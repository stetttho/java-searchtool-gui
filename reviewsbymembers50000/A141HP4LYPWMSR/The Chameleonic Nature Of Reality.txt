 How do you take a book as psychologically nuanced and sublte as Whitley Streiber's 'Communion' and translate it into a successful film? Judging by the reception it received in theaters across America upon its '89 release and again by the numerous negative reviews here on Amazon.com the answer appears to be you don't.  I guess I'll have to disagree with the majority consensus. In my opinion director Philipe Mora has done an admirable job in visualizing Mr. Streiber's disquieting, otherwordly visions, providing us with a disturbing glimpse into the world of UFO's and their occupants.  Much of the disappointment and animosity expressed towards this film is due to the ambigious nature of the UFO phenomenon and the directors insistence on leaving it that way. To try and pin down or label psychic experiences is to lose forever the essence of these primal encounters. In such matters we can only ask the questions fully knowing we will never receive the final, definitive answer. Are they from outer space, or someplace much closer to home? It is left for the viewer to decide.
