 'In The Falling Dark' is Bruce Cockburn's seventh and probably best studio album (only surpassed by his live in-concert album/CD; 'Circles In The Stream'). The album originally contained -10 tracks- however this re-release includes four additional bonus tracks. If you've never heard of Bruce Cockburn this is the album you should hear first. Get ready to experience the melodic, mystical and richly textured sound of a true innovator and consumate musican. From the very first track, 'Lord Of The Starfields' you'll find yourself drawn to the music in a way you've probably never been before. The music, lyrics and musicianship is impeccable.   Get this CD along with his live in concert 'Circles In The Stream' and 'Salt, Sun and Time.'  My Highest Recommendation!!
