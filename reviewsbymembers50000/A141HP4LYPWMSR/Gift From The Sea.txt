 An ill-fated love story set against the backdrop of a rustic Irish fishing village. Owen Quinn (Scott Glenn), widower and fisherman has been living a solitary life since his wifes' death five years ago. That all changes when an enchanting and mysterious woman with no name (Saffron Burrows) arrives in the village. She reaches out to him for help and he responds by taking her into his home. She takes the name Mairead and before long her kind and gentle ways heal his loneliness and pain.   However their love is not to be, for she is not what she appears to be. She is a seltie, one of the mythical seal people mentioned in Irish legend and lore. Her human form is only temporary, soon she must return to the sea or perish on the shore.  This may be a Hallmark Hall of Fame feature made for television, but you wouldn't know it from the production values. This is a wonderfully done film, one of those old-fashioned romantic tearjerkers that will stay with you for a long time. It also contains some of the most breathtaking scenic shots of the Irish coastline you'll ever see.  Scott Glenn delivers a strong performance as always, while Saffron Burrows plays the part of the mythical woman/seal to absolute perfection. This is a film that can be watched over and over again without ever losing its emotional impact.
