 What can you say about one of the most famous, off-the-wall, B-movie, horror cult classics of the 80's? Well..., for starters, the acting stinks, the obscene language is overdone and the overt nudity is unnecessary. Outside of that, it's also one of the funniest dark comedies within the horror genre ever produced! Not generally my cup of tea, but every once in a while when the moon is full and the acid rain is falling that appetite for brains takes over.  WARNING: Not for the prudish or easily offended.
