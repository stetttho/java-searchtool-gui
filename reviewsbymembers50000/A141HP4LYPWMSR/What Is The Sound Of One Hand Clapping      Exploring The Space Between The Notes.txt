 How do you transform the soft evening breeze into a musical composition, or express the unspoken longings of a human heart in a series of notes and pauses? Ask composer Tan Dun for that's exactly what he's accomplished in his brilliant soundtrack for 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.'  I can't say enough about this -15 track- CD featuring the incomparable cellist Yo-Yo Ma. As you allow the music to envelope you look around. Doesn't it seem like the world is beginning to slow down, as though time itself is about to cease to exist? It's like musical Tai-Chi, gentle, flowing, connected.  One of my favorite CD soundtracks which is now OOP. Get it while you can!
