 Long before we were entertained by films dealing with adorable little aliens (E.T.), magnificent Motherships flying over Devil's Tower, Wyoming (Close Encounters) and mysterious black monoliths on the surface of the moon (2001: A Space Odyssey) we had already received messages and messengers from the stars.  One of the greatest sci-fi/message films within this genre is the '51 classic, 'The Day the Earth Stood Still.' Even now, some 55 years since its theatrical release it delivers a timely, almost prophetic message to the world that is more important today than ever. We are not alone in the universe and what we do affects more than just this one little planet. Whether you interpret the films message spiritually or environmentally, what is ultimately at stake is undeniable. Learn to live in peace, or perish.
