 I know, you don't have to say it. My G*d it's the Olsen twins, what are you thinking? You're right, Mary-Kate and Ashley are, as always all-knowing, overly cutsie, predictable, trite and juvenile. Every one of their movies is basically the same story set in a different location. Again, all true. However in this one particular film for some reason the formula works.   Join the Olsen twins as they take Paris by storm when they visit their Ambasador Grandfather in the "City of Lights". Aided by a superior supporting cast for a film of this genre you'll be surprised how enjoyable this movie is. My daughter fell in love with this movie years ago and now eighteen, she still watches it. Putting all rational, intellectual criticism aside, this is plain and simple a fun, carefree movie that can be enjoyed by young and old alike!  Wonderful supporting performances by Matt Winston and the lovely Yvonne Scia.
