 Note: French with English subtitles.  There's a conspiracy afoot in France that has inadvertantly spread from the Royal Court of the King into the surrounding countryside, bringing death and destruction to a distant convent. One of the residence of this religious community happens to be Eloise (Sophie Marceau), the daughter of the famous musketeer D'Artagan.   After the murder of the Reverend Mother, Eloise leaves the convent, returning to Paris to find her Father (Philippe Noiret) in the hope of convincing him to use his fighting skills to bring the culprits to justice. As you might have guessed, this turns out to be a job that will require more than one musketeer. Soon D'Artagan and Eloise are joined by Porthos (Raoul Billerey), Aramis (Sami Frey) and Athos (Jean-Luc Bideau) and the battle is on.  This was a boring movie. Instead of making an action / adventure film directors Travernier and Blossier opted for a comedy. What's worse, it wasn't funny. Watching four old men who could barely walk pretend to fight off large numbers of younger and faster foes was a real stretch of the imagination. It just didn't work at all. Too bad, because the production values were first rate.   The only real energy in this production was generated by the charming Sophie Marceau. If not for her presence this film would have been impossible for me to finish. Thanks for being there Sophie.
