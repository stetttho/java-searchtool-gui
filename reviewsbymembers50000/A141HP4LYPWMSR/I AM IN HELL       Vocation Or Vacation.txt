 Yes Fletcher Christian (Mel Gibson) I'm sure you felt as though you were in Hell. Who wouldn't feel that way after being ordered to leave a tropical South Seas island paradise and the devastatingly beautiful Mauatua (Tevaite Vernette, the most beautiful women ever to appear on film) by a cruel and overbearing Captain Bligh (Anthony Hopkins) to be stuck onboard a ship in excruciating heat with a motley group of sweaty, unwashed sailors. A rather easy choice to make, military service or life on the beach. I think I would want to be back on that island too.  Technically and artistically a first class production, yet it still only earns 4 out of 5 stars. I found the pace of the film to be rather slow, particularily in the onboard ship sequences. It was when they are on the island amidst all the natural beauty and splendor of nature and the native girls that the movies best moments are found. I also found the ending to be rather abrupt, leaving the viewer with the feeling that something is missing.  Definitely a stellar line-up starring the already mentioned Anthony Hopkins, Mel Gibson and Tevaite Vernette along with an excellent supporting cast featuring Liam Neeson, Daniel Day-Lewis and Laurence Olivier. Add to that a haunting soundtrack by Vangelis and you have an enjoyable evening of motion picture entertainment awaiting.
