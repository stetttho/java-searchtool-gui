 Gripping, heartfelt drama about a dysfunctional Maori family struggling for survival in the government provided urban housing project (i.e. slums) of New Zealand. This is a violent, hardhitting film. Fortunately the story ultimately transcends the violence and offers some hope for a brighter tomorrow. 'Once Were Warriors' is a story of reconnecting with one's heritage and rediscovering who you are and what you can become.  Three other excellent movies dealing with the same theme of failed assimilation and destruction of indigenous cultures are: 'Where the Green Ants Dream' (VHS - OOP), 'The Fringe Dwellers'(DVD - Region 4 only) and 'Rabbit-Proof Fence' (DVD). All three are Australian films dealing with the plight of the Aborigine.  I would also recommend Emerald Forest (DVD) which deals with tribes living within the tropical rainforests of South America.
