 The 'Juniper Tree' is a slow, somber, methodical film with a weak storyline which at times becomes almost incoherent. However having said that I will also say that the true beauty of this film is not to be found in the story it tells, but in the visuals. Filmed in Iceland, a place where few of us have ever gone or will go, we get a glimpse of this beautiful and challenging island. Hostile, yet enchanting it appears as a world one can easily imagine to be populated by the mythical beings of Norse mythology, making it a perfect location for a tale of mysticism and witchcraft.  Katla (Bryndis Petra Bragadottir) and her younger sister Margit (Bjork) have left their village after their Mother (Guorun Gisladottir) has been burned to death by the villagers for practicing witchcraft. As they wander through the countryside they eventually come upon a small dwelling occupied by a recently widowed man and his son. They take refuge in his home and before long Katla begins to work her magic to win the heart of their unsuspecting benefactor.  Unquestionably the best moments in the film are young Margit's disturbing visions of her Mother's spirit. Guorun Gisladottir's long, matted dark hair and flowing, faded clothing are the perfect compliment to the frozen tundra surrounding her. As she sits silently amongst the protruding rocks she strikes a chilling pose in harmony with the stark, evocative Icelandic landscape.  This is not a film that stands up well to repeated viewings, but it has its moments. Now if you're a big Bjork fan that's a different story.
