 If Tim Burton remade the film 'Alice In Wonderland', 'Chasing The Ghost' would be the soundtrack. With its slow, melodic pace and electronic dissonant sound evoking a near trance-state, the listener is progressively hypnotized with each successive track moving you deeper and deeper into a dreamy, surreal world of multi-layered shadow.  KaRIN is not so much singing, but whispering to us to follow her on a journey down the rabbit hole. It has a somewhat disquieting affect, as though someone else is listening in and she doesn't want them to hear.  All -10 tracks- work well together as they seamlessly weave there way through the ever-shifting darkness. I particularily enjoyed -track 4- 'Dreamsleep', -track 5- 'White Rabbit' (great cover of the Jefferson Airplane classic) and -track 8- 'Monochrome.'  So turn out the lights and sit back and enjoy. No need to light any candles, the Cheshire Cat will arrive shortly and his glowing eyes and wide, mocking grin will provide all the illumination necessary.
