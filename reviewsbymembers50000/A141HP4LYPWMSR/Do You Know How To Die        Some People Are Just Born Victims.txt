 A sad but too often true case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Single parent Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) and his young son Danny inadvertantly witness a murder committed by four degenerates working for Judah, the local drug lord. Unable to make a successful escape, Ashe and Danny are captured and taken to the the harbor where they are killed and thrown into the ocean.  Meanwhile a beautiful young goth named Sarah (Mia Kirshner) is tormented by a series of bad dreams and is unable to sleep. A highly sensitive and intuitive tattoo artist and painter, she is familiar with the world of spirits and the ongoing legacy of 'The Crow.' Somehow she knows another Crow is on the way.  And so it all begins again. A new 'Crow' rises from the watery depths of Los Angeles harbor to seek revenge against the five people responsible for the death of Danny and himself. Sarah will help guide and comfort Ashe as he defines his mission.  'The Crow - City of Angels' certainly doesn't achieve the level of cult masterpiece as the original did, however few sequels ever do. With that understood put all your needs and desires to make comparisons aside and simply enjoy the second installment of 'The Crow Mythos.'  Vincent Perez is quite good as the new Crow and Mia Kirshner is absolutely beautiful as the dark, ethereal Sarah. I couldn't take my eyes off her. I also enjoyed the small but memorable role played by Thuy Trang as Kali.  Warning: While both the original and this sequel contain extreme violence, this film also is very heavy in sexual content. Be prepared for a hefty dose of nudity, S&M, voyeurism and an assortment of other behaviors unsuitable for a younger audience, or those offended by such depictions. I might have given this film -4- stars otherwise.
