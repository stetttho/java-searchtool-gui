 One of the last in a long line of Hammer horror films, 'Blood From the Mummy's Tomb' is not among the best. It doesn't possess the same depth and dimension of light and atmosphere that many of the early features are famous for. The footage is dull and drab throughout appearing as though it was filmed in an old abandoned warehouse. The set is also quite spartan, there certainly didn't seem to be much of a budget available for this feature.  However the one thing Hammer didn't jeopardize in this film was there reputation for having at least one beautiful, bosomy woman among their cast of characters. That woman is British actress Valerie Leon in the dual role of the soon to resurrected Queen Tera and Margaret, daughter of the archeologist/Egyptologist responsible for the discovery of Queen Tera's tomb and remains.  Neither scary or insightful, making it quite easy to pass on this one altogether if not for the presence of Valerie Leon on-screen.
