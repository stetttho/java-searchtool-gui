 I know very little about Goth music, my listening experience of the genre has been limited to 'Dead Can Dance' and 'This Mortal Coil.' However I do know what I like and 'Ethernaut' turned out to be a complete surprise! This is good stuff!!  Cruxshadows darkwave, synthpop sound reminds me of several popular new wave groups from the '80's. The Thompson Twins, The Smiths and Pet Shop Boys immediately came to mind while playing this CD. However they most remind me of Depeche Mode.  Being Goth in intent the lyrics are obviously much darker and foreboding, I guess that's where the name darkwave comes into play. All and all a highly entertaining listening experience.
