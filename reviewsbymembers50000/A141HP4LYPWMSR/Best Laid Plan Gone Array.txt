 'Ball & Chain' released in '04 is yet another foray into the ongoing cultural/familial conflict of East versus West.The story takes place within a Hindu community located somewhere in Texas, U.S.A. The parents of two Indian families have followed the time honored tradition of arranging the marriage of their offspring, Ameet (Sunil Malhotra) and Saima (Lisa Ray). The only problem is Ameet and Saima don't want to get married. In fact they don't even like each other.  A movie premise we've all seen many times with a foregone conclusion of what lies ahead as the young, engaged couple concoct a plan to make sure the marriage never takes place. When the two lay aside their dislike for each other in order to work together for a common goal they discover they have more in common than they thought. Will love blossom between these two attractive people? Will this marriage ever take place, or have they already messed up any chance of happiness they might have shared together? WHAT DO YOU THINK?  Sunil Malhotra and Lisa Ray are charming and Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle) supplies so comic relief in this well intentioned, but so-so film.  -3 1/2 Stars-
