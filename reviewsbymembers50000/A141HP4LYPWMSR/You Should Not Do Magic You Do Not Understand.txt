 Omri receives a rather unusual gift from his older brother for his birthday, an old two-shelf cupboard he found in the trash. The cupboard has a lock, but no key. Fishing through a pile of keys belonging to his Mother, Omri finds one that fits the lock. It turns out to be a special key given to his Mother by her Mother just before she died. Omri iis allowed to keep it and so the adventure begins.  You see something special happens to any toy locked away in this strange little cupboard, they come to life once unlocked. Conversely, toys that have been brought to life can be returned to their inanimate state when returned to the cupboard.  At first it all seems great fun. Omri tests his magical box with various toys, a dinosaur and Darth Vader, but when he unlocks a small replica of an Iroquois Indian from the cabinet he discovers he's not just playing a game anymore. A living, breathing 19th century Indian warrior named Little Bear emerges. Little Bear is not just an animated toy, he is a real person with a real life that has been mysteriously plucked out of his 19th home and deposited in miniature form into Omri's twentieth century bedroom.  Little Bear teaches Omri the meaning of being a warrior and taking responsibility for your own actions, scolding him for tampering with the lives of others he tells the young boy, "You should not do magic you do not understand."   This is great family entertainment containing a message we should all take to heart. It's a message of tolerance and understanding towards cultures and people different from ourselves.  The entire cast is terrific! The British medic (Steve Coogan) and the cowboy Boo-Hoo Boone (David Keith) were perfect in their supporting roles, while the two main characters Omri (Hal Scardino) and Little Bear (Litefoot) were absolutely magical together. Their goodbye scene is sure to bring tears to your eyes.
