 Penumbra's -9 track- CD, 'The Last Bewitchment' is a captivating, innovative piece of musicanship. It has so many things going on other than just goth/metal. Some tracks sound like they belong in a gladiator film soundtrack, some on the opera stage, others in a church service.  And no wonder, in addition to the usual guitars and drums Punumbra added an orchestra along with an eight person choir. This CD is a wonderfully coherent, thematic work of art. It definitely has alot to offer the listener. Being that I'm particularily fond of female vocals, my two favortie tracks are; 6- 'Testament' and 9- 'Pie Jesu.'   This CD is now OOP, get it while you can.
