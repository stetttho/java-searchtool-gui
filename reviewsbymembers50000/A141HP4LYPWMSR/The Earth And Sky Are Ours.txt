 'Lagaan' is an absolutely brilliant and inspiring Hindi film about determination, faith, unity and triumph. All these positive attributes are perfectly embodied within this incredible soundtrack.  From the chant-like 'Ghanan Ghanan', to the traditional dance number 'Radha Kaise Na Jale' and the defiant determination of 'Chale Chalo' this music will touch your emotions in so many different ways. And if 'Mitwa' doesn't bring you to your feet and get you dancing nothing will!
