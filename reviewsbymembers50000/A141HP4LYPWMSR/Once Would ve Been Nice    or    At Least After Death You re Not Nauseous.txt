 Question:  Take Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Napoleon Bonaparte and a Bergmanesque Grim Reaper - drop them into a 19th century Russian setting fit for an adventure/romance epic and what do you get?  Answer: One of the funniest films you'll ever see.  This is Woody Allen at the peak of his creativity. The fun never stops and it has tons of quotable lines that only get funnier with each repeat viewing. In my estimation this film, along with Annie Hall, are Woody's best work! A MUST OWN for anyone who loves to laugh!
