 When I think of my childhood memories of the Christmas holidays one of the first things that come to mind is Alastair Sim and "A Christmas Carol." It was a family ritual and as rituals go, it wasn't really Christmas until the family gathered around the television to watch it. It was a terrifying experience for me back then. The sound of those ponderous chains clanking on the wooden staircase as the ghost of Jacob Marley headed towards the upstairs bedroom of Ebenezer Scrooge would send me running from the room. I don't think any film ever frightened me as much as this one did.  What could be more disturbing than the ghostly apparition of poor, desolute Jacob bound for eternity, his punishment for the life he so selfishly wasted while among the living. Having learned the truth too late to save himself, he must now wander the world forever unable to intervene for good in the affairs of men.  Ebenezers' only hope of reclaiming his humanity and saving himself from a similiar fate is to encounter three more spirits. Traveling into the past, present and future with his disembodied hosts he comes to understand how the choices he has made and will continue to make in life affects not only his destiny but the destiny of those around him.  Ultimately Ebenezer returns a 'Man of Wisdom' and like a holy man in estatic trance rejoices in the received knowledge dancing about and singing, "I don't know anything, I never did know anything. But know I know I don't know anything!"  Make no mistake, the '51 Alastair Sim production is the definitive version of "A Christmas Carol" so don't let anyone tell you otherwise. This is a film for the AGES and definitely one of my All-Time Top Ten!
