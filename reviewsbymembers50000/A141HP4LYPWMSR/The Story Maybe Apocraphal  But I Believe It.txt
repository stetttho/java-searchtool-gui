 Carl Kolchak, the Night Stalker! Truly one of the great icons of '70s television! These two made-for-television movies were such a huge success they spawned a just as popular series. While the special effects certainly cannot stand up to what can be done today, nor are the horror elements in anyway spectacular, there is something 'magical' about this show that cannot be explained by any other way they by saying the name, Darren McGavin.  Darren McGavin created a character in Carl Kolchak that you simply couldn't help but love. Gruff, somewhat unmannerly, obtrusive and still somehow lovable. Carl was always there at the scene of the next mysterious, unexplainable crime. Adorned in his crumpled hat and un-ironed white suit, tape recorder in one hand and his little carrying bag of 'essential' occult paraphanelia in the other, he was prepared to take on any demon, vampire or other supernatural creature that might appear. The success of this show was by in large determined by the acceptance of Darren McGavin's wonderful characterization.   Another factor in the 'Night Stalkers' popularity was the unique and ingenius idea of bringing the realm of monsters, evil spirits and demons out of the dusty environs of some exotic faraway country or somewhere in the distant and obscure past and transporting them right into modern day America. Vampires feasting on showgirls in downtown Las Vegas and centuries old immortals haunting Old Town Seattle. What a concept!  Truly a classic from the '70s which can still be enjoyed today. Carl Kolchak, the beloved Godfather of television horror!
