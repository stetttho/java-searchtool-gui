 An ancient prophecy foretold three coming invasions against the Indian nation. The first invasion would come from the North, the second would be the "black robes" from the West. They have survived the first two, now the third was about to begin. So we are told in the opening sequence to 'Pocahontas - The Legend.'  Definitely not a masterpiece, but does succeed as a rather enjoyable, simplistic rendering of the famous love story of Pocahontas and John Smith. Sandrine Holt is absolutely beautiful as the Native American princess Pocahontas and the much maligned Miles O'Keefe is really quite good as the handsome and stalwart Englishman John Smith.  The problems with this film stem from budget limitations and shoddy production values. One of the first drawbacks I noticed was that everything was shot in closeups, so you never saw any beautiful panoramic views of the natural beauty to be found in the American wilderness. This indicated to me that their budget didn't allow them the opportunity to travel to any remote locations to get capture those vistas.     Secondly, I found the choice of clothing worn by the Indians somewhat disconcerting. Everything was exactly the same color and texture. It looked like the entire wardrobe for the tribe had been cut from one large piece of material. I'm not an expert in Native American clothing but I would've expected to see a variety of colors, shades and skins in keeping with the various types of animals that would have been indigenous to the area in 1607. There were other glaring discrepancies, such as the unauthentic look of the English fort that only hampered viewers imagination and ability to become immersed in the storyline.   If you're a Sandrine Holt fan or you have young children who like Pocahontas you'll certainly want to add this DVD to your collection. If not, it's a decent watch as a rental.
