 The 'Further Adventures of' was Bruce Cockburn's ninth album following the highly successful live concert 'Circles in the Stream' and preceding his most succcessful Americn album, 'Dancing in the Dragon's Jaws.'  Still in his joyous, contemplative musical phase this -11 track-album/CD (there's one bonus track on this re-release) is a delightful mixture of upbeat melodies focusing on both the natural wonders of the world around us as well as displaying a deeper appreciation for the spiritual mysteries laying behind physical creation.  Whether singing in English or French, 'Further Adventures of' is yet another wonderful listening experience from the incredible Bruce Cockburn!
