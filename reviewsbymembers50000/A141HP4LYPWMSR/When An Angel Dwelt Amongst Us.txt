 Ofra Haza the late Israeli pop-diva had the purest voice I've ever heard. In 'Yemenite Songs' she returns to her roots and sings 8 traditional pieces. No matter what the genre of music she performs there's no mistaking that angelic voice. If you're into traditional ethnic music this is definitely an essential to your collection.  RIP OFRA
