 No one embodies the heart and soul of Canada more fully than Gordon Lightfoot. For those living outside the boundaries of our neighbor to the North and our unfamiliar with the long legacy of this living icon, the closest comparison I can think of is Wayne Gretzky. What Wayne is to Canadian hockey, Gordon is to music.  This is Gordon Lightfoot at his best, the early United Artist years. This 2 discs, 49 track collection contains the entirety of Gordon's first four albums; 'Lightfoot', 'The Way I Feel', 'Did She Mention My Name' and 'Back Here On Earth.' Sit back and listen to the heart and soul of a true poet, storyteller, composer and musician.  A Canadian Treasure!
