 "You've been given a wonderful gift George, the chance to see what it would be like if you were never born." Thus spoke Clarence, angel - second class, to the suicidal George Bailey, owner and manager of the local, recently bankrupt "Building & Loan Co." in Bedford Falls, somewhere U.S.A.  Of course George doesn't believe this silly, little old man is really an angel, nor does he believe his wish to "never have been born" has just been granted. However the reality of the situation is soon to set in when he discovers that no one in Bedford Falls has ever heard of George Bailey. Not only is he viewed as a stranger in town, but the town itself is nothing like it was before he met Clarence. In fact it's no longer 'Bedford Falls.' It's 'Pottersville.'  Yes, George finally comes to realize that Clarence is right, a life is a terrible thing to throw any. We are all connected to each other in ways we could never imagine, nor fully comprehend. The absence of just one life may have devastating consequences on others.  Has George learned his lesson? Can an angel - second class, reverse the wish and restore George back to his family and friends in time for Christmas? And lastly, has Clarence finally earned his wings? Considering the fact that "It's A Wonderful Life" is one of the most beloved Christmas films of all-time I'm sure you already know the answer.  Simply the best Hollywood has to offer at Christmas, or anytime of the year! Thanks to director Frank Capra and the whole cast for making this film a part of my holiday family viewing tradition.
