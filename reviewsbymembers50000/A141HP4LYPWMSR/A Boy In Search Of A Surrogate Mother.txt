 'La Teta y la Luna' is a light-hearted and sensual story of a little nine year old boy named Tete (Biel Duran) who wants to be treated the same as his newborn baby brother. Unable to get his Mother's attention and affection away from her new bundle of joy, Tete decides to go in search of a surrogate Mother.  Tete asks the moon to provide him with a loving female. When a beautiful French dancer (Mathilda May) and her husband arrive in town Tete is certain she's the one he's been looking for. However convincing her won't be easy, not only does he have to deal with her husband, but another local teenager is also in hot pursuit of the enticing Estrellita.  This is definitely not for the prudish, or easily offended. There is quite a bit of frontal nudity in this film. However if you're open-minded and have a good understanding of European humor you will appreciate this erotic little comedy as much as I did. By the way, Mathilda May is absolutely ravishing, I don't know if I've ever seen a more beautiful woman in any film!
