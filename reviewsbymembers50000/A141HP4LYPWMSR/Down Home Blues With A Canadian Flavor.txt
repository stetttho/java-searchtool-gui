 'Night Vision' is Bruce Cockburn's fourth and now OOP album/CD. Without question Cockburn is the most eclectic, diverse musican I've ever listened to. Every album is a totally unexpected and highly enjoyable musical experience.  In 'Night Vision' Bruce's unexpected twist this time is a unique and clever excursion into the blues genre. This -10 track- collection is absolutely delightful. Perfectly capturing the blues experience with such tunes as: 'You Don't Have To Play The Horses', 'The Blues Got The World'... and 'When The Sun Goes Nova', you will find yourself returning to this CD over and over again. Especially on cold and rainy days.  Highly Recommended!!
