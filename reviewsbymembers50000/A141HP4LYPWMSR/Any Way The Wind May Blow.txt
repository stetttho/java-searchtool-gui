 'Waiting For You' released in '93 was Gordon Lightfoot's eighth and probably last collaboration with Reprise. Definitely Gordon's best days are behind him, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have a nugget or two left to offer his adoring fans.  Now late in his career we hear an aged, weathered balladeer who has just about experienced all there is to experience in this life. Older and hopefully much wiser Gordon presents his audience with -10 tracks- of musings about the road he has trod. His tunes are simple and uncomplicated. There are a number of weak tracks on this album/CD but a couple of very good ones as well. My particular favorites are 'Restless', 'Ring Them Bells' and 'I'll Prove My Love.'  One thing you can always be certain of when it comes to Gordon Lightfoot, there's a message in each and every song. That's the mark of a true poet.
