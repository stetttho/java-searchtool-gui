 'Hawaii Songs Of Aloha' is a beautiful presentation of the music and dance of the Polynesian Islands that perfectly encapsulates the "Spirit of Aloha." Produced for PBS television, this 77 minute concert will wisk you away on a musical voyage to the land of enchantment to listen to the rhythmic beats and watch some of the most lovely and expressive swaying moments the islands have to offer. It really couldn't have been anymore enjoyable. This is a DVD you'll never get tired of viewing!  My favorite performances are by; Na Leo, The Brothers Cazimero and the amazing ukulele playing of Jake Shimabukuro.
