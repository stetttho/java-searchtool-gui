 Note: Arabic with English subtitles.  This is a great women's empowerment film, but you don't have to be female to enjoy it. Lilia (Hiam Abbassa) is a widowed, middle-aged woman living the life a unexciting reclusive lifestyle as a seamstress. Her only child, a daughter, is a college student who has a life of her own and has only marginal contact with her Mother.  Her life appears to be going nowhere until she happens to meet a bellydancer while shopping at a local cloth store. She is hired by her new aquaintance a few days later comes to the cabaret to deliver the repaired outfit. Immediately captivated by the rhythmic drums and the swirling dancers see finds herself returning night after night to absorb the music and atmosphere.    Eventually she musters up enough courage to try it for herself. With only a few quick pointers from the girls she borrows an outfit and takes the stage. While her technique is poor and amateurish, her energy and enthusiasm draws the attention of the male patrons and she soon becomes the most popular performer. Her success at the cabaret slowly begins to bring about positive changes in Lilia life, as she faces her problems with the same determinatiion she brings to her dancing. Eventually she becomes a self-confident, assertive woman who can once again embrace life and love.  The music is fantastic, the atmosphere exotic and Hiam Abbass is the perfect mixture of innocence and sensuality. Highly recommended!
