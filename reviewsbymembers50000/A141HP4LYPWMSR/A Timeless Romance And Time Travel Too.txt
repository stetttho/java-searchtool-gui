 Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour, has there ever been two better looking people to play opposite each other in a movie romance? I certainly can't think of anyone else.  'Somewhere In Time' is for me, the ultimate romance. Cast, cinematography, costume and most definitely John Barry's musical score make this a film you'll never tire of watching. Add to this intoxicatingly beautiful romance a fascinating look at the possibility of time travel and you definitely have something special.  My Highest Rating!!
