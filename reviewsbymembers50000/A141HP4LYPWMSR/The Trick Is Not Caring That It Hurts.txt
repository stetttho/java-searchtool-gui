 Of all the movies that really don't need another review, this one probably heads the list. However since 'Lawrence of Arabia' is one of my all-time top ten films I wanted to add my two cents anyway.  Seldom in cinematic history has there ever been so grand a tale told as the story of T. E. Lawrence and his miraculous accomplishments in the deserts of Arabia. A man of truly mythic proportions whose interior vision was so powerful it forever changed the course of world politics. By an act of pure, concentrated willpower ("Nothing is written unless I write it") Lawrence defied all the odds and experts, uniting the ever-feuding semitic tribes of the Middle East under one flag in a battle for Arab independence. This was a daring project to commit to film and it paid of, becoming one of the most honored and studied films of all-time.   Columbia pulled out all the stops in bringing this true life adventure to the screen. Nothing but the best was required. Director David Lean, complimented by one of the most skilled casts ever assembled; Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Claude Rains, Arthur Kennedy, Jack Hawkins and Jose Ferrer brought the story to life as nobody else could. Coupled with Maurice Jarre's epic soundtrack, we have been graced with as perfect a film as you will ever see.
