 'A Little Princess' is an absolutely delightful film released in '95. Poorly promoted by Warner Brothers, it never received the acclaim it desired. The same can be said for the musical score of composer Patrick Doyle.  This movie soundtrack comprised of -28 tracks- is an enchanting blend of classical and Indian melodies interspersed with the youthful voices of a girls choir chanting mantras and lyrics borrowed from the poetry of William Blake. This inventive combination of musical genres and lyrical choices make for a multi-layered listening experience.  Highly Recommended!
