 Note: Original languages are French/Hungarian with English subtitles.  Very slow story that doesn't deliver in the end. An updated version of the apocryphal confrontation between Jesus and Simon the Magician, this Simon lives in modern day Hungary and comes to France to work with the French police on a murder case. During his stay he solves the crime, falls in love with a young girl and renews an acquaintance with an old rival who challenges him to a test of magical power. They both agree to be buried alive for three days and see who is powerful enough to survive.  You keeping waiting for something to happen but it never does. With such a wonderfully original concept it could have been a great film, but this movie proves that a good idea doesn't equal a good movie.
