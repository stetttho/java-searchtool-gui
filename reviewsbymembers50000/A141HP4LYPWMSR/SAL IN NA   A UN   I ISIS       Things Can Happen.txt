 'Free Willy' is simply one of the best family films you'll ever see, one that is equally as captivating for adults as it is for children. The story centers around a troubled teenager named Jesse (Jason James Richter) who has just moved into yet another foster care home in the Seattle area of the Pacific Northwest.  When mischevious Jesse is accused of helping to deface the local aquatic center he is forced to clean up the mess his friends left behind. He soon forms an unexpected bond of friendship with Willy, a young Orca whale in the parks water show and is offered the opportunity to help train and care for the baby Orca.  For the first time in his life things are going well for Jesse. That is until the greedy owner of the aquatic center tries to kill the whale in order to collect the insurance policy money provided for in the event of Willy's death.  Can Jesse convince the other trainers and his foster parents that Willy is in danger and needs their help? As Randolph (August Schellenberg), the wise Indian handyman and newfound spiritual mentor of Jesse says, "Sometimes Things Happen."  Sensational film with loads of excitement that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the climatic ending.  Say it with me: SAL-IN-NA, A-UN, I-ISIS!
