 'Hunting High And Low' was released in '85. It was A-ha's first album and the only one to receive any attention in the U.S.A. Containing -10 tracks- of wonderfully original, upbeat new wave/synth-pop tunes I consider it to be one of those rare, absolutely perfect albums/CD's. Every track is unique and immensely enjoyable, complimented by the most amazing male voice (Morten Harkett) I've ever heard.  An unbeatable collection; 'Take On Me', 'Hunting High And Low' and my personal favorite 'The Sun Always Shines On T.V. Definitely one of my All-Time Top Ten CD's!  My Highest Recommendation!!
