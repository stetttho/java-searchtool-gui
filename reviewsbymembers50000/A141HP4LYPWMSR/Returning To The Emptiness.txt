 Have you ever had a dream where you find yourself wandering alone in a shadowy, mist-filled garden. A sacred and ancient site where long abandoned structures adorned with indecipherable inscriptions protrude here and there from behind or between the thick, dark green centuries old vines. A dream so vivid that you can feel the cool wet mist caressing your face and smell the musty odor of the rotting undergrowth lying below the lush vegetation. Did a priestess appear in the distance with a voice as indescrible as the dream itself?  If you have this is probably the perfect music to re-create that dream experience and Azam Ali would be the priestess with the otherworldly voice. Such is the mood created by this sensual, multi-layered -11 track- CD by Vas. Titled, 'In The Garden Of Souls' your spirit we take flight into a mysterious Netherworld inspired by the talented Azam Ali and Greg Ellis and cross over to a timeless place of imagination and wonder. Truly a journey you will never tire of taking.  Get the candles lit, turn out the lights and enjoy the journey!
