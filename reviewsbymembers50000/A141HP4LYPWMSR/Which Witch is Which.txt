 NOTE:  Spanish with English subtitles.  A very slick, well conceived tale of love, lust, betrayal and occult payback. Just when you think you've got it all figured out everything changes and you're back to square one. It will keep you guessing to the very end and still surprise you.  If that's not enough to peak your interest how about the presence of a beautiful actress like Manuela Acuri (the Moorish girl in 'Mad Love')? She's absolutely gorgeous. So, if you like beautiful women (there are 3 in this movie), imaginative plots and surprise endings this movie is for you!
