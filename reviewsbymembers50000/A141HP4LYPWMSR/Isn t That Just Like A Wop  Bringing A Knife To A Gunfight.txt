 This is one of the great good guy, bad guy movies! While I'm not by any means a Kevin Costner fan, I have to admit he is great in this film in the lead role of Elliot Ness. I would consider this his "signature" film even more so than 'Dances With Wolves.' His face to face confrontations with De Niro (Al Capone) are the highlights of the film.  Robert De Niro is, as always, amazing and Sean Connery, Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith are perfect as the rest of the Untouchables. A true classic in the Mafia/gangster genre!
