 The Good: Sienna Miller and Lena Olin as Francesca Bruni and her Mother Andrea Bruni. Charming!   The Bad: Jeremy Irons as Pucci, the Grand Inquisitor. He is totally miscast in this role.  The Ugly: Oliver Platt (Paprizzio) with his shirt off and Heath Ledger dressed as a Venetian fop in a powdered white wig, lace and ruffles. It just doesn't work.  'Casanova' is OK (maybe) for one viewing and that's primarily because of the many lovely ladies cavorting about in amorous pursuit of the legendary lover.
