 'The Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Faunes and Fairies' written in 1691 by the now near mythic Scottish, Christian minister Robert Kirk (1640-1692) is still the classic work in the genre of fairie folklore and a must read and own for anyone serious about the subject matter.  Written in the 17th century, it's an extremely difficult read due to differences in writing style, sentence structure and phrasing, spelling and divergent meanings to various words. Despite the difficulties involved this work is mandatory reading for any would be explorer into the world of the "Little People" so find yourself a comfortable chair in a quiet room and just put in the effort and read. No Pain, No Gain!
