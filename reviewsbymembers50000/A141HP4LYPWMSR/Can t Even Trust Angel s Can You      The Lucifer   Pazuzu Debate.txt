 Remy Harlin's version of 'The Exorcist' was supposed to correct the mistakes (real or imaginary) of Schrader's production that was never released to the theater. While this film is quite good I tend to gravitate to Schrader's as the definitive and best of the two. Be that as it may there are a number of sequences in Harlin's film that add some additional and valuable material to the storyline that are missing in the other version.   First, I preferred the opening sequence in this film showing the devastating massacre of a 4th century Christian army being myteriously wiped out in East Africa by an invisible supernatural presence. This perfectly set the tone for what was to follow.    Another positive addition was the image of Pazuzu shown several times. First in the hand of a dying 4th century Catholic priest, again in 1949 in a coffee shop in Cairo, Egypt when Father Merrin is hired to join in the archeological dig in East Africa and finally once more in the strange, demented drawings of Bession (Patrick O'Kane) the archeologist originally in charge of the dig before he went insane after entering the excavated church. These scenes clearly established the Pazuzu imagery and solidly maintained the continuity between this film and the original. Something Schrader's adaptation failed to do.    The majority of the main cast remained the same as the Schrader version except for Father Francis who was now played by James D'Archy and Izabella Scorupco as the villages resident Dr. and potential love interest, Sarah.  If you're a true, hardcore fan of 'The Exorcist' series you'll simply have to buy both versions and pick and choose your favorite scenes.
