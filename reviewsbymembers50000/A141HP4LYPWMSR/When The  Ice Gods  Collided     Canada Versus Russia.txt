 Highlights of the 1972 "Summit Series," Russia versus Canada. Without a doubt, the 'Greatest Confrontation in the History of Sports!'  For those who don't want to sit through the 4 disc DVD set containing all eight games, this 95 minute documentary gives you all the important highlights and lots of informative commentary on the games and what was going on behind the scenes of this epic clash of hockey superpowers.  A wonderful timecapsule of "Old School" hockey and a rather unintentionally humorous look at '70's fashion surrounding this historic event. My favorite segment of the documentary is the interview with Canadian hockey hero Paul Henderson. His words, voice and demeanor are fascinating in retrospect and clearly show the intensity of hatred that existed between the two teams.  A MUST HAVE piece of sports history for the serious hockey fan.
