 Who built the Pyramid of Giza, Stonehenge and the myriad of other amazing structures from the distant past scattered around the globe? Were they built by the same beings that constructed the "face" on the planet Mars? And if they were, does that indicate that they are somehow related to the ongoing UFO sightings and the beings flying them?  Internationally known evangelical Christian and teacher Chuck Missler examines these questions and many more in this in-depth study of one of the most provocative and intriquing subjects found within the pages of the Bible.  Chuck approaches the subject in a multi-disciplinary manner as any good teacher would, incorporating the Protestant understanding of the Biblical text with ancient mythological beliefs and many of the new, far-reaching discoveries and theories of modern science. Hyperspace, multi-dimensionality, myth and legend, along with important archeological findings all merge with the Biblical text revealing a new, expanded understanding of prophecy, fallen angels, celestial and terrestial genetics and the realm of demons.  Yes, this is a Christian book containing the usual evangelical message at the end. Be that as it may, there is alot of valuable information within for the Christian and non-Christian alike.  Note: A condensed version of Chuck Missler's book is also available on VHS video tape and a two audio cassette pack, both listed under the title, 'Return of the Nephilim.'
