 Australian witch Deborah Gray's offering is a delightful 64 minute excursion into spell casting, what you might refer to as 'Basic Foundations of Witchcraft 101A.' There is nothing out of the ordinary or overly speculative offered here, just good, basic historical information and easy to follow instructions for each ritual casting designed primarily for the novice practitioner.  This is a nicely produced DVD and highly watchable for both the budding witch as well as those just curious about the subject. The set designs are meticulously prepared with the appropriate colors, scents and ritual impliments required for each spell to be covered by the very attractive Deborah Gray. Her soft melodious voice and the lavish ceremonial surroundings are sure to instill within the viewer the desired mood and level of openness necessary for a successful spell casting.  In my opinion where this little how-to-course really shines is in its emphasis on the essentials. Personal intention during the spell must be equally matched by the appropriate amount of time and energy in preparation for the ritual. Preparation goes hand-in-hand with intention. If one is too lazy or unwilling to put in the comensurate effort leading up to the spell casting how strong could the intention be?  There is also a wonderful featurette titled, 'Witches Weekend' which introduces some of the major figures in the Australian movement today. A very nice companion piece to the main feature.
