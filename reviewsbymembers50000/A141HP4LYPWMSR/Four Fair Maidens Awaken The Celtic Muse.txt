 'Celtic Voices' featuring Mary McLaughlin, Connie Dover, Maireid Sulllivan and Emma Christian is a wonderous blend of traditional and contemporary folk compositions. This 14 track compilation moves smoothly and seamlessly through a fascinating soundscape of mood and emotion with each performer leaving her own indellible mark on the listener. There's McLauglin's brooding and deeply mystical 'Yundah,' Dover's festive 'In Aimsir Bhaint an Fheir,' and Sullivan's nostalgic and romantic 'She Moves Through the Fair.' Concluding with Christian's bittersweet 'The Goodnight Song' we bid a sad farewell, at least for now, to a beautiful listening experience that will call you back again and again to the Emerald Isle of Dreams.  It's simply the best compilation of Celtic music I've yet to come across. Definitely one of the essentials.
