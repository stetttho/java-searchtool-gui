 LeeLee Sobeiski is absolutely magnificent as Joan of Arc, the long prophesied 'Maid of Lorraine' who would reunite a divided French nation and lead them to victory and freedom against foreign invasion (the British). While there may be a few historical accuracies in this film, they are more than compensated for with the loving and respectful way in which the material is treated. It successfully accomplishes the difficult task of both providing a wonderful action/adventure film while at the same time serving as an inspirational, spiritual docu-drama.   This is such an emotional, heartfelt production. Even after numerous viewings I'm still moved to tears several times during each viewing. While 'Joan of Arc' boasts a formidable, all-star cast; Peter O'Toole, Powers Boothe, Jacqueline Bisset, Peter Strauss, Shirley MacLaine and more, the two greatest performances are those of LeeLee and Chad Willett as her friend and military companion Jean de Metz. From the moment of their first encounter when Joan is just beginning on her spiritual journey to her tragic burning on the stake, Jean is forever by her side. Their bond of mutual admiration and unspoken love is the glue that ties the storyline together so perfectly.   What an incredible directorial job by Christian Duquay! This may be a made-for-television movie, but you would never know it by the production values; cinematography, special effects, soundtrack and acting couldn't have been better. 'Joan of Arc' is without a doubt one of my all-time favorite films.
