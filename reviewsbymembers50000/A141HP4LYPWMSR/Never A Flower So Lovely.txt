 From a rented apartment overlooking an enchanting botanical garden young Giovanni (Kristoffer Tabori) observes a beautiful girl (Kathleen Beller) walking alone talking to the flowers. There is a reason why she is alone but by the time he learns the dark secret for her isolation he has fallen in love.  This 57 minute PBS Presentation was quite a pleasant surprise. Some may find it a little slow, but I found it absolutely hypnotic. Like a prolonged dream sequence, you are drawn against your will towards the enigmatic Beatrice. I've been an admirer of Kathleen Beller for quite sometime and I must say they couldn't have found a more beautiful woman for this role. She has never looked lovelier than she does here.
