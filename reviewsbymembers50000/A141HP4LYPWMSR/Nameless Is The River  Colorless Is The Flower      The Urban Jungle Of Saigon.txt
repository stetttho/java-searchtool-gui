 Note: Vietnamese with English subtitles.  Far from the lush tropical family gardens present in 'The Scent of Green Papaya' and the majestic landscapes seen in 'The Vertical Ray of the Sun' Anh Hung Tran's second installment in this trilogy of films explores the seamy underbelly of urban Vietnam. Street gangs, prostitution and the endless pursuit of trying to survive for one more day is definitely a departure from his other two films.  Young eighteen year old Cyclo works day and night as a bicycle taxi driver. When his cycle is stolen by a local street gang he  is unable to earn a living and is eventually forced against his will to become a criminal. Meanwhile his sister is also lead astray by the quietly charming 'Poet' who leads her into the world of prostitution. The families hopelessness and desperation grows as the story unfolds and one is left to wonder if those caught in such unfortunate circumstances have any hope at all of ever escaping a world of such immense corruption and greed.  Anh Hung Tran's answer to this question is apparently found symbolically in the imagery of food, particularily fruit. In all three of Tran's films there is a scene of a mellon of some kind being meticulously cut open to reveal the moist, dormant seedlings slumbering within. I can only guess that such scenes are meant as a metaphor of new life and renewed hope always waiting to spring forth into the light of day and replace that which is forever passing away. While this may serve as an intriguing symbol to some, it hardly instills within the viewer much hope for the characters on the screen.   The incredibly beautiful Tran Nu Yen-Khe once again plays one of the principal characters (Cyclo's sister), along with the talented and immensely popular Asian superstar Tony Leung (Poet) and Le Van Loc in the starring role as Cyclo. As always, Anh Hung Tran's visual artisty is second to none and Tran Nu Yen-Khe is an absolute delight to watch.
