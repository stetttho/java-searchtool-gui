 'Old Dan's Records' was Gordon Lightfoot's eighth album and the first of two released in '72. The only other year this happened was in '68. I think Gordon may have been looking ahead to his follow-up album later in the year (Don Quixote) because 'Old Dan's Records' is a little lacking when you consider that this was written and recorded during the prime of Gordons' career.  Containing -10 tracks-, there is nothing that really stands out on this album/CD that would be considered classic Lightfoot, or be included on a 'Best Of' collection. It's enjoyable, but it won't get as much playing time when compared to many of his other albums/CD's.
