 Growing up in an evangelical Protestant home, I can remember many nights during my childhood when I would awaken from sleep after dreaming about the rapture and cry out, "Take me to Heaven too!" Such was the fear instilled in my young mind concerning the Christian belief in their impending mass exodus from this world. It has haunted me all my life.   Having said that, I'm really surprised at the number of - 1 Star - ratings this movie has received. Yes, this is a Christian movie that has a specific agenda designed to convert the viewer and admitedly that desire to convert is overdone in a number of scenes that may make the casual viewer want to turn off the film and look elsewhere.   Taking the evangelical nature of the film as a given and looking beyond the Protestant basis you might be surprised to discover that this is not as bad as you might expect.  Yes there is alot of predictability in this film because Christians don't like to substitute their truth to make something more palitable for mass comsumatiion. However, if you give it a chance and go with the flow I think you will discover a rather interesting movie that may not change your mind, but will at least make you think.
