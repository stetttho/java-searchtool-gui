 Well here it is, the anthology to end all anthologies; 4 discs and 88 tracks, containing 16 previously unreleased songs. It also comes with a 60 page mini hardcover book with lots of biographical information, discography, color reproductions of all his album covers, photos through the years and personal reflections from the man himself. This is definitely an absolute MUST HAVE item for all die-hard Lightfoot fans.  It's a little expensive, but it's worth every penny!
