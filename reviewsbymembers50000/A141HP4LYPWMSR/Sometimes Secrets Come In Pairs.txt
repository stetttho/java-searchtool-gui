 Note: French with English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean and Thai subtitles.  An attractive but troubled young Carmelite nun named Sarah (Elodie Bouchez) falls ill and the physicans responsible for her care are unable to correctly diagnosis the cause. Thinking it maybe psychological in nature Father and Doctor Joachim Ferrer (Gerard Depardieu) is summoned to investigate.  Father Joachim finds himself irresitably drawn to the vulnerable Sarah and continues to delve ever deeper into her pain and delusions even after Church authorities demand that he cease treatment and leave her to the care of the convent.  Determined to solve the mystery, he becomes more detective than doctor or priest and eventually discovers that Sarah's medical problems are somehow psychically linked to her twin sister Gaelle who was just recently released from prison.  There is something evil afoot between the syblings and only Father Joachim is in a position to save the innocent. Will he be willing to risk his priestly vocation to uncover the truth?  'The Pact of Silence' is an exciting murder mystery/romance that will command your attention to the very end. Gerard Depardeau is excellent, as is the very lovely Elodie Bouchez in the dual role of Sarah and Gaelle. One of my favorite French films!
