 John Michael Talbot has been the most influential contemporary Catholic singer/songwriter in the last twenty-five years. Originally one of the members of the 70's rock band 'Mason Proffit', John embraced the Catholic faith in the mid '70's and became a member of the order of secular Francisians.  Now garbed in monks attire John's music is a wonderful blending of traditional hymns, liturgical music, Bibilical verses put to song and a few original tunes here and there.  Released in '80, 'Come to the Quiet' is his fifth CD following his spiritual conversion and his first all instrumental release. Listening to this worshipful -12 track- collection is like enjoying your own personal retreat in the comfort of your home.  Highly recommended, but don't make this the only Johm Michael Talbot CD in your collection. If you do you'll miss out on hearing one of the purest male voices ever!
