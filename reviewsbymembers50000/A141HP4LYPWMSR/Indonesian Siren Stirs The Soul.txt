 Anggun isn't just another beautiful woman promoted by a record company solely based on her looks. Yes, she is incredibly attractive but there's also a voice to complete the package.  Her exotic Indonesian looks are well complimented by a smooth, husky and seductive voice that strongly reminds me of a young Annie Lennox. A comparison especially evident in track 1 - Snow On The Sahara - and track 7 - Selamanya -.  Definitely a strong debut album/CD, proving you can be both beautiful and talented at the same time.
