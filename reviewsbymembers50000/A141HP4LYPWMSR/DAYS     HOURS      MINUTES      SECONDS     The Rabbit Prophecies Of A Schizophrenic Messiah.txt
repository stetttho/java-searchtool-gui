 Wow, 886 reviews on this film, now soon to be 887! The sheer volume of existing commentary on this totally original, cutting edge movie are impressive enough, but even more amazing is the degree of depth and insight put into many of these reviews. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that 'Donnie Darko' is not only a cult classic, but a major cinematic phenomenon that has attracted an immense following. Considering the content of this film you might even go so far as to say it has established a "congregation" of its own.   So sit down, relax, strap yourself into your favorite chair and say a quick prayer in preparation for a hallucinatory journey through the brilliant but borderline schizophrenic mind of Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal), a troubled teenager dealing with a constantly shifting world of multiple dimensions.  Jake Gyllenhaal is magnificent as the disturbed Donnie Darko. The subtle but dramatic changes in personality, body movements, gestures, voice and physical appearance displayed during his mental transition from one state of reality to the next are done to perfection. Add to Jakes' nuanced performance the unnerving visual of a human-sized demonic entity dressed in a very bad rabbit suit and you have the makings of an experience unlike anything you've ever seen.  A word of warning is necessary. Beware of possible side-effects after viewing this film. It you start hearing a low, modulated voice speaking to you in the darkness of your room make sure to have some rabbit food handy. You never know?
