 Yes the cinemaography is elegant, the landscape intoxicating, the women enticing and the music mezmerizing. Such is the life inside the secretive walls of the Geisha House. 'Memoirs of a Geisha' is well worth watching for the visuals alone, in fact that's basically what I did. Not that it contained a poorly written script or was completely lacking in substance, it just didn't quite draw me in as I had anticipated it would. Add to that the long running time of the film, I have to admit I was glad when it was finally over.  While I'm fan of Ziyi Zhang (Chiyo), Gong Li (Hatsumomo) and Youki Kudoh (Pumpkin), I actually enjoyed the first half of the film much more when the main characters were children just arriving as servants in the Geisha house (Suzaka Ohgomore as young Chiyo and Zoe Weizenbaum as young Pumpkin). It was here at the beginning you felt empathy with the girls and their plight in life. Once grown-up and a part of the Geisha system they had lost much of their appeal and my interest.  All and all 'Memoirs of a Geisha' is a visual feast that will appeal to many, particularily those of the feminine persuasion.
