 'Fiddler on the Roof' is in my opinion the best musical ever to grace the motion picture screen. That being the case what else could the soundtrack committed to CD format be other than a wonderful audio experience!  This version is the best of the best. Nobody can do Tevye the way Topol. 'Fiddler on the Roof' is a celebration of life put to music and song that will have you on your feet dancing around the room with your arms raised high. A CD for the Tevye in all of us!  La'Haim!!
