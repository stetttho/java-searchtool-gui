 Entertaining and thought provoking venture into cyberspace and a possible future in which holographic reality and the physical world as we know it may eventually intersect.  Viktor Taransky (Al Pacino) a washed up, recently unemployed motion picture director discovers the perfect actress to resurrect his career from a soon to be deceased computer expert named Hank Aleno (Elias Koteas). This perfect actress is Simone (Rachel Roberts), a computer generated holographic image controlled by Taransky. What director could ask for anything more?   'Simone' takes a much needed slap at the all-pervasive media exposure that so dominates our culture and challenges us to look beyond the facade and illusory nature of the entertainment industry and learn to discern.  Refuse to submit to the lemming effect and the destructive nature of modern day hero worship. THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX!
