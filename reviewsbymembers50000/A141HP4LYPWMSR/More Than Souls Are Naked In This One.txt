 Britt (Pamela Anderson) is a talented sculpturess who is on the verge of making her mark on the artistic community. However her achievements go unnoticed by her scientist/boyfriend Edward (Brian Krausse) who is busy attempting to record the thoughts and memories locked away in the human mind.  As their relationship deteriorates Edward is contacted by Longstreet (David Warner) who offers his finanical assistance to the research project. Unfortunately the aging and crippled Longstreet's true intention is not to simply record the thoughts and memories of others, he plans to transfer his mental processes into the younger, athletic body of the unsuspecting Edward. Thus taking over his life, his work and his girlfriend.   Pamela Anderson starred, or co-starred in four films between '93 and '95. They are; Raw Justice ('93), Snapdragon ('93), Naked Souls ('95) and Barb Wire ('96). Everyone pretty much knows what to expect from her movies, silly plot, poor production values, mostly unknowns except for herself and lots of Pamela in various stages of undress. Of course if you've seen all four of these movies you are obviously a fan of this buxom blonde and could care less about the first three expectations mentioned above.  'Naked Souls' is in my opinion the best of the bunch. Pamela has never looked better and she actually does attempt to do some real acting in this film. For any women in the audience there's Brian Krausse from the popular 'Charmed' television series to occupy your time so everybody's happy.
