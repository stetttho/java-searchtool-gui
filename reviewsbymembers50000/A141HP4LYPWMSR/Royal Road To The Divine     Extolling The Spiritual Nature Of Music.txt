 'Music, Mysticism and Magic' by Joscelyn Godwin is an absolutely amazing first of its kind sourcebook that belongs in a honored spot in the bookcase of every serious musicologist, mystic, magician and theologian. This scholarly and invaluable work contains the testimonies of many of the greatest composers, philosophers and spiritual leaders of all-time. Much of this material has been translated into English for the first time and is available nowhere else. A truly staggering and epic work!  This rare hardcover edition published in '86 by Routledge & Kegan Paul didn't receive wide distribution in the U.S., so it was hard to locate a copy even when it was in print. Now OOP, it's almost impossible to find. Good luck!  My Highest Recommendation!!
