 I was once a Korn fan.  Their first album was one of the greatest hard rock albums ever. "Life is Peachy" and "Follow the Leader" were also very good.  But something very bad has happened to them lately. The music, which once challeged the boundaries of what defined "havy" (yes, even on "Issues"), has now turned into bad synth-goth, sort of like maybe what Orgy wanted to be.  The lyrics, once angry and throaty, have finally delved into unintentional self-parody and are delivered in an annoying whine.   This might be the single worst album I've ever spent money on.  If you're new to Korn, get one of their first three albums.  If you're an old fan, this is going to disappoint you greatly.  You're better off downloading this one. I wish I had.
