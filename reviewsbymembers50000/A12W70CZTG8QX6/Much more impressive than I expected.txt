 I'm not good with "labelling" music.  When I was growing up, you either listened to "metal", "rap", "rock" or "pop", and that was pretty much it.  Now there's a sub-classification for every CD in the world. So what is Front Line Assembly? "Goth-industrial"?  How about "Spooky Dance Music"?  Or if I was a real music critic I'd call them "Angst Driven Heavy Dub Electronic Post Pop Distortion Artists".  That's great, and mighty creative to boot, but it doesn't tell you a ... thing about what FLA sounds like.  The most accurate, or perhaps easiest, way to describe them to the uninitiated is an unholy fusion of Skinny Puppy, Ministry, Fear Factory and an angry Atari 2600.  If you're a fan of any of the aforementioned bands (or liked abusing your old-school Atari), this band, and more specifically this album, is for you.  Crunchy, razor-sharp guitars meet creepy vocal fx galore, a conglomeration of heavy HEAVY near-techno drum beats and about eight miles of deep bass.  This CD demands to be played loud and WILL challenge your stereo system.  All the tracks on this disc are good, and while some are weaker than others this is one of the few discs I can play all the way through without skipping songs.  My personal faves are "Circuitry" (I bought the CD for this track), "Mortal" (very weird atmospheric instrumental), "Modus Operandi", "Barcode" and "Infra Red Combat" (... I assure you it's an awesome track).  One word of note: Most people seem to feel that "Tactical Neural Implant" is the Grand Poobah of FLA albums.  I don't really know about that since I don't have that disc, but I can say with all certainty that "Hard Wired" is one of the better CDs in any genre I've heard lately. While it is the first FLA CD I've purchased, it's label-defying sound has assured that it won't be the last.
