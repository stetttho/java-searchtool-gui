 I bought this CD on the advice of a friend who was aware of my penchant for indie-rock.  To be honest, "Liz Phair" was suggested, not this particular CD, but I figured this was the latest one so obviously it was the one to get.  Wrong, oh so wrong.  I've looked at some of the other reviews, and they indicate that I maybe I would have been happier with one of the earlier releases.  Maybe I would, but I'll probably never know for sure, because after listening to this sorry piece of plastic a couple of times I'm not too inclined to pick up another Liz Phair CD.  The first 6 seconds of the CD had a pretty good riff, and "Love/Hate" and "HWC" were OK (close in sound if not in content to what I was expecting), but the remaining tracks were generic -- any of them could have been a track on "Dawson's Creek" or "The O.C" or any other cruddy teenage drama that needs another anonymous grrl pop song to feel cutting-edge.  And if the music wasn't bad enough, the lyrics are so dumb I felt like I was losing brain cells just listening ("You're like my favorite underwear" ... What the hell is THAT?).  Sorry, I guess I actually AM the thirtysomething I seem to be, instead of the fifteen year old kid this disc is marketed to.  P.S.  Check out PJ Harvey, Ultrababyfat, Jucifer, Beth Orton or even some old Tori Amos if you'd like to hear an album by a female artist that actually offers some substance.
