 Well, it's a tribute album.  And generally speaking, a tribute album is nothing more than some label throwing together a gaggle of sorry unknown bands in a thinly disguised attempt to scam money off some other label's big draw.  Add the fact that this is a CLEOPATRA release, and you've tossed in some bad goth covers of what could conceivably be the best band in the last decade (Cleopatra's motto: 'If you can write it and make money, we can cover it with a Casio and five bucks...').  OK, OK... Now there are some fairly well known groups here(Haujobb, Rosetta Stone, Razed in Black) if you know your tribute albums (haha), and some of these covers are kinda interesting (the Haujobb, Maya Hyena and Translation Collapse tracks I am embarrased to admit I kinda dug), BUT if you are a TOOL purist as I am, NONE of these tracks are going to sound right, much less good, to you.  I would say that this isn't a horrid tribute album, but it sounds about as funky as the Tori Amos tribute this label put out not so long ago.  The bottom line:  If you really want to hear this, either check out the samples or download the album, or even buy it used, it is NOT worth full price.  And if you REALLY have to have a TOOL tribute in your music library, get the string tribute, you can bypass some bad Depeche Mode vocals that way.
