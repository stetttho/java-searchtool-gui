 What else is there to be said?  It's The Muppet Show!  I could go on and on about what features are on what disk, and what the special features are, and how good it all looks on DVD, but most of the other reviewers have already done that -- some in excruciating detail.  They're all completely right, of course, but that's not the point.  If you remember watching this as a kid, you'll love it.  You'll see episodes and be able to sing along like you'd just seen it yesterday.  You'll laugh at the gags like you've just seen it for the first time.  Your kids will love it just as much as you did (and still do).  And THAT'S what makes this a five-star, must-have set.  You'll thank yourself when you pick this up.
