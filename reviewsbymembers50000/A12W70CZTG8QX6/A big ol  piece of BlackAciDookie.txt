    Make no mistake, I love the entire catalog of Danzig's work.  The man is a near-genious, and any guy who can write a song for Johnny Cash (the Original Man in Black), well, that's just awesomeness personified.       Until this.  I remember waiting a long time for Danzig 5 to come around, and being hugely disappointed.  Sure, alot of the other reviewers talk about how creative this album is, how modern, how it was pushing the envelope.  Well, none of that really matters if it still sucks, and this sucks like a turbocharged Hoover.  "Ashes" is the only good song here and while a couple of other tracks are listenable, none are particularly memorable.  (I might mention I have the original version of this album with the red cover.  I have heard the 3 bonus tracks on this one, and they suck too.  There is a far better version of "Deeper" -- the original "Deep" on the X-Files Key of X album).     What made the original four Danzig albums so much better than everything past that was the musicianship, attitude and signature blues-metal sound.  Quite frankly, Ol' Glenn wrote better lyrics on those albums as well -- back when he could be sinister and not corny.  ("Girl I'm gonna make you cuummm!!"  Yeah, best of luck with that, Glenn.  What are you, a randy teen?  You embarass me.  Seriously.)     The single worst thing he's ever recorded.  What a pity.
