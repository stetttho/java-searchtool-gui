    With this album, Danzig seems to have realized the error of his ways.  On 6, he has abandoned the crappy overprocessed industrial sound so limply churned out on 5 in favor of the trademark blues-metal sound of the original four albums.     Well, almost.     Don't get me wrong, 6 isn't...bad.  There are some rockers.  "5 Finger Crawl", "Belly of the Beast" and "Cult w/o a Name" are awesome.  Really.  But then you get drek like "Cold Eternal", which sounds like one of Motley Crue's rejected ballads.  And "Thirteen" was better when Johnny Cash did it.  So sorry, Glenn.  Most of the other tracks have some good riffs, but the vocals are processed HEAVILY, indicating that either Glenn has something to hide or maybe he just didn't learn his lesson last time.  When I buy a Danzig CD, I'd like to hear some VOICE, not crappy vocal fx.     So in the end, if you can get past the harmonizer AND can reconcile yourself to the fact that John, Eerie and Chuck are gone, this is an OK album.  Better than 5, nowhere near the impact of any of the first four.  The perfect purchase off the used rack.
