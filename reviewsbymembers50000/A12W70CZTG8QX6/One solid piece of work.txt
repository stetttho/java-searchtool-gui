 I never buy NASCAR books.  Ever.  Generally they are cheap, poorly written and focus on one or two drivers (can you say Dale Jr?  I knew you could).  How much fun is that?  And please tell me why I'd want to pay for that?  Well, I happened to cruise the bargain bin at the local superchain bookstore, and this happened to catch my eye.  I did say I never bought the books, to be sure, but I'm pretty regular about flipping through them to see if just maybe I want it.  This one's a keeper, to be sure.  This book covers everything from the early (EARLY) days of NASCAR to the 2003 season.  Plenty of pictures, good sidebar features, season highlights, and in the back year-by-year (and race-by-race, I may add) stats.  Awesome.  If you enjoy NASCAR, this book is for you.  Period.  Go Rusty!
