 Amazingly mediocre. Incredibly OK. Super allright. That's how this album strikes me. In places very good -- with "They" and "Falling for You" being standouts -- but in no way reinventing the wheel here. Most of the tracks here are fairly anonymous (all Dido comparisons aside) or just another case of "reach exceeding grasp." A very listenable album, especially for fans of semi-indie-type stuff (um, like Dido), but not anything you'll wear out. Bottom line: Pick it up if you like this sort of stuff, but don't pay full price.
