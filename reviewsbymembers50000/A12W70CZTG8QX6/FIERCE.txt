 I would suggest that it's a fair assuption that 99% of the good folks that have visited this page or purchased this CD have done so because of the "Danny Carey" name attached to it.  That's fair and understandable -- would A Perfect Circle's sales been as high if Maynard hadn't been attached to it? Doubtful.  And I suppose a few of those people have been taken somewhat aback by this release.  APC (and I hate to say it) is a "safe" side project.  Yeah, I love 'em too (except for the Steaming Pile Known as "Emotive"), but they're basically TOOL Lite.  Same dreamy environs, a smidge more rock.  For those who'd like to get their TOOL in sub-12 minute doses.  Let's face it, MJK's very distinctive (and very good) voice doesn't help distinguish between the two.  But it's still enjoyable.  What you have here is one mean album.  My old school Korn CDs, who thought they were pissed, get nervous when sitting next to "The Power of Beef."  Imagine an aberrant amalgamate of the Melvins, Helmet, Butthole Surfers, Clutch, pre-1994 Rollins Band and a handle of bad bourbon and you'll be sniffing around the right orifice.  This album probably would have been cutting edge 10 years ago, but as it stands it's a pleasant throwback to the Good Ol' Days of metal when a trip to the pit could turn into a trip to the ER.  Standout tracks:  All of 'em.  I rarely say that, but after repeated listenings (aka getting hung up in traffic), this CD has slowly grown on me like a creeping case of skin fungus.  All are hard rockers.    If you are a fan of early nineties metal, you will enjoy this.  Immensely.
