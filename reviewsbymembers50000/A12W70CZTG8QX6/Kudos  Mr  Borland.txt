 I suppose it's pretty much common knowledge at this point that BDF consists of former Limp Bizkit guitarist Wes Borland.  I would further construct that the bulk of the album's sales was the direct result of that fact.  For those of you who have yet to experience BDF here's the important part:  This sounds absolutely NOTHING like Limp Bizkit!   That's right kids, NO obnoxious backwards-baseball-cap-pseudo-rap-nu-metal, and more importantly, NO Fred Durst!  What you get here is eleven tracks of admittingly varying quality that are as experimental as they are irreverent.  Is this album genius? No, but it does give a much needed finger to commercial radio.  Think Ween crossed with the Melvins with an occasional dose of old school death metal and you'll be in the ballpark.  "Kali", "Blood Red Head", "Fightin Stance" and "Rebel" are my personal faves, and any band that's got the gumption to use "Mighty P**** Laser" as a song title you've gotta respect, or at least giggle at.  Bottom line:  This CD doesn't work at all levels, but it's good fun and definitely a welcome change from the cookie cutter sludge that graces the FM dial these days.
