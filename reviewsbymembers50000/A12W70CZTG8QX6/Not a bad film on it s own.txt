    Really, if you look at it independently from George Romero's masterpiece, it IS pretty good.  No, not great.  But pretty good.  And truthfully, the bulk of my complaints about it do result from comparing it to the original film.     First off, the opening sequence (10 minutes or so), are AWESOME -- possibly the most intense set I've seen in a long time.  Very kinetic and spooky.  The opening credits are great, capturing the paranoia perfectly, and using Johnny Cash's (RIP) "The Man Comes Around" was nothing short of unexpected genius.  Unfortunately, the rest of the film is sorta downhill from there.     Again, the bulk of my complaints in comparison to the original.  Other than in the opening scenes, the zombies didn't spook me very much.  In the original, when the zombies got ahold of somebody, there was no question of the fact that some serious flesh consumption was going to occur.  Here, it seems like the character can get away with maybe just getting nibbled on a little so he can turn into a zombie a la "28 Days Later."  Not bad, but not too satisfying to a fan of the franchise.  I also wasn't a fan of EVERY character having a witty one-liner to go out on.  That got a little old.  And I DO wish they'd kept the paranoia of the opening (newsreel stuff, etc) going.  Some of the best stuff from the original trilogy was Romero's use of TV/radio media to demonstrate how the world order was collapsing and the characters were truly on their own.     Other than that, though, this turned out to be a nifty little movie, with a fairly decent cast.  Easily worth a rental if you enjoy the zombie genre or thought "28 Days Later" was great.  Again, if you're a fan of Romero's originals you will be let down.     PS:  This was a hell of a lot better than the sorry remake of "Night of the Living Dead" from 1990.
