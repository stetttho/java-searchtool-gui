 These guys were a local band in Orlando in the early nineties.  They were, if I remember correctly, pretty popular on the club circuit and this CD was the hot ticket amongst my Navy buddies.  I can't say that this is a great album -- they do churn out a respectable dose of industrial-metal, but the NIN and Ministry influences are, well, pretty apparent.  Really nothing new has been brought to the table here.  That being said, this is still a very listenable CD, and it does take me back.  If you're a fan of the industrial of the early nineties (especially Psalm 69), you'll probably like this well enough.  Just don't expect anything groundbreaking.  3 stars for the CD.  1 for the nostalgia.
