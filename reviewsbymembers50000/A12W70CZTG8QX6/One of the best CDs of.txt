 It seems a little unfair, and possibly naive, to expect this album to sound like "old" Skinny Puppy.  The band hasn't existed as an entity since 1995, Dwayne Goettel is dead....How could you poosibly expect another "Too Dark Park?"  Instead, this sounds exactly as I expected: a fusion of OhGr and Download.  How could it not? This is what Ogre and Key have been doing for the last few years, these are the sounds they've developed independently, and "The Greater Wrong of the Right" is the obvious conclusion.  For me, this works very well.  I am an old Puppy fan, and I enjoy the later work of Ogre and Key as well.  I don't believe that they have become more "metal", as some of the other reviewers have indicated -- more melodic, sure, but this and the stress on guitarwork seems to be a natural extension (or sequel) to "The Process."  There seems to be some complaint over the political tone of the album.  Well, I'm no left-winger, but this is a lot more subtle than some of their earlier work, and certainly more so than APC's "Emotive" (in case you want a contemporary comparison).  This is a solid album.  I'm particularly fond of "I'mmortal" and "Use less", but I don't exactly skip over the remaining tracks.  Much better than the cookie-cutter crap on the radio.  Buy it.
