 I dunno, I was very disappointed in this one. I LOVED Black Unicorn, and I thought Gold Unicorn was excellent, but the plot of Red Unicorn just left  me... a bit cold. Instead of going into an alternate reality, Tanaquil  could have done a lot of what she did in the "real" world  instead, and I might have enjoyed it more.  I think what annoyed me about  the book was that it had alter-characters(?) in another dimension of all  the real characters back in Tanaquil's world. It didn't seem necessary. The  whole thing wasn't able to hold me. Plus, for some reason, the writing  style seemed lonely and isolated, perhaps because Tanaquil herself was  isolated in a way throughout the entire book.  What I really want,  altogether, and which will probably not happen, is for Tanaquil to interact  more with characters and to have her own adventures. However, not much can  stand up to the original, and Tanith Lee writes in a way that doesn't  follow the roads quite right-on, but sideways. Her story seems to have it  all, but something is not quite right. The characters are not typical, the  situations would appear to be almost typical but then veer sharply away.  Altogether, this is a wonderful style to read, and I'd normally be happy,  but something doesn't come quite all the way through, as if Tanith Lee was  getting somewhere, then stopped in the middle of the road.
