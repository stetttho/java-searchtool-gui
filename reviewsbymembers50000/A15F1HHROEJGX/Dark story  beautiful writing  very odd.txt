 Yes, the heroine of the tale, Rachaela, is depressing and sulky, but for some reason I really, really like her; her personality is so clear,  complex, somehow REAL. A unique protagonist with an odd charm, a clear  vision, a quick mind. Very different.    This book, like all of Ms. Lee's  stuff, is completely outside the norm. Her stories seem to follow a  predictable plot, but somehow Lee's writing makes the whole story veer off  its tracks. Lee's novels always seem to be isolated and lonely, distant,  almost cold. And yet, despite all this, her characters are strange and  engaging, and you actually care about them. To anyone who likes it a  little different, who enjoys an original prose style, who likes the  characters different and compelling and unusual, I recommend this book. IF  you can find it. This book, Dark Dance, is all but impossible to find  anywhere. *sigh*  Lee's writing style is, as ever, truly excellent. Her  plots take off into their own forests along their own dark paths, the  characters are truly different and arresting. Altogether, a fabulous book.  Tanith Lee, you're a wonder.
