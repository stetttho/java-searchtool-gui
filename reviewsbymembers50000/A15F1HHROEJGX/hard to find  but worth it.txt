 Well, the book is worth five stars, but since you can't find it anywhere, there's almost no point in reviewing it. The book is so good, however, that  I suggest going to a good library and searching for it there.  Personal  Darness is the sequel to Dark Dance, where the reader first meets Rachaela,  a beautiful young woman with clouds of black hair and blue eyes. Rachaela  is completely alone, a little silent insland in the middle of bustling  London, but her life changes drastically when she goes to the countryside  to live with her father's family, one of the most bizarre and unusual  groups of people in literature.  In Personal Darkness, the story takes  right up where Dark Dance left off, and winds its way through several  different plots. The twists and turns are unexpected and truly...  different, gothic and mad, with the original cast of characters still in  top form, and a slew of new ones who are equally compelling.  This is a  lush, strong, strange, gothic, extremely unusual novel. I don't really know  how to explain it. For a while there it seems to be Tanith Lee's answer to  Anne Rice's vampire series, but turns completely upside down and mutates  into an altogether different story. Like all of Lee's work, the story hides  under the guise of formula, but remains its strange, original, different  self.  If you ever come across this book or its predecessor, I strongly  suggest you pick it up. The wonderful characters of Rachaela, Althene, and  even Ruth are worth it, and the character Malach, a white-haired  warrior-priest who debutes in this novel, is absolutely gorgeous. I highly  recommend it.
