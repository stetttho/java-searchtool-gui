 I absolutely love the main character of this story, Saskia. She is imaginative, creative, well-read, and intelligent, but not at all  pretencious or snobby. Her loneliness is palpable, her daydreams and  imaginary forays are excellent. Saskia is a truly wonderful character, and  her alienation from the rest of society is realistic and heartbreaking and  completely understandable.   The first part of this book was wonderful,  if at times a wee bit confusing and slow, but the moment Saskia's father,  Thomas, steps in, the whole novel goes to hell. However, this is probably  Brian Hall's intention. Saskia changes, tries to fit in, evolves, fails,  runs away, everything, when her horrible, amoral, narcisistic father enters  the story. It's almost like two stories got thrown together, but somehow  Hall makes it all work, and the very ending is excellently done, if a bit  dark and depressing. I wanted more when the book ended. If that isn't  reason enough for five stars and a hearty recommendation, I don't know what  is.
