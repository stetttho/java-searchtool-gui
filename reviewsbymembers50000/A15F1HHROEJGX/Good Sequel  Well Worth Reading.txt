 Really, the sequel is very, very good. There are still more interesting, complex characters, a strong plotline, and all kinds of surprises, twists,  and magic, magic, magic. Tanaquil is her old complex self, as wonderful and  strong and clever and dry as she was in the first book, Black Unicorn. Her  familiar, the peeve, is also going strong, and I particularly liked it in  the sequel.  At first, it may look to some readers like the book is just  another formulatic epic-battle-type fantasy, but Tanith Lee takes all the  old, used-up cliches of this sort of fantasy and reweaves them, turns them  upside-down, completley rejeuvenates them.  This is a wonderful book, and  a worthy sequel. I would have liked it perhaps if Tanaquil had just gone on  adventures by herself (and the peeve) and there had been no war element,  but this sequel is still good the way it is.  Altogether, I wasn't  disappointed. Fun book! Well worth reading!
