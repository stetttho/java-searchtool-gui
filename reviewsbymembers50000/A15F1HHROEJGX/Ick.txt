 Yuck. I don't know where to start. There are some lovely parts to this book, and the descriptions and writing style are lovely, but something's  definitely lacking. The Beast is a remote character, the plot has no spunk,  there's terror but no joy or laughter. The heroine is just a little too  vague; the reader can't really connect very well. The same goes with the  supporting cast. The plot takes forever to get practically nowhere.   However, like I said earlier, there's some wonderful stuff in this book;  the reminiscings on Beaty's dead mother and her home back in the city, the  sisters are nice sketches, the descriptions of the cottage and the roses  are wonderful, and, unlike the first retelling, this book has an element of  urgency and true fear. Whereas the first Beauty book was nothing but  sweetness and sugar, this book has a little edge to it; the darkness, if it  must be there, and the soberness, is an interesting additon to the tale.  This doesn't make up, however, from the inherent flaws embedded in the  book, but if you love rewritings of fairy tales, this one will be  interesting to get.
