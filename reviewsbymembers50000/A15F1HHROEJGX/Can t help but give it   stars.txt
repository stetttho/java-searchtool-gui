 This book reminded me very much of Jonathan Carroll's type of novels. Siri Hustvedt has created a very appealing, likable heroine in Lily Dahl, and  the supporting cast is wonderful. Like Carroll, Ms. Hustvedt seems to have  all kinds of ideas for this novel; she can't seem to choose which genre or  storyline to use, so she hops around from one type of story to another.   Ordinarily this would annoy me, with the novel beginning as a love story  (or an erotic novel, take your pick), then a coming-of-age novel, then a  sort of fairy-tale, then a murder mystery, then... I don't know what. Some  things are never answered or explained inm this novel, but somehow even the  unexplained and out-of-place parts of the novel don't irritate the reader.  Rather, they enrich the story, give it all kinds of elements. Hustvedt's  dream sequences, for example, wouldn't seem to have anything to do with the  novel, and yet they add to it; the story wouldn't be nearly as engrossing  or lovely without them.  Ultimately, even though the novel misleads you  several times, The Enchantment is still a wonderful book with all kinds of  elememts in it that make it strange and engaging and beautiful. Lily Dahl  is a wonderful character, and I found myself wanting to read about what  happens to her after the end of the book, not an easy feat for a novel.
