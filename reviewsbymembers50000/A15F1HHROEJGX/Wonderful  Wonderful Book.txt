 I first read this book in junior high, and now I'm a freshman in college and I'm still re-reading it. This was the first Tanith Lee book I ever  read, and it's probably the best one I've ever read (no easy feat).  The  Black Unicorn is the subtle, humorous story of Tanaquil, the bored, cranky  daughter of a powerful sorceress. She lives in her mother's fortress in the  middle of a desert where no one ever comes, and is terribly, terribly tired  of being there. One day Tanaquil "accidently" brings a unicorn to  life, and Tanaquil finds herself on quite an adventure, together with a  talking peeve whom she met in the fortress along for the ride.   Tanaquil  is a wonderful character, one of my favorites of all time. She is smart,  subtle, creative, strong, and realistic. Her little "sidekick",  the desert peeve, is just as wonderful, and the book wouldn't be the same  without it. The book is filled with all kinds of people and creatures and  places and things, all of which are amusing and fully fleshed-out. Tanith  Lee writes this story beautifully, with rich images, a sense of humor, and  a real knack for the fantastic and the oddly magical mundane.  I'm really  sorry to hear that this book is unavailable. If you like fantasies or  fairy-tales, you should definitely try to find this book and its two  sequels in a good library.
