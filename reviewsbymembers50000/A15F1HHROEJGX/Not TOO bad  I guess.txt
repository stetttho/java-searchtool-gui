 I first read this prequel to The Hero and the Crown in the fourth grade, and finished the book with a feeling of dread and fear. The part where the  dead dragon talks to Aerin stuck with me forever, and long after the title  of the novel vanished from my mind I still had little half-nightmares about  that scene. Then, in maybe nineth or tenth grade, I picked up a copy and  reread the whole thing.  Hmmm. Having despised The Blue Sword story and  disliked Rose Daughter and very nearly hated Deerskin, I must say that this  is probably my favorite McKinley book, aside from Beauty. This is not  saying much. But there must be SOMETHING good about McKinley's books, or I  would not keep on reading them.  Ms. McKinley has a wonderful writing  style and all of her novels are quiet and thoughtful, with a touch of  sadness in even the sweetest books. However, I have a hard time actually  LIKING any of her characters, and a hard time worrying that everything  won't be all right in the end, either. I have the usual complaints about  The Blue Sword, but there is something I liked about Aerin this time, when  she wasn't busy annoying the hell out of me, and I liked the man she  eventually married much more than I liked Aerin herself. Her lover the mage  basically annoyed me too, and so did Aerin's horse, but still... something  struck me. Plus, I loved the dragon. The part of the story that once gave  me nightmares now gave me thrills. Interesting way to do it. I don't think  I've ever read anything like that dragon-on-the-wall scene before.   Altogether, not a wonderful book, but it had a little something (je ne  sais quois!!) that the others don't have, so I'm begrudgingly giving this  one three stars. Yay.
