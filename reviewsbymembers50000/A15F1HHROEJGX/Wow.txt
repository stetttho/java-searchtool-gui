 Tanith Lee really, really shines in this novel. I don't think her writing was ever so good as in this book. Her character, Jane (Jain) is  exceptionally written, superbly realistic, heartbreakingly wise. Her lover,  Silver, at first infuriated me with his cold, non-human perfection -how can  a robot love you, and does he really love you if he is programmed to love  everyone else just as much?- but as the story grows, Silver skyrockets into  a real, true character, as human as they come.  This is a beautiful love  story, and it's definitely withstood one test; it's being reprinted!!!!  Most books, once out of print, stay that way, sadly (the book Fire and  Hemlock by D.W.Jones comes quickly to mind). Also, I must say The Silver  Metal Lover passed another test; so far, all (twenty-five) reviews already  up here are five-stars. Does this ever happen?  To anyone who hasn't read  the book; Go directly to your nearest bookstore and buy a copy! Then, sit  down somewhere comfortable and with access to lots of food and tissues,  because you won't be getting back up for a long time, and when you do,  you'll be drenched in tears. When I read it the first time, I could NOT put  it down, and I had classes the next day (I ended up reading till  dawn)! This book truly is timeless, beautiful, heartbreaking. Highest  recommendation!
