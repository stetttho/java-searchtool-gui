 I don't know what to make of this third story of the Scarabae; it seems to me that Tanith Lee is just indulging herself. I felt the same way with her  third Unicorn book; Red Unicorn seemed to be just as much an exerice in  writing and little else as Darkness, I.  I get the feeling that Tanith  Lee is getting lazy with her novels. They're not as tight as they usually  are; all of her latest stuff seems half-hearted, a rough draft, not  polished at all. Strange. Perhaps Lee needs to do something completely  different for a while, or something, to get back in the swing of things.   Still, even with its problems, Lee's Darkness I is definitely worth  reading. Her characters are, as usual, excellent, real, and completely  different from any other. Lee's best qualities are her prose style, both  lush and spare at the same time. Amazing. Her characters, as ever, are  wonderfully drawn, remarkably different, unusual.  I just hope that when  Tanith Lee writes again, she's rejeuvenated; I miss the tight writing and  plots that I expect from her. I'm looking forward to another sterling book.
