 Yes, the writing is the loveliest I've ever encountered, with drifts and drifts of vivid words, lovely descriptions, poetry everywhere. Every  sentence is a small work of art.  In fact, the story is so beautifully  written that it completely makes up for the wishy-washy ending, the  occaisionally irritating characters, the fits and starts of  characterization. The book is beautiful and often warm, but still a touch  of cold and ice pervades the novel and its people, even in the warm  moments. Somehow, the reader never really gets very close to the  characters; they're beautiful and true, but distant; a work of art, but not  real. Rois is a wonderful heroine, wild, calm, loving, wise, but something  seems lacking in her, just the same. As do her counterpart sister,  beautiful but tame, her sister's fiance, her father, even the handsome  stranger Corbet himself. The characters of a story  often reflect the  character of their author; all of McKillip's people seem to have this  strange, dreamy distance, much like Tanith Lee's characters are generally  packed in fiery ice. Aloneness and dreaminess pervade this author's works.    Oh, well, you can't have it all. The novel is lovely enough to make up  for its odd coldness, and the characters, although seemingly trapped in the  prose of the author, shine enough to make it all worthwhile.
