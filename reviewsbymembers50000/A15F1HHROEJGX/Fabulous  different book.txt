 Well, it was funny, gentle, frustrating, beautiful, infuriating, confusing, simple, convoluted, completely believable, sad, happy, strange,  familiar, erotic, stern, playful, poetic, choppy. In effect, everything  under the sun! The reason to read this highly engaging, luminous novel is  the angel; Xas is one of the best characters I have come across. A  beautiful, distant, earthy, gentle, erotic, subtle angel, touched by God  and Lucifer both, he is well worth all the trying, annoying, bland, and  confusing parts that pepper the story.  Right behind him is Aurora, a  wonderfully written character, so much more strong, gentle, wise, and  clever than Sobran (if you don't believe me, just ask Lucifer!). She's  another fabulous new literary character, a perfect complement to Sobran and  Xas.  Like all truly great novels, this one at times is trying, and other  times slow, and other times almost self-indulgent, but all of these  supposed "inadequacies" actually make the story more real, more  strong, more original, more memorable. All the classic novels have their  fair share of irritating or confusing parts; it's almost a calling card of  sorts.  Altogether, the book is wonderful, with highly original ideas,  plots, and characters, with twists on every cliche and philospophy of God  and religion and angels. Read it!!!
