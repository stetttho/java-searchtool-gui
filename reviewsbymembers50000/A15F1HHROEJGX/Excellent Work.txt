 This is a very strong, unique novel, with some wonderful characters and a realistic setting, ending, and feel throughout the story. The medieval/Renaissance aspect to the novel is perfectly, professionally done.   It took me a while to like the heroine of the tale, William/Elinor, but  when her frosty, standoffish attitude finally faded into a likeable, strong  protagonist, I really began to enjoy and like her character. The young  King of the tale is a gem, who starts out as a headstrong, almost ignorant  young monarch and blossoms into a truly wonderful, amiable, sympathetic and  attractive character. His multidimensional character glows throughout the  book.   Margaret is the most tragic character of this story, and while  she is definitely the villain of the tale, I couldn't help but hope she'd  make it out all right. The reader really does feel for her, and sympathises  with her (for lack of a better word) plight. This is a wonderful novel  with the most unique flavor, and the people who move through the tale, from  protagonists to antagonists to supporting players, are all excellently  crafted. The queer/gay/transgender slant to this novel is splashed all over  the back cover blurbs and Publisher's Notes and Introduction, but reading  the book, I didn't once think of it as a queer/gay/transgender work. It's  just an excellent   story whose emphasis is on the plot and the characters,  and to pigeon-hole the thing into a queer work is a shame. The book is a  great deal more than just that.  All in all, highly recommended!
