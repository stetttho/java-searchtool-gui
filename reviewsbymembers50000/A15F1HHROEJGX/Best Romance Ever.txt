 This was probably the first romance novel I ever read, and certainly the first Woodiwiss novel. I can't tell you how lucky I was to read this before  any other romance; it is by far the most excellent romance novel I have  ever come across. After having read something this high-quality, I couldn't  go back to anything less. I recommend this book to anyone at all who loves  quality, strong characters, excellent writing. While most of the other  Woodiwiss novels always ended up disappointing me, this one is still a  personal classic, and, several years later (I read my mother's copy in  grade school and now I'm a freshman in college and have gone through two  copies) it's still the best romance I've ever read. I pick it up again and  again, to remind myself how writing's REALLY done. Three cheers for Erienne  and her wonderful lover, Christopher, one of the best men in fiction!
