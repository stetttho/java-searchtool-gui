 I am absolutely amazed that no one else has reviewed this little book yet. By far one of my all-time favorite stories, the book, Sleeping Ugly, is  meant for children, but anyone with a sense of humor will savor this  story. Set in some unknown kingdom, Sleeping Ugly is a short story about  a beautiful, perfectly worthless and mean princess named Miserella, a  plain-as-mud orphan named Jane, a fairy in disguise, and an imnpoverished  prince (the youngest son of a youngest son) named Jojo. This story takes  the traditional tale of Sleeping Beauty and promptly sets it on its ear. I  received this book at age seven, and at age eighteen I still know the whole  thing by heart. It's amazing that a book this short and this simply written  can be so hilarious and filled with such wonderful characters. There's even  some morals included, and the illustrations are great.  Every parent  should buy this book for his/her child, and anyone who likes fairy tales  should buy this book for him(her)self. You won't be disappointed!!!!   This is one of the best stories ever, period!!! Don't be fooled by its  diminutive size or simple writing!! Go directly to a bookstore and pick it  up!!!
