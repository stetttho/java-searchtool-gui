 Boring, boring, boring. I have finally figured out why I can't seem to ever like Robin McKinley's novels and stories; they BORE me!!!! How?  They're almost all beautifully written, quiet and filled with magic, and  yet I just can't seem to like them. They're tedious and boring.  The Door  in the Hedge is just as boring as all the other KcKinley stuff I read, only  this time I couldn't even finish the damned book. Why, why, why can't I get  into McKinley's stuff more? I have the same problem with Patricia A  McKillip!! AND Patricia C. Wrede! I want so hard to like Robin's stuff, but  I can't. I've given up.  Altogether, McKinley's characters have sobriety  and intelligence, but no spunk and no individuality. They're all the same,  the supporting cast is all the same, they're all happy endings, everything.  There's nothing to sink your teeth into. The poetry is there, and the  ideas, but nothing gets through.  Altogether, disappointing. Robin  McKinley gets SO CLOSE to having wonderful stories, but always ends up  falling short. I'm gving her the two stars because at least she gets close  and her stories aren't shallow fluff, which I see so much of. McKinley's  people and stories have so much potential, they're such good almost-people,  but something's always missing. Oh, well, at least she's closer than most  authors. That's something, isn't it?
