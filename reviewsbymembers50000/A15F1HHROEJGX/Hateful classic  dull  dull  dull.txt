 Why does everyone love this book? Why? I thought I would really connect with Meg and Charles Wallace and Calvin, beacuse they're all intelligent  misfits who don't quite fit in, and I connect with that, but I didn't. The  characters are dull, stultifying, snobby, mundane. They're so in love with  their enormous intellects and unusual, close-knit family life that I could  cry with frustration and annoyance. The writing is weird, the characaters  are weird, the plot is weird, and none of it is entertaining. I love a  different book with a different plot, but the triteness and egotism and  coldness of this book destroyed it for me.  I must admit that the story  has some truly interesting elements to it. Madeleine L'Engle does well with  storylines and plots, and the story does indeed move along, (like I said, I  like weird--i.e., unusual and original-- plots) but the stuffy dullness of  all the characters, main and supporting, ruins the book. I couldn't relate  to anyone in this book, and I found I really didn't want to.
