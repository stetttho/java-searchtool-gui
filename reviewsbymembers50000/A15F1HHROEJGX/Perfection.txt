 This is one of the loveliest books I have ever read, period. I'm counting full-length novels, anotholgies, poetry, everything. The writing style is  absolutely wonderful, the retakes on the classics astoundingly subtle and  haunting. What can I say? It's a beautiful book. Ms. Donoghue's writing  style far surpasses those of Patricia Mckillip's, Robin McKinley's, even  Elizabeth Knox's, in sheer marriage (uh-oh, getting a little swept away,  here!) of words and images while using the sparest of styles. Nothing is  wasted or superfluous in this lovely collection of fairy-tales. All of the  stories are haunting, with nice twists and turns and oddly strong  characters with strong and individual voices, no easy feat for such short  tales. My favorites were the remakes of Donkey Skin, Beauty and the Beast,  and Snow White. Lovely, lovely.    I'm almost shocked that this book is  to be found in the children's section of a bookstore, it seemed to me to be  a bit too grown up for children. But that's ok. With what many will view as  lesbian themes, or at the very least feminist themes, letting children read  literature that accepts such normally taboo or looked-down upon concepts  might just inadvertantly teach them tolerance and acceptance. That's  definitely a good thing, and I know from experience that what a child reads  is more than a little influential in her life.  The sum of it is, this  book is superbly written with finely, finely crafted stories, and I highly  recommend it to everyone.
