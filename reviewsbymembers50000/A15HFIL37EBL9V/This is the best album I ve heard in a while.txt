 Neil, you've done it again.  I have to say Are You Passionate? left me a little confused, but this album hits the mark dead on, and is a great diatribe on modern America (from a Canadian).  It's hard to pin down exactly which one of the characters is most like Young, but they are all believable and it's a great story.  The Horse is once again one of the best bands ever recorded, and this is assuredly an essential release for any Neil Young fan.  Don't be scared, it's not Trans all over again.
