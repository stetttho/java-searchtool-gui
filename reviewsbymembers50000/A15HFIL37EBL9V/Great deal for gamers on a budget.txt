 I didn't really have a chance to shop around and had to choose between this, a X800, or a nVidia 6800GT, that was it.  Given my income and rig (a P4 2.4) i didn't think bleeding edge was what the doctor ordered, so I said what the hell and ditched the old GF ti4600.  Well, ho-lee crap, what's that about an average 67fps in Half-Life 2 with all detail settings turned up, 4XAA, 8XAF @ 1024x768?  MORE than happy with those numbers for the price.  How about Doom3 at 800x600 detail medium-high at steady above 60fps?  Not too bad for a 2 year old rig.  The Catalyst software suite is very nice, though since nVidia also makes great drivers these days it's kind of a moot point.  One thing to note, using ATI's Overdrive utility I have experienced some system hangs, particularly in HL2.  Switched to Powerstrip and now I've got it lethally Oc'd on factory cooling and stable as a coffeetable... go figure.  In short, this card will run any of the current gen of games well enough for 99.9% of gamers.  With full DX9 compatability, it's even got a shot at next-gen titles.  Highly overclockable, well-priced, and reliable as can be.  Great buy!
