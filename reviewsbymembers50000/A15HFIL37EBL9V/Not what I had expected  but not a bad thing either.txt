 Although I really want to slap Chris for being a closet Christian even though he seems to be an intelligent person, Dashboard has always connected with me as being great mood music.  I.E. great after you girl was a dumb sl**, grating otherwise.  So you can imagine my surprise when I put this in my player and heard (FOR THE THIRD TIME ON A RELEASE FOR GOD'S SAKE) the single "Hands Down" all electrified and had to do a double-take... is this really the new dashboard?  And by the time the fourth track, the first to use an acoustic guitar as the foundation for the rest of the song, I realized this was a very different album, but actually a very good one.  "So much for... so much more." and "Where I'm from we live like it's the latest attraction" are lines that will stick with you for at least 72 hours after you first hear it and are from the two best tracks on the album.  Is it a classic?  No, a few duds linger in the mix, and accessibility for the mainstream alterna-parents has reduced the formerly deeply personal introspective lyrics to oblique universality that even mom will love.  Oh well, it's still their most listenable if not best release.  Just wish "So Impossible" had made its way on instead of "Hands Down" and its PG-13 sexuality from a 28 year old man.  Once Chris decides to shed the dogma and get real on emotion and life, Dashboard will become what their hype says they already are.  Until then, you've got a good soundtrack to a rainy day, although much less cloudy than their last two LPs (which I still think may be just a little better).
