 Rating a season of the Simpsons is a futile endeavor.  The Simpsons is great, possibly the most entertaining 23 minutes and change on TV ever, bar none.  The commentaries are great, the packaging is slick, and if you're on this page you more than likely intend to buy this season.  So just do it already and stop wasting your time reading glowing reviews.
