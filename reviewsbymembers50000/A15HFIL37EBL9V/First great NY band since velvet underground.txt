 What about Sonic Youth?  I guess 20 years of great albums are easy to ignore, right?  Otherwise, this is a really good album.  Good, you hear me?  Last Nite, and that one "I didn't take no shortcuts..." song rock, and I love that take it or leave it one.  I recommend this album to anyone with a desire to listen to some good old fashioned rock and roll delivered with some panache for a change.  Good work, boys.
