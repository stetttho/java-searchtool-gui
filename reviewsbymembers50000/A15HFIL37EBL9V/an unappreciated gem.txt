 What an amazing movie!  As 168 other fine people have summarized the movie already, I'll just touch on what I loved.  This is the closest to experiencing someone elses life I can ever imagine.  After going through some major losses in my family, I found the beginning to be espescially moving (the reference to the tray of cold-cuts is ingenious, and brings this home to anyone who has ever had to arrange a funeral) and did feel very much endeared to Schmidt, despite what other reviewers have said otherwise (dairy queen was priceless). Kathy Bates is divine, and as my own mother is your quintessential horn-dog divorcee I will also say her performance was magnificent.  OK, one and only gripe: the shooting star.  After a movie pulls no punches, to have one of the single most cliched see-it-from-a-mile-away cop out scenes ever left a real sour taste, but the hummel figures sliding back and forth on the roof of the winnebago made up for it.  This is a really great movie, obviously not a light-hearted comedy, for crying out loud, look at the friggin' cover?!?!?  Don't go in with the wrong expectations and you're in for a treat; expect jack nicholson to be type-cast and caveat emptor.
