 what is this all about?  why did this album make such a splash? this is highly derivative garbage, and it is not worth the admission price.  any album with something as corny as mary jane's "i love pot" fifth grade premise and assorted weak cliched lyrical touches should be canned immediately, not in heavy rotation.  not half the album of anything the hives put out, and put out years ago.  avoid at any price.
