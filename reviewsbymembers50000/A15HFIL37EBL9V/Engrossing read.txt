 I admit to being biased (my family moved to Albany around the time this story is set and has stayed since) but still insist this is a great period story that is at times hilarious, at times heart-wrenching, and never dull.  Although period literature is definitely in no short supply, Kennedy writes this book with a distinctly mystical flair that adds a stern dose of magic to a time most authors relegate to stuffiness and pomp.  In addition, his characters here are immediately endearing, espescially Maud, Magdalena, and Daniel Quinn himself.  I'm less coherent than normal having spent the night awake reading this great story in lieu of sleep, but for anyone interested in, well, good storytelling set with a  historically accurate backdrop of Albany and canal-town New York as a whole, Quinn's Book recommends itself.
