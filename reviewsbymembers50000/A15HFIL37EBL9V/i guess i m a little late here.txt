 so i ran into an ex girlfriend the other day and she mentioned this as being an amazing album.  well, tim armstrong has proven himself one of the most capable songwriters of our time on rancid's last several albums, and we all know the aquabats and blink are cool if you dig that sort of thing (which i don't) but this rapper [is bad]!  tim's come close to rapping on rancid albums all the way back to their debut in '93 on "rats in the hallway" so don't say rap-punk is being invented because tim did it a decade ago.  and tim does it way better than this weak chump and his screamy cliche violence and hate references, this is fascist nonsense!!!  i really can't recommend this album.  to hear tim armstrong flexing his creative muscle check out life won't wait, and blink, well, boxcarracer was actually pretty good, but this is for the linkin park angry violent set.  violence is great but for a reason, and not just stupid handgun references and boasting by this rob chump.  between this and the new rancid album i don't know what i'm more let down by.  the guiding lights of rock and roll are fading fast.
