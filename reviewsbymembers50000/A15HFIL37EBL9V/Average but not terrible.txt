 First, I bought these for the sound, not because I'm ultra-concerned about the aesthetics of my family room.  In any event, I don't understand why other 3 piece systems sell for this or more and get away with it.  The sound is decent, crystal clear, bass is not quite cut out for Ludacris but otherwise tight and controlled.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a solid deal.  Paired with a low-distortion high-watt amp, these aren't the best speakers you've ever heard, but they will provide you with decent stereo sound...
