 It's kind of sad to see so much negativity from a band with some of the best fans in the world.  I'd understand if this were a subpar album, but it's anything but, and is their leanest, meanest and most heartfelt release to date.  From the opening track (coincidentally also the first single) and its heartfelt anxiety at the thought of being a good father to screaming "let the reigns loose" this is a very moving and god-forbid EMOtional album.  The only decipherable difference is in the delivery, with less distortion and a more downbeat bend on some tracks that focuses more energy around the moving vocals and the message behind them.  Personally, I think this is a very logical preogression for what is and has been my favorite band for sometime and was very surprised to see these low reviews and felt the need to set the record straight.  Keep it up, guys.
