 Here are my rambling thoughts on this spectacular album:  This sounds to me like the other side of the coin from the young Bob Dylan's experiences in New York City; while Dylan immersed himself in Americana and traditional imagery on The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, Conor Oberst turns his mind's eye inward and talks about his experiences as a transplant from the midwest struggling with the pointless self-absorption and excesses of NYC life.  The effect is powerful and a little embaressing sometimes, as it feels like he leaves nothing left of himself.  Musically, the album's sometimes sparse, sometimes crowded mixes are beyond reproach.  On the lonesome numbers, not a note is wasted.  On the rollicking ones, the drumming is admirably concise with impressive displays of rudiment-laden fills that really contribute to the overall texture and horns that sound like I always imagined the trumpets of heaven sounding like to call us up for the rapture... except in Conor's world we're "wait(ing) for an explosion / a bright light to wipe the slate clean" and not happiness.  Emmylou Harris is great on This is Nowhere... in all very happy.  The inevitable contrast with Ryan Adams, whose meteoric rise to press darling followed by critical demise is, I think, ill-fitting.  Also, Ryan Adams keeps drifting closer and closer to filling the gap left when Jerry died and "Cold Roses" if friggin awesome.  Conor has yet to bomb.  I guess every generation gets one (Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen) songwriter who comes closest to transcendance of time and space ;) and this is ours.
