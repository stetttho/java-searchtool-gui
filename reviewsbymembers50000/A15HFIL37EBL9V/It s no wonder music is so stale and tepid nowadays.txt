 If fans don't allow bands to do new things, then what is the point of making new music?  You've got plenty of old staples to tide you over, so stop moaning about change.  This is actually a really good record, despite what most people think.  It starts out great and kinda loses steam toward the end, but all in all, a really good album by any band at any point in their career.
