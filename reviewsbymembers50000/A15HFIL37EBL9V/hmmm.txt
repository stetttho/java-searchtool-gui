 there's no doubting tim armstrong and lars are two of the baddest ...... in the world, but i can't help but feel like they weren't trying on this one.  i was built up a little i suppose by hearing this compared to life won't wait, which is still imho the best rancid album ever, period, end of story, but this is not that.   from the get-go, it sounds less like classic rancid and more like... something not quite as good, although definitely not bad.  i will say that any rancid fan will not be completely disappointed, but in total honesty, a coupl of songs here totally blow (lookin at the single).  i blame the little bit** from good charlotte for poisoning them with his upper-middle class suburban maryland upbringing.  other than that, rancid is still the greatest band in america, just not by as wide a margin.
