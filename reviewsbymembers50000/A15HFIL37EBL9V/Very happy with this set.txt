 As a replacement for an old set of CS 4-Point Surrounds, these are remarkable.  The soundstage is palpable, highs shimmer (with proper treble adjustment of around 70%), lows are well-defined and punchy (with bass turned down to around 25%, this thing can go a little crazy), and the convenience of having volume, bass, treble, power, AND a headphone jack on the right speaker is HUGE.  I was aware of a potential dip in low to mid-midrange frequencies due the downward firing driver; it's there, but very VERY slight.  I do have a highly reflective soft pine desk, though.  Volume, while not room-demolishing, is great, and distortion isn't a factor until well beyond comfortable listening volume.  Appearance is great, and the speakers themselves feel solid.  This is one of the better ways I've seen the slim profile handled; like it or not, speakers size is directly proportional to their ability to move air and generate midbass frequencies.  By including a 3" midrange, Altec has made a speaker than balances form and function perfectly.  I can't recommend these enough, espescially at the price!
