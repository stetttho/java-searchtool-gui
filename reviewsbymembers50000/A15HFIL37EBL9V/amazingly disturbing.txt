 although the stand-up bits that preface the skits aren't that entertaining, my god, once the film gets rolling, this is the most entertaining half hour tv ever showed.  equal parts hilarious and thought-provoking, this dvd set is now permanently parked in my changer and i'll routinely check out my favorite bits, although certain parts can only be watched once - the christmas carols for one, once definitely was enough for that, but it's helping me quit smoking.  along with stupid whit men, these are some of the best demonstrations of freedom of the press ever.
