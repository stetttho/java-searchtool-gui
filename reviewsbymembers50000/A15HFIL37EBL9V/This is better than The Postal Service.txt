 ... at least to me.  Lush soundscapes, simple but poignant lyrics... I don't understand what's not to love.  I bought the two albums at the same time and I've actually (and unexpectedly) been listening to this one more.  They're both great, but I really love the bold steps Conor took on this release.  Think of it more like Tom Waits when he got out of his troubadour phase and started making anti-music.  Just a way for Bright Eyes to make sure we haven't all fallen asleep on them and we're still listening.    I find this album easy to get into, easy to love, and easy to recommend.
