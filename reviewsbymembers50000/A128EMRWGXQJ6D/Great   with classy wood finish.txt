 I have the version with a black wood finish, but the cherry ones sound just the same.  They look very nice on a wood bookshelf, appearing very hi-end.  Confuse your friends by blasting some Wu-Tang out of them! These speakers are redesigned for 2003, and I think the bass response sounds better.  If you're on a budget, or don't need to rock any houseparties with your system, you could just go with these as your primary speakers.  But if you want a truly awesome home theater system, these make GREAT rear-channel speakers. Plus they give amazing sound for being a little bigger than a toaster.
