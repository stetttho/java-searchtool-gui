 Once again, Bose comes through with a quality product at an affordable price.  If you've ever had a pair of Bose speakers, you know they'll give you quality sound for the life of your system.   These speakers are redesigned for 2003, and I think the bass response sounds better.  If you're on a budget, or don't need to rock any houseparties with your system, you could just go with these as your primary speakers.  But if you want a truly awesome home theater system, these make GREAT rear-channel speakers. Plus they give amazing sound for being a little bigger than a toaster.
