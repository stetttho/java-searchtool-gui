 This is some grimey east coast hip-hop. The Beatminerz create their second masterpiece album (Check "Enta Da Stage"), with bottomless basslines and sloooow BPM's. I like S&W's back-and-forth, old school MC style, it works well. This album would be a 5-star LP, except it really starts to drag in the middle before finishing strong. But on the whole, it's a must have.
