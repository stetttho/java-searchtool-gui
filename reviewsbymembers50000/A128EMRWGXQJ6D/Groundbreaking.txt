 This album smashed all stereotypes about rap when it came out in 1988.  Beofore then, hip-hop's sound was very 808 drum machine based, mastered only by a few groups (Run-DMC comes to mind).  But when the "In Full Gear" LP dropped.  Just listen to the first two tracks.  The opening song uses a dope sample that Public Enemy fans will recognize, and "Let the Music Play" flips a JB's loop that soars through the song. But Stetsasonic did not limit themselves to innovative sampling: they were called "The Hip-Hop Band" for a reason.  Check out the all-out classic "Talking All That Jazz" with the great bassline ans keyboards done by Wise.  (As a bonus, this reissue throws in the fantastic "Dominoes" remix of "Talking All That Jazz" .)  And don't sleep on my all-time favorite: "Step Troop '88!" Pick up this reissue while you can.  Make Prince Paul proud.
