 Anthony Franciosa stars as a young actor who goes to New York with big dreams and, of course, finds that it's a lot harder to make it on the stage than he realized.  Dean Martin co-stars as his director/buddy, Shirley MacLaine is the alcoholic daughter of a famed Broadway producer with whom both men get involved, and Carolyn Jones is a former actress turned successful agent.  There's nothing in this material that is original or especially fresh, since it follows a basic plotline we've seen before.  Franciosa comes on strong (and sometimes too strong) as the idealistic actor who must decide how much idealism he can afford.  Martin is solid and understated, while MacLaine chews the scenery when allowed.  Jones creates the most memorable character, mixing in pathos, humour, and a world-weary experience.  It's not a bad film, but there's nothing here you haven't already seen.  It can be a hard trip on your way to the top. It depends on how bad you want it.
