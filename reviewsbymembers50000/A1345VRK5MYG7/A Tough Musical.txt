 Doris Day stars as torch singer Ruth Etting, who rose to the top thanks to her involvement with a gangster, played by James Cagney.  Day has the talent, but Cagney (forcibly) opens the doors for her, and then he is unable to give up control once her career gathers momentum and she no longer needs him.  Neither character is made to be completely sympathetic, since Day uses Cagney's affection to get where she wants to go, while Cagney is presented as a violent control freak with little social skill.  Day is strong, if a bit detached as Etting, with her best moments in the film coming when she sings the great old songs.  Cagney, a fearless actor, goes full throttle as the gangster, making him brutal yet allowing the viewer to see just how much he needs and loves Day.  The rest of the cast are fine.  The colour of the film (unless it was the print I saw) is a little stark, reminding me of how colourized black and white films look.  But the production values are high, with great music and a tough script.  As musical biopics go, this is one of the better ones.
