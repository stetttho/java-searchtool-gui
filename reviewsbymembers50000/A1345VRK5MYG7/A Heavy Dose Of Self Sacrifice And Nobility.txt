 I found this to be a hard one to sit through.  Bette Davis stars as the widow of a gangster trying to make a new and better life for herself.  She's in love with the rich but aimless Henry Fonda, and is loved by her lawyer-boss Ian Hunter.  Fonda's father is dead-set against their relationship and she keeps the birth of their child a secret from both father and son.  But of course, it can't stay a secret forever.  Davis is fine, although her character isn't defined particularly well by the script.  She could best be described as "suffering", and it gets heavy-handed after a while.  Fonda is livelier than I've seen him in most of his films.  The supporting cast play cardboard cut-outs that help the plot to move along.  Everybody in the film was far too self-sacrificing and noble for me, with the last half of the film seemingly endless.  Director Edmund Goulding does a poor job of pacing the film.  It just limps along to a completely convenient conclusion.  This is soap opera without style or polish and not my kind of film.
