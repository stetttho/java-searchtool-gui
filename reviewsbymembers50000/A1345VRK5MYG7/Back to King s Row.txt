 I was struck by how much this movie reminded me of the 1940's classic King's Row, exploring the claustrophobic way of life in a small town, with families that come from (literally) both sides of the tracks.  Although I  think King's Row is a better film, this one is entertaining on certain  levels.  I found myself laughing out loud at some of the dialogue and  scenes, but I had to remind myself that this was probably cutting edge  material back in the Fifties.  The performances are all good.  Lana Turner  is surprisingly effective as the conservative mother with the secret past  and has a number of highly emotional moments.  Hope Lange and Betty Field  are both excellent as members from the troubled family on the wrong side of  the tracks.  Russ Tamblyn and Diane Varsi have some good moments as the  teenagers exploring their feelings and trying to break free from their  mothers.  Peyton Place is basically a soap opera, and although I'm not into  soap operas, this one kept my attention for the message it delivered about  the narrow-mindedness of small towns and the people who live there.   Sometimes we tend to romanticize small town life, and this film reminds us  of some of the pitfalls.
