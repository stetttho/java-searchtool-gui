 Frank McHugh is a mild mannered greeting card writer who happens to figure out all the winners at the racetrack while on the bus to work everyday.  He never places a bet, and in fact, has never seen a horse in person.  He does it for the fun of it.  After an argument with his wife one day, he goes on a drinking binge and winds up in the hands of some small time gamblers who recognize a gold mine when they see it.  After he makes them a lot of money, they take control of this life so that he can make them rich.  But McHugh maintains a delicate balance in his life, and if they upset his life too much, he won't be able to pick winners anymore!  McHugh is appropriately low key in his role, making his character of Irwin a believable everyday loser.  Allen Jenkins, Sam Levene, and Teddy Hart as the gamblers are a lot of fun, doting over him for all its worth.  Joan Blondell contributes another winning performance as Levene's girlfriend. The rest of the cast is kind of grating, but thankfully, are not given too much screen time.  Some of the jokes and innuendo fly, while others fall flat.  There are some decent laughs in the film, but I somehow suspect this story worked more effectively on the stage where it first began.  But it's a good premise, with some decent performances, and at under an hour and a half, it's easy to take.
