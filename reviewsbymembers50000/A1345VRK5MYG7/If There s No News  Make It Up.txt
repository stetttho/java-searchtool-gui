 Clark Gable and Walter Pidgeon are newsreel photographers working for different companies on the search for the same stories.  There isn't much they won't do for a story, especially Gable, and one of the film's highlights comes at the beginning of the story as Gable creates a battle scene in China just to satisfier his boss' demands.  When famous aviatrix Myrna Loy enters the scene, the boys' competition only intensifies.  The story is entertaining, although the scenes in the Amazon were hard to believe.  Gable carries the film, with his charm and energy, while a number of supporting actors really add to the fun as well.  It's a timely film to watch these days, as people are questioning how much of the news is made more newsworthy by tabloids and over-zealous reporters looking for a good story.  This film takes a comic slant to that question, but makes its point nonetheless.
