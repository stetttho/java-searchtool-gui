 Charles Boyer is a famous jewel thief hiding out in the Casbah, a section of Algiers famous for its winding streets and a perfect place to hide from the police.  He has a network of friends who help him, and all is good until a beautiful woman played by Hedy Lamarr enters and makes him remember Paris and love and the things he can no longer have while he is trapped in the Casbah.  Boyer is excellent as the edgy, clever thief, making the caged situation of his character very real.  Lamarr is beautiful, but a block of wood as an actress.  Gene Lockhart is very good as the man who informs on Boyer, while the rest of the supporting cast is adequate. Time has not been good to the prints of this film, and the quality of the image is poor, although that does add to the feeling of being undercover in the Casbah.  The director most have come from silent films, because the pacing and certain angles and shots are reminiscent of that style, although they are not appropriate here. The film is worth watching to see Boyer's performance, but it is certainly not a must-see.
