 In a change of pace from her usual goofy, zany tv characers, Lucille Ball plays a widowed mother of eight kids that falls in love with Henry Fonda, a widower/naval officer with ten kids.  If that sounds like a famous tv program, it is sort of, but that doesnt' take away from the enjoyment of this film.  Fonda and Ball are terrific together, and it is nice to see Lucy playing someone a little more real and normal.  She brings her great comedy timing, but also a lot of warmth and decency to the character.  The scenes with the eighteen kids in the house are a lot of fun, as is Lucy's drunk scene and the scenes surrounding their blind dates.  This isn't a hysterically funny, holding-your-side kind of comedy, but it is a warm, affectionate look at the perils of blended families, which in the hands of Ball, Fonda, and some good child actors, is very amusing and entertaining.
