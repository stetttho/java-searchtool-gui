 This is one of those films that has achieved legendary status that everyone should see.  Starring Fifties film icon James Dean, it tells the story of several young people (Dean, Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo, etc) who don't fit into their families or what society considers acceptable behaviour.  It was one of the first films to deal with alienated youth, and although elements of it are dated and very much a part of Fifties culture, it still maintains its power and appeal.  Of course, a great deal of that power and appeal comes from Dean's most famous and defining performance.  He brings so much raw energy and emotion to his character, and he has a screen presence that is so unique you can understand why he continues to be such a larger than life figure in film, even with only three starring roles to his credit.  Wood and Mineo also contribute memorable performances,  but it really is Dean's show.  Rarely have actor and role been so closely matched and inexorably linked.  It's the stuff of legends.
