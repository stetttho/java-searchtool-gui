 Gary Cooper stars as a General advocating the need for developing the Air Force following WWI, at a time when the Army and Navy did not believe it would be useful.  His insistence on its usefulness leads to a demotion when he goes against orders, and later on, when he makes accusatory statements about the military, he is brought to trial for court martial.  The fact that this is a true story certainly lends interest to it, but the slowness of the pacing offsets that.  Cooper has a few good moments as the stubborn, heroic general who puts his career on the line to speak the truth and try to make changes, but to be honest, I did not find his performance to be a complete success.  He's inconsistent and his laid back style doesn't always work.  The supporting cast does better, with Rod Steiger as one of the prosecutors adding a lot of spark, and Ralph Bellamy relishing his role as Cooper's defender.  It's fun to watch a number of up-and-coming young stars such as Elizabeth Montgomery (in a critical role), Jack Lord, Darren MacGavin, and Peter Graves.  As a history lesson I learned a few things, and as a courtroom drama, it does come to life at times.  But director Otto Preminger keeps things moving pretty slowly, and I wish the film had been tightened up a bit.
