 The Razor's Edge takes an unusual theme and manages to turn it into a terrific drama.  Tyrone Power stars as a war veteran who can't seem to find his purpose in life.  Whether he's searching for the meaning of life, or to  understand the reason why he is on Earth, he goes on a journey (externally  and internally) to understand the bigger picture.  That's a pretty lofty  theme, but it is well played out and may leave the viewer asking themselves  a few questions, too.  Gene Tierney stars as the girl who loves him, but  can't understand what he's all about.  Anne Baxter gives a great  performance as Tierney's friend, who through personal tragedy, turns to  alcohol and loses all purpose in her life.  Clifton Webb is Tierney's  uncle, a man who exists to enjoy the pleasures of life and who is only  concerned with society and appearances.  This is certainly an odd film to  have come out of Hollywood in the 1940s, but with its good performances and  production values, it is surprisingly enjoyable.
