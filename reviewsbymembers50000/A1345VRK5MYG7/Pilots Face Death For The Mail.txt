 James Cagney portrays one of the pilots responsible for delivering the mail through the best and worst of weather conditions.  Pat O'Brien is his buddy and the man in charge of the airport, and June Travis is the young pilot that Cagney falls for, despite their age difference.  Cagney has a well-earned reputation for being irresponsible, and it finally starts to catch up to him.  Cagney is terrific in this film, cocky as usual, but with some of the edge taken off.  He has some great moments as he romances Travis and faces the consequences for his actions.  He displays a more relaxed manner in some scenes than he often did in other films.  His fans should definitely catch this film.  O'Brien is his usually solid self, while young Travis is very appealing and Isabel Jewell punches through her scenes as the domineering wife of a pilot with a lot of gusto.  The film builds up a lot of suspense as the weather plays havoc with some of the flights, while the drama in the airport more than holds your attention, too.  This film took me by surprise, since I had heard very little about it.  Cagney fans and old movie fans will want to see this one for sure.
