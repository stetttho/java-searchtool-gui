 Katherine Hepburn stars as Lizzie, a woman who is well on her way to being a spinster.  Her father and two brothers are trying their best to get her married off before it's too late, but time is running out, and unfortunately, Hepburn is too serious and not "flirty" enough to be able to land a man.  Into this situation walks Burt Lancaster, a con man who claims that for $100 he can end the drought that is another worry for them.  Everyone knows it is a con, but much like the problem with Hepburn, they hold onto anything that might give them hope.  Lancaster gives a florid performance as the charismatic huckster.  Sometimes he's a little over-ripe, but he definitely leaves an impression.  Hepburn never completely captures her character, although she does have some terrific moments.  Earl Holliman as her rowdy younger brother scores big with this performance, offering some of the films most amusing bits.  The Rainmaker was adapted from a stage play, and you can see its stage origins, where I suspect it probably comes across better. The film is good, although I wouldn't rate it as highly as many of the other films featuring these stars.
