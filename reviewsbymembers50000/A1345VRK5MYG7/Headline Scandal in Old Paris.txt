 Bette Davis is a young governess brought in to educate and basically mother the children of the Duc and Duchesse de Praslin in Paris of the 1840's.  The Duc and Duchesse are at war with each other, trying to keep the children out of it.  Davis' calm manner and way with the children soon catches the eye of the doting father, Charles Boyer, leading to a love between the two that is never acted upon.  The Duchesse, Barbara O'Neill, grows to resent the governess for having taken the affections of her husband and children from her.  It leads to a series of dramatic events that tears the family apart.  Davis is subdued and unusually controlled as the governess, a fine counterbalance to the fiery dramatics of the spurned O'Neill.  Boyer is excellent as the tormented Duc, torn between duty and love.  It's a long film, but Anatole Litvak's tight direction and the quality production keep the story moving along well.  Although primarily melodrama, it's has aspects of mystery and social commentary woven into its plotline, all anchored by Davis quiet performance.  It's one of her least known films from that era, but one worth viewing.
