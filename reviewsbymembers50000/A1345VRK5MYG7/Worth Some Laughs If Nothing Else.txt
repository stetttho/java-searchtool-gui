 I had a hard time coming up with a rating for this film ... it did entertain me, but not because of its superior filmmaking.  A lot of money obviously went into this overproduced spectacle.  If only a less heavy-handed touch had been used as well! Jennifer Jones is the panting half-breed girl torn between two brothers, the very good Joseph Cotten and the very bad Gregory Peck.  Their mother, the saintly Lillian Gish looks on with concern, while their father, the not-so saintly Lionel Barrymore opposes the girl and pretty much everything in general. What ensues is over two hours of lust, bickering, bellowing, and more lust. Jones swings her hips and shoulders to convey her characters urges, but does little else with what little character she has been given to develop.  Peck is fun as the brother lacking pretty much any morals, while Cotten is one note and boring.  Gish looks stunned throughout most of the film, but manages a couple of effective moments (and lets ignore her straight-from-the-silents deathbed scene!!).  Barrymore blusters and blusters in a role tailor made for his hamminess.  Others in the cast, including Charles Bickford, Walter Huston, Herbert Marshall, and Butterfly McQueen deliver what you would expect of them.  The script is full of laughable lines and characters, and there's more than a few moments when you'll be holding your head wondering what they were thinking!?!?  The music score is dramatic, although sometimes overpowering, and the colour cinematography is outstanding. There are the bones of a good film here, but pretty much everything is overheated and overproduced.  The movie is entertaining, albeit not always for the reasons is should be.  And it certainly isn't boring.  It's one of those classic films that should be seen ... if only for a few good laughs.
