 On her deathbed, Will Klein's mother tells him that his assumed-dead brother is really alive, and from there unfolds an incredibly complex series of events, cover-ups, and moments of violence and mystery that take the reader on quite a ride. Klein's brother was implicated in the death of Will's ex-girlfriend, and it becomes apparent that he may have been involved in much more than just that - or maybe not.  A string of colourful characters passes through the books pages, each one making an impression and playing a role in the complicated mystery.  Among the more memorable is Klein's devoted friend Squares who works with runaways, The Ghost who is an incredibly violent and dangerous friend of Klein's brother, and various other people, including a go-getting out of town journalist and a pathetic ex-hooker.   Coban has a great ear for dialogue, and I can only imagine the time it must have taken to plan such a detailed, twisting plot.  His ability to bring to life characters that only appear for a short time is something other writers should learn.  His plotting and periodic surprises keeps the story moving and always exciting.  I don't know if Hollywood will make a movie out of this one, but it would be difficult to capture all that is happening in the story.  It's a great read.
