 Sergeant York traces the life of the real Alvin York from rebellious youth in remote Tennessee, through his religious conversion and status as a conscientious objector, to World War I hero.  The film is a little corny  and too "homespun" at times, but it succeeds in large part due to  the very effective performance of Gary Cooper, who is never anything but  believable in all the stages of York's life.  Walter Brennan delivers his  usual good supporting performance as Cooper's moral mentor, and Margaret  Wycherly is quiet and sweetly amusing as Cooper's calm, ever patient  mother.  But it's Cooper's movie, and he makes the most of it, making Alvin  York a hero to be admired and respected.  This movie must have played well  to audiences during World War II when it was released, and it still plays  well today.
