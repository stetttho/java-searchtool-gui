 Fredric March stars as the infamous Dr. Jekyll, the compassionate, forward thinking physician whose experiment with separating the dual natures of Man ends in tragedy.  Jekyll believes Man has both a good and bad sides to his nature, and Jekyll's bad side takes the form of Mr. Hyde, a brutal, repulsive thug who destroys the life of Ivy, a "girl from the wrong side of town," who unfortuantely crosses paths with him. March is excellent in this role, especially as Mr. Hyde.  He's almost unrecognizable in his transformation, and he plays both characters with a lot of style.  Miriam Hopkins, never a subtle actress, digs into the role of Ivy and makes her sympathetic, sexy, and very memorable.  Director Reuben Mamoulian experiments with camera angles in this early talkie, and although some of the close-ups aren't successful, the film never drags or fails to entertain.  I've never read the novel to be able to state whether the film is faithful to the text, but the movie could hardly detract from it.  It's very good drama/horror.
