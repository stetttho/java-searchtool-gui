 My summer has been a quiet one so far, and it certainly can't compare to the summer Elizabeth Taylor has in this film, a summer in which she witnesses the traumatic death of her cousin, leaving her in shock and setting the stage for a lobotomy to help "relieve" her distress!  Sound a little over the top?  Well, it is, but this is a Tennessee Williams story and over the top is what makes it fun. Katherine Hepburn plays the dead man's very wealthy mother who decides that her niece must have a lobotomy in order to prevent her telling the truth about what happened last summer.  She approaches neurosurgeon Montgomery Clift with a big cheque to help convince him of its necessity.  Before he operates, he wants to delve into Taylor's case and the unravelling of the mystery of what happened that summer drives the film. The first time I saw the film I remember being unimpressed by Taylor.  Not so the second time, however, as she delivers an emotionally charged performance with much skill.  She gets some big moments in the story, and she takes full advantage.  Hebpurn gets to play one of the strangest characters of her career, and does so with obvious relish and style.  Clift is very subdued in a thinly written role, letting the two star actresses take control of the scenes and reveal their characters, which is really what a psychiatrist does. There is obviously more going on then the script of a 1950's film could get into, so the film deals with its larger issues as well as could be expected.  The last twenty minutes are especially impressive.  It's certainly not a feel good movie, dealing with some pretty dark aspects of human behaviour and reasoning.   But the film is nonetheless fascinating to watch, and certainly worth seeing for the performances of its leading actresses.
