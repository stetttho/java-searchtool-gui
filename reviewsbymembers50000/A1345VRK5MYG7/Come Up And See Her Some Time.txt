 This was the first Mae West film I have seen, and I was curious to see if she would live up to her reputation.  She did.  West stars as Lou, a singer with a penchant for diamonds and men.  She's mixed up with a bunch of white  slave traders and crooks.  West has a wisecrack for everything, and more  than enough male admirers to keep her busy.  But the one guy she wants, she  can't seem to get, and that's do-gooder Cary Grant, the recipient of her  famous "Come up and see me sometime" line that has made her  immortal in films.  West has a great screen presence and she exudes  sexuality.  She must have been a shock to Thirties film audiences.  The  film moves along briskly (it's just over an hour), and the dialogue really  keeps your attention, as does Mae.  The lady had a way with words.
