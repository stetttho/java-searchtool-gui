 Edith Evans is the wealthy grandmother to troubled teen Hayley Mills.  Mills lives with her grandmother, since Evans is unhappy with her daughter's second marriage and wants to protect her granddaughter.  John Mills works as the butler and Deborah Kerr is the latest in a long line of governesses hired.  Hayley has a way of scaring them away.  Kerr seems to have arrived without much of a past or family ties (but that becomes clearer later).  Hayley is angry at her mother and the world and feels very isolated and it's up to Kerr to find a way (whatever the cost) to get through to her. The performers are all strong.  It's the kind of role that Deborah Kerr did very well, while Hayley is good in a character that requires her to be more than just cute.  John Mills is solid as the butler, while Evans has some good moments as she realizes that not only her garden is inhospitable to growth, but so is her home and relationships to her daughter and granddaughter.   The music is a little over the top, as are a few melodramatic moments in the script, but the story is entertaining as the tug-of-war between the governess and her charge heats up.  It's an interesting character study.
