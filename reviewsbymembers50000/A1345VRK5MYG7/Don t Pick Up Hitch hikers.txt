 Frank Lovejoy and Edmond O'Brien go on a fishing trip, but end up the hostages of William Talman, a hitch-hiker who has already killed other drivers, on a trip to Mexico where Talman wants to escape the authorities.  The film is short, at seventy minutes, but that keeps the action moving right along.  It's tightly edited, and the viewer gets a very real sense of the confinement of the two men.  A lot of credit goes to director Ida Lupino, who establishes a mood of tension and desperation, as well as to the fine trio of actors who are all memorable in their roles.  It's a smart thriller that will grab your attention and keep it to the very end.
