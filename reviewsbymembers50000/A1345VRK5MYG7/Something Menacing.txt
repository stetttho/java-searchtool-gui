 Ray Milland and Ruth Hussey star as a brother and sister, who while on vacation in the Cornish countryside, fall in love with a house for sale and decide to buy it.  The home is surprisingly cheap, and they quickly discover why.  Doors open and close, the upstairs studio is cold and damp and somehow menacing, the animals won't go upstairs, and worst of all, just before dawn the moans of a crying woman echo through the house.  Somehow connected to all this and in terrible danger is Gail Russell, the daughter of the man who sold the house.  Her parents lived in the home, and her mother died there.  It becomes very clear that she is in danger every time she visits the house unless Milland and Hussey can find an answer as to why they have "uninvited" guests.  If this excellent ghost story had been made today, the emphasis would be on computer generated special effects to deliver the chills.  But that's not what makes this such an effective film.  The dark, candle lit cinematography, the restrained performances and direction, and the measured approach to presenting the chills is what makes it work.  The story and mystery are involving, presented in a way that makes the viewer believe it could actually happen.  Milland and Hussey are very good, and Gail Russell delivers a sympathetic performance as Stella.  The only criticism of the story is the character and performance of Cornelia Otis Skinner as a woman who knows the truth of what happened with Russell's mother.  She is over the top in a film where everyone else is restrained, and the parts of the story that shift the focus from the house to the insane asylum that Skinner runs interrupt the flow of the film.  But other than that, this is a perfectly crafted film that delivers a terrific, suprisingly effective ghost story that make it tops in that genre.  The film establishes a mood and credibility that make it a real winner.
