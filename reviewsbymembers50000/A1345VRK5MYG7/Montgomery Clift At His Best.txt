 From Here To Eternity is probably best remembered for the famous beach love scene of Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr, but there's a lot more to  this legendary film.  It tells the story of the lives and relationships of  several characters in the time leading up to the Japanese attack on Pearl  Harbour.  The film is well cast.  Lancaster gives a strong performance as  the tough sergeant in love with his superior's wife, and Kerr is equally  fine as the frustrated wife who has become famous for her dalliances.   Frank Sinatra gives a charismatic performance as Maggio, the soldier with a  love of drinking who gets himself into trouble.  Donna Reed convincingly  plays a "toned-down" prostitute who doesn't want to fall in love  with a soldier, but does.  The best performance is given by Montgomery  Clift as the soldier Reed loves, a bugler and former boxer who critically  injured a man in a fight and doesn't want to step back in the ring.  Clift  was an actor capable of digging deep into his characters, and  unfortunately, he seems not to be as well known today as others from his  time. The dialogue is sharp and mature, the attack scenes are excellent,  and there are a number of dramatic, memorable moments in this film.  Watch  it for the beach scene, for Clift's superlative performance, and for all  the qualities one would expect in a top notch film from Hollywood's Golden  Era.
