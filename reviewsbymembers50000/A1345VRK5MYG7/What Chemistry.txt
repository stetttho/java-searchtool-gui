 The first time I viewed A Place In The Sun it did not have much of an impact on me.  Perhaps I was too young, plus I did not understand Montgomery Clift's acting style.  Subsequent viewings have made me realize the quality of this film.  Clift stars as the poor relation of an important family who begins to work his way up.  He first has a relationship with plain working girl Shelley Winters.  Then he meets the real love of his life, beautiful, wealthy Elizabeth Taylor.  From that point, things become very complicated for all concerned.  Clift was an actor that played everything deeply, and his performances are always painfully real, just like this one, in which you can feel the conflicts that tear him apart.  Winters is excellent in her tragic role, while Taylor, besides looking unbelievably beautiful, brings a lot of honesty to her character.  The chemistry between the Clift and Taylor is palpable, and their on screen kiss is one of the most memorable you will ever see.  Although there is a sense of doom that permeates the movie, the actors make every moment a great one.  Some of elements of the story may seem dated, but it is played with such honesty and intensity that you will appreciate it for the very fine film it is.
