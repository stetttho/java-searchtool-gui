 Dennis Morgan stars as fighter pilot Colonel Robert Lee Scott who flies with the Flying Tigers, trying to keep the Burma Road open, while also launching attacks into Hong Kong, trying to strike down the Japanese Navy.  Scott believes in himself and in luck, while missionary priest Alan Hale tries to make him see that God's hand can be found all over.  Morgan is good in the lead role, and well supported by Hale and many familiar character actors with faces you might remember, even if their names escape you.  The film isn't quite as moralistic as the title would suggest, although Morgan's gradual acceptance of God's power is certainly at the heart of the film. I imagine that the image of God taking care of everyone must have been a comfort to audiences at a time when the world had been turned upside down. The film is also filled with some terrific air battles, replete with some bad Japanese trash talking (did Forties' audiences buy this?). I've seen enough Forties war films to expect that, as well as some stiff, corny dialogue between the fliers, and I find that part of the fun of watching these kinds of movies.  At only an hour and a half, the film moves along quickly, mixing in enough action with the sentiment to keep me entertained.
