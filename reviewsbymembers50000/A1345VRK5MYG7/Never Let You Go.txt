 Gene Tierney stars as Ellen, a woman incapable of anything except obsessive love.  She goes to extreme lengths to keep her new husband (Cornel Wilde) all to herself.  And I do mean extreme!  She leaves her family in ruins.  I'm not sure why Leave Her To Heaven works so well.  The acting is either dull (Wilde, Jeanne Crain) or over the top (Vincent Price).  The script is full of bad lines and unbelievable situations.  But somehow it works!  Give credit to Gene Tierney, who manages to make one of the most unbelievable and unlikeable characters in movie history so watchable by more than just her incredible beauty.  Also give credit to the amazing technicolor photography that really must be seen.  The musical score is very dramatic and over the top, which makes it a perfect fit for this movie.  You may be shaking your head throughout most of the film, but I guarantee you'll watch it to the end to see what happens.
