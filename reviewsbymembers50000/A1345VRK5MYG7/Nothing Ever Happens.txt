 Lewis Stone tells the audience at the beginning of Grand Hotel that people come and go through the expensive hotel, but nothing ever happens.  Of course, the sharp viewer knows irony when he or she hears it, since the film then sets about to disprove his statement.  Burglar John Barrymore is at the centre of the action.  He's fallen in love with fading ballerina Greta Garbo, befriended dying office worker Lionel Barrymore who is at the hotel to live life before he dies, offended businessman Wallace Beery who is on the brink of financial ruin, and worked his considerable charm on stenographer Joan Crawford who has come to the hotel to work for Beery, but her job may go beyond typing.  Everyone is at a turning point in their entwined lives, and these moments are played out in various plot lines that link together beautifully.  Both Barrymores and Beery, along with Stone and Jean Hersholt give their customary excellent performances.  There are two surprises in the film:  Crawford and Garbo.  I haven't seen Crawford in a lot of films since she holds no appeal for me as an actress.  But in this film she lights up the screen with warmth, humour, energy, and real emotion.  Her phone scene with Lionel Barrymore is a great moment in the film.  Garbo, on the other hand, disappoints me in this film.  Apart from her famous moaning of vanting to be alone, she is excessively theatrical.   It's not easy to make a successful film with so many linked subplots, but Grand Hotel pulls it off with style, drama, fine acting, and humanity.  Nothing ever happens?  I don't think so!!
