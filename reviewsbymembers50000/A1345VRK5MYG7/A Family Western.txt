 This is the story of a Southern father, played by Alan Ladd, who is heading North (just after the Civil War) to find medical treatment for his mute son, played by David Ladd.  The boy underwent some trauma during the war that has left him unable to speak.  When the elder Ladd gets into trouble, farmwoman Olivia de Havilland bails him out with the judge, leading to his working on her farm to pay off the debt.  She's having trouble with her neighbour Dean Jagger, so she needs all the help she can get.  The Proud Rebel is a well made family western, with a little more emphasis on the family than on the western.  Since they were, of course, a real life father and son, the Ladds have an excellent, real chemistry together on screen as well, with much quiet emotion.  The younger Ladd is especially good in his role, delivering a very natural, believable performance.  As the independent farmwoman, Olivia de Havilland may not seem to be the likely choice, but she is terrific in her characterization, bringing a mixture of warmth and toughness to her, as well as some good chemistry with both the Ladds.  Director Michael Curtiz balances the action with the family relationships and sentiment, and the result is a film well worth viewing.
