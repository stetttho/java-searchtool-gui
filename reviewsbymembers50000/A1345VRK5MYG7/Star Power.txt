 This film has a plot that is quite complicated to describe, although as the film progresses, it all makes sense.  Essentially, Myrna Loy is an heiress suing a newspaper for libel (five million dollar lawsuit), and Spencer Tracy defends his newspaper by using fiancee Jean Harlow and writer William Powell to prove that the story his paper originally printed about Loy was actually true.  Relationships then get very tangled as this comedy proceeds.  The plot is fun, and some of the dialogue humourous, but the real strength is its star package.  Jean Harlow gets some scenes where she cuts loose and shows the comedic range she possessed (might surprise you).  Spencer Tracy plays the driven newspaperman with a lot of energy and edge.  But it's really William Powell and Myrna Loy who own this film.  What chemistry the two had on camera!  Of course, they proved that in film after film, and this is a prime example.  Witty, sophisticated, sexy are just some of the words for the two on screen.  Powell in particular is in top form here, and as everyone notes about this film, his fishing scene is the highlight of the film. Star power is what this film is all about, with a complicated story and some good laughs thrown in for good measure.
