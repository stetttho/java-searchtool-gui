 The trouble with Harry is, among other things, that he won't stay buried.  It's a bizarre concept, and I imagine that a lot of people will find this movie to be strange.  The humour is dark and a little dry, and it's not  what an unsuspecting viewer might expect from Alfred Hitchcock.   Personally, I like the film, because the humour appeals to me, as do the  performances.  John Forsthye, Shirley MacLaine, Edmund Gwenn, and Mildred  Natwick make a great foursome trying to dispose of the corpse that just  won't go away. A very young Jerry Mathers shows up, too, as MacLaine's son,  and it's amusing to see him in this film.  If you like your humour a little  dark and dry, and you can deal with a Hitchcock film that is not typical  Hitchcock, than this film is for you.  However, if you can't go for that,  than this film is probably one that you should skip.
