 Dick Powell stars as an Army private stationed in Hawaii who becomes tangled up with a general's daughter (Ruby Keeler) involved with another man.  When things end badly and he is accused of not behaving like a gentleman, he transfers to West Point so that he can become an officer (and a gentleman) while also forgetting her.  Of course, she re-enters the picture and his successful training is placed in jeopardy.  The plot is pretty thin, which was often the case in the Warner Brothers musicals of the Thirties.  Although the often co-starred Powell and Keeler are comfortable with each other, riveting they are not.  They play their roles earnestly, as does the rest of the cast, which includes Pat O'Brien as Powell's proud former sergeant and Ross Alexander as Powell's fellow cadet.  The songs are generally forgettable, and apart from the marching in formation, there's little here visually to distinguish the film, unlike so many of the studio's other Thirties musicals.  The film seems to lack energy and charisma, building little momentum or interest.  It passes the time, but does little else.
