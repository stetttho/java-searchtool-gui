 Norma Shearer stars as the free soul, a woman with bad judgement who falls in love with brutal crime king Clark Gable, a man recently defended in court by her alcoholic father, Lionel Barrymore.  She's already engaged to polo champ Leslie Howard, a much better match in the eyes of her family.  The film is surprisingly adult in its presentation of Shearer's relationship with Gable, as well as in Barrymore's alcoholism.  The performances are a mixed bag.  This was one of Shearer's early sound films, and she's still playing to the back row as if it were a silent film - lots of dramatic hand gestures and lurching about.  She never completely lost some of those mannerisms in her acting, which is too bad, because in her quieter moments she is fine. Barrymore has the showiest part, and he makes the most of it, with his justly famous courtroom speech a highlight.  Howard was a great actor in the right roles, but this wasn't one of them, and as in certain other films, he's pretty bland.  But it's Clark Gable that impresses the most in one of his first roles.  The film comes alive when he's on screen, bringing an intensity and explosiveness to his gangster character, and showing how even early on in his career he had the screen presence that would make him a legend.  The writing is pretty good and the direction is a little creaky, but the film is worth a look as a worthy example of Hollywood filmmaking in the early days of sound.
