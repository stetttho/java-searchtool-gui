 At a time when Hollywood paid more attention to its female audience and made films for them, this may be the best of the bunch.  A padded Bette Davis stars as Charlotte Vale, an overweight, unattractive spinster bullied by the mother who never wanted her.  On the verge of a nervous breakdown, her sister-in-law arranges for her to meet a psychiatrist played by Claude Rains, and after spending time at his "hospital", she emerges thinner, beautiful, and more prepared to face the world, a world which include Paul Henreid, a married man that she falls in love with while on a post-recovery cruise.  It's the kind of role an actress must love, and Davis plays it with restraint and class.  Rains is good as usual, and Henreid delivers one of his best performances.  The supporting cast is excellent, with Gladys Cooper pulling out all the stops as the tough mother and Mary Wickes bringing a gentle humour to her role as a nurse.  The musical score by Max Steiner is excellent, and of course, there are the famous moments of Henreid lighting two cigarettes at once, something that wouldn't work in today's movies, but is quite effective in this film.  With it's Ugly Duckling/Cinderella angle and it's sense of romance, this has to be the ultimate woman's picture.  It knows its audience and delivers.
