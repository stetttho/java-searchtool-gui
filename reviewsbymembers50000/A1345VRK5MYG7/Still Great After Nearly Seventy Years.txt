 It Happened One Night has aged very well, and it remains as funny and sexy as when it first premiered in 1934.  Claudette Colbert stars as an heiress  on the run, trying to get away from her controlling father who does not  approve of the man she has quickly married.  While on a bus to New York to  return to her new husband, she becomes entangled with news reporter Clark  Gable, a man who feels only contempt for her (at first), but who won't pass  up a good story.  Colbert and especially Gable are in top form, displaying  a terrific chemistry in Frank Capra's comedy.  The scenes I enjoyed are the  same as everyone else - the walls of Jericho and Colbert's method for  hitch-hiking.  But my favourite scene is in the cabin when they pretend to  be a bickering married couple to throw off investigators looking for her.   Their "improv" is hysterical.  I can't believe that after almost  seventy years, this film has not dated.  Give credit to Capra, writer  Robert Riskin, and of course, the star combination.
