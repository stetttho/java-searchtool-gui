 Judy Davis stars as a young Englishwoman who journeys to India in the 1920's with her fiance's mother.  They stay with her fiance, who is a magistrate for the English government.  Both women are unimpressed with the English colonists' upperhanded treatment of the Indians, and they wish to make friends with them.  The opportunity arises through an Indian doctor who arranges to take them on a tour of some famous caves.  Unfortunately for all concerned, it's a tour that changes everyone's lives forever.  I assumed prior to viewing that this would be little more than a well-photographed travelogue pieced together by a thin plot.  Although the plot is not as involved as I would like, the film does have some substance to it.  It explores with honesty the strained relationship between the Indians and the British.  Virtually no attempt was made by the British to understand the culture and character of those they ruled.  There is also a sense of sexual tension present that surprised me, but it added another layer to the story.  Peggy Ashcroft gives the standout performance as the most sympathetic character, the elderly Englishwoman who sees too clearly what is going on within the country and her family.  Victor Banerjee, as the doctor, gives a heartfelt performance with quite an arc of development.  Judy Davis has the most difficult role as the conflicted young woman, and she makes the most of it.  Director David Lean perfectly captures the atmosphere with some truly breathtaking shots.  The script contains some excellent dialogue, although the film continues for almost a half an hour after the real climax.  It needed a little re-structuring.  Also, Alec Guinness pops up from time to time as an Indian professor, a character which really adds little to the film and could have been eliminated.  But these are small criticisms for what is otherwise a well-acted, beautifully crafted film.
