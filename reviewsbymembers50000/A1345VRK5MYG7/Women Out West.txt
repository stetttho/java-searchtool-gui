 Robert Taylor stars as the tough head of a wagon train of women heading West to California to marry men in need of female companionship at a new settlement.  The women are an odd assortment who prove their mettle in the face of floods, Indians, and various other obstacles.  It's an unusual premise, but director William Wellman and the story's creator Frank Capra make it memorable, along with capable performances by all the cast, especially Hope Emerson as the no-nonsence Patience.  You've got to have respect for the women and all that they faced and conquered.  The West needed a lot of strong women to help build it, and this film gives them credit.
