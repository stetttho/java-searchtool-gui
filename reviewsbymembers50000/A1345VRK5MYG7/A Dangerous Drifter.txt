 Paul Newman plays another one of his cocky, dangerous characters in this story of a drifter who moves into a small Mississippi town dominated by fatcat Orson Welles.  Welles' own son, Anthony Franciosa is weak, and he likes Newman and wants to match him up with his staid daughter Joanne Woodward, but she's not interested ... or at least not at first.  Newman's high wattage star charisma is on display here as the man who manages to get out of tight spots and can spot an opportunity when it is presented.  Woodward is very good as the young woman who needs to let go and allow herself to live.  Welles dominates every scene he is in, with his characteristic bluster and dramatics a good fit for this character.  Lee Remick, as Franciosa's wife, and Angela Lansbury, as Welles longtime girlfriend, are both sadly underused.  The script has got some great bits of dialogue, and the main characters are allowed to develop quite well.  But the ending seems rushed, and the full dramatic potential of the town's confrontation with Newman and Welles is not allowed to play out enough.  The movie does evoke a Southern atmosphere, and this chance to see Newman and Woodward in their primes shouldn't be missed.
