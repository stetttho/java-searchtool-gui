 Rock Hudson stars as a minister who feels he has lost his calling and returns to the Air Force (he had fought in WWII) to train Korean soldiers during the Korean War.  He and his men become involved with a group of Korean orphans and a young Korean/Indian woman that cares for them.  While the war rages on, Hudson begins to find his way back to God, while also trying to protect the orphans.  I initially believed that this was a war-action film, only to be surprised that, although there are several good fighting sequences, this was a more personal story of finding faith.  Surprisingly, it meshes together well with the action.  Hudson is earnest in his portrayal of the real life colonel, and he is well supported by Dan Duryea as one of his men/sidekick.  There are some great lines about faith, and some of them made me think, especially the belief that God allows things to happen for reasons that may not be clear to us now, however bad they may seem at the time.  In light of what has gone on in the world lately, this is a comforting thought.  Battle Hymn is a well crafted, inspiring movie that never seems to preach, yet it certainly makes its points.
