 Edward G. Robinson gives one of his most vivid characterizations as Wolf Larsen, captain of the "Ghost".  Robinson is hated by his entire crew, since he employs violence and humiliation to keep the men in line.  Among the crew is fugitive John Garfield, who fits right in since most of the crew is made up of society's losers.  Writer Alexander Knox and convict Ida Lupino are also taken aboard and they also fall victim to Robinson's cruel ways.  The only way out seems to be escape or death.  Garfield and Lupino are intense as usual and well-matched, although their relationship develops quicker than the story gives it time to grow.  Knox is convincing as the intellectual writer who analyzes the captain and also learns about himself under extreme conditions, but he doesn't have much screen presence.  Supporting players Gene Lockhart and Barry Fitzgerald have some excellent moments, with Fitzgerald a particular surprise, cast against type as one of the ship's most disagreeable characters.  But it's Robinson who towers above everyone else as the cunning, cruel Wolf Larsen, one of his best performances.  Director Michael Curtiz keeps the suspense up, giving the film a dark, disturbing quality.  The script is literate, the music effective, and the characters are well drawn and performed.  It's a very solid film.
