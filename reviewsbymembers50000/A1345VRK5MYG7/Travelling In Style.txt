 When millionaire collector James Stewart is talking about the guests he will be flying in for the opening of his museum, he tells reporters, "I think you'll all agree we brought them here in style."  The sharp viewer will, of course, recognize irony in those words because this is an Airport movie and his guests are guaranteed anything but a comfortable flight.  I've always had a soft spot for the Seventies' disaster flicks, and this is one of my favourites.  Art hijackers plan to take control of Stewart's jet to steal his cargo and leave his passengers, put to sleep by gas, sitting on the plane on a remote island.  But this is a disaster movie and the hijacking doesn't go quite as planned, leaving the airplane sitting on the bottom of the ocean instead. It's intact, but slowly flooding and with the fresh air disappearing rapidly.  It becomes a race against time to somehow signal for help while the Coast Guard and Navy search for the missing plane, well of course from where they expect it to be. The Seventies' disaster flicks usually had great casts, and this is no exception.  Jack Lemmon is very intense and convincing as the heroic captain and Brenda Vaccaro brings warmth and vulnerability to her character as the stewardess/assistant to Stewart.  Lee Grant chews the scenery (as she sometimes did), playing the drinking bitter wife of the emotionally distant Christopher Lee, while Olivia de Havilland is amusing as a poker playing art patron.  Darren McGavin, Pamela Bellwood, and M. Emmett Walsh are also quite effective in supporting roles.  Given the time, the special effects are good, both as the plane crashes and as it floods during the rescue attempt.  The set design of the unique jet is excellent.  The rescue procedure is hard to believe, despite the mandatory disclaimer at the end that it was a real technique used.  Far from a great film, Airport '77 is an entertaining film, well cast and fun to watch.
