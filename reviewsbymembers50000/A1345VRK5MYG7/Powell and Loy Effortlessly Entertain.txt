 William Powell and Myrna Loy return as Nick and Nora Charles, this time with a baby to help keep the dog company.  The mystery is a rather complicated one, with the couple's quiet weekend in the country disrupted by the murder of her business manager at the hands of what appears to be a blackmailer.  But things are never what they seem, and several murders later, Nick reveals all. Powell and Loy continue to be a perfect match, with such a breezy, comfortable chemistry.  They effortlessly toss off lines laced with dry humour.  The supporting cast is good, featuring a funny Marjorie Main as a landlady, a slick Sheldon Leonard as the man threatening the victim, and an underused Ruth Hussey as a mysterious nanny.  There are a lot of other familiar faces as well. I found the story a bit confusing in the beginning and would have liked the "cute" scenes with the baby reduced.  But the plot keeps the viewer guessing and I did enjoy Nick's wrapping up of the murders.  Although not a great film, it's a very solid mystery that fans will enjoy.
