 Broadway Bill is the story of a man played by Warner Baxter, married to  the daughter of a business tycoon, who has sacrificed his love for horses  to work for his empire building father-in-law.  He decides to break away  from the life he hates, and he pins his hopes on Broadway Bill, a horse  with a lot of heart.  Along for the ride is Myrna Loy, his wife's younger  sister who shares his disdain for the family empire and his love of horses.   Baxter, a forgotten actor from the 1930's is alright in the central role,  and Loy is really appealing as the girl secretly in love with him.  The  story has a lot of good moments, particularly those surrounding the betting  and the racetrack.  The parts of the story dealing with Baxter's in-laws  aren't as well written or interesting (although I liked the way they ate  dinner "together"), and the ending doesn't quite ring true.  But  all in all, it's an entertaining movie.
