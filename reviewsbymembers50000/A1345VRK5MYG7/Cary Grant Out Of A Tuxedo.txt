 Cary Grant stars as an ex-professor who has sought refuge (and isolation) in the South Pacific while World War Two rages around him.  He is forced to volunteer as a lookout on a remote island, which instead of being invaded by the Japanese, becomes overrun by seven schoolgirls and their teacher Leslie Caron, survivors of a plane crash.  Although charming is usually the word used to describe the typical Cary Grant character, it doesn't work in this film.  The gruff and frustrating Grant wants nothing to do with the girls or their stubborn teacher, but it's a small island and they're hard to avoid.  Grant and Caron work very well together in this blend of comedy and some action.  It's a change of pace for both, and they acquit themselves nicely with a good chemistry and sense of character.  Grant also has a number of terrific moments with Trevor Howard, his military contact via the radio.  Directed with a light touch by Ralph Nelson, he wisely lets Grant do his thing and let's the script speak for itself.  It's good to see Cary Grant out of a tuxedo for a change, and it's great to see a comedy that comes from character and situation, rather than put-down one-liners.
