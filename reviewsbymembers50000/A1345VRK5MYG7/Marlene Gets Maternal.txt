 Marlene Dietrich stars in this comedy as an actress who rescues/kidnaps a two month old baby and decides to raise him as her son, a move that shocks  all who know her.  But since she is not financially stable or married, the  odds of a successful adoption are against her.  But marriage to baby doctor  Fred MacMurray would certainly help her cause, and she goes after him.  I  found it hard to swallow Dietrich as a baby lover in the beginning, but she  grew on me as the film progressed, and in the end she gives a believable  performance.  However, the script needed at least one more re-write and  more laughs needed to be added to give the movie more life.  It's not one  of Dietrich's better known films, and I can understand why.
