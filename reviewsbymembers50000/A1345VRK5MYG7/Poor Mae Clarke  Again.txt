 James Cagney stars as a conman that winds up a Hollywood star trying to escape his shady past.  The story begins with Cagney first getting conned by a group of con artists, then joining them and moving them on to much bigger games.  When they turn on him, Cagney ends up in Los Angeles, where he works his way up the "extra" ladder to becoming a top star.  Of course, his criminal "friends" want the bigger game that he can now bring them, possibly bringing an end to the life he has made for himself. This is the perfect kind of role for the young Cagney.  It allows him to display the cocky attitude, intelligence, aggressiveness, and humour that made him the immortal screen character he became.  The two elements of the story mix well.  The con game aspect is fun to watch as people cross and double cross each other.  But it's also fun watching the fish-out-of-water Cagney adjusting to life in movies, giving us a glimpse of life behind the camera in 1930's Hollywood.  Margaret Lindsay is competent as usual as Cagney's actress-girlfriend, while Mae Clarke is fun as one of his partners in the con games.  Once again, Clarke gets pushed around (and pulled by the hair!) in a Cagney film, providing some of the film's highlights.  Like most of the Warner Brothers films directed by Roy Del Ruth in the 1930's, Lady Killer moves along quickly, with plenty of in-your-face action and laughs, giving you a prime look at vintage Cagney.
