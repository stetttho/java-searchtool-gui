 It seems kind of pointless reviewing a film as well known and often-seen as It's A Wonderful Life, but I would like to throw in what I think makes this film so great:  The performance of James Stewart.  This film has become such a Holiday fixture I think it's easy to lose sight of just what he did in this film.  It's an amazing performance, so full of honesty and emotion.  It's perhaps one of the most real performances ever given on film, and it certainly stands the test of time.  I've read the original story that this film was based on, and as good as it is, the film surpasses it.  It's an excellent adaptation, fleshing out the characters more and adding so much more conflict and detail.  The supporting cast is terrific, with such reliable actors as Lionel Barrymore, Beulah Bondi, Donna Reed, Thomas Mitchell, Gloria Grahame, Ward Bond, and of course, the wonderful Henry Travers.  The story reminds us of the impact each of our lives has on those around us, an impact we might not even appreciate.  And at a time like Christmas, when we think of family and friends, it's something we need to be reminded of.
