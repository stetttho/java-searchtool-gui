 Jimmy Stewart stars as Elwood P. Dowd, a very ordinary man except for the fact he sees and talks to a large white rabbit (a pooka, actually).  His overwrought sister Veta can't take it anymore, since he is ruining the chances of her daughter Myrtle Mae finding a suitable husband.  She wants to get him committed to the Chumley Sanitarium.  And that's when things begin to get very complicated for all concerned.  As comedies go, Harvey isn't one of those riotous, laugh out loud howlers.  It does have some laugh out loud moments, mostly supplied by the inimitable Josephine Hull as poor Veta.  She's extremely funny, with her quavering, fluttery voice, and expressive eyes.  The comedy is more gentle and rooted in human nature.  Stewart hits all the right notes as Elwood, a terminally calm and happy man who seems much more at peace with himself and the world than the apparently sane people around him.  He and the film leave you questioning what the harm is in a man who sees a big white rabbit, but loves life and making friends and who really disturbs no one.  After all, don't we all have our own oddities and quirks - myself excepted, of course ;) .
