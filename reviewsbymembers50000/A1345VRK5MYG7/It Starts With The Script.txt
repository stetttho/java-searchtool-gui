 Repeated viewings do not dull the shine of this excellent movie.  Bette Davis gives perhaps her most famous performance as Margo Channing, the fiery, aging stage star coming to grips with her maturity and her insecurities.  She tears into the character (and every scene) with relish.  Gary Merrill is very good as her younger director-boyfriend.  Celeste Holm is her calm, understanding best friend (a playwright's wife), and she's terrific, especially in scenes where she communicates a lot with simple reactions.  George Sanders is at his very best and steals many scenes as the sharp tongued critic who sits back and manipulates the events.  Thelma Ritter is right on target as Davis' all-knowing, all-seeing maid.  Marilyn Monroe has a small, but showy role as a voluptous (what else) wanna-be actress.  But special praise should go to Anne Baxter as Eve, the conniving young lady who insinuates herself into Davis' life.  Not enough attention is paid to just how great her performance really is as she walks the line between who she really is and who she wants to become.  However, despite these awesome performances, the real star of this movie for me is the script.  Joseph Mankiewicz's script is simply perfect, from its narrative construction with the opening framing device, to its witty, mature, quotable dialogue.  This is one of those films where you just sit back, smile, and marvel at the excellence each time you view it.
