 In High Sierra, Humphrey Bogart plays one of those characters that we shouldn't admire because he has led a "bad" life of crime, yet somehow we find ourselves rooting for him to get what he wants, because we  suspect he's a decent guy at heart that didn't get the right breaks.  In  other words, he's a complicated character, and in the hands of Bogart, he's  well played and very compelling.  Ida Lupino gives another one of her  intense performances as the girl who loves him and who herself is in need  of a break.  Joan Leslie plays a teenage girl that Bogart helps out and  falls in love with.  Leslie seems like an unlikely choice for Bogart to  love.  She's too young and there isn't any chemistry between them at all.   But for me, that's about the only real flaw in this film.  Director Raoul  Walsh blends a lot of elements together:  gangsters, bank caper, chase  scenes, love story, and drama at a very human level.  And he blends those  elements into an excellent movie.
