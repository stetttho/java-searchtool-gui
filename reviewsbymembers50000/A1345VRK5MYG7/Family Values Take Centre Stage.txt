 This episodic film tells the story of a Norwegian immigrant family living in San Francisco at the beginning of the twentieth century.  Irene Dunne gives a terrific performance as the title character who is the moral and emotional core of the family.  Various episodes in the family form the basis of the story, some humorous and some more sober.  It's great to see a family where values are important and everyone does their part.  Oscar Homolka as a frightening uncle and Ellen Corby as Mama's frightened sister standout in a strong supporting cast.  The film pays tribute to a wonderful mother, but it also plays tribute to the support that comes from the family unit.  It's nice to see this kind of story once in a while!
