 Barbara Stanwyck proves again why she was one of classic film's best, most versatile actresses in this comedy of a single magazine writer pretending to be the happy homemaker who must become the real thing when a war hero comes to stay with her and "her family" as part of a publicity stunt.  Dennis Morgan plays the hero, and he and Stanwyck share a warm, comfortable chemistry that adds much to the film.  It's a lot of fun watching Stanwyck trying to pull off the homemaking stunt, and it one of those films that's fun to watch each Christmas.
