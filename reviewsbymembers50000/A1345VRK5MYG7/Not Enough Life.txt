 Moulin Rouge traces the life of artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and his paintings of the famous French nightclub.  Jose Ferrer gives a strong, emotionally controlled performance as the crippled artist who is unable to accept love in his life.  A large part of the film centres on his relationship with a streetwalker tiringly overplayed by Colette Marchand.  Not a great deal of time is actually spent in the Moulin Rouge, which is unfortunate since it may have injected some needed life into the story.  The film left me cold.  Toulouse-Lautrec had a very difficult personality (at least as portrayed in this film), making him a hard character to relate to, and there wasn't enough spectacle or life in the story to at least hold on to.  I wish I could add to the raves about this film, but for me it was a very unsatisfying viewing experience.
