 It's been a few years since I saw Gilda, and I don't remember much of the plot, other than Glenn Ford has trouble with his boss because the boss' wife is Rita Hayworth, a former flame of Ford's.  You're not going to watch  this movie for the plot and the dialogue.  You're going to watch this movie  to see Rita.  Her performance as Gilda has got to be one of the sexiest  performances I have ever seen.  I can't think of an actress at work today  that could have done it better.  Her beauty and appeal are perfectly  showcased in her "striptease" to "Put The Blame on  Mame".  It's hard to believe that she only takes off one glove in the  number, because it has the same affect as if she took a lot more off!    Plot and dialogue?  Forget it.  Rita?  Wow!
