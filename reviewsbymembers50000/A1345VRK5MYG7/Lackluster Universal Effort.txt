 Jon Hall wants revenge on the couple that have swindled him out of a fortune.  He not only expects to take over their estate, but he also expects their daughter's hand in marriage as well.  He stumbles upon a doctor experimenting with invisibility, and uses this weapon to get what he wants.  This film had some potential, but much of it is wasted.  Jon Hall isn't much of an actor (not that the role required him to be), so he isn't very compelling.  Evelyn Ankers, the scream queen, is given very little to do here, appearing in just a few throw away scenes.  The great Gale Sondergaard, a great presence in many movies, shows up in the first third of the film, then disappears (suffering from nerves, it is explained in the story).  John Carradine is fun as the scientist, the only somewhat memorable character.  The back story of the plot is confusing, leaving me with more questions than answers, and the direction is choppy.  There are a few good special effects, but that's not enough to compensate for the rest of the film.  I usually like these Universal horror films, but this one need a complete overhaul before it was even filmed.
