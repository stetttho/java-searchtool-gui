 There's something about Laura, that once you see it, you want to add it to your collection of classic films.  There's murder, jealousy, obsession, and love, all wrapped up in 85 minutes of classic movie magic.  Dana Andrews  stars as a tough as nails detective who finds himself falling in love and  obsessing about a murder victim that he knows only through the memories of  others and from a portrait hanging in her apartment.  Clifton Webb, as the  unforgettable Waldo Lydecker, is the man who shares the memories of Laura.   Webb is perfect in the role, and expertly delivers the best lines in the  movie.  Vincent Price and Judith Anderson are both very good as Laura's  fiance and aunt, and as suspects in her murder.  And a painfully beautiful  Gene Tierney is Laura, the woman that men can't help but want.  There's a  haunted quality to the film in the way it is shot, using shadows and  darkness to excellent effect, plus an unforgettable score that is used  repeatedly to great effect.  The screenplay is full of great lines and the  characters may not be people you'd like to meet in real life, but they are  fascinating to watch.  This is a must-see for film fans.
