 The Searchers is probably one of the most analyzed Westerns ever made, so I'm not going to attempt to look at its deeper meaning.  From a purely entertainment point of view, the movie works very well.  John Wayne is  excellent as the tough, driven uncle of Natalie Wood, who goes on a 5 year  quest to find her after her family is murdered and she is kidnapped by  Indians.  Two things about this film standout for me.  One thing is the  relentless pursuit by Wayne and the way one man, for whatever his motives,  refuses to give up or move on without getting what he is after.  The other  standout is the photography.  This must be one of the most beautifully  filmed movies of all time.  The colour and scenery are breathtaking.  Some  of the dialogue and acting (especially Jeffrey Hunter) are stilted and  unbelievable, but they do not interfere in the enjoyment of the movie.   Anyone in "search" of a great, classic Western should be sure to  view this movie.
