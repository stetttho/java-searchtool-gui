 This is another gangster classic from James Cagney, and it has a number of scenes that rank up there with the best he ever did.  His character, Cody Jarrett, is a violent, heartless thug who trusts no one except his "Ma", and shows no mercy.  Jarrett is on the run from the law  after leading the robbery of a train.  His wife, well played by Virginia  Mayo, is afraid of him and only stays with him for what he can give her and  for fear of what he might do to her if she were to try and leave.  His gang  also fears him.  He only has his "Ma" looking out for him, and he  loves her a little too much.  She's played by Margaret Wycherly in a  memorable performance.  But it's Cagney (as usual) who steals the film,  from the famous scene of losing his grip in the cafeteria, to the even more  famous and chilling final scene.  He's older in this film, but even tougher  than in his younger days. The story never loses interest, with Raoul  Walsh's direction delivering all the punches.  This film has a different  feel than Cagney's other gangster films from the Thirties, so if you think  you've seen enough of him in this type of role, give this film a look  anyways.  It might surprise you.
