 Paul Muni stars in another one of his famous biographical roles, this time as scientist Louis Pasteur.  Pasteur became famous for his involvement, in among other things, demanding that doctors sterilize their instruments and wash their hands, in finding a vaccine for anthrax, and developing a treatment for rabies.  In this film, we see how Pasteur struggled not only with the science behind these issues, but also with the medical establishment that did not want to give credit to a mere scientist.  Muni is very good in the title role, impatient, demanding, wise, and impassioned at various moments.  The screenplay manages to take a topic that could have easily been made boring (a scientist staring into a microscope looking for germs) and makes it great entertainment instead.
