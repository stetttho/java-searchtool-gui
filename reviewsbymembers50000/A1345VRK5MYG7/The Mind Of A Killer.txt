 Robert Montgomery stars as the superficially charming page boy who insinuates his way into the life and home of wealthy invalid May Whitty.  Whitty isn't particularly sick, but she seems to enjoy making everyone around her miserable, especially her niece played by Rosalind Russell.  She takes a liking to Montgomery, unaware what the viewer and Russell have figured out - he's the murderer of a local woman.  I'm not giving away the ending, since it's made clear as the story progresses.  It's not the point of the film.  What this movie does want to do is take you into the mind of a murderer, and given the fact that this was made in the 1930's, it's a pretty surprising approach.  And oddly enough, it's quite suspenseful, since we wait to see what he will do next.  Montgomery is very effective as the psychopath, charm and humour masking something quite dark inside himself.  May Whitty also delivers a terrific performance as the cantankerous woman longing for the attention of a son she doesn't really have.  Russell is OK in her characterization.  Unfortunately, her character is poorly defined and her motives are often unclear, so there's something about her that doesn't add up.  The film has a number of suspenseful moments, and although it's not a completely successful portrait of a killer, I did enjoy it and think it is certainly worth watching.
