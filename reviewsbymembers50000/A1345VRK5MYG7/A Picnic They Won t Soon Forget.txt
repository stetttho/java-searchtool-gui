 It's Labour Day weekend in a small midwestern town, and drifter William Holden rides the rails in, looking to get a job from college buddy Cliff Robertson. He meets Robertson's girlfriend Kim Novak, her younger sister Susan Strasberg, their mother Betty Field, old maid schoolteacher Rosalind Russell, and Russell's boyfriend Arthur O'Connell.  His appearance sets the stage for a Labour Day picnic they all won't soon forget, as the handsome drifter stirs the women up.  Holden is a little old for the role, but does such a great job of infusing the character with desperation, charm, and painful honesty that his age is hardly a liability.  Novak is good as the beautiful girl who wants to be known for more than just her beauty.  She doesn't bring much depth to the character, but she and Holden have an excellent chemistry on screen together.  The supporting cast is uniformly great.  Russell pulls out all the stops as the frustrated and pathetically desperate teacher, while O'Connell is laid back and a perfect counter-punch to her histrionics.  It's the kind of a story that almost everyone can find something to relate to - if you've ever felt trapped in your life, or been unsatisfied with where your life has gone, or had dreams for something more.  It's well written, well acted, and well worth watching.
