 This classy adaptation of Jane Austen's novel stars Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet as the Dashwood sisters.  Left out of their father's inheritance, they must rely on finding suitable marriages.  Thompson is the reserved one who feels things deeply, but masks her emotions, while Winslet is the passionate one with the more lively personality.  Both become involved in complicated relationships with men, each pursuing love in their own ways.  Both actresses are terrific in their roles.  Thompson is a particular standout, and the scene at the end when her true emotions surface is a great moment.  The supporting cast of English actors all add greatly to the atmosphere and quality of the film.  Thompson is also the writer, and she incorporates humour and a real grasp of the characters' inner feelings.  The sets and costumes are all perfectly rendered as well.  But what I enjoyed most was how the film communicated what the characters weren't saying.  I appreciate not having everything spelled out for me.
