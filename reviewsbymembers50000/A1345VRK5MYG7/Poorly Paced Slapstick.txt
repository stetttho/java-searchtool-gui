 Although Warner Brothers studio was famous for many film genres in the 1930s and 1940s, comedy was not one of them.  They didn't have any great comedy actors on their roster, so Joe E. Brown was their comedy "star" in a series of B-films.  If you like your comedy played very broadly, you might find him funny.  Personally, I don't see the appeal.  In this film, he stars as a "natural born salesman" trying to sell earthworm tractors to lumberyard owner Guy Kibbee, who does not want any new-fangled machinery.  At first, he does so to try and impress his old girlfriend, but in the end he is trying to impress his new girlfriend, Kibbee's daughter June Travis.  There's much slapstick with his misadventures with the tractors, and most of it goes on for far too long.  Director Ray Enright poorly paces the film, letting jokes drag on and on well past the point of being funny.  The acting is weak and obvious, although Travis does display some talent.  Mercifully, the film is short, and there are a couple of moments that made me grin (such as when he is repeatedly tossed out the door), but a couple of moments is hardly enough for a whole film.
