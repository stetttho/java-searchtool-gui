 The Rains Came is an early example of the disaster films popular in the 70s, and unfortunately, like those films, this movie is long on special effects and short on story.  Myrna Loy plays a woman with a "bad"  past who falls in love with an Indian doctor played by Tyrone Power.   George Brent stars as one of Loy's former boyfriends, who has romantic  problems with a young girl (Brenda Joyce) who basically wants to get out of  her parents' home.  In the midst of all this, an earthquake hits Ranchipur  and causes a spectacular flood, perhaps the only really interesting thing  that happens in the film.  Loy and Brent look bored and give bland  performances.  Power manages to deliver a performance that has more life in  it.  The special effects are good during the flood, although it appears  that they simply shook the camera to get the earthquake effect!   The story  is trite and the movie is poorly paced.  This was a real disappointment to  me.
