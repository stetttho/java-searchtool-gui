 Loretta Young stars as a young Swedish farm girl who goes into the big city and ends up as a maid for an important political family (Joseph Cotten and Ethel Barrymore).  She has opinions herself, and wouldn't you know it,  she winds up running for Congress herself.  This is one of Young's most  famous films, and the movie contains some of my favourite actors from the  Forties (Cotten, Barrymore, and Charles Bickford as the family's butler).  This is an easy, warm comedy that benefits from the expert performances of  the entire cast.
