 In this lesser-known Errol Flynn action vehicle, he stars as Canadian Mountie Steve Wagner who tangles with Nazis on a mission in Canada to bomb an important canal.  Since Flynn's character is the son of German parents, he works undercover with his sympathies being questioned by both sides.  The set up scenes for Flynn's undercover work are weakly written and directed, but once he goes on his mission the story begins to pick up, with some good action scenes and moments of conflict.  Oddly enough, Flynn isn't much of a presence in this film, going through the motions more than acting.  Julie Bishop as his fiancee is hardly one of his best leading ladies, while Helmut Dantine as the Nazi leader is good in a role the actor had to play in many films throughout WWII.  I'm not sure where the movie was actually filmed, but a lot of it appears to have been on soundstages, which is unfortunate, since the tough, bitterly cold northern Canadian landscape would have added a dimension of reality to an otherwise unrealistic story.  Certainly, despite its shortcomings, the film is an interesting one to watch, but fans of Flynn will not count it among the best of his work at Warner Brothers.
