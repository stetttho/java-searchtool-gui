 Set in World War II, Errol Flynn stars as a French thief saved from the guillotine by a British air raid.  Captured later by famed police inspector Paul Lukas, they end up in a small French town where 100 civilians have been captured by the Nazis to be used as hostages until a bridge saboteur turns himself in.  Flynn, facing imminent death for his crimes, decides to be a hero and confess to sabotaging the bridge, thus freeing the 100 captured men.  But confessing to a crime he didn't commit proves to be more difficult than expected. If the story sounds far-fetched, it is, and the film doesn't make it seem anymore plausible.  There are a lot of big loopholes in the screenplay, not to mention that the main character does not make sense, being inconsistently written and acted by a tired looking Flynn.  The supporting cast of Lukas, Jean Sullivan as the village girl he loves, and Lucile Watson as her employer, do what they can with such poor material. Director Raoul Walsh usually does a great job of pacing his films and providing enough action and character development to keep viewers engaged.  But not this time.  There's very little in the way of action or tension, and Flynn's character is hard to figure out or to like.  This is easily one of Flynn's weakest Warner Bros vehicles.
