 It's probably been fifteen years since I saw this film, and despite the time that has passed, I still hear Raymond Massey's voice whenever I think of Lincoln or read his words such as the Gettysburg Address.  That's how  definitive and on-the-mark his performance is.  I've seen a number of other  actors play the great man, but Massey captured him better than any one  else.  Apart from the title performance, I have to say that the movie  involved me much more than I was expecting.  It gave me a good feel for his  life and character, and it's one of the better biographies I have seen.   Watch this film.
