 James Cagney and Joan Blondell star as a couple of scam artists who work out detailed schemes to get money out of innocent (and not-so-innocent) people.  It's Cagney's idea (of course) to get into this, and Blondell goes along because she falls in love with him.  Before long, they're swindling swindlers and getting mixed up with people even shadier than them.  A lot of the film is lighthearted and played for laughs, although it does have its dramatic moments.  The con games they are involved in are a lot of fun to watch unfold, and as a pre-Code film, there are some interesting scenes, dialogue, and innuendo.  Cagney and Blondell are a great team together.  His talents are, of course, legendary, but Blondell is not as well known to audiences today.  She's terrific in the film, leveling wisecracks with the best of them, yet quietly effective in the more serious scenes.  The movie moves along quickly with lots of snappy dialogue (it is a Warner Brothers film afterall), and the two stars make it memorable.  Oh, and for the record - I don't think I've ever seen another film where so many people get slapped in the face!!
