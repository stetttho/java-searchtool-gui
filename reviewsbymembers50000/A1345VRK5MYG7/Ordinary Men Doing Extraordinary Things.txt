 Gregory Peck stars as a general sent in to replace Gary Merrill, another general of a failing daylight bombing group.  Merrill has become too close to his men, clouding his judgment and allowing the men to view themselves as the "hard luck" squad.  Peck decides to take a very different approach.  He plays it tough, wants everyone whipped into shape, expects nothing but the best, and hopes that by eventually restoring a sense of pride after some successful missions, the men will come around.  Needless to say, the men resent him and his approach, transfer requests pour in, and it becomes questionable whether Peck's strategy can work.  Peck is outstanding as the general, a perfect choice for the role.  Merrill and Hugh Marlowe both give unusually strong performances, and Dean Jagger as a Major working in the office, delivers a subtle, humourous, and very intelligent performance that helps to anchor the film for the viewer.  Although there are some good action sequences, this film isn't about the action of the War.  It's about leadership and building pride, and it could apply to any organization. It also shows what an unreal thing war is, and what it does to the men involved.  Twelve O'Clock High is an outstanding war film, not because of the rah-rah heroics, but because of it's honest and real approach to the men whose lives are being put on the line.  Ordinary men are called upon to do extraordinary things.
