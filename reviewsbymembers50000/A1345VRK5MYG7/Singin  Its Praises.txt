 There are a lot of reasons why I would recommend watching this film:  1. The title song sequence is one of the most joyful moments in movies I have ever seen.  2.  All of the accurate and funny details surrounding the problems encountered when films changed from silent to sound.  3.  The excellent performances by co-stars Donald O'Connor and especially Jean Hagen.  4.  The humour and unbelievable energy that drives the film.  5.  The fact that I don't like musicals, but actually think this is a terrific movie.  Watch this film!
