 William Holden plays a director who wants to bring a has-been back to the stage, since the roll requires someone who can sing and act, and a washed-up Bing Crosby seems to fit the bill.  Plagued by alcoholism and insecurities, Crosby seems like an unwise choice to most, but Holden sticks by him.  Conflict arises between Holden and Crosby's suffering wife, Grace Kelly, mostly because Crosby has set them up for it, rather than admitting his weaknesses.  Crosby is miles away from the kind of roles we expect to see him in, delivering an excellent performance that shows the talent he had.  A dowdy (for most of the film, anyways) Kelly is very strong here, scoring in a big way in a role that is also miles away from what we would expect of her.  Although not the most exciting film I've seen, and I do wish that more had been done to show the rehearsals and other aspects of making a Broadway show, the conflicts that develop between the triangle of main characters are very well written and acted.  It once again proves that there is no replacing strong characters and writing.  They elevate a movie like this one.
