 Julia Roberts stars as a law student who writes a brief about the murder of two Supreme Court justices, and through a series of connections, the brief ends up in the hands of the FBI and the White House.  Her conclusions are far-fetched but plausible, and as people connected to her and the case start dying, it's obvious she has stumbled onto something.  She goes on a run for her life, aided by Washington journalist Denzel Washington, who thinks she's on the right track.  Roberts and Washington are very effective in the leads, underplaying their roles and allowing the suspense and plot to drive the film.  The supporting cast has a lot of big names, each one solid, from Robert Culp's goofy president to Sam Sheperd's alcoholic law professor.  The truth and the contents of the Pelican Brief are gradually revealed to the audience, keeping the viewer's interest, and although the film is long, there is enough chasing and intrigue to sustain it.  Only at the very end, after the climax, does the film really lose steam.  Most of the last ten minutes should have been cut or rewritten.  The direction by Alan J. Pakula is competent, if not spectacular, and even though I have enjoyed other Grisham films more, I would recommend this for a good evening's entertainment.
