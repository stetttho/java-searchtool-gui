 This fictionalized account of the real life disaster takes a while to get going, but does deliver some good scenes in the final third of the film.  George C. Scott is a Nazi colonel sent aboard the Hindenburg due to threats made about its voyage.  He is joined by a cast of familiar actors, including Anne Bancroft as a bitter German countess.  As was typical with disaster films of the Seventies, there are several small stories involving the various passengers, but none of them are particularly interesting.  I found the set up scenes for the bombing plotline confusing to follow.  The film's strength is the terrific set pieces for the Hindenburg and its final thirty minutes.  The actual explosion doesn't feature the level of special effects we're used to seeing, but since it combines real footage of the disaster, it made a strong impact on me.  By no means a great film, The Hindenburg is salvaged by its final moments and by the audience's knowledge that it really did happen, although perhaps not for the reasons presented in the movie.
