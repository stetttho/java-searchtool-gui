 It's not hard to see how Elizabeth Taylor became such a big star when you see her as Velvet Brown in National Velvet, her first important role. Besides already being very pretty, she is endearing as the young girl who  dreams of her horse winning the Grand National Steeplechase, discovering  that she herself may have to be the jockey.  The rest of the cast are  terrific, with special praise for the understated performance by Anne  Revere as Velvet's wise and understanding mother. The sequences at the race  are well filmed, the Technicolor beautiful, and the story hits all the  right notes.  Children, especially young girls who love horses, will enjoy  the film a lot.
