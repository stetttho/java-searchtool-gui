 A woman steals her sister's husband, drives him to his ruin, divides her family, and nearly destroys the life of a young man in a film directed surprisingly by John Huston.  Bette Davis, at her most unsubtle, is the selfish Stanley, a woman bent on having fun and getting what she wants at the expense of all around her.  Olivia de Havilland is her level-headed sister Roy, who loses the most at the hands of her sister.  George Brent and Dennis Morgan are the men in their lives, although neither actor makes a particularly strong impression.  The supporting cast of welcome character actors like Charles Coburn, Billie Burke, Lee Patrick, and Hattie McDaniel contribute their usual expert performances.  But it's hard to get noticed in a film where Davis cuts loose even more than usual, her famous eyes afire as she plays the bad girl to the hilt and then some, in an endless state of agitation and drama.  However, give credit to de Havilland, underplaying her character and keeping the film rooted, matching her co-star with a strong performance that displays her skill, especially when she is simply reacting to her sister's devious nature.  The film is very melodramatic, and some of the dialogue is pretty stilted.  But it's never boring.  What's also fascinating is the portrayal of the family's maid's son, a young black man helped by de Havilland who wants to be a lawyer.  He's presented as intelligent, ambitious, and very decent.  He must have been one of the first positive black characters to be featured in a major film and it's great to see it.  Equally fascinating is the almost incestuous relationship between Davis and her uncle Coburn.  Not much is done to hide the sexual overtones in Coburn's doting.  In This Our Life is a memorable melodrama aided by the performances of its lead actresses and its unusual themes.
