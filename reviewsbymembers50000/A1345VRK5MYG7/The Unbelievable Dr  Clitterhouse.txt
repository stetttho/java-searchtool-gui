 Edward G. Robinson stars as Dr. Clitterhouse, a man fascinated by criminals and what makes them tick.  In the name of science, he pulls of a series of heists, observing his accomplices in action and then later  checking their vital signs, etc to determine the effect that crime has on  men.  A suspicious Humphrey Bogart leads the accomplices, while Claire  Trevor as the fence, and Gale Page as his nurse, are the women who worry  about him.  The story is pretty unbelievable but it maintains interest, and  the performers are good, especially Robinson.  It's not a bad movie, but  it's not likely the film that you'll remember Robinson, Bogart, or Trevor  for.
