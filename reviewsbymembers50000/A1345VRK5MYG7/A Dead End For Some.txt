 Dead End is set in a 1930's New York City neighbourhood where the upper class live in buildings right across the street from the lower class slums.  It's a bizarre juxtaposition, since each side can see how the others live.   The story focuses on the lives of some of those who live there, focusing  more on the poor.  Sylvia Sidney stars as a young woman on strike, trying  to support her kid brother Billy Halop, who has become a member of the  neighbourhood gang (the Dead End Kids).  Joel McCrea is the idealistic  architect she has loved since childhood.  But he's infatuated with Wendy  Barrie, a formerly poor girl who now lives across the street.  Into this  neighbourhood walks Humphrey Bogart, who used to live there, but has now  moved on to bigger things like a career in crime.  All of their stories  intertwine to give an honest, if not very happy picture of the human  condition.  All of the actors are very good, including Claire Trevor as  Bogart's former flame, who since he left the neighbourhood, has fallen on  hard times.  The Dead End Kids get too much screen time, but the story  moves along well.  It's not the kind of story you expect William Wyler to  direct, but he does so with his usual class, successfully juggling several  story lines at once.  The message of the movie is pretty obvious.  Although  the neighbourhood is at the end of a dead end street, the lives of some of  the people are at a dead end, even those like Bogart, who have found a way  out.  Some may make it, many won't.
