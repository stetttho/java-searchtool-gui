 This Hemingway tale is set in Italy during WWI.  Gary Cooper plays an American working as an ambulance driver in the Italian Army, while Helen Hayes is a British nurse.  They meet under strange circumstances, fall in love, and develop an intense relationship.  But the war and various complications, most of them supplied by Cooper's Italian surgeon friend Adolphe Menjou, create problems in their relationship.  Both leads are quite good, with particular praise going to Helen Hayes as the outspoken nurse.  Menjou is also interesting as the friend who doesn't think love can be found in the war.  I've read that the photography of the film is beautiful, but the print I've seen (like many of the ones out there of this film) was quite dark, occasionally making it difficult to see the action.  But the film is well made, and the ending of the movie is well played and mounted, and will stick in your mind after it is over.
