 I watched this film as a fan of William Wyler and because I had read the Bronte novel in university.  I also knew it was one of the legendary classic films to come out of Hollywood.  Some people seem to object to this film because it only covers the first half of the novel.  From my point of view, that was a wise choice because I found the second half of the novel to be a let down compared to the intensity and feeling of the first half.  Laurence Olivier perfectly embodies the loving and cruel sides of Heathcliff's complicated personality, while Merle Oberon, never much of an actress, brings a lot of feeling and beauty to Cathy.  The supporting cast is excellent, as Wyler (yet again) gets top performances from everyone.  The haunting quality of the novel is captured in the film, and it's easy to see why Heathcliff and Cathy have become two of the most legendary lovers of all time.  And coming from me, not a fan of romance movies, that says a lot.
