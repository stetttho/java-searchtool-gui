 It seems Bette Davis' character is having splitting headaches and double vision, and long before her character figures it out, the audience knows what's happening and where the story is going.  Yet as morbid as a story about a brain tumour should be, this film isn't.  In fact, it gets stronger as it goes along, with a very moving ending that ranks up there with the best. I found some of the dialogue to be heavy handed, and the pacing of the film isn't the best.  But the film succeeds in spite of that. Of course, much of the film's success belongs to Davis, who plays the character's crisis full throttle, from party girl to bitter victim to radiant fighter.  George Brent, as the doctor who tries to save her and falls in love with her, is ... well ... George Brent.  Never much of an actor, Brent probably gives one of his strongest performances here, although that is hardly a compliment.  Geraldine Fitzgerald as secretary and best friend comes off very well, while Ronald Reagan and especially Humphrey Bogart seem out of place and uncomfortable.  Fans of Davis and melodrama will definitely want to catch this one, and even if this type of story isn't what you like, there's no denying the power of the lead performance or the impact of the final ten minutes.
