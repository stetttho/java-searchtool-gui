 Robert Stack is a rich alcoholic married to down-to-earth Lauren Bacall, while his sister Dorothy Malone is trying to get his best friend and rock (pun intended) Rock Hudson, who is actually in love with Bacall. Toss in a small town, a big house, lots of great costumes and campy dialogue, and what you get is one of the most memorable and memorably ridiculous melodramas to come out of Hollywood.  Some might describe the film as lurid, and it is, but give director Douglas Sirk credit for not holding back and throwing everything into it.  Hudson and Bacall are noble and bland, while Stack and Malone light up the screen with their overheated, charged performances as the alcoholic and nymphomaniac who couldn't get Daddy's love or respect and are wasting their rich lives.  The script has some great lines, and a number of fun scenes, including the opening credit sequence, as well as Malone's frenzied dance in her bedroom while other dramatic things are happening at the same time, all to the shaking music.  Subtle is ain't, but it's all made and played with such relish that it's hard not to enjoy it.
