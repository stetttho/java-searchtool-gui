 Cary Grant stars as Dr. Noah Praetorius, a gifted physician who believes that his patients' emotional and spiritual states are critical to their overcoming physical challenges.  There's a lot of mystery surrounding Grant's past, and Grant plays the character with such an even balance it adds to the mystery.  He's given a lot of preachy speeches to deliver, some of which work and some of which don't, but Grant makes the character believable.  Jeanne Crain is less successful as the young woman that Grant saves.  She never zeroes in on her character's personality, although that may be, in part, a fault of the script.  The rest of the cast does well, including Finlay Currie as Grant's mysterious, quiet manservant and shadow.  The film left me with an odd feeling.  I felt I was being preached to, but I did enjoy learning about the puzzle that was Grant's past and the role that Currie played in it.  This is an unusual film, difficult to describe, that will fascinate some and frustrate others.  It did both for me.
