 Ann Dvorak stars as Molly Louvain, a woman who aspires to a better life and doesn't want to turn out like the mother who abandoned her.  However, she attracts all the men she meets, and in the space of seventy minutes, she goes through four of them!  One of them is particularly bad news, leaving her on the run from the police, and another leaves her a single mother.  Like most Warner Brothers films from this time period, it's a tough little film.  Ann Dvorak is good as Molly, although it's hard to feel sorry for a character that makes so many bad choices.  Lee Tracy has a lot of charisma as man #4, perhaps the only man that really understands her.  The film is well directed by Michael Curtiz, and it has some great dialogue.  But it's not the kind of film that really involves you, since none of the characters evoke enough sympathy (except Molly right at the end).  It was probably cutting edge in its day, with its depiction of an unwed mother, but it doesn't have the same kind of impact today.
