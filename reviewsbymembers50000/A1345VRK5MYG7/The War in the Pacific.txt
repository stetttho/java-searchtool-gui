 In Harm's Way tells the story of America's naval involvement in the Pacific, beginning with a very effective, detailed presentation of the Pearl Harbor attack.  John Wayne stars as a Navy captain that is reinstated to lead the charge against the Japanese, and Kirk Douglas is his irresponsible, self-destructive commander.  Both stars give solid performances, as does Patricia Neal as the nurse that falls for Wayne.  They have a very believable relationship that is a highlight of the film.  The supporting cast is incredible, and although there are a few too many threads in the story that sometimes distract from what is going on, it never gets boring or loses course.  This is the kind of big filmmaking we don't see enough of these days, with a story and stars that are larger than life, combined with drama, action, and humanity.
