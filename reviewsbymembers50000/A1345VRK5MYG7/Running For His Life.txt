 Dustin Hoffman stars as a serious student, plagued by his father's suicide brought on by the communist witch hunts, whose brother is mixed up with corrupt goverment officials and Nazis.  When his brother is murdered, they come after him, assuming his brother has shared some key information with him.  The movie starts off with a bang, and the rest of the film is punctuated with several scenes filled with action and tension.  Those scenes are well done (including a famous torture scene you won't forget).  However, the scenes linking the action stretches are less successful, presenting ill-defined characters and moments where it appears something was left on the cutting room floor.  The actors are all good, with Hoffman intense as usual, and Roy Scheider as the brother and Laurence Olivier as the Nazi dentist excellent in support.  The movie certainly kept my interest, despite the awkward "between" moments, and director John Schlesinger knows how to keep the intensity and tension high when it counts.  The Marathon Man is certainly worth a look.
