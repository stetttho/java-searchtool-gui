 Gregory Peck is solid as the frustrated commander of troops that are being ordered to take a hill controlled by the enemy during the closing days of the Korean War.  Peck and his men know that a truce is being negotiated and that in the end, the battle may be for nothing.  Miscommunication during the battle adds to their obstacles, as does political manouvering.  There is also the propaganda broadcast by the Chinese at the Americans, a facet of this film I found especially memorable as I imagined it's effect on the soldiers.  There are a lot of recognizable faces in the cast, long before they were stars, but that does not distract from the action.  I found the movie to be slow in parts and the story required a better pacing and dramatic structure, but it's very accurate in portraying the honest emotions of the men caught between duty and their hearts.  This is not a "pretty" war movie, with beautiful photography and attractive locations.  It gives you a feeling of the hell that war must be, especially with a battle such as Pork Chop Hill.
