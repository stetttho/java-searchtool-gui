 It's hard to imagine Marlene Dietrich starring in a Western, but oddly enough it works - and it works well.  James Stewart stars as Tom Destry, the son of a famous lawman, who is brought into an out of control town to  restore law and order.  One look at the tall, gangling boy scout has  everyone laughing at the folly of it.  Among those laughing is tough saloon  singer Dietrich, who's opinion of him soon changes.  Destry Rides Again  mixes comedy with typical Western action, and does so to good effect.  Both  Stewart and Dietrich are great in tailor-made roles.  Dietrich is famous  for singing the "Boys in the Backroom" song, and I must confess I  don't understand why her singing is so well remembered, other than to  politely say that it is certainly unique.  Mischa Auer is very funny in a  supporting role as one of Stewart's sidekicks, and Dietrich has a well  staged and memorable cat fight with Una Merkel that is a highlight of the  film.  Fans of the stars or the Western genre will want to check this film  out, since it is unusual, well made, and a real classic.
