 Monty Woolley stars as Sheridan Whiteside, a critic with a gift for insults and getting his way, who falls on the porch of the home of a family eager to meet him.  He must stay with them while he recuperates, and they  discover that having him around isn't the honour they thought it would be  as he turns their house and life upside down.  Bette Davis stars as his  patient assistant who falls in love with a local would-be playwright, and  Ann Sheridan stars as a two-faced actress in search of a good role.  The  performances are all excellent.  Woolley blusters and puts down everyone  with great style (especially his nurse, Mary Wickes), and Davis is  excellent in a straight role that helps to keep the film from becoming too  much of a farce and gives it some heart.  The dialogue and one-liners are  terrific, and the whole movie reminds you of what movie comedies used to be  like.
