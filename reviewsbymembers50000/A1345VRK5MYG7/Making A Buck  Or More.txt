 The first hour or so of this film sets up the plot.  Dick Powell is hired by wealthy but cheap Alice Brady to chaperone...  It seems like everyone is out to make or save a buck in this film, often with comedic results.  But this film isn't famous for the plot.  It's the musical numbers that make up the last third of the film that you will remember.  There's one involving a huge number of showgirls playing pianos that revolve and move around the stage exactly like you would expect in a Busby Berkelely musical.  The second number is for the famous song "Lullaby of Broadway", which Berkeley presents with great drama, pushing back all the boundaries.  As a rule, I don't much like musicals, but the sheer visual imagination of these numbers kept my attention.  There's nothing else like them.  As for the actors, they do what they did so well in so many of the Warner Brothers' musicals and comedies of the Thirties.  Forget the ridiculous plot and concentrate on the spectacle and professionalism of all involved.
