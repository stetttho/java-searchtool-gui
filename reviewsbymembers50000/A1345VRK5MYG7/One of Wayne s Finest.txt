 John Wayne probably gives the finest performance I've seen him give so far in this story of a Calvary officer, just days before his retirement, who goes on one last assignment.  He's accompanied by fellow officer Victor McLaglen who's very funny in a broad way, as well as two stiffly acted young lovers, a subplot that doesn't take too much away from the overall film (fortunately).  Wayne has to rely a lot less on heroics in this performance, and instead concentrate on characterization, which he does with much success.  He brings depth and a bittersweet quality to his character in a way that might surprise some.  With a beautifully photographed backdrop framing each scene, this John Ford feature is sure to please fans of Wayne and Westerns alike.
