 Barbara Stanwyck stars as a hard-as-nails newspaper/radio columnist who will ruin the career of anyone she deems worthy of it.  Her latest victim is Clark Gable, a race car driver she perceives as having no conscience since he has been involved in several accidents.  Not surprisingly, once she meets him she falls in love, but can't get past his ruthless nature.  Their relationship is not very believable, and the scene  where Gable slaps Stanwyck is a real howler.  When the film concentrates on the racing, it has some good energy.  But the love story is badly done.  Fans of the stars would be better off checking out some of their other films.
