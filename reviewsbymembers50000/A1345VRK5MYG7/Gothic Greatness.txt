 From the opening shots and line about dreaming of a visit to Manderly again, to the final shots of Mrs. Danvers and the flames, Alfred Hitchcock creates a dark, eerie atmosphere that will remain with the viewer every  time you see the film. Although Rebecca is never seen, her presence is felt  throughout the entire movie.  Laurence Olivier, as the late Rebecca's  tortured husband is good, although I think his moods and personal torture  are played too strongly.  Joan Fontaine, never an actress I have especially  admired, is surprisingly excellent as Olivier's new, unnamed, naive wife,  thrust into a world she is unprepared to deal with.  But the greatest  performance of the film belongs to Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers,  Rebecca's housekeeper, and consequently, Fontaine's nemesis.  With her  daunting profile and posture, and her chilling delivery of lines, she  creates one of the most memorable film characters I have ever seen.  With  its winding plot, terrific performances, and the direction of Alfred  Hitchcock creating tension and atmosphere on a Gothic scale, Rebecca is one  of the greater suspense films I have ever seen.
