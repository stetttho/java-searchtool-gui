 Humphrey Bogart stars as a former newspaper columnist who partners up with crooked fight manager/promoter Rod Steiger to act as a P.R. man for a South American fighter.  "Toro" has impressive size, but little else going for him, and all of his fights have to be fixed for him to win.  Bogart's wife Jan Sterling puts pressure on him to get out of the crooked business, and Bogart's own conscience weighs heavily on him.  The Harder They Fall is not a glamourous look at the sport of boxing.  It's tough and (pardon the pun) pulls no punches as it exposes the racket behind the sport.  I was surprised by how tough the approach was, although I found the ending to be a bit of a letdown and not matching the rest of the film.  Bogart is appropriately cynical and world weary, while Steiger shines in his performance as the man manipulating all.  This film isn't going to leave you with a positive impression of sports promotion, but you will be impressed by its honest, realistic depiction of the game in and out of the ring.  It makes you wonder if things have changed at all in the last fifty years.
