 Robert Williams plays a reporter with a comeback for everything that marries wealthy Jean Harlow, and unfortunately, her family as well.  Left behind is the simple girl who really loves him, fellow reporter Loretta  Young.  Since Williams doesn't fit into Harlow's world, and Harlow doesn't  fit into his world, many complications arise as the upper class meet the  common folk.  Young, despite top billing, has little to do in the film  except look good, which she does with her usual style.  Harlow is a bit  stiff, but has some good moments.  Halliwell Hobbes, as the family butler,  has some great moments and provides some good laughs.  But surprisingly,  the real star is Robert Williams, an actor I've never heard of until this  film.  He has a smart screen presence, and plays his part with a lot of  charm and ease.  He has some excellent scenes with Harlow.  The film has  some funny moments mixed in with romance and drama, and it plays out the  class distinctions well.  Catch this Jean Harlow/Loretta Young film for its  real star, Robert Williams.
