 Joseph Cotten stars as a struggling artist trying to find the passion and inspiration to bring his art to life.  A chance encounter in a park with a young girl named Jennie begins to spark his work, and their infrequent meetings afterwards fuel his creativity and feelings.  Oddly, she seems to come from an earlier time and each occasion he meets her, she ages more than the time that has passed.  He slowly pieces together the mystery of who she really is. Cotten gives one of his best performances in this ethereal story.  He's very convincing as the artist whose muse and love may very well be some sort of ghost.  Jennifer Jones stars as the title character, and despite being given some heavy-handed dialogue, makes the character of Jennie quite believable at all stages of her life.  The supporting cast is excellent, with particular praise going to a well cast Ethel Barrymore as the gallery owner who takes Cotten under her wing.  She brings a weary, sad quality that matches the film perfectly. The photography of the film is remarkable, having the quality of a painting throughout, with the last ten minutes very effectively filmed in Technicolor.  The music also adds the other-worldly quality that permeates the movie. The opening "lecture" of the film, however, is awkwardly done, hurt by some of the overbaked writing that occasionally plagues the dialogue.  But the rest of the film succeeds admirably, creating a mood and romantic feeling that sustains the unusual story.  It's unlike any other film you will see from that era.
