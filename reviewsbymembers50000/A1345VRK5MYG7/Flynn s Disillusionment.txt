 Errol Flynn stars as an unfairly disgraced Union officer who decides to look out for number one in post-Civil War America.  He quickly builds a financial empire, methodically taking over Silver City, a town dependant on its silver mines.  Of course, a lot of people have to pay for his ambition and ruthlessness, and in the end, so must he. Flynn's performance is better than usual throughout most of the film, his own personal sense of disillusionment no doubt contributing.  Ann Sheridan, as the feisty woman he loves, is stronger in the first half of the film.  Thomas Mitchell, as the sermonizing lawyer, gets some great speeches which he plays for what they are worth. Unfortunately, the movie's moral message is laid on a bit heavy.  A little less talk and a little more action would have been an improvement.  Director Raoul Walsh is usually very good at mixing character development with action, but it doesn't come together here.  The actors and the director seem "tired" with this film, and the results show on the screen.  It's an average Western that probably could have been much more.
