 Errol Flynn stars as a successful business man with a secret.  Although the world thinks he's just an investment counselor, he is also a controversial best selling writer of mysteries using a pen name.  His interest in mysteries as he tries to solve a jewel robbery/murder case threatens to expose his double life. It's kind of odd to see Flynn in suits and modern clothing after years of watching him in period action pieces.  He does an acceptable job in the role, although the Texan accent he assumes in some scenes is really poor.  But the script never allows him or the rest of the cast to develop their characters - they're cut-outs going through the motions.  Flynn has little chemistry with Brenda Marshall as his wife, and Lee Patrick is badly miscast as a burlesque queen.  Even reliable Allen Jenkins, one of my favourite character actors, hardly makes an impression.  The film tries to be a comedy mystery, but the comedy is barely evident and the mystery hardly engrossing.  The set up of the film holds lots of promise.  But neither the director or the writers deliver on that promise.
