 Lost Horizon is a most unusual film.  Ronald Colman stars as a British diplomat whose plane is hijacked and later crashes in the mountains of Tibet.  He and his fellow passengers are rescued and brought to a land of paradise hidden and sheltered in a valley between the mountains.  This magical land is known as Shangri-La, a place where peace reigns, life is simple and perfect, people do not age, and natural beauty abounds.  Colman needs to decide if he can leave behind his old life and settle into his new life.  The performances are alright, although characterization isn't the focus of this film.  Dialogue isn't a real priority either, as lofty ideals and the meaning of life are discussed repeatedly.  The strength of this film is the atmosphere it creates, as the viewer actually comes to wish that a place such as Shangri-La really could exist.  The photography is excellent and director Frank Capra captures a feeling and mood that is quite remarkable.  The use of photographic stills to replace footage lost over the years does not interfere with the enjoyment of the movie.  There are a number of memorable shots and scenes and there's something about this film that makes it linger in your mind, long after it is over.
