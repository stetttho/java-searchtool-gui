 There is a magical romantic tone to The Ghost and Mrs. Muir that is different from most films you see.  Gene Tierney stars as a young widow who moves into a haunted house by the sea once owned by dead sea captain Rex Harrison.  Tierney is a stubborn woman and she won't leave, even after a few encounters with the rough seaman.  He quickly falls in love with her beauty and her spirit, and relents in his demands that she should leave.  What develops is an unlikely relationship between the real widow and the unreal captain.  Joseph Mankiewicz wrote and/or directed a lot of smart, mature films in the Forties and Fifties, and this is one of the best of them.  Harrison comes on strong as the captain, and plays the character with much charisma and bravado.  Tierney is as ethereal as ever, and brings out the independence and loneliness of her character very well.  The music and photography add to the mood, and touches of comedy compliment the story.  This romantic ghost story is the kind of movie that even people who don't like romances will end up liking a lot.
