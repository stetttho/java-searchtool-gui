 Julie Harris stars as Frankie, a 12 year old girl trying to figure out where she fits in.  Rejected by her peer group, she decides she will join her brother and his future bride on their honeymoon and go with them forever.  The family housekeeper, Bernice, played by Ethel Waters, tries to convince her otherwise, but Frankie is strong willed and won't be deterred.  Julie Harris gives an intense, painfully honest performance as the struggling adolescent, hitting all the emotional peaks and valleys with such feeling and truth.  As Frankie's pseudo-mother, Waters is equally impressive, delivering a charismatic, deeply felt performance that provides the film's emotional centre.  The film definitely betrays its stage origins, with a lot of dialogue and little change in scene or action.  The film is about characters and the human drama, and although it's hardly uplifting, anyone who can remember the feelings of their youth and wanting to fit in, will understand what it is trying to say.
