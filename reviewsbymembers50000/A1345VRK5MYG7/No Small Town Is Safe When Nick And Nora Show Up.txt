 Nick and Nora go to a small town to visit Nick's parents in this installment.  Of course, usually it's a quiet place where nothing exciting ever happens, but when the Charles show up, there's bound to be murder.  There's an extra dose of humour in this story compared to the others in the series and the film has a strong supporting cast that includes Lucile Watson and Harry Davenport as the parents, Gloria DeHaven as a drama queen, Leon Ames as a mysterious art collector, and best of all, Anne Revere as the town's crazy woman.  William Powell and Myrna Loy do their customary good job as the leads.  The mystery was interesting, with some good twists, and other than needing a little tightening up in a few places, the film moves along well.  Mystery fans will enjoy this entry.
