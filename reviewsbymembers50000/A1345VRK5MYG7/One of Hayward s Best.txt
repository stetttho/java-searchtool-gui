 Susan Hayward stars in this biography of Lillian Roth, a talented singer pushed into the spotlight by her stage mother, and when she is unable to deal with her insecurities and the tragedies in her life, she turns to alcohol.  It's one of those roles that every actress must dream of getting, and Hayward really sinks her teeth into it.  She goes from glamour to degradation, with a very realistic portrayal of Roth's descent into alcoholism.  She puts everything into it, and her performance is forceful and truthful.  Jo Van Fleet is also terrific as her grasping mother, too eager to give her daughter the life she never had, and her scenes with Hayward are among the best in the film.  It must have taken a lot for Roth to write her life story and let it be filmed, but she has in Hayward an actress that lays bare the painful honesty and ultimate courage of her struggle.  It's a tribute to Roth and to the fine work done at Alcoholics Anonymous.
