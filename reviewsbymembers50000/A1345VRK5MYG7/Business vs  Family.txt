 Gregory Peck stars as a Madison Avenue executive whose life reaches several crises at once.  His wife, Jennifer Jones, is pushing him to make more money and to be more successful, but without losing his ideals or honesty in a business that values neither one of those.  His experiences in World War II are coming back to haunt him, and his ownership of his grandmother's house is being challenged by her former servant.  Fredric March co-stars as his new boss, a man who put his business before his family, a decision whose consequences he must now live with.  There are a lot of lofty ideas being bounced around in this story, and they tend to center around the importance of family and being true to one's self and ideals.  Peck is his usual solid self, probably the perfect choice for this kind of role.  Jones gets the big emotional scene in the film, and she plays it to the hilt.  March gives a very moving, sympathetic performance, while Ann Harding as his distant wife has a couple of good scenes.  Although this is very much a film of the Fifties, the basic message of the movie still has its impact today.  It's honestly presented, well acted and written, and well worth watching.
