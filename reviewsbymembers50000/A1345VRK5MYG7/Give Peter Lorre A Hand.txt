 This is a well-titled, but bizarre horror film from Warner Bros, a studio not known for producing horror films.  Victor Francen stars as a renowned pianist living in one of those dark creepy movie mansions/castles.  One hand is useless, so he uses his other hand to play.  He relies heavily on his nurse, Andrea King, shuns his secretary, Peter Lorre, and sometimes seeks the company of Robert Alda who helped adapt the music for one-handed playing.  When Francen dies (violently) and leaves his estate to his nurse, this sets off a series of strange events as everyone is terrorized by his disembodied hand!!   Sound bizarre?  Well the film certainly is strange, establishing a foreboding mood early on and then taking the story in "unusual" directions.  The characters are not well defined, especially the nominal leads Alda and King.  It's one of those films where the characters need a slap to the head since they act so stupidly at times (or maybe it's the writers who should have been slapped around a bit).  Only Peter Lorre really establishes a presence and performance here, going all the way in his characterization of the decidely strange secretary.  It's perfect casting for the role and he capitalizes on it. Director Robert Florey does establish some mood and atmosphere, but the outright silliness and illogic of the whole story hurts the film.  It's fun to watch at a certain level, but with a better script and director it could have been a much more effective chiller.
