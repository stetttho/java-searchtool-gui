 Oddly enough, I never saw this film as a child and was an adult for the first viewing.  Cynically, I didn't expect to enjoy it much.  So much for cynicism - the magic of the film and its message got to me.  And it still does every time I watch it.  Edmund Gwenn is excellent as Kris Kringle, the man who is a dead ringer for Santa Claus because he IS Santa Claus.  Natalie Wood is the young girl (a cynic herself) who doesn't believe in him, having been taught by her mother, Maureen O'Hara, to be very realistic and practical.  Not only was Wood a great adult actress, but she was also a gifted child star, delivering lines and emotions like a pro.  Thelma Ritter has a small bit as a frustrated shopper, but she's a standout, as is the rest of the supporting cast.  This film reminds you of the joy and magic that every Christmas should bring, whether you're an adult or a child.
