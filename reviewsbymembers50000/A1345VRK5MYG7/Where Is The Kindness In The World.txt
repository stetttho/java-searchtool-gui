 The body of Dimitrios Makropoulos washes up on the shore of Istanbul, and his history of crimes is brought to the attention of mystery writer Peter Lorre.  Dimitrios was a man without a conscience, always looking to make money at the expense of anyone.  Lorre becomes fascinated by his story, and goes on a quest to find out more about the much despised man.  The quest takes him across Europe, to such locales as Sofia, Geneva, and Paris.  Along the way he gets involved with Sydney Greenstreet, a menacing man who clearly knows more than he is saying, with motives of his own.  The story is partly told through a series of flashbacks, as victims of Dimitrios' schemes and backstabbing relate their experiences.  This is another example of film noir, with the action taking place at night, in dark spaces.  Everyone has questionable motives and characters, each looking out for themselves.  Lorre is good in an offbeat role, and it's entertaining to watch him with the always fun Greenstreet - what an odd couple.  Zachary Scott is appropriately menacing and nasty as Dimitrios, and Steven Geray is particularly good as one of Dimitrios' unfortunate victims.  I did get occasionally confused during the flashbacks, but not enough to detract from the overall film.  It quickly establishes a dark, sinister mood, and doesn't let up.  This is a forgotten thriller that deserves to be seen.
