 If you're expecting to see Joan Crawford battling the Nazis with her shoulder pads, you might be in for a surprise here.  Crawford is quite subdued as a newlywed on her honeymoon with Oxford prof husband Fred MacMurray.  They have been recruited by the British Foreign Office to locate a missing man in pre-war Germany.  Through a series of (unbelievable) secret messages and rendezvous, they move from one episode to another, since as an American honeymooning couple, they are "above suspicion", or are they?  Along the way the get mixed up with Conrad Veidt and a sinister Basil Rathbone, both offering their usual quality performances in underwritten parts.  The story is completely unrealistic, the dialogue is not much to shout about, and the direction a bit sluggish.  Yet the film is entertaining, since MacMurray and Crawford in their ordinary-people-thrust-into-extraordinary-cirucumstances characters are appealing, if a little bland, and it would be great if something like this really could happen.  I guess it's one of those films where you can turn your brain off and just have fun with the harmless story.  At ninety minutes long, it's easy to take.
