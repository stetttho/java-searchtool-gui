 I didn't know much about the story this film is based on before I watched it, so two things stand out for me:  the relationship between Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp, and the gunfight itself.  Burt Lancaster and especially  Kirk Douglas do an excellent job of portraying the low key relationship  that gradually develops between the two men, unlikely allies that learn to  trust  each other.  The famed gunfight itself is well staged and executed,  with tension slowly built leading up to it, and with the explosiveness one  would expect once it is underway.  This film shows the fine line between  lawlessness and control that existed in the Old West, as well as the code  of honour that each man had.  It's well done.
