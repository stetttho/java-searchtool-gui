 Although I don't think that The Birds is Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film, it is probably my favourite of his movies.  I've seen the trailer for the film, and it's very humourous, and obviously Hitchcock wanted to have a lot  of fun with his audience.  The trailer suggests that the birds attack as a  response to all that man has done to them over the years.  It's an  interesting idea, especially since the reason for the attacks is omitted in  the film, which is one of the things that I like about it.  I like the way  the film looks at the reaction of people to bizarre events, especially as  some of the townspeople connect the arrival of the birds with the arrival  of Tippi Hedren as though she somehow brought this on them.  I didn't even  notice that there wasn't a musical soundtrack the first time I saw the  film, because the sounds of the birds attacking amidst the silence is  really effective.  The performers are good, especially Suzanne Pleshette,  and although I don't think Tippi Hedren was the greatest actress to appear  before a camera, I think she's better than most people give her credit for,  especially considering that the actors are secondary to all that is  happening in the film.  She looks great, and projects a certain detached  coolness, which is appropriate for the character.  The special effects are  good (condsidering the time), and the tension slowly builds with each  attack.  I particularly like the scene where Tippi Hedren waits outside the  schoolhouse, and the birds slowly gather behind her without her knowledge.   For me, this is a fun movie to watch, well made and very effective for its  purpose.  I've seen a lot of other suspense and horror films and they  generally don't stay with me.  But I have to admit that there have been a  few times when I have gone by a large group of birds perched somewhere, and  I've flashbacked to this movie and walked a little faster!
