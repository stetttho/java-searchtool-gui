 This movie could also have been called The Daughter From Hell.  Joan Crawford plays a very giving mother who wants her children to have the best of everything (especially Veda).  To accomplish this, she starts her own  business which becomes incredibly successful and she  sacrifices herself.   Her reward is the most selfish, uncaring, self-centred daughter you'll ever  see on the screen.  I have certain problems with this film.  First of all,  I'm not a Crawford fan, although I will admit she's good in the movie.   Secondly, I have hard time believing this mother-daughter relationship  (it's too extreme).  And thirdly, the movie leans more closely to melodrama  than film noir (which is what I wanted to see).   Having said all this, I  would still recommend the movie because there is a pretty good mystery in  the way the plot is constructed, Eve Arden is great as Joan's wisecracking  assistant, and Ann Blyth is excellent (you'll hate her) as Veda, the  daughter no one would want.  It's a well made movie, and it will probably  appeal to a lot of people.
