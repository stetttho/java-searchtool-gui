 You Can't Take It With You presents the story of an unusual family and assorted offbeat characters that live in a house where the unusual is the norm and everyone is encouraged to do what makes them happy.  Grandfather Lionel Barrymore leads the family, a man with great respect for God and the ordinary man, as well as a great love for life and all the little joys it has to offer.  Barrymore is being pressured to sell his house to a big businessman, Edward Arnold, who is trying to buy all the surrounding property to build a factory.  Barrymore resists, but the problem is that his granddaughter Jean Arthur has fallen in love with Jimmy Stewart, the son of Arnold.  It all becomes the story of big business vs. the little guy, the rich vs. the ordinary man.  In other words, the typical conflicts of many of director Frank Capra's films.  The film starts off a little slowly, but picks up energy and steam as it goes along.  There are a number of terrific scenes, including Stewart and Arthur in the restaurant, the fireworks explosion, and the courtroom.  Stewart and Arthur give fine performances, but the film really belongs to Barrymore and Arnold, playing men with opposite viewpoints who basically want the same thing out of life.  Both of these great character actors deliver top, moving performances.  With its humour, quirky characters, and message about what really counts in life, the film gives viewers everything you would expect from a top Capra movie.
