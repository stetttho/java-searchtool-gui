 Claudette Colbert gives a very strong performance as real life writer  Agnes Keith, an American woman living on Borneo with her British husband  and son during WWII.  When the Japanese invade, she and her son are  separated from her husband, Patric Knowles, and all are imprisoned in  camps.  A Japanese colonel, very well played by Sessue Hayakawa, takes an  interest in Colbert since he has read her book, and they have a platonic  relationship that is one of the most interesting features of the movie.  He  has been educated in America, and he reveals more about himself than a  typical Japanese soldier would.  Three Came Home illustrates the poor  conditions of prison camps during WWII and the effect of the war on those  who weren't soldiers but had to fight to survive. It's a dramatic story,  well acted, and worth viewing.
