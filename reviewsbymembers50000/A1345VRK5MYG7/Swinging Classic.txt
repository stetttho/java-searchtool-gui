 Jimmy Stewart stars as Glenn Miller, the famed band leader from the Thirties and Forties, in a film that charts his rise from his beginnings as trombone player in various bands and orchestras, the various setbacks on  his way to the top, to his eventual success as an innovative band leader  before and during the War.  June Allyson plays his incredibly supportive  and understanding wife, and Harry Morgan is his lifelong best friend (and  piano player).  I don't know enough about Miller's real life to say how  accurate this film is, but it seems to hit the highlights.  Stewart is very  good (as usual), and he has a nice, comfortable chemistry with Allyson.  Of  course, Miller's music is the prominent feature in the film, and even for  me - someone not from that generation - it's great to hear and enjoyable.   In fact, I just purchased a CD of Miller's greatest hits to add to my CD  collection.  Maybe the movie is inspirational!
