 Dean Martin stars as an irresponsible man trying to make his fortune, surrounded by sisters and a wife who love him so much, and in fact, probably too much.  When he finally comes into money, it sets of a chain of events that leaves his family in shambles.  Martin is good in his role, revealing what a capable actor he was.  As his sisters, Geraldine Page and Wendy Hiller deliver their usual excellent performances.  Page was especially adept at playing such complicated women, while Hiller quietly let's us in on all that her character is thinking.  Yvette Mimieux does a good job as Martin's desperate young wife, and an older Gene Tierney is very good as her detached mother.  The movie presents a controversial subject matter as frankly as they could probably get away with when it was made, and although it wins no awards for being exciting (or even that pleasant), it is dramatic and the characters kept my attention.
