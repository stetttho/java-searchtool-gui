 British cinema during the post-WWII years produced a string of terrific movies, and Black Narcissus is among the most remarkable of those films.  There is an eerie, sexually charged atmosphere throughout this story of five nuns sent into a remote part of the Himalayas to establish a convent and work with the locals.  There's something about the air that clears their heads and allows all sorts of worldly thoughts to permeate their consciousness.  The results are tragic.  Deborah Kerr stars as the Sister Superior and gives yet another excellent portrait of repression and duty mixed uneasily together.  As good as she might be, it's Kathleen Byron as the disturbed Sister Ruth whose performance dominates the film.  Her descent into madness is chilling and Byron is nothing short of amazing in the way she physically and emotionally plays it.  The cinematography is justly famous, and the direction is superb, capturing and exploiting the repressed atmosphere and increasing mental unease of the experience using great camera angles.  The score also deserves mention.  The sound of the howling wind runs throughout the film, and choirs of voices are used with rising intensity to create dramatic tension.  Black Narcissus is unlike any movie you have seen.
