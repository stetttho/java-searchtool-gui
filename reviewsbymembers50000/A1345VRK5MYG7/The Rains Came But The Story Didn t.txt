 The Rains Came is an early disaster film, and I watched it to see how the disaster scenes would be filmed.  The movie was made in 1939, and the special effects are quite good, especially as the earthquake and subsequent  flood tear through Ranchipur.  Unfortunately, the story built around the  disaster is pretty shaky itself.  Myrna Loy plays a "bad" woman  who falls in love with a Hindu surgeon (Tyrone Power!).  George Brent is  along for the swim as Loy's former boyfriend, a charming (?) man that is  having romantic difficulties himself with an eighteen year old (Brenda  Joyce) who wants to get away from her parents.  In the middle of these  entanglements comes an earthquake that triggers a huge flood, all of which  leads to death and disease.  Neither Loy or Brent is able to inject much  life into their characters, although Power actually pulls off a pretty good  performance in a most unlikely role.  The supporting cast has a lot of the  old character actors in it, including Jane Darwell, Nigel Bruce, Henry  Travers, and the always dramatic Maria Ouspenskaya.  It's an interesting  look at the culture, but better writing and casting would have made a more  memorable film.
