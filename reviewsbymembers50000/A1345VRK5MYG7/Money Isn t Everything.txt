 Robert Donat, an excellent actor who made too few films, stars as a young English doctor who enters the profession with many ideals and dreams, but loses them along the path of his life.  Rosalind Russell stars as the schoolteacher he marries that loves his ideals, while Ralph Richardson and Rex Harrison are doctors he befriends at different points in his life.  Richardson believes in helping the regular man and that money is not important, while Harrison treats wealthy hypochondriacs in between fancy lunches and golf games.  The message of the film is pretty obvious, and there are some slow parts.  But the acting is fine, with special praise to Richardson who has a number of showy moments.  It's one of those stories that reminds us that money isn't everything.
