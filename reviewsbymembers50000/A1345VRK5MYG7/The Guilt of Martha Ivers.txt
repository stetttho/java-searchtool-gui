 Van Heflin is a gambler who returns to his hometown and gets tangled up with some childhood friends.  He left town the night Martha killed her cold-hearted aunt, a murder that was successfully covered up.  Now the grown-up Martha, played by Barbara Stanwyck, and especially her weak husband, played by Kirk Douglas, fear he might reveal what happened that night.  Heflin gets involved with Lizabeth Scott, a convict, who fears his past relationship with Stanwyck will take Heflin from her.  In this film noir, none of the characters is particularly likeable, each trying to protect themselves.  There is some biting dialogue and effective use of music, although sometimes it becomes a little overpowering.  Stanwyck is terrific as usual, really delivering in the latter scenes.  Douglas is too strong of a presence to play the weak, manipulated husband, and would have been better off trading with Heflin.  Scott has a strange screen presence, and although it fits the character somewhat, she never seems quite comfortable.  But the characters are fascinating (typical for film noir) and the story is really interesting, despite the poor choice of a title.  Since so much of this film centres on guilt and how difficult it can be to escape one's past, I think a better title for the film would have been The Guilt of Martha Ivers.
