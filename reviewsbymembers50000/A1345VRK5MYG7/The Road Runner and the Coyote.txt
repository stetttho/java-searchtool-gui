 Tony Curtis stars as The Great Leslie, a daredevil trying to win a car race from New York to Paris.  His chief competition is Jack Lemmon as the inept Dr. Fate, the villain with many tricks up his sleeve, most of which never work.  Along with them in the race is Natalie Wood as Maggie DuBois, a feminist newspaperwoman out to prove that women are men's equal.  Their adventure takes them through the Old West and an old fashioned bar room brawl, on an iceberg, and through the Court intrigues of a mythical European country about to crown a new king who looks very much like Dr. Fate.  Director Blake Edwards throws everything he can into this comedy, with tons of sight gags and physical humour.  His biggest asset in the film is Jack Lemmon.  Lemmon goes over - way over - way, way over the top in his characterization of the villain, the kind of villain found in silent films, all dressed in black with the sinister moustache to boot.  With his wicked laugh and constant shouting, he's not exactly subtle, but he gives the film the edge and energy it needs to sustain the drier, less interesting parts surrounding Curtis and Wood.  Lemmon is well assisted by Peter Falk as Max, Dr. Fate's poor assistant. The rest of the cast is fine, including Vivian Vance as Wood's boss' wife, another feminist.  It's rare to see Vance in a theatrical film, although she has few scenes to shine.  I admire the film and those involved for trying everything and anything and playing it with much energy.  Not every scene works, and not all the gags work, but the film is worth a look, if only to see Lemmon like you'll never see him in another film.  Watching this film, I was reminded of a Road Runner/Coyote cartoon, with lots of visual action, hairbrained schemes, and characters placed in precarious situations that survive and comeback for more.  The only thing missing is an anvil being dropped!
