 Crash Dive was released the same year as Destination Tokyo, and I think the latter was the better film.  Not to slam this movie too much, because it's entertaining enough.  But the focus in Crash Dive is different,  spending a considerable amount of time off the submarine as Tyrone Power  and Dana Andrews clash over the affections of an incredibly beautiful Anne  Baxter.  The performances are as good as you could expect with this kind of  material, and the action scenes are quite effective.  But it's the kind of  movie you can watch and then forget pretty soon afterwards.  It's  entertaining, but without much impact.
