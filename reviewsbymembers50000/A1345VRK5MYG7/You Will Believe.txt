 Oddly enough, I had never heard of this film until a couple of weeks ago, but based on the reviews here, decided to check it out.  I'd like to thank the other Amazon reviewers for some very sound advice.  It's a terrific film.  An older Dana Andrews is in England investigating the paranormal and the occult when he gets mixed up with a cult leader who tells him he will be killed by a demon on a particular day, a day which is three days away.  Despite mounting evidence, Andrews doesn't believe him, although we the audience are convinced very early on.  But will Andrews see the light before it's too late, and could he do anything about it anyways?  The film has a creepy quality to it, not only because of the frankly presented subject matter, but also because of the darkly lit black and white photography.  There's nothing like b&w to really add atmosphere in a story like this one.  The performances are all good, especially the villain, played by Niall MacGinnis in a quietly threatening way.  Highlights for me were the children's party, the hypnosis scene, and the climax.  The mood and tension builds as the film progresses, and remains strong to the very end.  I guess I should put in my two cents about the demon's appearances.  I think it worked well at the end, but I would not have shown it at the beginning, instead hainvg the smoke and the sound of it without a visual image.  But that's a minor criticism of a fine suspense film.  I hope more people have a chance to see this minor classic.
