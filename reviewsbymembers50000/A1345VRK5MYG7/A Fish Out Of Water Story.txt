 The Egg and I is an amusing look at a city girl's adjustment to living life on a chicken farm.  Claudette Colbert stars as Betty, whose new husband Bob, played by Fred MacMurray, gives up his corporate career to pursue his lifelong dream of raising chickens.  Their "new" house is a disaster area, and they quickly discover that starting a farm isn't that easy.  Marjorie Main and Percy Kilbride star as their neighbours Ma and Pa Kettle, parents of more kids than they can remember the names of.  Louise Allbritton plays another neighbour who has a mechanized farm and an eye for MacMurray.  The performers are all good, with Colbert delivering another solid comedic performance and Main stealing every scene as the tired, down-to-earth wife of the lazy husband.  This isn't one of those movies that will have you laughing till you cry.  It's a good natured look at a typical "fish out of water" story.  I did laugh out loud during the dance and a few other scenes, and with great comedy performers such as these, you're guaranteed to be entertained.
