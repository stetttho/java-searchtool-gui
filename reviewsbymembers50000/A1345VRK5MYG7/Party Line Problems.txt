 This film was a lot better than I was expecting.  Doris Day stars as an interior decorator sharing a party line with composer and womanizer Rock Hudson.  Their constant battling over the phone is a source of much frustration, but in one of those it-could-only-happen-in-the-movies plots, Hudson ends up impersonating a Texan oilman and they fall in love.  Day and Hudson demonstrate their considerable on-screen chemistry in this film, with good support from the perpetual romantic loser Tony Randall as Hudson's friend, and an underused Thelma Ritter as Day's drinking maid.  The movie looks great, and is surprisingly adult given the time it was made.  It is pretty predictable, but the laughs are there, the script has a number of good lines, and the whole production is very polished.  It's not hard to see why Day and Hudson were a popular romantic team.
