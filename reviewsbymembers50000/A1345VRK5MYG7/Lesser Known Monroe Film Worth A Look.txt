 Robert Mitchum plays a practical, no-nonsense farmer recently reunited with his young son, Tommy Rettig.  They rescue a young couple (Marilyn Monroe and Rory Calhoun) going on a raft down a river by their homestead, and that's where the trouble begins.  Calhoun is out to make a gold claim, and he'll do anything, including stealing Mitchum's horse and gun, leaving Mitchum, Rettig, and even Monroe behind to face the Indians without any defence.  So they must take to the raft to survive, and that's where the adventure begins.  I liked this film a lot.  Mitchum is his usual laconinc self, but it works really well with this character.  Monroe gets to act in this film, and she does so very well, playing a saloon singer that wants to defend her man, despite what he has done to all of them.  Young Rettig is good too, not cloying and irritating like so many child actors can be.  The scenery is beautiful, the title song very effective, and although the direction of Otto Preminger isn't very fluid and sometimes the movie lumbers from one scene to another, the performances and relationships among the characters make up for it.  Viewers will enjoy the trip down the River of No Return.
