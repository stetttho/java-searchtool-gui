 I'll begin by saying I have neither read nor seen the play version of this story, so I cannot compare them.  But I have read and seen other Tennessee Williams plays, and I have always been impressed by how richly the  characters and conflict are drawn, and this story is no exception.  The one  thing that stands out the most for me in Cat On A Hot Tin Roof is the  character of Maggie as played by Elizabeth Taylor.  She's incredibly  beautiful and sexy in her role as the frustrated Maggie, and it is one of  her greatest performances.  But she's not the only one that delivers.  Paul  Newman is excellent as her alcoholic husband Brick, Burl Ives as Big Daddy  fills the screen with a powerful performance, Judith Anderson as Big Mama  is also strong, and Madeleine Sherwood as the very fertile sister-in-law is  so good at being catty and greedy you'll hate her.  The story explores the  lies, the rivalries, and the greed that tear apart a Southern family.  The  way they talk about each other is very pointed and often humourous, but the  way they hurt each other is painful, and Williams and the screenwriters  manage to walk a fine balance between the two. This is one of the screen's  great dysfunctional families, and also one of its most memorable.
