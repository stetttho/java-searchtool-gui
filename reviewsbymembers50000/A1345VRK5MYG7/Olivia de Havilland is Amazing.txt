 The Snake Pit was released at a time (late Forties) when Hollywood was taking a more serious look at important issues.  This film deals with mental illness and mental institutions, and does so in a direct and honest  way.  Olivia de Havilland stars as a wife / aspiring writer whose husband,  Mark Stevens, has to commit her to an institution when her irrational  behaviour becomes too much to deal with.  In the institution, she fights to  regain her mental health with the assistance of a kind doctor, Leo Genn.   But it's not easy, and the film shows the setbacks she faces, not to  mention the horrors of life in an asylum.  She is subjected to electroshock  treatments, cruel nurses, and patients even more disturbed than she is, all  in conditions that could hardly foster improved mental health.  It truly  resembles a snake pit, particularly in one memorable shot taken above the  bizarre goings-on below.  Although the honest presentation of the subject  matter is important, the real strength in the movie lies in de Havilland's  performance.  She's incredible in a role that showcases her dramatic  ability to it's full extent.  She manages not to go over the top, which  would have been easy to do given the subject matter, and she makes the  character believable and sympathetic.  The film and de Havilland's  performance should be seen.
