 James Stewart, a man with a past that he is trying to put behind him, leads a group of settlers in this highly entertaining Western.  He's taking them deep into the country of Oregon where they are going to set up a farming community.  Along for the ride is Julia Adams, the daughter of the settler's leader and a girl that Stewart likes.  But she only has eyes for Arthur Kennedy, another man with a shady past that Stewart has befriended.  I liked this Western a lot.  The main character is complicated and a bit mysterious, and Stewart plays him with a lot of intensity and authority. This is one of the films where you see the kind of actor of great depth that Stewart matured into as he grew older, and although I have seen few of his films with director Anthony Mann, I'm going to make a point of it do so now.  The rest of the performances are also very effective, although Rock Hudson is given a badly underwritten character that adds little to the film.  Mann builds up a lot of tension as the story progresses, and the photography is beautiful.  In one sense, the story is a character study about redemption and how a man can change.  But it is also a well produced Western, with plenty of action.  The combination works unusually well!
