 It's hard to know where to begin praising Double Indemnity.  I always appreciate smart dialogue, and this film is full of it courtesy of Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler.  The exchanges between Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray are classic.  But the script is also well constructed, using an effective shift between present and past as well as MacMurray's voice over to move the winding plot along.  Then there are the actors.  Stanwyck, such a versatile actress, easily gives one of her best performances as Phyllis, the woman who lures an insurance salesman into a scheme of murder and greed.  As the salesman Walter, MacMurray is surprisingly good in a role unlike the usual "likeable guy" he played.  He should have played more shady characters in his film career.  Edward G. Robinson delivers a fun performance as MacMurray's friend and insurance claim inspector.  Billy Wilder's intelligent direction uses all of the elements of film noir and puts them together in one of the best examples of the genre.  Phyllis and Walter may not be the most likeable people, but it is fascinating to watch them lead each other into trouble.  Fans of classic films, film noir, the director, or any of the actors should make sure to add this film to their viewing list.
