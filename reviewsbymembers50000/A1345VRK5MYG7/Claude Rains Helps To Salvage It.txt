 Whether you are going to enjoy or get into this film depends on a few factors.  First of all, you must believe that every man is tripping over himself to win the hand of the woman considered the most beautiful and desirable in New York, Bette Davis.  Now Davis was certainly attractive, but it's a real stretch to consider her that kind of once-in-a-lifetime beauty.  You must then be willing to spend two and a half hours watching a vain, self-centered woman use her beauty, abuse her family, and then try to find sympathy for her when irony deals her exactly what she deserves.  Obviously, I had some problems with this film.  It tells the story of Fanny Trellis who later becomes Fanny Skeffington, the object of every man's affections, who can't see beyond her own mirror to see the events of the world or the pain she causes others.  She marries Claude Rains for money and security for her family, but her marriage unravels and eventually so does her beauty.  The character of Fanny is not sympathetic, and I found it hard to get past that, although thankfully she does have a sense of humour, which helps.  Davis, using a higher pitched voice, doesn't shrink away from portraying Fanny as she is, and her appearance as the older Fanny is startling given how we know she aged in real life.  Rains is his excellent self as usual in this film, really capturing the heart of the story.  Not surprisingly, his absence from most of the last half of the film hurt it for me, as I found it long and badly in need of editing.  There are some good moments in the film, but since I found little to like in the central character, there wasn't much else except Rains to appreciate.
