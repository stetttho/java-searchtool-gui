 Richard Todd stars as a proud, stubborn Scottish soldier who learns some lessons about friendship in this little known film from 1949.  At the close of World War Two, and following surgery for the removal of a kidney, he recovers in a jungle hospital, with the truth about his very serious condition being kept from him.  His anger over his lack of a discharge, coupled with his hard attitude and demeanor, keeps him separated from fellow patients and nurse Patricia Neal.  Attempts are made to befriend him, but it only leads to conflict.  Ronald Reagan is the American patient "Yank" and he gives one of his better performances.  Neal is also good, although a little detached, as the nurse trying to keep the peace.  But it's Todd who really stands out, giving a moving performance as the friend-less Scotsman who has never fit in and has been hardened by the experience.  The scenes are played with honesty, and although the film reveals its stage origins, it doesn't seem static.  Director Vincent Sherman lets the characters and conflict drive this story about man's need for friendship, and the results are memorable.
