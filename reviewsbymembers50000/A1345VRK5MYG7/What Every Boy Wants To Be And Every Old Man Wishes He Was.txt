 Clark Gable and Cameron Mitchell star as brothers and cowboys who first try to rob businessman Robert Ryan, but end up partners with him in a huge cattle drive from Texas to Montana.  Along the way they pick up Jane Russell, who falls in love with Gable, but wants the rich lifestyle that Ryan can provide. The story is hardly short on action.  There's blizzards, Indian attacks, cattle drives, and plenty of male/female friction.  But it doesn't add up to anything particularly exciting or even interesting.  It was a surprise to me, given not only the cast, but also the director Raoul Walsh, who certainly knew his way around action and adventure, not to mention how to pace a film.  There are a few good moments, especially the final drive with the cattle, but not enough to sustain any interest in the characters or the story.  The actors are fine, but the missing energy really hurts the film.  It's a large scale Western, but the scale doesn't impress.
