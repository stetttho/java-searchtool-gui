 I didn't have much in the way of expectations when I started to watch this film, so I have to say I was pretty surprised by how good it was.  Dana Andrews stars as a cowboy/businessman in 1850's Oregon who is in love with Susan Hayward, the fiancee of his friend, a reckless gambler played by Brian Donlevy.  Andrews has to look out for Ward Bond, a violent wanderer who seems bent on killing him.  Toss in some Indians, beautifully photographed scenery, other love interests and subplots, and you have a good story that ties all of the elements in together, providing enough action, drama, and romance to keep any viewer satisfied.  Plus you have Hoagy Carmichael moving about singing several songs.  What more could you ask for?
