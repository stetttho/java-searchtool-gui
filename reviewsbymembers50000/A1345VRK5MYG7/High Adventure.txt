 Robin Hood is one of the great action films of all time.  It's hard to know where to begin.  As directed, the film is full of energy and humour, with the action scenes choreographed brilliantly.  Just watch the legendary  sword fight between Flynn and Rathbone, as well as the capture of Rathbone  and his party in Sherwood Forest.  The musical score is rousing, and the  technicolor brings it to life vividly.  Of course, it's hard to imagine  anyone else as Robin Hood than Errol Flynn.  He plays the role with just  the right combination of heroics and athleticism.  As usual, he and Olivia  deHavilland sparkle opposite each other, and a familiar and welcome cast of  character actors only add to the magic.  In particular, Claude Rains seems  to have a lot of fun in his role as the villain.  Robin Hood is a film that  both young and old can enjoy with each repeated viewing.
