 Nowadays, most people have not heard much about this film compared to some of Hitchcock's other more famous works.  The fact that this was one of his favourites alone makes it worth a look.  But the film itself is outstanding  and should be seen by more people.  Teresa Wright, one of the best  actresses of the Forties, delivers another terrific performance as the  adoring niece of Joseph Cotten who discovers that her Uncle may have a  secret that would destroy her whole family.  Her developing suspicion is  credibly presented as clues are dropped like only Hitchcock can, and the  viewer is able to completely sympathize with her as she must shoulder the  burden of her knowledge alone.  Cotten quietly makes a menacing villain in  one of his best performances.  The two stars are well supported by Patricia  Collinge as Cotten's loving sister and Wright's mother, and by a very  quirky Hume Cronyn as the next door neighbour whose hobby is  (appropriately) murder.  The screenplay builds the suspense slowly but  steadily, and there are a number of trademark Hitchcock shots.  I may be  biased because Wright, Cotten, and Hitchcock are among my favourites from  the Forties, but I think everyone will agree that Shadow of a Doubt is an  excellent suspense film.
