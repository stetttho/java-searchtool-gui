 Bette Davis stars as a nightclub "hostess" who gets mixed up with brutal crime boss Eduardo Ciannelli, an association that leads to tragedy for Davis.  She's one of five women who work at a clip joint, their jobs being to get as much money out of the male customers as possible.  Davis needs the money to help support her kid sister's education. However, when her sister Jane Bryan also gets mixed up with Ciannelli, Davis finds herself doing battle with the mob, both in court and out.  This is an unusually tough film and roll for Davis, and it's one of her more interesting ones.  She's very good, getting a number of scenes to cut loose.  Lola Lane and Isabel Jewell as two of her co-workers also give strong performances, as does Humphrey Bogart as the special prosecutor who fights for Davis.  It's unusual not to see Bogart as a heavy at this point in his career, and the change of pace displays his versatility.  Lloyd Bacon tightly directs the film, leaving little room for sentimentality.  The film has a hard edge that suits its theme very well.  It's well made and acted and fans of any of the stars will want to see it.
