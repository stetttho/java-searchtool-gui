 The Strawberry Blonde has elements of comedy, drama, music, and romance all tossed into one entertaining film.  Set at the turn of the century, James Cagney stars as a man studying to be a dentist who falls in love with a strawberry blonde stunner that every man is after, Rita Hayworth.  Although she finds him attractive, she is more attracted to the prospects of his ambitious pal, Jack Carson.  Caught up in the mix is Hayworth's friend, the forward thinking Olivia de Havilland.  Cagney finds himself getting stuck with de Havilland, and it takes him a while to figure out what the audience already knows ... he really got the winner.  Although Hayworth and the supporting cast of character actor veterans (Alan Hale, George Tobias, Una O'Connor, and Carson) are all fine, as a fan of Cagney and de Havilland I have to say the film belongs to them.  Cagney gets to play his tough guy with a lighter touch here, getting knocked down more often than the other way around, and he displays a humorous romantic side that should have been used more often by Warner Bros.  de Havilland has some of the film's best moments as the straightforward working girl who Cagney comes to discover has a lot more depth.  Their three scenes in the park are classics, played with humour, charm, and honesty.  Fans of Cagney and de Havilland should make this film a must for viewing!
