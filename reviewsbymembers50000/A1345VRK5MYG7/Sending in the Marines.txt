 John Wayne leads his men into battle in the Pacific in this film that pays tribute to the work done by the Marines during World War II.  Wayne plays it tough as the no-nonsense sergeant that clashes with marine John Agar, the son of his mentor.  The emphasis in this film is on the action, which is what it should be, although the usual stock characters are brought out to round out the supporting cast.  Real life battle footage is effectively mixed in with studio work to create a realistic feel to all that is happening.  When you watch a John Wayne war flick, you pretty much know what you're going to get, and this one hardly surprises.  But it is competently made, well acted by Wayne, and an easy way to fill in a couple of hours.
