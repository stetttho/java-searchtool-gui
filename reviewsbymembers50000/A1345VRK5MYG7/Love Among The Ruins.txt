 Clark Gable stars as Barbary Coast club owner Blackie Norton who doesn't believe in God - only in taking care of himself.  Priest Spencer Tracy knows that his old friend has a bigger heart than he lets on, especially when singer Jeanette MacDonald enters the scene as the classy, proper, opera -rained singer who captures Gable's heart.  As MacDonald finds herself caught between Gable and his enemy Jack Holt, everyone finds themselves in peril when the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 hits.  The love story is ridiculous, as MacDonald switches allegiances more often than she changes clothes.  She's a bit over-ripe as the confused singer and her singing begins to wear out its welcome toward the end.  Gable is strong in the kind of role he did often at this point in his career.  Tracy, too briefly seen, is a tower of strength and honesty.  Although the script lacks depth in plotting and characterization, the film is watchable.  The best parts of the film deal with the quake and its aftermath.  The special effects and the atmosphere created are definitely impressive.  The film's moral message falls on you like a ton of the falling bricks from the quake, but then again it's the spectacle that drives this film.
