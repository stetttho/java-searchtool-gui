 Barbara Hershey stars in this true life story of a white South African journalist who sacrifices her self and her family to try to bring an end to the injustices of Apartheid in 1960's South Africa.  With her husband having fled the country, Hershey finds herself arrested under the Ninety Day Detention Act, leaving her 3 daughters in the care of her mother.  It has a particularly hard effect on her sensitive oldest daughter, played by Jodhi May, who realizes more of what is going on to her family and country, and who also finds her self ostracized because of her parents' politics.  The effect of South Africa's racial injustice is also seen on the family's maid, Linda Mvusi.  The film gives viewers a solid look at the experience of Apartheid in 1960's South Africa, by showing the differences in the lifestyles of blacks and whites, and in the attitudes of the white characters towards blacks.  It also raises the question of whether the Hershey character sacrificed her family too much in her pursuit of justice.  Hershey is very good as the tough, crusading journalist, and May is excellent as her frustrated, confused, and awkward daughter.  The cinematography and score are terrific, although the sound can be a problem in certain scenes where dialogue is difficult to hear.  The violence is kept to a minimum so that this could be a great introduction for children into the history of South Africa.  It's a small film well worth watching.
