 This was the first teaming of Bette Davis with director William Wyler, and it's as classy as you would expect from Wyler, with the fireworks you would expect from Davis.  Davis stars as a spoiled southern belle who goes after  everything she wants and expects to get it.  However, her selfishness has  an effect on those around her.  Needless to say, Davis is terrific in the  central role, making her both both sympathetic, yet willful and stubborn.   She is well supported by the cast, especially Fay Bainter as her patient  aunt, who understatedly demonstrates the way a "true" southern  woman should behave.  The scene at the ball is justifiably famous,  highlighted by Wyler's terrific direction and camerawork.  Fans of Davis  and Wyler will enjoy this film.
