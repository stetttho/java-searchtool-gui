 This is the film that started it all, and movie fans ever since have been grateful.  It's the first pairing of the legendary Hepburn and Tracy, and from the moment when he first sets his eyes on her (actually, her legs - a great shot!), you can feel why they were such a perfect match on screen.  They star as newspaper columnists coming from different backgrounds and perspectives, who despite the odds, fall in love, even though they have no idea how to fit into each other's worlds.  Both stars give their usual top performances, compensating for some slow parts and dated elements in the story.  I enjoyed the film, as I have enjoyed all their films that I have seen.  Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy were two of the best in the business, so any opportunity to see them together should be taken!
