 Although David Lean has become famous for his epic films, I've always thought that the "smaller scale" movies he made in the Forties and Fifties were better, and of those, Great Expectations is the best.   From the eerie opening scenes in the graveyard to the musty, lifeless house  of Miss Haversham to the full circle development of Pip's life, the film is  flawless.  Charles Dicken's always colourful assortment of characters are  brought to life by an expert cast, each a standout in their performance.   The black and white photography is beautifully shot, and the film is full  of memorable moments (especially those involving Miss Haversham).  This is  a film that should be seen!
