 Of all the Cagney films I've seen, and I've seen a lot of them, this is the way that I always remember him.  He's tough talking, swaggering, with the hint of a good guy that never got a break and was destined for a life  of crime.  Cagney is amazing in this role, and you'll recognize so many of  the mannerisms and speech patterns that became his trademark and part of  his legend.  Pat O'Brien also makes a good impression in his role as Father  Connelly, and this type of role is what he is well remembered for, too.   It's a basic story of two friends, and one goes down the right road, while  the other goes down the wrong road.  The movie is fast, full of memorable  moments, and the last scenes will stay with you for a long time.  This is  one of those "they don't make them like that anymore" movies, and  it's a must-see for anyone who likes Cagney, gangster films, old films, or  simply good movies.
