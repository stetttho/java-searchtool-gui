 Arthur Miller wrote the screenplay for this film about a group of people, rootless and alone, who come together in Reno, Nevada and learn a little something about themselves.  Marilyn Monroe stars as a dancer who has come  to Reno for a divorce from her husband Kevin McCarthy.  She stays with  divorcee Thelma Ritter, and she has no idea where to move on to next.  Eli  Wallach is a pilot/cowboy who falls for her, and he's a widower with a  house out in the middle of nowhere he offers to her.  Clark Gable is his  cowboy partner who falls for Monroe, too.  Montgomery Clift is a walking  rodeo accident/cowboy who joins up with them to go Mustanging.  Each  character has their own story, secrets, and pain, and Monroe seems to be  the one who draws it out of them.  Monroe gives an excellent performance,  fragile yet sexy, and it shows the kind of actress she was becoming.  The  men all give top performances as well, and Thelma Ritter proves again that  she could deliver a wisecrack better than anyone.  The scenes surrounding  the capture of the Mustang horses are unforgettable, and all the more  starkly presented with the terrific black and white photography.  This  isn't a film that will make you feel good when it's over, but it presents  some very real characters in an almost too honest way.
