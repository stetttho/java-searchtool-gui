 One of the great mysteries and contrversies of the twentieth century was whether anyone survived the execution of Czar Nicholas II's family.  There were always rumours that the youngest daughter Anastasia had survived and escaped, and many imposters tried to claim the crown.  The most credible was Anna Anderson, and this film explores her story.  Ingrid Bergman gives an excellent, touching performance at the amnesiac woman who seems to more know about the family than any imposter could. Yul Brynner is the Prince who tries to make her over into Anastasia for financial gain, only to discover she may be the real thing.  Helen Hayes is Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress, the one person's approval that could validate Bergman/Brynner's claim.  Hayes is terrific as the skeptical royal, tired of so many pretenders to the crown.  Her meeting scene with Bergman is one of the great scenes of all time.  The film is well made, directed, written, and acted, and even though science seems to have proven now that Anna Anderson was not Anastasia, this does not diminish from the film's impact, especially given that she knew so much that cannot be so easily explained.  It remains a great mystery!
