 The legendary Greta Garbo gives one of her legendary performances as Marguerite Gautier, a comsumptive French courtesan caught between two men - Armand, whom she loves, and the Baron de Varville, whom she needs for financial support.  Surrounded by a group of superficial friends, she must ultimately make a decision about the depths of her love that will have an impact on all three.  Garbo's performance really comes to life when she is confronted by Armand's father (Lionel Barrymore) and the scenes after that meeting.  The Garbo mystique is on full display in these scenes as she turns Marguerite into one of the great tragic figures.  As Armand, Robert Taylor is alright, although clearly inexperienced as an actor.  Henry Daniell gives a more polished performance as the Baron.  Camille moves along well, but it probably wouldn't be half the film it is were it not for the unique screen presence and talent of its star.
