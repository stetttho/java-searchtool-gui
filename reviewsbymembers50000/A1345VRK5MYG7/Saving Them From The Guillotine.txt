 Leslie Howard is the courageous English aristocrat who saves French aristocrats from the guillotine in this filming of the famous novel.  Very few know just who this mysterious saviour, the "Scarlet Pimpernel", really is, since he uses disguises and moves with the secrecy of a spy.  Howard must also keeps his double life secret from his wife, Merle Oberon, a woman he loves but does not like very much.  But forces are conspiring against him to reveal the truth about the Scarlet Pimpernel, which would lead to the brutal deaths of so many Frenchmen.  Howard plays the many faces of his character with equal class and wit, giving a very natural and relaxed performance that is among the best I've ever seen him give.  Oberon also scores well, getting more out of her character than simply being a very beautiful decoration in the film.  The film could use a little more action, and unfortunately the years have not been good to the quality of the film's prints (especially the sound), but there is a lot here to entertain anyways.
