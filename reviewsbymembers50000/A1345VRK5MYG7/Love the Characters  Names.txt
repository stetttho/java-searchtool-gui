 If Kid Galahad has one thing going for it, it is the unusual names of some of the characters.  Bette Davis is Fluff, the decent and wise girlfriend of a boxing manager/promoter, and she's good in this movie she made before she  became the megastar she would become.  Humphrey Bogart is Turkey Morgan,  another manager/promoter who's the bad guy of the film.  This is the kind  of role I've seen Bogart do a lot before he became the megastar he would  become.  It doesn't give him much of a chance to show the talent we know he  had.  Davis' boyfriend is played by Edward G. Robinson, and he plays the  character like ... well... the usual Edward G. Robinson character of the  Thirties:  flawed and in your face.  The boxer that Robinson manages and  Davis ends up loving is nicknamed Kid Galahad and is played by Wayne Morris  a little too earnestly.  This is the kind of quick, predictable, yet fun to  watch film that Warner Brothers turned out a lot in the Thirties.  It's a  chance to see some big stars before they were big stars, and it's not a bad  way to pass ninety minutes.
