 In this period piece, Helena Bonham Carter and her aunt Maggie Smith go on vacation in Florence, encountering novelist Judi Dench, Reverend Simon Callow, and Denholm Elliot and his son Julian Sands.  Smith cuts the trip short after witnessing a passionate kiss between Bonham Carter and Sands.  Back in England, Bonham Carter ends up engaged to stuffy, serious snob Daniel Day-Lewis, while Sands and his father end up living in town.  Needless to say, all of this leads to complications. As one would expect from a Merchant-Ivory film, the performances are all top standard. Bonham Carter is excellent as the girl struggling against the growing passions inside her.  Smith excels as the fussy, proper, but deeply concerned aunt.  Day-Lewis is terrific in a most untypical role, while Sands is very strong as his counterpoint.  The supporting cast are all terrific as well. As one would also expect from Merchant-Ivory, the attention to period detail is amazing and the script is very literate.  It is a bit slow in parts, but the development of the characters and the manner in which thoughts and feelings are conveyed without words makes up for it.  The meaning of the title becomes only too evident by the end.  Everybody on a trip loves a room with a view.  But the same should apply to our everyday life.  Why shut yourself into loneliness or unfulfillment?  Get out and enjoy the view!
