 Job Switching is probably one of the most famous half-hours in TV sitcoms.  This is one of Lucy's best episodes.  The physical humour is amazing, and that is a tribute to all four stars.  The scenes between Desi Arnaz and  William Frawley are very funny, and of course, Lucille Ball and Vivian  Vance were a perfect team.  The candy factory conveyor belt scene is one of  those moments that will leave you laughing out loud everytime you see it.   The other episode with Bob Hope is amusing, but not one of the more  outstanding episodes of the series.  However, there is a great rapport  between Hope and Lucy, and their scenes are enjoyable.  But the reason to  purchase this video is to spend some time with the Ricardos and Mertzes as  they discover that everybody's jobs have their good points and bad points!
