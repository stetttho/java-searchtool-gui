 Pat O'Brien stars as a dectective at New York City's Bureau of Missing Persons, where people go to find loved ones that have disappeared.  O'Brien has been transferred there to learn more about proper police work, guided by the Bureau's chief, Lewis Stone, a man who can be tough and compassionate, depending on the situation.  A lot of stories come through the Bureau, and a number of them are nicely woven into the subplot.  O'Brien becomes involved with one of his clients, a mysterious young woman played by Bette Davis, who claims to be looking for her new husband.  There seems to be more to the story than she says, and that soon becomes apparent.  I really enjoyed this film a lot.  In many ways, it is a typical Warner Brothers 1930's film.  There's plenty of tough talking dialogue, tight editing, and no-nonsense acting.  O'Brien comes on strong with a solid performance, Stone is wise and all-knowing, and Davis is unusually, but effectively understated.  Glenda Farrell, as O'Brien's money-grabbing wife, is a lot of fun.  Director Roy Del Ruth keeps it all moving at a very quick pace, and I really like the way the camera zooms back and forth between scenes, giving you a real sense of the urgency in the story.  That's an unusual technique for films of that time.  I also got a sense of the atmosphere of New York in the 1930's, which added to the film's effect.  The story is surprisingly fresh for today's audiences, the dialogue is a lot of fun, and the film moves along very well.  I'd recommend spending some time in the Bureau of Missing Persons.
