 Objective Burma is a gritty, suspenseful account of American paratroopers dropped behind Japanese lines in Burma to destroy one of the Japanese radar stations.  They end up trapped behind enemy lines and need to walk and fight their way out.  Errol Flynn stars as their leader, and it's easily one of the best performances I've ever seen him give.  Instead of his usual dashing heroics and cocky attitude, he plays this character with maturity and subtlety, and he is never less than convincing.  The locations look very realistic and atmospheric, the sounds of animals and the swamp becoming an important feature of the soundtrack.  Director Raoul Walsh paces the film well, building tension expertly and balancing the human elements of the story with excellent episodes of action.  This is one of the better WWII movies to come out of Hollywood during the war.
