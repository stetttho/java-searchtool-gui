 I think that Lover Come Back is the best of the Doris Day/Rock Hudson romantic comedies.  The humour is sharper and more adult, and all the actors nail their characters down perfectly.  Day and Hudson are rival advertising executives, with Day using the by-the-book approach, and Hudson wining, dining, and providing female companionship to lure and sign clients.  Through the kind of mixups you expect from one of their movies, Day comes to believe that Hudson is a client, and then things become complicated.  Tony Randall plays Hudson's boss, an insecure man that wants to protect himself above anything else, but who ends up paying the price over and over for Hudson's antics and schemes. The dialogue has a lot of funny lines and innuendos, and the three leads play it with relish.  The supporting cast of Edie Adams, Ann B. Davis, and others, all add to the fun.  Director Delbert Mann has a sure touch and keeps the film moving along briskly, and even though you can pretty much guess the conclusion, it's a lot of fun getting there.
