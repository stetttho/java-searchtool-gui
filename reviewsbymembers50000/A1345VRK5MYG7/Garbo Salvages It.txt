 Greta Garbo stars in this adaptation of Tolstoy's famous novel as the title character, a woman whose loveless marriage leads her into the arms of another man ... and then to tragedy.  Garbo, always fascinating to watch, is very strong in the role of a woman torn between her love for an officer and sacrificing her child.  Fredric March, as the officer she loves, does not register as strongly.  It's difficult to see the attraction he holds for Garbo.  Basil Rathbone, playing Garbo's rigid husband, is appropriately cold, while the rest of the cast walks through their roles without much notice.  All in all, the film failed to engage me to any great degree.  The screenplay is stiffly written, with little time given to showing how the lovers' relationship developed, and several wooden moments of dialogue that fall flat.  Were it not for the presence of Garbo, I don't think there would be much to recommend in it.  From the great moment at the beginning where her face first emerges from the smoke by the train, she gives the film whatever magic it has.
