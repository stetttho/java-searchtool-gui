 Rock Hudson stars as a hard drinking newspaper man who wants to do a story on stunt flyers at a show, but finds himself drawn into the world of one flyer in particular.  The flyer is played by Robert Stack, a war hero with ice in his veins, whose wife does parachute stunts, and whose son worships him.  Dorothy Malone is his wife, while Jack Carson is his mechanic who is in love with Malone.  Before long, even Hudson finds himself in love with Malone as well, and he is also fascinated by the couple's compelling story.  With everyone in love with Malone, things of course get complicated.  This is another heated film from director Douglas Sirk, featuring several of his actors from his overheated classic "Written on the Wind".  Everyone gives charged performances as would be expected, although I found Hudson's character a little difficult to understand.  Hudson is fine, but I think the character was not written well enough, although he has a number of grandstanding speeches.  Carson is quite good in his smaller role.  The film certainly isn't boring, since Sirk knows how to keep your attention with music, photography, and drama.  But like so many of Sirk's other films, subtle it isn't.  If you're in the right mood, you will enjoy it.
