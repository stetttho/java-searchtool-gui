 Van Heflin stars as a struggling rancher who agrees to guard outlaw Glenn Ford for $200 as he is being escorted to jail in Yuma.  Ford killed a stagecoach driver while robbing the coach, but he is backed by a loyal gang that everyone fears.  Heflin is assisted by town drunk Henry Jones.  There's a lot going on in this brief, tense western.  The relationship between Heflin and Ford is really interesting, as Heflin finds more courage than we thought he had, and Ford makes his character almost likeable as  he mentally works over his captor.  There is also an interesting relationship between Heflin and his wife, quite complicated given their brief time together on screen.  She seems to question his courage and strength of character.  Director Delmer Daves gradually builds the tension, but never allows it to let-up, propelling the story to its exciting conclusion.  The centerpiece of the film is the performances of the two stars.  Ford, not a great actor as a rule, really digs into this character and makes him quite memorable, while Heflin, a favourite character actor of mine, is totally convincing as the beleaguered farmer, forced into the role of hero that he never wanted, but wants to prove he can handle.  This may not be a very well known film, but it should be considered one of those hidden treasures that it's fun to unearth.  Suspenseful, well written, with enough action and atmosphere to make it a classic western.  Look for this one!
