 In a stunning performance, Ben Kingsley stars as the famed Indian leader who showed the world that non-violent resistance was an alternative (and better) way to bringing about change and political justice.  From his rise to prominence in South Africa, fighting against unfair racial laws, to his role in bringing about the independence of India from England, Gandhi stood firm with his ideals and maintained a simple life.  Director Richard Attenborough fills Gandhi's story with beautiful visuals, yet doesn't shy away from presenting the brutality of violence that Gandhi tried to avoid and end.  Kingsley is simply amazing in the lead, seemingly inhabiting the body of his character.  The supporting Western cast are often little more than cameos, well done although not necessary, and the Indian cast are excellent.  The pace is a little too slow at times, but the film is rich in atmosphere and the photography is beautiful.  I knew very little about the life of Gandhi prior to viewing this film, and I come away with a knowledge of who he was and an appreciation and respect for what he stood for.  Once again, I am reminded of how the actions of one man can affect the world and the power of standing by what one believes in.
