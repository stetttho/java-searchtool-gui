 Loretta Young stars as a career girl on her way up in the business world at the expense of her marriage and ideals.  She has moved to New York to find work while her husband's band is touring in Europe.  She lands a job at an advertising agency, where her beauty is considered as much of an asset as her skill.  She immediately gets the attention of her boss, Ricardo Cortez, and when her husband arrives back from Paris, things get very complicated.  This is another one of the pre-Code films of the early Thirties that gets away with dialogue and situations that films made a few years later couldn't.  The theme of the career girl trying to make it in a man's world is a good one, and this film addresses it, but not enough.  It's the more interesting part of the story, but the marriage problems take over about half way through the story.  Another problem with the movie is that Young's relationship with Cortez is far more interesting than her relationship with her husband, Frank Albertson.  It's hard to see why she wants to be with him.  Young, beautiful as always, is alright in the central role.  Cortez is appropriately smooth as the man on the chase, while Albertson acts like a teenager in love.  The standout in the film is actually Joan Blondell, in a small role late in the film as the girl being used to set up their divorce.  She wisecracks and brings an energy to the film it is otherwise missing.  That's the ultimate problem with the film - it's lacking energy or any spark.  Allowing for its age, it's competently made and acted and worth seeing as an example of the pre-Code films, but more could have been done with the story.
