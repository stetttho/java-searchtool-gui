 The Bridges at Toko-Ri is a simple, yet powerfully told story of Navy pilot William Holden, really a lawyer and father of two daughters, questioning his role and purpose during the Korean War.  Having narrowly escaped two brushes with danger, he finds himself being sent on a mission he fears may be his last.  Holden is quietly excellent in this role, thoughtfully playing the real man behind the hero.  I was somewhat surprised by the film's questioning of the war, having assumed that a film made during the Korean War would feature the usual flag waving cliches.  I enjoyed the film's honesty, the realistic depiction of the attitudes of its characters, and I especially enjoyed the flight sequences, well filmed and exciting.  It's a terrific, mature depiction of war.
