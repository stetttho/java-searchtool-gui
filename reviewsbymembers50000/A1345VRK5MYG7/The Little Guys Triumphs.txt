 I have to admit that I have never been a big fan of Frank Capra's directing or the stories he chose.  But this movie scores for me.  James Stewart is simply amazing as Jefferson Smith, the naive young man who  discovers that Washington and politicians are not what they seem to be.   Jean Arthur, an actress who seems to be forgotten these days, is excellent  as the secretary who has seen it all.  Claude Rains and Harry Carey do well  in supporting performances as a senator and the president of the Senate.   The underlying themes about political corruption and the power of the  people still work today.  The scenes surrounding the filibuster are  unforgettable, and you'll find yourself routing for the little guy,  something I thought I was too cynical to do myself.
