 Harrison Ford was a great choice to take over the role of Jack Ryan in Patriot Games.  Ford has that everyman quality that works really well when he finds himself and his family (wife Anne Archer and daughter Thora Birch) thrust into international events when they witness an assassination attempt on a British royal.  Ford thwarts the attempt, which makes his family revenge targets.  The assassins, an Irish militant group, counts amongst its members, a hotheaded Sean Bean who makes it his mission to kill Ford, Archer, and Birch.  But needless to say, Ford has other ideas! Patriot Games is a well-crafted thriller from director Philip Noyce.  He keeps the tension going from the beginning, mixing periodic bits of action into the drama that drive the film to its' climax.  There's also a good mix of gadgetry and politics to spice the plot up as well. Ford does a great job portraying the hero as a family man out to protect his loved ones.  Archer is an ideal, classy wife, and Birch isn't the typically annoying or cute movie kid ... she's very likeable.  Samuel L. Jackson is wasted in a smaller role as Ford's buddy, while Bean and Patrick Bergin make the most of their bad guy roles. I've seen a lot of action films that have the heart stopping chases and intrigue, but Patriot Games is a step above them.  It's a great combination of cast, director, story, and action, and it holds up to repeated viewings.
