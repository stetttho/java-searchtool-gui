 Wayne Morris, Ronald Reagan, and Eddie Albert star as three senior cadets in their final year at the Virginia Military Academy.  The question that hangs over them is whether they will graduate, since they have a talent for getting themselves into trouble.  Morris drags Reagan into many of his schemes, including chasing girls, while Albert has caught his girl, marrying her (which is against the rules).  To top it off, she's also pregnant.  The cast is up for the various shenanigans, playing their parts with a lot of energy.  Albert is particularly memorable as the cadet trying to concentrate on graduating while his personal life is upside down.  The girls are played by Priscilla Lane, Jane Bryan, and Jane Wyman.  Only Wyman really makes an impression.  It's fun to see life in the Academy and to see Reagan and Wyman before they were big stars.  Some of the humour wears thin and there are certain lapses in logic, but everyone is so likeable it's easy to overlook.
