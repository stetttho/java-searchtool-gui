 Dinner at Eight offers a chance to see some of the greatest stars of the early Thirties all together in one film.  Lionel Barrymore stars as a failing businessman whose wife, Billie Burke, is putting on a dinner party for an English nobleman.  Their engaged daughter Madge Evans is in love with an alcoholic has-been actor John Barrymore, while Lionel's doctor Edmund Lowe is having an affair with Jean Harlow, the wife of Lionel's business opponent Wallace Beery.  Added into this mix is Marie Dressler as an aging former actress and friend of Lionel's who is in need of money.  It's quite a collection of characters coming together for one evening, especially when they are played by the actors in these roles.  Jean Harlow gives one of her best performances as the tough social climber, and her fight scenes with Beery are well played by both.  The Barrymore brothers have the serious roles in the film and play them with great skill, with special credit going to John who comes so close to playing himself it's almost uncomfortable to watch.  Burke is very funny as the hostess trying to impress everyone as her party falls apart.  However, it's Dressler who has some of the best lines, and she plays them with relish.  Her acting in the closing scene alone makes the video worthwhile.  Yes, it is very talky and episodic as it moves from one subplot to another, but it all comes together at the end very well.  I do wish music had been included on the soundtrack, but this was early in the era of sound. But it's a funny, honest, and sophisticated comedy, and movie fans will want to seize the opportunity to see so many great stars in peak form!
