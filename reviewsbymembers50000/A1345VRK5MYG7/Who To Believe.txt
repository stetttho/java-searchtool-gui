 George Raft is a self described salesman travelling throughout Asia who gets tangled up in a Nazi plan to bring neutral Turkey into the war on their side.  He encounters spy Osa Massen on a train.  She's being followed, so she gives him an envelope containing forged plans to invade Turkey supposedly by the Russians so that Turkey will want to side with the Axis.  When she turns up dead later in Ankara, he finds himself the centre of attention, with various spies and plotters like Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Brenda Marshall after the envelope.  Raoul Walsh directs with his customary gusto, bringing lots of action to the twisting and turning spy story, culminating with a terrific chase scene.  The film is well plotted, with surprises thrown in to keep the viewer guessing.  Any film with Greenstreet and Lorre in it is usually worth watching, and they are as engaging as ever.  The action helps to mask Raft's typically colourless performance (Bogart would have been great in this one).  I love a good spy story, and this film did not disappoint me.
