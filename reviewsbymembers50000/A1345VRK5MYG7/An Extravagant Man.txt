 As someone who is not a fan of musicals, I was already at a disadvantage before the movie even started.  I fast forwarded through most of the numbers, and they looked dazzling enough and I'm sure would be entertaining for people who like that sort of thing.  I concentrated on the drama between the numbers, and with that I was quite satisfied.  William Powell is excellent as the famed, extravagant theatrical producer, Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.  The film chronicles the many highpoints and lowpoints of his career, as well as his two marriages.  Myrna Loy co-stars as his second wife, actress Billie Burke (Glinda the Good Witch from the Wizard of Oz), and although she gets second billing, she doesn't have much to do.  But the chemistry between her and Powell is once again a high point.  Luise Rainer, who had a brief career in Hollywood, stars as Anna Held, the first wife, a passionate, impulsive singer that Ziegfeld made a star of in America.  Rainer's scene on the phone has become quite famous, and she plays all of her scenes with great drama.  The film is a bit long, but it doesn't get boring, thanks to the stars, the story, and the great personalities that appear (Ray Bolger, Fanny Brice).  And for people that like musicals, this will probably entertain them even more.
