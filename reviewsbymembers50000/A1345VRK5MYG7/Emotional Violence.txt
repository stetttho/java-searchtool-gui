 The Heiress is an excellent, detailed production which seems to be getting the respect that is deserves lately.  It's the story of a plain and awkward girl who finds her love abused by not only a fortune hunter who does not  love her, but also by her widowed father who can barely hide the  disappointment and contempt he feels toward her.  As the awkward girl,  Olivia deHavilland gives what must be one of the most perfect performances  delivered on film by an actress.  Using everything including the tone in  her voice, posture, slight clumsiness, and her eyes, she flawlessly  portrays the character's evolution from innocence to bitterness.  She's  amazing.  Montgomery Clift portrays her would be lover, and he seems out of  place in the film, but upon reflection, it works because his character  wants to move up in the world, using deHavilland and her money as his  means.  He's not supposed to fit in.  Ralph Richardson plays her father,  and he's a strong presence in every scene.  Miriam Hopkins plays her  meddling aunt, and she provides some amusement amidst the emotional  turmoil.  William Wyler once again directs a detailed, mature film, and the  musical score by Aaron Copland perfectly fits the film.  The final scene is  memorable, as are some of the lines such as when Richardson puts down  deHavilland for wearing a red dress like her mother used to, saying that  her mother "dominated the colour".  I don't want to be sexist,  but as a man I admire the film for it's detail and performances.  However,  the women I know who have seen the movie react very emotionally  and  strongly to the story, because I suspect it hits a particular chord.  It's  certainly a film that leaves the viewer talking, and that's always a good  sign.
