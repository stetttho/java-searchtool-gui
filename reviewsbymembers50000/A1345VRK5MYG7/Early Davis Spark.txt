 Richard Barthelmess stars as the young son of a sharecropper who finds himself torn between his loyalty to other sharecroppers and to their landowner, for whom he has become a trusted employee.  Barthelmess disagrees with the exploitation of the sharecroppers by the landowners, but he also disagrees with the sharecroppers' response of stealing and unrest.  Complicating things for Barthelmess is the fact that he has fallen in love with the landowner's daughter, Bette Davis.  Barthelmess spends the whole movie looking confused, no doubt trying to figure out how anyone is going to believe him playing a young man.  He never seems to get a grasp of the character and he comes across as awkward, and at times, laughable.  Davis acts circles around him, very appealing in an early role as the tempting Madge.  She provides the film its only spark.  The direction of Michael Curtiz in this early sound film is admirable, and with a better leading man and tightened script, this could have been a much more memorable film due to its socially significant theme.  As it is, it's an interesting piece of early Thirties' cinema, containing one of the film world's famous bits of dialogue.  But it could have been more than it is.
