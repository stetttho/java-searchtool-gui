 They Died With Their Boots On features one of Errol Flynn's greatest performances as the flamboyant General Custer, and he plays him with humour and bravado.  He's well matched by his best leading lady, Olivia  deHavilland, who's given more of a character to work with than usual in the  Flynn films, and she brings humour and decency to the role of Mrs. Custer.   This was Flynn and deHavilland's final film together, and it showcases  their chemistry better than their other films, especially in their farewell  scene.  I don't think the history behind the screenplay is very accurate,  but then again, how many historical films from Hollywood are?  The action  scenes are well directed by Raoul Walsh (especially Custer's last stand),  and it's a good balance of drama, spectacle, action, and humour.  Although  the film runs for nearly two and a half hours, it never seems long.
