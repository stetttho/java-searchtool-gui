 Alec Baldwin stars as a lawyer in this true story of the re-trial of the murderer of civil rights leader Medgar Evers.  When Evers' widow Whoopi Goldberg approaches the District Attorney's office about re-opening the case of her late husband's murder, Baldwin takes an interest as he considers the injustice and the suffering of the Evers' family.  The first two trials, 25 years earlier, were declared mistrials, and the hunt begins for new evidence that might make a re-trial a viable option.  Needless to say, much stands in the way for Baldwin, both professionally and personally as he takes an unpopular stand in a still racially divided Mississippi.  Baldwin, a good actor that has appeared in too few good films, is strong in this role, although he is outshone by James Woods in a flashy performance as Byron de la Beckwith, the accused racist.  Woods has a field day, in heavy makeup and padding, make the most of his moments on screen.  Goldberg is very subdued, and I found her performance adequate, but a bit disappointing.  Actually, the film itself is quite subdued, too.  Director Rob Reiner is sloppy here, not establishing much in the way of pacing or tone, but he is fortunate that the subject of the film and the fact that it is true maintains the viewer's interest despite its shortcomings.  Although I recommend the film, especially to those who enjoy true stories and stories with a courtroom bent, I do wish a better film had been made about this important case in civil rights history.
