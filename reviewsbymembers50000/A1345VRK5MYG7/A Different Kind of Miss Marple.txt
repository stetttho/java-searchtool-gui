 Margaret Rutherford stars as a different kind of Miss Marple in this adaptation of an Agatha Christie novel.  Jane Marple sees a young woman strangled on a passing train, but since no dead body ever turns up, she's dismissed as a dotty old woman confusing reality with the mystery books she loves to read.  With the help of a bookstore owner companion, she determines where the body must have been dumped, and she then joins the household (of the estate owning the property) as a maid/cook to prove that what she saw really happened.  It's an unpleasant place to work and live, and it seems obvious that something sinister is going on.  The emphasis of this film is on light humour and entertainment, rather than the more serious approach of a typical Christie mystery.  Rutherford is a game choice for the role, clearly having a good time dashing about.  She's not how I pictured Miss Marple, but she's fun to watch.  The supporting cast aren't given much opportunity to develop characters, and I can't say the mystery had me riveted (I correctly guessed the killer, although I couldn't fill in all the details).  But the movie was entertaining and I enjoyed the tone and approach.  I hope to see more of the Rutherford/Marple mysteries.
