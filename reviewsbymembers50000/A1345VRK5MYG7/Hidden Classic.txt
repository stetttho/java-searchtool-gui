 Underground is a film that is hardly known today, perhaps because it lacks any major stars.  It's basically a B-movie cast in a film that is not produced to be just a programmer.  Set during the early days of World War Two, it features Jeffrey Lynn and Philip Dorn as German brothers involved on opposites of the conflict.  Dorn is a leader of the underground movement, while Lynn is a soldier fiercely loyal to the Fuhrer.  Dorn's underground members send out leaflets denouncing the Nazis, but more effectively, they broadcast an outlawed radio program that the Nazis want desperately to stop.  When Lynn falls in love with Kaaren Verne, another underground member, things get even more complicated.  The performers are all quite good (including Martin Kosleck as one of those detestable Nazis portrayed in WWII films), and director Victor Sherman, an accomplished director, tells the story very effectively.  It moves along well, builds up excellent suspense, and develops a lot of sympathy for its characters and their cause.  This is a great film to "discover", and I hope that on video, it will become more well known.  It deserves the attention.
