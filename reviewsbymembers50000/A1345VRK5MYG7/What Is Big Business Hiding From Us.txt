 Alec Guinness plays another one of the oddball characters he often played in 1950's British films, this time as an inventor/scientist of a miracle fabric that will not wear out or get dirty.  It seems like a great idea to him and to the owner of the factory where he makes it, but then the economic reality of it becomes an issue.  What will happen to fabric manufacturers and the clothing industry if clothing doesn't wear out?  Will unions let that happen?  Trapped in the middle of all this turmoil is Guinness, glowing in his white suit.  He delivers yet another terrific performance, and is well supported by so many fine British character actors.  The film is well written, although I found the first fifteen minutes or so a little confusing.  The premise is great, and it makes you question whether there are a lot of potential products not being invented because of their long term effects on big business, regardless of their usefulness to the general public!
