 Clark Gable owns a gambling club where he must deal with crisis after crisis with customers.  At home, his son loves him, but doesn't like him, his wife is trying to keep everyone happy, and his brother-in-law that lives with him and works for him is cheating him.  Not surprisingly, all the tension is giving him chest pains and making him re-evaluate his life.  The film starts off slowly, but picks up steam as it goes along, building to a very good conclusion.  Gable is terrific here, conflicted, tough, in crisis, and in charge.  Alexis Smith, somewhat underrated as an actress I think, is also strong as his wife that reveals a lot more toughness then she appears to have.  But as good as the leads are, it is the terrific character actors that support them that make this film memorable.  Marjorie Rambeau, Lewis Stone, Frank Morgan, and the great Mary Astor all contribute top performances, each actor bringing a lifetime of experiences to their characters.  The script has some great lines (courtesy of future director Richard Brooks) and takes a serious look at the effects of gambling on individuals and families.  When you get past the first forty-five minutes or so, the film really picks up and becomes quite good.
