 Fans of murder mysteries, especially those of Agatha Christie, will want to check out this mystery about the murder of an American heiress (played by Lois Chiles) on board a boat sailing down the Nile.  Almost all the passengers on board have a reason to do away with her, and someone does the deed.  It's up to passenger and sleuth extraordinaire Hercule Poirot, this time played by Peter Ustinov, to exercise his little gray cells to find the answer as the bodies begin to pile up.  The mystery itself is quite entertaining to try and solve, with enough surprises to more than keep your attention.  Ustinov brings humour to the Poirot character, and is amusing in a different take on the famed fictional detective.  The supporting cast is filled with terrific actors, but unfortunately, they're not given much individual screen time to establish their characters.  However, Angela Lansbury as the drunken author of steamy romance novels has a field day with her character, staggering from scene to scene to great effect.  Mia Farrow also gets some juicy scenes.  Bette Davis and Maggie Smith, as wealthy, jewellery loving old woman and her much put upon nurse, have a great chemistry together, insulting each other with style, but they aren't given much else to do.  It's not often you see Davis blending into the background!!  Others, like Jack Warden, David Niven, George Kennedy, and Olivia Hussey, are effective in underwritten roles.  Victim Lois Chiles is quite stiff and doesn't deliver much of a performance at all.  But apart from not fleshing out the characters enough, the film maintains the suspense, is great to look at (great scenery and costumes), is well scored, and the climax of the mystery is quite satisfying.  Also, as an aside, it is unusually violent for a Christie story/movie, with repeated shots of murders.  All in all, it's good, but not great mystery entertainment.
