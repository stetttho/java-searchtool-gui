 Lana Turner stars as a woman who marries above herself into a powerful family, earning the dislike of her mother-in-law.  When she becomes involved with a notorious playboy who dies accidentally, her mother-in-law uses it as an excuse to get rid of her, forcing her to leave the family and her child, assuming a different identity.  Her life spirals downward out of control, until she ends up in jail, charged with murder and being defended by her now grown-up son.  There are a lot of holes in this story which relies far too much on coincidence and the stupidity of its characters to advance the plot.  Turner is the standout of the film, shedding her typical glamour as the character falls apart.  She makes the most out of the role as its written.  The supporting cast are given two-dimensional characters to impersonate.  John Forsythe barely registers a performance, while the great Constance Bennett barks out her nasty character.  The music telegraphs all the emotions at the start of every scene.  I'm not a fan of soap opera, but I can watch it if it's handled with a subtle touch.  Subtle wouldn't be the word for this movie.  Think "heavy-handed and plastic".
