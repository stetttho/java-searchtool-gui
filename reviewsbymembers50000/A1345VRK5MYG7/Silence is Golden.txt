 Johnny Belinda must have been a groundbreaking film for its time.  The subject matter of the film surprised me for a movie made in the 1940s.  Three aspects of the story impressed me.  For one thing, the movie clearly  demonstrates the way that a deaf-mute person can communicate and that they  are not stupid (a "dummy"), as people used to assume.  The viewer  can learn a lot about sign language, and this must have been new to  audiences of the forties.  Another fascinating thing is the fairly  straightforward handling of the rape and its after effects.  There's  nothing graphic about it, but the movie doesn't attempt to really skirt  around the sensitive subject matter the way older movies used to due to  censorship and moral codes.  I was also impressed by the realistic  depiction of the small town where Belinda lives.  Their attitudes and  feelings of superiority ring very true.  As the central character, Jane  Wyman gives a very good performance, communicating Belinda's confusion,  fears, and growing maturity without the benefit of words.  Lew Ayres is  good as the doctor, and Charles Bickford and Agnes Moorehead give terrific  supporting performance (which they usually did) as Belinda's tough but  loving father and aunt. Johnny Belinda is an adult, honest, and well-made  movie.
