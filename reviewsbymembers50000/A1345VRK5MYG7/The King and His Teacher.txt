 Irene Dunne stars as a widowed single mother who is engaged to teach the numerous children of the King of Siam.  Rex Harrison stars as the King, a man trying to bring Siam into the modern world and to find respect for himself and his country on the world stage.  Ultimately, he comes to rely on Dunne for her support and guidance to achieve his goals, and there is an obvious feeling of attraction that develops between the two.  Dunne delivers yet another solid, emotional performance as the independent woman who must learn to adapt to a new culture.  Dunne was always such a pro, yet surprisingly is not as well known today as other actresses from her time.  Harrison strikes me as an odd choice for the role of the King, but he grew on me as the movie progressed, and although I think he's not the best choice, he nonetheless delivers a credible performance.  Gale Sondergaard, a favourite character actress of mine, is very good and quietly effective as the King's ignored first wife, looking out for the interests of her son, the heir.  I don't know how much of the story is really true, but it is entertaining and a good look at another time and place in history.  It's an excellent production, and even if you've seen the musical, I'm sure you'll enjoy this version, too.
