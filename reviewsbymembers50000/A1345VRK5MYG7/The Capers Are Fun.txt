 Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones star as a pair of world class thieves who join forces under confusing circumstances to pull off two very impressive heists.  Throughout the film, we're never quite sure of each one's motives since there is a general tone of "all is not what it seems."  The preparation for the capers and the capers themselves are the highlights of the film.  They have enough suspense and technical wizardry and gadgets to entertain the viewer.  But Connery and Zeta-Jones have little chemistry together, and their relationship strains credibility far more than the capers do.  Maury Chaykin plays a strange crime kingpin in Malaysia, but the character is barely used and ill-defined.  This script needed another re-write and perhaps a more stylish director.  It's an interesting film, but not a very good one.
