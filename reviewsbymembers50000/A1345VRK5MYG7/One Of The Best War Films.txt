 Bataan has to be one of the best war films I have ever seen.  Robert Taylor is the sergeant leading a small group of men in the Philippines trying to hold off the Japanese by destroying a bridge that the Japanese keep rebuilding over and over.  There's a sense of doom as you watch the film, since there is no way this motley crew of men can hold of the Japanese forever, and it does take on an "And Then There Were None" quality as the men fall one by one throughout the story.  But the fighting is tough, brutal, and realistic, and all of the actors play their roles with conviction, with particular praise going to Taylor and Robert Walker.  I would highly recommend this film to fans of war and action movies.
