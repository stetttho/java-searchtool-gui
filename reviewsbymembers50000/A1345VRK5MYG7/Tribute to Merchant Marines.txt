 Humprhey Bogart is part of a great ensemble cast in this WWII film that demonstrates the important contribution of the merchant marines.  Bogart  and Raymond Massey are solid as officers on board the ship, both committed  to their careers and country, and both eager to return to the women they  have left at home (Julie Bishop and Ruth Gordon).  Among others on board is  the always likeable Alan Hale, as well as Dane Clark, who gives a good  performance as an intense sailor questioning his commitment to the cause.  Lloyd Bacon doesn't direct with much style, but he punches across all the  action scenes and keeps the film moving.  Watching this film, I developed a  greater respect and knowledge for the role the merchant marines played  during WWII.
