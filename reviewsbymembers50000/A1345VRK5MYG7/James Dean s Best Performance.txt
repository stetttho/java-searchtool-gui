 Although this may be the least known of Dean's three major films, I think this is by far his best performance and the one that most fully explores his talent.  Dean stars as the troubled son of Raymond Massey, always trying to please his father, but without much success.  Richard Davalos is Dean's brother, and he has his father's love and the love of a sensitive young girl played by Julie Harris.  The boys are named Cal and Aaron, which reminds us of Cain and Abel, and so does their relationship.  Dean gives one of those raw, emotional performances that is sometimes almost uncomfortable to watch it is so real.  The rest of the cast is also excellent, with Jo Van Fleet giving an edgy portrayal of the boys "lost" mother.  The struggle for approval and the feeling of not fitting in is one that we can all appreciate, and it is sensitively and dramatically presented.  The Steinbeck story is a classic, and in the hands of director Elia Kazan and his terrific cast, so is the movie.
