 Nicholas Cage stars as a Secret Service agent assigned to protect former first lady Shirley MacLaine.  MacLaine has a difficult personality, and being guarded by Cage, a by-the-books man, causes a lot of friction between the two.  She won't let him be reassigned, yet she seems bent on messing with him every chance she can get.  It turns into one of those love-hate relationships that have fueled many a film, but this one works better than most.  Cage and MacLaine are both excellent choices for their roles, giving the kind of quality performances you'd expect, with an unexpectedly good chemistry between them.  I wish Cage would appear in more films like this, since I often find his choice of pictures puzzling.  The rest of the cast takes a backseat to the star performances.  The writing is good, allowing the relationship to develop naturally between the characters.  I do wish there had been a few more laughs and that the ending had not come so quickly.  I don't know if relationships develop between Secret Service agents and the people they are assigned to protect, so I don't know how realistic this was, but I really liked the characters, found the story amusing, and enjoyed the film a lot.
