 A law student investigates the murder of his younger brother, a murder that is being covered up as suicide, because those likely involved are the richest of the rich with considerable influence and power.   Everything the rich in this story do is over the top, but unfortunately so is the writing of author James Patterson ( and Peter De Jonge).  The book starts out with a promising premise, but it evolves into an unrealistic revenge fantasy that reads more like a bad movie script, with little character development, and action that stretches credibility more than just a bit.   With characters filing in and out of each short chapter, there's little chance to get to know them as anything more than plot devices.  The hero's grandfather and investigator-girlfriend are the most interesting and deeply written (Patterson obviously had an affection for them), while the numerous villains are predictable and so darkly written they become boring.  As for the hero, Jack Mullen, he's bland and not nearly as developed as one would expect for the main character.  Patterson's plot really falls apart once Mullen begins to avenge his sleazy brother's murder.  Moments of dialogue are overwritten or stretching to be too clever.   Yes, with its short chapters Beach House is a quick, easy read.  But I kept getting the feeling as I read it that Patterson was already looking ahead to the movie deal as he wrote it, with lots of short, choppy scenes instead of a flowing narrative that wouldn't require the charisma of multi-million dollar leading man to pull it off.
