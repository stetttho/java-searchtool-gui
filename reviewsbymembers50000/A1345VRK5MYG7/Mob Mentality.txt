 The Ox-Bow Incident is the best film that I have seen to look at the dynamics and mentality of a mob.  In this story, three innocent men are captured and accused of the death of a rancher.  Although Henry Fonda, a  drifter, tries to change the mind of the mob, everyone wants  "justice".  The lives of three men hang in the balance.  Fonda,  as usual, is excellent in his role of the man trying to convince the  others, similar in a way to his role in 12 Angry Men.  Dana Andrews, as one  of the accused men, gives a heartfelt, unusually emotional performance.   The movie is short (75 minutes), which means the action moves at a good  pace, and the black and white photography adds to the starkness of the  whole situation.  This is a western that takes a sharp look at how mobs  function, and it presents a lot of unfortunate truths.
