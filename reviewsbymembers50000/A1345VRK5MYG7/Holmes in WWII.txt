 Sherlock Holmes gets transported to WWII in this episode of the classic film series, as Holmes tries to protect a scientist who has devised a new kind of bomb sight that will help the English in their battle against the Germans.  However, he is up against his old foe Professor Moriarity who wants to sell the information to the Germans.  A lot happens in the space of just over an hour, which is a good thing, as the film is filled with disguises, tricks, a secret code, and Holmes' life hangs in the balance more than once.  Of course, Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce are good as usual, with Rathbone getting to disguise himself a few times and doing a good job of it.  Lionel Atwill is Moriarity in this film, and he's sinister as always.  I enjoyed the quick pace of this film, plus all of the twists and turns.  I'm hoping to see more films in this series.
