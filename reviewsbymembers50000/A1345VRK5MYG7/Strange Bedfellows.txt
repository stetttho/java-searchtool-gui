 I'm usually pretty hit-and-miss with Woody Allen films, and in this case, it was a definite hit.  The film explores the behind the scenes goings-on of a 1930's Broadway show being put into production.  John Cusack stars as the self-important young writer/director who finds his play bankrolled by a Mafia kingpin, which necessitates having the kingpin's mistress in the play.  Chazz Palmenterri plays the mistress' bodyguard, a man who has a knack for re-writing scenes.  The actors in the play are Dianne Wiest, Jim Broadbent, Tracy Ullman, and Jennifer Tilly.  All the performers in the movie are exceptional, with special praise to Wiest and Tilly.  The dialogue is typically funny for an Allen film, and the plot moves along well.  The behind the scenes aspect of the film works very well, and Allen does an amazing job (along with the production team) of re-creating a 1930's atmosphere.  The film speaks about the need for art to be accessible to everyone, and not simply a self-indulgent activity that strokes one's ego.  This is certainly one of Allen's most accessible films.
