 Dennis Morgan and Jack Carson play themselves in this film featuring the duo trying to get waitress Doris Day a job as the leading lady in their next film.  They're giving the producer a nervous breakdown with their repeated attempts to get his attention on Day.  As they make their way around the studio, there are a number of cameos by some of Warner Bros star contract players. Morgan and Carson are not exactly a great comedy team, but then again, they're not exactly given great comedy material to work with.  Day is perky as usual and has a couple of good songs.  Most of the cameos aren't particularly noteworthy, despite the presence of Ronald Reagan, Jane Wyman, Sydney Greenstreet, Eleanor Parker, Patricia Neal, and Edward G. Robinson.  Gary Cooper is amusing in a bit as his typical "man of few words" cowboy.  The funniest moment in the movie is supplied by, of all people, Joan Crawford, who does a dead-on job of making fun of her tough Warner Bros screen persona. Were it not for the star cameos, the film would be completely forgettable, and even they aren't that effective.  The songs, story, and performances are pretty bland.  It's not a horrible way to fill an hour and a half, but I doubt the film will make much of an impression on most viewers.
