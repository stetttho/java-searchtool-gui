 His Girl Friday is one of the most famous comedies from the classic film  era, and its reputation is well earned.  Superior acting, directing, and  writing combine to create a unique film that holds up with every viewing.   Rosalind Russell and especially Cary Grant appear to be having a great time  in their roles, and their comedic timing during their verbal clashes is  perfect.  Grant plays the wily newspaper editor with just the right mix of  charm and mischief, while Russell brings intelligence and equal doses of  vulnerability and toughness to her role.  What a match!  Howard Hawks  directs with a lot of energy so that dialogue is fired at machine gun pace,  and the viewer needs to pay close attention so as not miss anything.  This  comedy has carved out its own niche in the history of film, and should be  considered required viewing by anyone who "seriously" loves film  comedies.
