 For those expecting the usually exciting and florid performance from Bette Davis, this film may come as a bit of a surprise.  Davis is subdued, but very effective, as the wife of an anti-fascist German freedom fighter  during World War Two, who has come home to her family in Washington so that  she, her husband, and her children may have a rest from the difficult and  dangerous life they have been leading.  Paul Lukas gives a sincere and  quietly emotional performance as her heroic husband who must make some  difficult decisions to protect his friends and family.  Lucille Watson is  terrific as Davis' strong and opinionated mother, while the young actors  who portray the children are a bit stiff.  The movie has a number of  political speeches about anti-fascism that would have been appropriate  since the film was released during the War, but the strong characters and  drama of the story don't allow the speeches to dominate.  Watch on the  Rhine is an unusual film for Davis, but it is certainly a good one.
