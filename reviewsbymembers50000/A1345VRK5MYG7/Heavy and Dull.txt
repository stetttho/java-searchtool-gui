 Ughh. It was a rainy day when I watched this film, and as dreary as the day was outside, this film managed to beat it.  Edmund Purdom stars as the Egyptian in the title, a physician who starts out with the right ideals, but gets sidetracked often. The film follows his journey from nobody to the Pharaoh's personal doctor to nobody again.  Along the way he encounters ambitious soldier Victor Mature, barmaid with the bangs Jean Simmons, one-eyed conman Peter Ustinov, wimpy Pharaoh Micheal Wilding, hard as nails sister of the Pharaoh Gene Tierney, and vamping Bella Darvi, the femme fatale.  Those characters may sound interesting, but they're not in the least.  Maybe it's the terrible writing, but the performances are flat and dry, although Darvi was so awful she had me laughing, which at least got a reaction from me.  The Egyptian neither inspired or moved me.  I suspect it could have been better, although the writing, acting, and directing would have needed a complete overhaul.  I would recommend watching some of the other historical epics of the Fifties before choosing this one.
