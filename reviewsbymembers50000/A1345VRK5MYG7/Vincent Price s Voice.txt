 I usually enjoy the Universal Horror Films of the Forties because they are quick, not to be taken seriously, and very entertaining.  This film is no exception, and in fact is better than most of them.  Vincent Price stars as a man wrongly accused of murder who is injected by his friend John Sutton (a doctor and the brother of the Claude Rains character in the first film) with a serum to make him invisible and able to find the real killer.  Nan Grey is Price's girlfriend who helps him along the way.  The special effects are good, and the climactic chase between Price and the killer is very well done.  Price was a perfect choice for this film, which requires an actor with a great voice, since that is the actor's only asset for most of the film.  Price (like the great Claude Rains before him) had an excellent, distinctive voice that he uses to great effect, portraying his descent into madness superbly.  This film is a lot of fun to watch.
