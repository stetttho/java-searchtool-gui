 Helena Bonham Carter stars as the young girl who for nine days was Queen of England.  Lady Jane Grey was Henry VIII's niece and a staunch Protestant.  Through political machinations, the dying King Edward (a teenager) makes his cousin Jane his successor, not the legitimate choice, his very Catholic sister Mary.  Jane is forced into an arranged marriage to facilitate the move and soon finds herself on a throne she never wanted.  Her husband gives her much support, and the two decide to make changes that will benefit the long suffering common man.  But Mary will not be denied her throne (and neither will her husband, the Spanish king).  Queen Jane is removed and condemned to death, quite a common fate back then.  The acting is tops, with Bonham Carter and Cary Elwes as her husband delivering excellent performances, surrounded by a cast of pros.  The sets, costumes, and other period details are terrific as well.  I wasn't expecting to see a romance film, which is what this movie develops into.  It's not very accurate, although the actors have a great chemistry and make it work.  I was expecting to see more of the political behind-the-scenes treachery, since the story of Lady Jane is rooted in religious conflict and personal ambition.  The politics of Tudor England are fascinating, and this film certainly deals with the political and religious climate, but I would like to have seen more.  Nonetheless, the film is well made and serves as a solid introduction to that critical time in English history.
