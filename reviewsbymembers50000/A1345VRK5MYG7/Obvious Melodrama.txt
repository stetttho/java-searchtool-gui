 Bette Davis stars in this melodrama as Joyce Heath, an actress that has been labeled a jinx due to the hard luck that befalls the men in her life and the productions she is associated with.  Once considered that brightest, rarest talent of her generation, she is reduced to an embarrassed alcoholic, unable to get work.  She is rescued by Franchot Tone, an architect and fan who wants to rehabilitate.  He's engaged to society girl Margaret Lindsay, who knows nothing of his "humanitarian" deeds.  Needless to say, Tone falls for Davis, and he begins to discover why his housekeeper Alison Skipworth has warned him against her ... she is dangerous.  You can't say Davis doesn't go for it with this performance.  She chews the scenery in her drunk and bitter scenes. She is more subdued and effective in the quieter scenes, when she reveals her character's vulnerability.  Tone is alright, not really making much of an impression, while Lindsay is boring in a badly written role that she does nothing with.  The screenplay is weak and obvious, and the melodrama came on too strong for my tastes.  I never really felt that these were real people, but rather just plot devices to keep the story moving along.  But Davis does help to keep it watchable.  You sort of get the impression she knew how bad this was, so she did whatever she could to salvage the film.
