 Lilian Hellman's original story is watered down and made palatable to 1930's audiences in this tale of a mean little girl who ruins the lives of her teachers at the private school she attends.  Merle Oberon and Miriam Hopkins are best friends and teachers at a school, and young Bonita Granville concludes that Hopkins has become involved with Oberon's boyfriend Joel McCrea.  Granville has gotten herself into trouble, so she spreads the rumour to deflect her concerned grandmother's attention.  Hopkins, Oberon, and McCrea are all fine, but it is Granville who takes the acting honours.  She is vicious, mean, and completely believable and dislikeable as the young girl who needs a firm hand.  Marcia Mae Jones as her weak accomplice, easily manipulated, is also convincing.  The movie illustrates well how a lie can grow and damage the lives of those involved.  The dialogue is terrific, and under director William Wyler's steady, dramatic hand, it moves along well.
