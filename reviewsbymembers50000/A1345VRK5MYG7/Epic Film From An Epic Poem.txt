 Following the success of Errol Flynn and Olivia deHavilland in Captain Blood, Warner Brothers quickly put them back together into another action film.  But it's a surprising pairing, since deHavilland's character isn't  in love with Flynn, but his brother instead.  Actually, the deHavilland  character and the love plot really arent' necessary, although they don't  take away from the film.  The movie is an action filled account of an ill  fated charge by the British against a much larger Russian army in India.   Tennyson wrote a famous poem about the incident, praising the British for  their bravery.  The movie explains the events leading up to the charge, and  as someone who is not a history expert, I'll accept the views of others  that say that the film is much more fiction than fact.  To me, that doesn't  matter, because it entertains nonetheless.  The musical score is terrific  (as any score by Max Steiner usually is), and Michael Curtiz's direction is  excellent, particularly in his depiction of the sweeping action.  One thing  is surprising.  Nowadays, as people have become more aware of protecting  animals in film and television, the climatic scene in this film is sort of  disturbing, given that you can see a number of horses being injured, if not  killed.  But overlooking that, Charge of the Light Brigade is an action  filled epic that is most impressive.
