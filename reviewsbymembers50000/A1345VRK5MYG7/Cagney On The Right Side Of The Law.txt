 James Cagney stars as a struggling lawyer who joins the FBI when his friend, an FBI agent, is killed while on duty.  Cagney's law studies were financed by a man with mob ties, but he turns his back on that to avenge the death.  He gets off on the wrong foot with his superior, Robert Armstrong, and Armstrong's sister Margaret Lindsay, but he quickly proves his courage and ability.  The cocky character played by Cagney is nothing new for him, although it's good to see him on the side of the law this time around.  The rest of the cast does well, with Ann Dvorak particularly fine as the wife of one of the gangsters, a former girlfriend of Cagney's.  When the action gets going, the film really picks up.  The Armstrong character isn't well written (or acted, for that matter), but other than that one drawback, the film is easy to watch and a real throw back to the Thirties way of presenting crime in movies - especially the great shoot-outs.
