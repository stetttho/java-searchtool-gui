 Charlton Heston stars as Buffalo Bill, who along with partner Wild Bill Hickock, played by Forrest Tucker, is attempting to set up the Pony Express to help connect California with the rest of the country. Beautiful Rhonda Fleming and her brother are part of a group trying to prevent that from happening, wanting California to go it alone, rather than be part of the Union. Not only must Chuck do battle with them, but there are also the Indians to consider, not to mention the nagging presence of Jan Sterling, a tomboy in love with him. Pony Express is not short on action and that is its saving grace. The plot and dialogue are routine, the direction uninspired, and the characters comes across as sketches. The beauty of Rhonda Fleming and the technicolor scenery helps to make this acceptable viewing. There could be a great movie made about the Pony Express. This just isn't it.
