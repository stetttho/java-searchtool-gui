 Ralph Richardson stars as Baines, butler to an ambassador, who is having an affair with an embassy employee.  The ambassador's young son Phillipe, played by Bobby Henrey, idolizes the butler.  When his wife accidentally  falls to her death following an argument with him, Richardson finds himself  the only suspect in her murder.  Henrey, believing Richardson to be guilty  but wanting to protect him, lies to the police to help out. But lies have  gotten Richardson into this mess, and more lies only make it worse.  The  film is quite suspenseful as it goes on, and the scene with the paper  airplane is justifiably well remembered for the way it ups the tension.   Richardson, as usual, is excellent, as is young Henrey and Sonia Dresdel as  the shrew wife.  The Fallen Idol grows on you with each passing frame and  lie.  It's another great film from 1940's England.
