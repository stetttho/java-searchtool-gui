 Paul Muni stars as a Chinese farmer who loves the land, but ambition overcomes him and he loses sight of what is really important to him.  Luise Rainer stars as his self-sacrificing wife, a timid woman with a strong will that quietly keeps the family together.  They most overcome the devastating effects of a drought, the Chinese Revolution, and most impressively, a locust plague which features remarkable special effects for 1930's Hollywood.  Everything in the film centres on the land, the "good earth", which gives life and is something a man can call his own.  Rainer doesn't get much in the way of dialogue, but her expressive face makes up for it, and she gives a touching performance as the tired, sensible wife.  Paul Muni, an actor somewhat forgotten these days, has a few good moments, but doesn't make the kind of strong impression he made in so many other films in the 1930's.  He just doesn't seem right for this role.  As the father and uncle, Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly offer good support.  The sets and photography are well done, and MGM obviously invested a lot of money into this picture.  The dialogue and screenplay could have used more work, but the film remains quite an achievement.
