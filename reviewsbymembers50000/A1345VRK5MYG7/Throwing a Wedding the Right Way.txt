 Bette Davis stars as an editor of a lifestyles magazine who is underpressure to complete a feature about a typical midwestern girl's ideal wedding, complete with a makeover of the bride's house and family.  To add to Davis' problems, the man hired to write the feature article is an old boyfriend who prefers writing about hard news instead of fluff pieces.  Robert Montgomery stars as her former flame, and as he, Davis, and the rest of her team invade the family's house to prepare for the wedding, the problems really start - for the family and the former lovers.  Montgomery gives a breezy, flip performance that adds much to the film.  Davis does well enough as the straight lady amidst the chaos, although this is one of the least memorable roles you'll ever see her in.  There aren't enough genuine laughs to make this a great comedy, and the potentially funny situations that could arise from Davis' magazine team making over the house aren't really explored.  It's a pleasant movie to watch, but little else.
