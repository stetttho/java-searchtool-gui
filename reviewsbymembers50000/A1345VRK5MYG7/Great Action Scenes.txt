 Gregory Peck is solid as usual as a British Naval captain who mixes it up with the Spanish and French, wins the love of a beautiful lady, and earns the respect of his crew through both his leadership at sea and his strength of character.  Virginia Mayo is the beautiful lady he falls in love with.  The action sequences as ships battle it out are exciting and very well filmed, which is to be expected in a film directed by Raoul Walsh.  The sight of the great boats attacking and manoeuvering around is a highlight of the film.  The rest of the film moves along well, although for me, it's the fighting and action that make this picture memorable.
