 Peter O'Toole stars as the reserved, quiet private school master who learns to relax and open up thanks to the love of a good woman, eventually earning the respect of all around him.  O'Toole gives an excellent performance, although having him sing wasn't the wisest choice.  Petula Clark is warm and cheerful as his wife, and they work well together.  Maybe if I was a fan of musicals, I might rate this one more highly, but they could have cut out every song and I wouldn't have cared.  There's nothing memorable about the musical numbers.  It's the story and O'Toole that carry the film.  The music should have been left out.
