 If it's directed by Cecil B. de Mille, you know there's going to be plenty of spectacle, and this film is no exception.  Joel McCrea stars as a man hired by the Union Pacific railroad to be a troubleshooter as the build the railroad across the country.  Not everyone wants to see it built, so sabotage causes lots of delays.  Things get even more complicated for McCrea because his old pal Robert Preston is partnered with Brian Donlevy, one of the men trying to delay the construction.  To add to it, Preston and McCrea are both in love with the same woman, an Irish lass named Molly played by Barbara Stanwyck.  Train wrecks, Indian attacks, brawls, and other De Mille touches enliven the story.  The actors aren't given much to work with, as in most De Mille spectacles, but they do well enough, although Stanwyck's accent is a little hard to swallow.  Akim Tamiroff and Lynne Overman, as men hired to protect McCrea, add a lot of humour to the film with their knowing performances.  The story moves along at a good pace, and although I like to make fun of Cecil B. De Mille movies, I must admit that I enjoyed this one more than some of the others I have seen.  I like the time period and the trains, and in De Mille's hands, it's certainly not boring.
