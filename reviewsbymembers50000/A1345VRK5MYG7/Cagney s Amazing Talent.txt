 James Cagney stars as a producer of prologues, which are short live musical numbers that precede talking films.  He is ably assisted by his secretary, Joan Blondell, who is obviously in love with him without his knowledge.  Dick Powell plays one of his performers who falls in love with Ruby Keeler, an office assistant who also blossoms into a performer.  Other members of the Warners Stock Company are along for the ride, including Frank McHugh, Guy Kibbee, Ruth Donnelly, Hugh Herbert, and Claire Dodd.  Cagney is having problems putting together his prologues, being cheated by his partners, and the women in his life other than Blondell are taking him for a ride too.  Cagney is in great form here, dominating (as usual) every scene he is in, including his dance number in the film's final musical sequence.  Blondell gives yet another likeable performance, tossing off the one-liners yet giving her character some heart.  I usually find Powell a bit irritating, and he holds true to form in this film, while Keeler's acting and dancing seem clunkier than usual.  But Powell and Keeler can be easily overlooked by the spectacle of Berkeley's musical numbers, the solid, quick direction of Lloyd Bacon, and by Cagney's star performance.  It's a shame that Warner Brothers didn't give Cagney a few more roles like this one that fully show his amazing talent.  His fans will definitely want to catch this film.
