 Hayley Mills and June Harding star as young girls sent to a convent school who manage to raise a little "hell".  Actually, their antics seem pretty tame these days, but it's the spirit that counts.  Rosalind Russell stars as the Mother Superior who must find the patience and humour to deal with the girls.  The movie is episodic, moving from one backfiring plan of the girls to the next.  From episode to episode, however, Mills gradually learns from the example set by the nuns and how they conduct themselves with humility and purpose.  She does a great job showing her character's gradual evolution.  Russell is commanding and honest and touching as the Reverend Mother.  Director Ida Lupino does a good job of balancing the gentle humour with the more dramatic moments of character revelation, and the musical score by Jerry Goldsmith really contributes to a number of scenes.  Not the funniest or greatest film ever made, The Trouble With Angels does succeed in showing us the value of humility and serving others without ever seeming preachy.
