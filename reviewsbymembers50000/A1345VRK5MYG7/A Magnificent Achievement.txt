 A lot of attention has been paid to how the studio butchered the film by imposing its own ending.  I hope that doesn't take away from this achievement by Welles.  The film, ending and all, is a carefully crafted  story about the fall of the Amberson family, and in particular, the  arrogant George Amberson Minafer.  The opening sequence, which sets up the  story of the family and its relationship to the community, is perfect and  sets the tone for the film.  Welles narration becomes as much a part of the  story as the characters themselves.  The cast is uniformly excellent, with  strong performances by Joseph Cotten, Tim Holt, Agnes Moorehead, and a  young and very beautiful Anne Baxter.  Moorehead, in particular, is  incredible in her role as the frustrated spinster aunt.  Her scenes toward  the end of the film are riveting.  I've watched this film several times and  I am still amazed by the simplicity of the story and the incredible detail  of the filmmaking.  It's difficult to imagine that the scenes edited out  could have improved this final product.
