 If you've seen Kid Galahad (also with Humphrey Bogart) then you already know the story of Wagons Roll at Night.  It's a remake which follows the same plot structure, but switches the subject from boxing to the circus.   Bogart runs a circus, and Sylvia Sidney is his girlfriend / fortune teller.   Eddie Albert joins the circus as a gifted lion tamer(!).  Bogart doesn't  have a high opinion of circus people (calls them gypsies), so he tries to  keep his people away from his young sister, Joan Leslie.  But it's not easy  to keep Joan and Eddie apart.  The performances are fine, and the use of  the circus is an interesting switch from the original.  The movie is short  (84 minutes), and thus it moves along well.  This is not one of Bogart's  famous films, and it's hardly a classic, but it's an easy way to pass an  hour and a half.
