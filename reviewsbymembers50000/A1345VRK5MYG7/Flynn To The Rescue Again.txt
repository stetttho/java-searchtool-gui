 The Sea Hawk is a more seriously toned swashbuckling tale than one would expect from Errol Flynn. However, since the film was released at the time when World War II was underway for England, that may be part of the reason.   Flynn is more subdued than usual as an English privateer that finds  himself a slave for the Spanish, after being trapped (as a result of  English court intrigue) in Panama.  The sequences in Panama were shot in a  sepia tint that adds to the atmosphere of overwhelming heat and humidity  and hopelessness in the swamps. Flora Robson is terrific as Queen  Elizabeth, playing her with humour and more humanity than others have.   Claude Rains gives his usual smooth performance as the Spanish ambassador.   Alan Hale, Donald Crisp, and Una O'Connor support the movie with their  always reliable acting.  Brenda Marshall plays Rains' niece and Flynn's  love interest,and although her performance is alright, Olivia deHavilland's  absence is felt.  Although the roles in the Flynn films may not of offered  her much, deHavilland offered them a lot of energy and chemistry with  Flynn, which this film could have used.  The action sequences and the movie  itself would have benefited from some tightening up by director Michael  Curtiz, but on the whole this is a well crafted pirate tale that  entertains.
