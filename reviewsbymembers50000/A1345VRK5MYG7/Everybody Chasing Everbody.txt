 Fred MacMurray stars as a pollster looking for a disappeared colleague in hillbilly country who gets mixed up with Marjorie Main and her half-witted brood trying to recover some hidden money.  The film is non-stop action, as everyone is chasing or running away from everyone else.  There's glowing animals (and the odd person or two) and it's set in one of those only-in-a-movie houses with secret passageways behind the walls.  The characters aren't played with much subtlety, and the laughs are sometimes forced, but it's all played with a lot of energy.  A better director might have given the film a little style instead of just hammering home every scene, but if you like a lot of slapstick and chase films, you'll probably enjoy this one a lot,
