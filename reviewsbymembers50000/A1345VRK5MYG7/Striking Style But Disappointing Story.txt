 Looks like I'm going to swim against the tide and give the film a negative review.  Lee Tracy stars as a fast-talking, wisecracking newspaper reporter trying to solve the case of a maniac killer who murders people on nights with full moons. The police have narrowed the chase to Doctor Xavier's (Lionel Atwill) labs, convinced that someone working there is responsible. Atwill devises a series of experiments to determine which of his fellow scientists might be the lunatic.  There is a very effective creepy feeling established in the film.  The early Technicolor glows, giving everything an eerie quality.  The sets are vintage horror film staples, and everybody seems weird.  The make-up is extremely well done as well.  The actors do as well as you can with this material.  Scream queen Fay Wray, as the doctor's daughter, does her thing, shreiking needlessly a few times.  But despite the impressive look, the film failed to engage me.  I found it slow moving, with a lot of holes in the script.  It's stylish and unique, but without a script to match it, I found it disappointing and long.  Horror film fans will definitely want to check it out, but others will probably find it tough going.
