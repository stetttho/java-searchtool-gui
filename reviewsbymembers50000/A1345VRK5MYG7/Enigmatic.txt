 Jane Fonda stars as a court appointed psychologist analzying a young nun at a French Canadian convent who has been accused of murdering her newborn baby.  The case has caused a scandal, and both the Church and Court want it resolved as quickly as possible.  But when Fonda begins questioning the young nun, Meg Tilly, and her Mother Superior, Anne Bancroft, it becomes clear that things are much more complicated than they would appear.  The film raises a lot of questions about miracles, Catholic dogma, and failings of the Church.  It also taps into that sense of secrecy in the Catholic Church, since so much happens behind close doors and in quiet, whether it be behind the walls of a convent or even the Vatican, or inside the small space of a confessional.  It doesn't answer a lot of the questions it poses, and in a certain sense, the ending was not completely satisfying.  But there's a lot to compensate for it.  The performances are quite good.  Anne Bancroft comes off best, with her stubborn, blunt Mother Superior trying to protect the young novice.  Meg Tilly is also wonderful as the innocent, enigmatic nun.  Jane Fonda is a bit one-note as the doctor, having a few good scenes along the way.  Director Norman Jewison creates a mood and atmosphere in the film that compliments the subject matter well.  Although it's not the blockbuster success you'd hope it would be, and although the subject matter had more potential than you will see here, the film is nonetheless involving and well made and certainly worth a look.
