 Kiss of Death is a crime thriller that kept me more involved then I was expecting.  Perhaps it's the fact that the Victor Mature character is pretty sympathetic.  Mature (a better actor than he was given credit for)  plays the internal conflicts of his character with a lot of conviction.   The location filming and the straightforward direction help to add a lot of  realism to the film.  The supporting cast, with the exception of Colleen  Gray, contribute good performances.  But it's Richard Widmark, in his film  debut, that leaves the strongest impression.  His giggling, psychopathic  killer Tommy Udo is one of the most memorable characters you'll ever see,  and the wheelchair scene is justifiably famous.  Kiss of Death is a  gripping crime drama.
