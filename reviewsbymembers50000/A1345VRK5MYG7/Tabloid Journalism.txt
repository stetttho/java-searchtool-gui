 Lee Tracy stars as a newspaper writer who makes a name for himself by writing a gossip column often dominated by news of "blessed events", which end up being stories about expected babies that are full of innuendo and scandal.  He feeds off of workers all over town for his stories, and daily libel suits only intensify his search for a great story or rumour.  Needless to say, people and their lives get ruined when he's on a roll.  Tracy is amazing in the lead, firing of dialogue like a champion.  He really has star presence, although his career in films never went anywhere.  He's supported by a good cast of familiar Warner Brothers faces like Ruth Donnelly and Ned Sparks.  A particular standout is Allen Jenkins as a henchman of a mobster.  Watch his face as Tracy describes in detail what it's like to be in the electric chair.  I was surprised by how open the film was about tabloid journalism, carrying a message that is still fresh today.  It is also a lot more adult than you would expect of a 1930's film, but it was made before the Production Code would have disallowed such things.  Like many of director Roy Del Ruth's film, it's filled with energy, fun performances, and some good camera work.  This is one to watch.
