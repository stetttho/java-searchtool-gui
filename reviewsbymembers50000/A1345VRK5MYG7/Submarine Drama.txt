 Destination Tokyo is a fine dramatic action film about life aboard an American submarine during WWII that is sent on a mission that puts them into Tokyo Bay.  Cary Grant stars as the captain who wishes he could be  with his wife and children and who has the total respect of his crew.  It's  a good performance, not typical of the character that you expect to see  Grant playing.  Members of the crew include John Garfield, who has a story  about every girl he's ever met; Dane Clark, an intense sailor with a reason  for hating the enemy; and Alan Hale as the cook, providing much of the  film's humour (as he often did in other movies).  The film has a series of  tense episodes, and mixes the drama and action well.  Other than saying  that it could have been shortened, the movie is quite good, and it must  have had a strong impact on audiences during World War Two who were able to  see what life on a submarine may have been like.
