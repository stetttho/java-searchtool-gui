 Rudolph Valentino stars as a Russian soldier who is out to avenge his father's death.  Valentino has been branded a deserter from the Army after rebuffing the advances of the Czarina, and running to his father's aid.  Things get more complicated for Rudy, though, because he falls in love with the daughter of the man responsible for his father's tragedy.  That's where the title of my review comes from (taken directly from a card in the movie).  The film might sound kind of silly, and it is, but it moves along quickly and has enough action to keep it entertaining.  Valentino is pretty good as the hero, and thankfully he doesn't overdo gestures and play to the back row like so many silent film stars had to, since they was no sound for dialogue.  Vilma Banky and Louise Dresser, as the girlfriend and Czarina, play it up more, but are generally effective in their roles.  I got more than I was expecting from this film, and I suspect most viewers will too.  I far and away prefer sound films over silent films anyday, but once in a while it is kind of fun to step back in film history and see how things used to be.
