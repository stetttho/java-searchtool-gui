 Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn star as prosecuting attorney and defence attorney of a woman accused of shooting her cheating husband.  The trial gets a lot of attention as Hepburn attempts to assert the need for equality in how women and men are treated when caught in similar situations, such as revenge against a cheating spouse.  She believes a man shooting his wife would be considered more justifiable.  The trial also gets a lot of attention since the lawyers are married.  Thus men and women are pitted against each other in yet another fight for equality.  Elements of the film have dated, mostly surrounding the trial itself and Hepburn's circus like attempts to make her point.  But what is not dated is the very real chemistry between the two stars, setting off sparks outside the courtroom.  Both were top actors, with screen personalities and styles that contrast each other perfectly.  Their talent and chemistry alone can carry a film.  They are well supported by the wonderful Judy Holliday, who makes her character just slightly off-centre enough to be believable.  The only sour note is David Wayne, as Hepburn's obsessed neighbour.  It's not that he doesn't do a good job - he does.  But the character is extremely annoying as written, and I found myself fast-forwarding through some of his parts.  But despite that and, as I said, the dated courtroom elements, the film is smart, with pointed dialogue, great performances, and of course, more than enough chemistry to make it well worth watching.
