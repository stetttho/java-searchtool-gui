 Wonder Bar is a nightclub in Paris owned by Al Jolson where the backstage dramatics more than equal the show being put on out front.  Dolores Del Rio and Ricardo Cortez are a dance duo that headline the show.  Cortez is a gigolo who uses women like Kay Francis, and Del Rio loves him in spite of it all.  Jolson is in love with Del Rio, and so is bandleader Dick Powell.  Passions and tempers flare.  To offset that drama, Guy Kibbee, Ruth Donnelly, Hugh Herbert, and Louise Fazenda are quarrelling American couples looking for some fun on the side.  They provide the film's comedy relief, but are not necessary to the plot and are given little to do.  Jolson does have a lot of charisma, which helps since Francis, Del Rio, Cortez, and Powell are given little to do and almost nothing in the way of character development.  In particular, I find the fact that Kay Francis was a big star in the early Thirties a bit puzzling.  I don't see the appeal.  The musical numbers are too long, and the less said about the very politically incorrect black face number "Going to Heaven on a Mule" the better.  Wonder Bar is a strange film that succeeds neither as a musical or a drama, yet at times it's fascinating to watch, sometimes for all the wrong reasons.  It manages to squeeze in comedy, romance, drama, murder, suicide, dance, and music into its short running time.  The mix doesn't work, but the film may be worth a look for those who enjoy films from the Era or for fans of Jolson.
