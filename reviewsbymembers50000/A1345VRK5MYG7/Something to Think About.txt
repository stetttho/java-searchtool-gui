 Inherit the Wind is a movie about ideas, and in the hands of master actors like Spencer Tracy and Fredric March, the ideas are well delivered.  March and Tracy bring the full force of their talents to their roles as opposing  lawyers (and one time friends) who face off on the issue of evolution vs.  Creation.  The fact that this is based on a real life court case only adds  to the drama.  Florence Eldridge, March's real life wife, is excellent as  March's movie wife who recognizes the flaws in her husband, but loves and  admires him anyways.  Harry Morgan also gives a solid performance as the  judge caught in a very controversial case.  Gene Kelly plays a very cynical  reporter and has some good scenes, but overall isn't completely effective.   The movie is full of dialogue, and is obviously based on a stage play, but  the ideas are so strong, the actors so dynamic, and there are enough scenes  away from the court case, so that the movie doesn't drag.  And of course,  the issues raised about freedom of speech and thought are still relevant  today. This is a movie and a story to learn from.
