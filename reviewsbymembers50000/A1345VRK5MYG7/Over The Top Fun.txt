 From the moment Olivia de Havilland sends the severed head rolling down the staircase at Bette Davis, you know it will be impossible to take Hush ... Hush, Sweet Charlotte seriously.  Just sit back, relax, and let director Robert Aldrich and his great cast go right over the top in this story of a Southern woman played by Davis being driven insane by her vicious cousin de Havilland.  Davis is probably the only actress who could have gotten away with playing this character with any credibility.  She dives full force into the roll of the aging Charlotte who has never gotten over the brutal murder of her teenage love, a murder everyone thinks she committed.  She's joined by Joseph Cotten in a weak performance as her doctor, Agnes Moorehead at her hammiest and most entertaining as Charlotte's protective slob of a housekeeper, the great Mary Astor as the bitter wife of Charlotte's dead love, and numerous other top character actors.  But it's de Havilland as the evil cousin Miriam who really steals the show.  Audiences accustomed to seeing de Havilland in sweet, gentle ladylike rolls will be surprised by how convincingly she could play a villainess.  There is an unusually long prologue to the story that drags a little, but the rest of the film moves along from one bizarre moment to the next at a good pace, and as over the top as the film is, it's fun and entertaining to watch such a great cast clearly having a good time with such outlandish material.  Toss in a haunting song and a few severed body parts, and it becomes a memorable movie!
