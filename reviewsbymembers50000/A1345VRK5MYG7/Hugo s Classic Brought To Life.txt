 Fredric March stars as Jean Valjean, a poor man sent to the galleys for stealing some bread for his sister and her child.  After the hardships of his imprisonment, he is naturally a changed man, but he reforms himself and becomes a productive, highly respected citizen.  In doing so, he violates the terms of his parole, and for that he has Charles Laughton, a police inspector, on his trail.  Although the pursuit anchors the film, there is more going on here, as the dignity and rights of all men, rich or poor, convicts or not, is also a strong theme of Victor Hugo's novel and the film.  March is excellent in his role, undergoing a number of physical transformations, while always conveying the honesty of the character underneath it all.  Laughton is forceful as ever, this time as the inspector that is blinded by the law and cannot see the humanity behind the actions of others.  The film has a number of chase sequences accompanied by music that will certainly remind viewers of a silent film.  I don't know anything about the director, but I suspect he may have come from that era.  The script weaves together the various elements of the story well, and viewers will come away from the film quite satisfied.
