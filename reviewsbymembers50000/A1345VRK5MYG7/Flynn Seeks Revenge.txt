 Errol Flynn stars as a cowboy out to get revenge on the cattle rustler that has stolen his cattle and the cattle of several other men.  He returns to San Antonio to settle the score, but before he can do that, he falls in love with Alexis Smith, the actress and singer performing at his enemy's saloon.  Needless to say, things get complicated.  This isn't the greatest of Flynn's westerns, although it's far from the worst.  There's just nothing new here.  Flynn was already starting to show the signs of the premature aging that would eventually lead to his death, and his performance lacks its usual fire.  Smith, however, plays her character well and looks beautiful in the great technicolor.  There is a terrific saloon shoutout/brawl, but it doesn't add up to much more than an average western.  It's entertaining, but nothing special.
