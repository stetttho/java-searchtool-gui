 This B-film from Warner Brothers concerns the mysterious and deadly goings-on at a boarding house owned by Frieda Inescort and Miles Mander, who live there along with their daughter Heather Angel and several boarders.  Among the boarders is a struggling writer, an eccentric spinster, and two men involved in shady business.  In the course of the film's one hour running time, bodies begin to pile up as the writer tries to figure out the identity of a killer.  The actors all express the appropriate amount of shock and confusion as the mystery deepens, and the pace of the film maintains the suspense.  The direction could be sharper, and I found the story a little confusing at times, but I did like the twist ending.  Very few people have heard of Shadows On The Stairs, and although I think the comparisons to Hitchcock are a real stretch, fans of B-films will want to check this one out.
