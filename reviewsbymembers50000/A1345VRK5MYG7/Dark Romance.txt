 Joan Fontaine stars as Charlotte Bronte's title character, a governess who began her life as an unloved orphan, raised at a brutal school, now living on an estate run by the mysterious Orson Welles.  Lots of things go bump in the night at Thornfield, one of the many strange things about her new home.  Welles dominates the film, with a forceful, blunt performance as Rochester, the man with the terrible past.  Fontaine is subdued and quietly strong as Jane.  The rest of the cast don't get much of a chance to shine with Welles in the film, although Peggy Ann Garner as the young Jane is quite memorable.  The look of the film is often amazing.  Dark shadows and fog are used to great effect, and there is an unreal quality to it all that matches the story well.  When I read the novel in university, I enjoyed it for all of its gothic touches and mysterious tone.  Although the film does not follow the novel's storyline exactly, it does maintain that Gothic feel.  This film is yet another example why black and white filmmaking can be so effective.
