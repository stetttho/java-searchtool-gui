 Lame is the first word that came to mind as I was watching this all-star World War II morale booster.  I really wanted to like it a lot more than I did, but the plot's framing device killed it for me.  Robert Hutton plays a soldier on leave who visits the Hollywood Canteen with one hope ... to get a kiss from Joan Leslie, that All-American girl next door.  He does, and a phony romance develops between them that pretty much ruins the film.  It's oh-so-sweet and innocent and trite.  Fortunately, there are some good moments that don't feature the wholesome couple.  The film is populated by the best talent at Warner Brothers, mostly playing themselves.  Dane Clark doesn't play Dane Clark, but instead Hutton's army buddy, and he supplies the film's humour as he tries to win over Ida Lupino, Alexis Smith, Joan Crawford, and Janis Paige.  Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre have a short but terrific scene together where they use their sinister screen personas to great effect.  There are some good musical numbers performed, along with other appearances by such classic stars as Jane Wyman, Barbara Stanwyck, Jack Carson, Dennis Morgan, Joe E. Brown, and the Hollywood Canteen's founders, Bette Davis and John Garfield.  So although I did enjoy seeing so many great actors from yesteryear out of character for a change, I just wish that screenwriter and director Delmer Daves had come up with a better framing device to move the film along.  Sixty years later it doesn't stand up very well, and I can't imagine that audiences back then really bought into it either.
