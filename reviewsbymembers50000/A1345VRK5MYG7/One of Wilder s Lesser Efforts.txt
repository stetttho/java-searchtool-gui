 Looks like I'm going to be going in the opposite direction of most reviewers when I say I didn't much care for this romantic comedy from director Billy Wilder.  I've made it a point to see as many of Wilder's films as I can, and I found that this film was missing the edge that his others have.  The basic story is wealthy ladies man Gary Cooper who has many women in every town he travels to, becomes involved with a mysterious, apparently experienced Audrey Hepburn, who in reality is a student and lives with her detective father Maurice Chevalier.  She falls for him quickly, and he gradually begins to fall for her, despite knowing remarkably little about her.  But can such an oddly matched couple find lasting love together?  There is some sharp dialogue in the film, as one would expect from Wilder.  He also knows how to milk a gag for what it's worth.  The ending is also very satisfying, something he was known for.  But all of that didn't add up to enough for me to really like the film.  Hepburn lights up the screen as she usually did.  Cooper, however, I think was not the best choice, lacking the worldly quality of a playboy.  He is also badly photographed in the film, although I have read that it was done purposely to downplay his age.  As for the frequently discussed age gap between the stars, they're both adults so it was not a big deal to me.  However, their lack of real chemistry and the thinness of the plot was a bigger deal.  In the hands of a director like Wilder, I expected more substance and polish.  This is certainly one of his lesser efforts.
