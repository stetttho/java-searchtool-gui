 Humphrey Bogart stars as Frank Taylor, a factory worker who wants to be the next foreman. When he is passed over for the promotion he was counting on by a young, eager Polish American, his frustration and anger leads him to join the Black Legion, a group of racists out to punish anyone who isn't "100% American".  He keeps this activity a secret from his wife Erin O'Brien Moore and his best friend Dick Foran.  But before long, his life starts to unravel because of his association with this group, leading to a lot of tragedy, death, and heartache.  I was impressed to see that a major studio like Warner Brothers took such a direct look at a hate group in 1930's Hollywood.  The scene where Bogart takes the group's pledge particularly surprised me with its subtle brutality.  Bogart is very good in this film, one of the few actors of his time that could have made this character seem believable.  The supporting cast, which also includes a young Ann Sheridan as Foran's fiancee, all give good performances as well.  The film is tough, presents a hate group as frankly as a 1930's film could, and although a little preachy at the end, delivers its message well.
