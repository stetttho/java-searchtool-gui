 Robert Mitchum stars as a tough marine who washes up on the shore of an island in the South Pacific and finds Deborah Kerr, a nun.  The priest she was working with at a mission is dead, the Japanese having come through.  Together, the unlikely duo forge a real friendship and struggle to survive against illness, the elements, and of course, the Japanese who make repeated trips to the island.   The acting is terrific, with Mitchum and Kerr the only characters on screen.  Mitchum displays his range here, at times tough and uncouth, and at other times kind and doting.  Kerr is equally fine, never letting her performance dissolve into a nun caricature, giving Sr. Angela an internal strength and shy sense of humour. The action moves along well, with director John Huston expertly pacing and scripting the film so that the characters are allowed to develop without sacrificing the action and tension of the war.  It's an honest film with real characters both devoted to their causes, and by the end you can't help but like and admire the both of them.
