 Amy Irving stars as Anna, a woman claiming to be the youngest daughter of Czar Nicholas II of Russia, a claim which would mean that she had survived the execution of the Royal Family.  She seems to know things about the Royal Family that only Anastasia could know, yet she has huge gaps in her memory and is unable/unwilling to speak Russian.  Things are complicated by the fact that other women have claimed to be Anastasia in the past, and the Royal Family has grown tired of the pretenders to the throne.  However, Anna has her supporters, although she knows the must win the support of her grandmother, the empress, if she is to have any hope of being officially recognized.  Irving has a few good moments as Anna/Anastasia, but she doesn't project the strength that so many of the characters tell her character that she has.  The supporting cast is competent, although few are given much in the way of characters to flesh out.  The real bright spot in the film is Olivia de Havilland as the Empress.  She infuses her character with humour and wisdom, and steals her far too few scenes.  There is a narrator that appears irregularly throughout the film, and that device should have been eliminated.  The direction lacks pacing, the script could be stronger, and the ending is rather flat.  Despite the fictious romance and other weaknesses, I did find the film interesting, since the mystery surrounding Anna Anderson was one of the great puzzles of the Twentieth Century.  People argued for and against her with equal passion.  Since the film was completed, scientists appear to have proven that Anna Anderson was not Anastasia, but it would be interesting to think that maybe someone could have survived that brutal moment in history.  I do wish they had made a more fact based, tighter film about it.
