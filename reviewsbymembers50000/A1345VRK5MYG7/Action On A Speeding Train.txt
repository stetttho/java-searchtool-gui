 I've seen very few of the Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce Sherlock Holmes films, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I did enjoy this short film.  Holmes and Watson have been hired to guard a famous jewel called the Star of Rhodesia, a diamond that has caused no end of problems for its many previous owners.  Most of the film takes place aboard a speeding train bound for Scotland, a scenario ripe with possibilities, due to the confined space and lack of possible escape.  Various characters are aboard, opening up many chances for robbery, and as it turns out, murder as well.  Rathbone and Bruce are of course classics in this genre, and after so many turns as these characters, there performances seem effortless.  The supporting cast is fine as well, and there is enough action to more than keep the viewer's attentions.  It's obvious not much money was spent on the film, and the absence of music at key events is felt, but this mystery remains entertaining nonetheless.
