 Judy Holliday is the whole show in this story of a crooked junk dealer who hires a tutor to give his chorus girl girlfriend a little culture as he tries to buy his way into Washington.  Broderick Crawford is the junk dealer, and he bellows hiw way through the character, a self made millionaire who thinks everyone can be bought.  William Holden is good as the tutor/journalist who has nothing but contempt for Crawford, but finds himself falling in love with his pupil. Holliday shines as the pupil, a girl who doesn't like reading or learning, but discovers that she's a lot brighter than she thought, and that there is more to life than the world Crawford has created for her.  From her voice to her mannerisms to her perfect timing, it's one of the best comedy performances you will see an actress give.  The script has some great dialogue, some preachy speeches, and some funny moments, such as the gin rummy game.  It's a smart comedy about a couple of dumb people who both learn important lessons.
