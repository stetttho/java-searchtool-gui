 Errol Flynn and David Niven star as a couple of pilots and close friends in World War I who know firsthand about the reality of war.  Angry at first with his commander, Basil Rathbone, who must (against his own wishes) send  very inexperienced men up to fly against the Germans, Flynn  soon learns to  understand his commander's feelings of guilt and duty when he takes over as  commander and must send up Niven's brother to a certain death.  The film  mixes the glory and heroics of the air war with a look at the futile waste  of young, unprepared men who really don't know what they are in for.  As  the wiser, seasoned pilots, Flynn and Niven have an excellent rapport, and  Rathbone is fine as the tortured commander whose men do not respect him  until they can themselves personally understand what he goes through  everytime he is ordered to send up more inexperienced pilots.  The aerial  sequences are well done, and the film is a thoughtful look at both the  glory and futility to be found in war.
