 Let me first state that I have not read the book or ever seen any other version of the story.  Having had to read a Jane Austen novel in university, I can also state I'm not a fan either.  So I'm reviewing this  movie based on its own merits.  The bottom line is I liked it well enough.   Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier are well matched as lovers who take a  long time to come around to the fact that they are in love, due to social  and class pressures.  Mary Boland as Mrs. Bennett, the mother who is trying  to marry off Garson and her four other daughters, is fluttery and quite  funny.  The other daughters are adequately played by Maureen O'Sullivan,  Ann Rutherford, Marsha Hunt, and Heather Angel, but they are not given much  in the way of characters to flesh out.  Edna May Oliver plays the same  character she played pretty much in every film I've seen her in, this time  as Olivier's commanding Aunt.  There's a strong emphasis on humour in the  story, and sometimes it's overdone.  But the exchanges between Garson and  Olivier are memorable, and the picture it creates of class distinctions in  Austen's England are effective.  I don't know if it's great  "Austen", but I do know that the film entertained me and is worth  a look.
