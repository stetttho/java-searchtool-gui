 Humphrey Bogart stars as "Gloves" Donahue, who looks into the murder of a family friend, and the investigation gets him involved with a mysterious nightclub singer (Kaaren Verne), the art world, and Fifth  Columnists (people in the US helping the Nazis during WWII).  There's a lot  of action and humour along the way as Gloves discovers that things aren't  what they seem.  This isn't a typical Bogart film from this time period,  and it's a nice change of pace.  Bogart is supported by a terrific cast.   Conrad Veidt, Peter Lorre, and Judith Anderson are properly menacing as the  Fifth Columnists, while Frank McHugh, Jackie Gleason, and especially  William Demarest are a lot of fun as Bogart's boys.  The double talk  sequence as Bogart and Demarest try to pass themselves off as Nazi  sympathizers at a Fifth Column meeting is hilarious and memorable.  I liked  this film and I thought it was great that humour could be used in a film  about an otherwise serious subject at a time when the world was at war.
