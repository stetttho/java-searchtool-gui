 There's a serial killer on the loose who preys on afflicted women, and poor mute Dorothy McGuire seems like the next likely victim.  McGuire works in one of those big old movie houses with flickering candles, dark cellars, and a general feeling of unease all around.  She nurses invalid Ethel Barrymore who lives with son Gordon Oliver and stepson George Brent.  Barrymore is worried for McGuire's safety, and as the film progresses, it becomes obvious she has good reason - the killer is after Dorothy. The supporting cast does a good job, albeit a little over the top at times (except for Brent, who is his usual lifeless self).  McGuire turns in a memorable performance, using her face and body language to communicate what her character can't say. Director Robert Siodmak uses some interesting shots to establish the menacing presence, and the tension does gradually build as we realize that McGuire isn't only trapped by a killer, but also by her inability to communicate her situation.  Although it doesn't have the effect of a Hitchcock thriller (wonder what he would have done with this story?!), it's nonetheless a very good thriller in that creepy old house tradition of classic Hollywood.
