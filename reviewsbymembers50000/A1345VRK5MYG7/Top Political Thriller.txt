 Laurence Harvey returns to the United States as a war hero following the end of the Korean War.  What few realize is that he returns a brainwashed tool of enemies of the US government, trained to follow all of their orders, no matter what.  Fellow soldier Frank Sinatra is having horrible nightmares about having been brainwashed as well, but he can't put it altogether.  There is a brilliant scene from his nightmare at the beginning where a meeting of communist leaders to introduce the brainwashed men (who have had their brains tricked to believe they are actually at a Ladies horticulture club meeting) is both brilliantly funny and frightening.  To add to his problems, Harvey's mother (Angela Lansbury) is a cold, manipulative backroom politician angling to get her second husband a place in the White House.  Sinatra's growing concerns about what really happened to him and Harvey, Lansbury's political ambitions, and Harvey's controlled state of mind all mesh together to make a terrific political thriller that never lets up.  Sinatra is excellent as the troubled soldier wanting answers, both impassioned and on the edge.  Harvey is necessarily robotic in a way, but very convincing in his role as the soldier that was basically re-wired during the war.  Lansbury is most impressive in a very uncharacteristic role, shrewd, cold, and frighteningly obsessed with all her objectives.  A lot of credit must go to director John Frankenheimer, who keeps the tension building, and who employs a lot of unique shots and angles as the story unfolds and tightens.  The script is excellent, showing us how television (even back in the Fifties and Sixties) changed the rules of the political game, especially for those who knew how to use it best.  Could Hollywood please make some more smart thrillers like this one?!?!
