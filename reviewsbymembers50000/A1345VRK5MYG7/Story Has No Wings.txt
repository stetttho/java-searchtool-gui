 James Cagney plays yet another cocky tough guy needing to get knocked down a peg or two (or three).  He joins the Marine Air Corps on the encouragement of his Marine buddy Pat O'Brien.  Cagney is a terrific flyer who thinks he knows it all, and needless to say, he isn't prepared to take orders and be just a regular Marine.  He also takes a liking to Margaret Lindsay, O'Brien's girlfriend.  So things get complicated.  Or at least things should get complicated, but the story is so basic, the dialogue so boring, and the actions of the characters so obvious, the film becomes very predictable, never leaving the runway, so to speak.  The acting is passable, the direction efficient, if uninspired, and by the end, I didn't really care what happened to anyone in the story.  I usually like Cagney, but other than a few good aerial shots, this film was a misfire from the start.
