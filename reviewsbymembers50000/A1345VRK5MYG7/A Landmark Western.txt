 Stagecoach presents the story of several passengers on board a stagecoach travelling through Apache territory.  Those on board include Claire Trevor as a good-hearted prostitute run out of town, Thomas Mitchell as a drunken doctor, Donald Meek as a meek salesman, Louise Platt as a pregnant soldier's wife, John Carradine as a shady gambler, and John Wayne as the Ringo Kid, an outlaw who ends up being more decent than the so-called decent characters on the stagecoach.  Wayne's relationship with Trevor is well drawn, and Mitchell's showy performance as the doctor has some great moments.  But the real reason to watch this John Ford classic is to see the attack, which features excellent camera work and stunts, particularly for a movie made in 1939.  It's not the greatest western ever made, but it is a landmark film in the careers of Ford and Wayne and in the evolution of the genre.
