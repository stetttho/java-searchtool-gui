 Captain Blood is the kind of movie that I like to pop in the VCR on a Saturday afternoon when I need a couple of hours of down time.  Errol Flynn stars as Peter Blood, a doctor wrongly imprisoned who turns to piracy in  the seventeenth century.  Flynn was the perfect actor for a role like this,  because he had the athleticism and charisma to make this character come  alive, and he manages to deliver some "goofy" dialogue without  making it sound "goofy".  Olivia deHavilland plays his love  interest (as she often did), and she's well cast as the proper, yet spunky  young lady.  It's hard to imagine a couple of actors more suited for each  other.  Physically, they look incredible together, and the chemistry  between them is obvious.  Their youth and energy keep the film moving, as  do the well-directed action sequences, the rousing musical score, and the  playful humour.  There are a lot of familiar character actors in the cast,  including the always great Basil Rathbone.  Captain Blood is the kind of  movie you don't get tired of watching, because it entertains every time.
