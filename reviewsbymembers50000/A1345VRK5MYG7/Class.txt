 Although I'm not a fan of romance movies, you have to admire this film about devotion and trust.  Ronald Colman is a shell-shocked WWI soldier who develops amnesia and is sent to an asylum as the war closes.  Escaping, he is befriended by dance hall entertainer Greer Garson, they fall in love, and as they embark on a life together he is injured in a traffic accident and forgets his years with her. Instead, he remembers all that happened up to the war, but nothing after.  Garson and the audience must wait to see if he will ever remember his true love again.  This story of amnesia could have seemed ridiculous or far-fetched, but in the hands of all concerned it works very well.  Colman is his smooth, classy self, believable at every stage of the story.  But Garson is the real treasure here, creating a subdued, warm portrait of a woman who knows she must wait, perhaps forever, to have her love returned to her.  Susan Peters, as a young woman in Colman's life after Garson is very good, particularly in a scene in a church where she realizes where she really stands with him.  Director Mervyn LeRoy paces the film perfectly along with the screenwriters.  With the class of its stars and the MGM production values, Random Harvest stands as one of classic films' greatest love stories.
