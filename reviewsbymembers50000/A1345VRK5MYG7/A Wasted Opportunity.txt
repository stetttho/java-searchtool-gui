 Wesley Snipes stars as a DC homicide cop brought into the White House to help solve the brutal murder of a White House staffer.  He gets very little support from the Secret Service, who want the matter resolved quickly, even if that means bending the facts a little.  Snipes begins to realize that there is a coverup in progress and that he is only one man standing against the machinery of Washington.  Snipes is a good fit for this role, not relying on simply mugging and attitude like he sometimes does.  Diane Lane as the Secret Service agent assigned as his liason gives the film's best performance.  She really deserves to get her "breakout" role that would give her a shot at better scripts than this one.  It starts out promisingly, but the mystery and action becomes increasingly ridiculous as it moves along.  The supporting cast are never given a chance to flesh out their roles as their characters do things that don't make much sense. By the ending of the film, the best I could muster was, "Yeah, right."  A murder mystery involving top level political cover ups in Washington is a ripe topic to say the least.  But this was a good idea that needed a lot of reworking before filming.  It's a wasted opportunity.
