 The first time I saw Dodge City, it didn't make that great of an impression on me.  The whole movie seemed to be full of clichs.  But having seen it several times now, I've come to appreciate that this was  probably the movie where most of the clichs were started.  Errol Flynn  stars as Wade Hatton, a trail boss, who moves into Dodge City and takes the  job of sheriff.  It's a tough place to be sheriff, because lawlessness is  the way of life, and Bruce Cabot(the movie's villain) is calling the shots.   Flynn's frequent leading lady, Olivia deHavilland, stars at the outspoken  newspaperwoman that he falls in love with.  Alan Hale, who provides most of  the movie's laughs, is along for the ride as Flynn's sidekick.  The movie  has a lot going for it.  I've always thought that westerns worked better in  colour, and this movie is filmed in beautiful Technicolor.  The movie also  features the best bar-room brawl I've ever seen, and there is a lot of  humour thrown in amidst the action.  The performers are all good, although  Ann Sheridan is given little screen time, despite her high billing as  Cabot's girlfriend.  With all the action, humour, and Technicolor beauty,  Dodge City is a western well worth viewing.
