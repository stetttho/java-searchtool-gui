 Brad Renfro stars as a street smart Louisiana boy who tangles with a member of the mob as that man is about to commit suicide.  The mobster reveals the whereabouts of a body everyone is searching for, and after his suicide, everyone comes to believe that the boy knows the truth - he has both the Mob and the FBI after him for it.  The always great Tommy Lee Jones leads the way for the FBI, while it's up to small time lawyer Susan Sarandon to defend and protect the boy, her client.  Sarandon is terrific as the emotionally wounded lawyer trying to keep everyone at bay.  Renfro is extremely good as the kid/client, completely believable and self-possessed.  The story moves along well, being highly entertaining without ever becoming too improbable as films like this sometimes do.  At the heart of the film is the relationship between attorney and client, very well written and played.  The Client is the kind of film to watch on a rainy/snowy day when a movie is the best option.
