 In a tailor-made role, Whoopi Goldberg stars as a Motown lounge-singer in Reno who witness the murder of a chauffeur at the hands of her married boyfriend and mobster, Harvey Kietel.  When she goes to the police, they need to hide her some place safe, and they find a place where no one would think to look for the mistress-singer ... a convent.  Maggie Smith also stars as the Mother Superior who agrees to shelter the newly christened Sister Mary Clarence, and in the hands of Whoopi, you can guess what happens to their woefully inadequate choir.  This is one of those films it's hard not to like.  The role was made for Whoopi, and she plays it for all it's worth.  The nuns are all cute, the fish out of water story has built in laughs, and the music is terrific - really gets the toes tapping.  There's nothing deep or earth shattering here, and thank God for that.  It's simply a film about singing out your joy and serving others.  In other words, it's a feel good movie and a lot of fun.
