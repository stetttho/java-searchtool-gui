 I watched this video for the sole purpose of seeing the legendary Rudolph Valentino for the first time.  I was curious to see if he lived up to the legend.  Sorry to say, I don't get it.  Maybe it's because I'm a guy, or  maybe it's because the film itself isn't that great.  It's basically the  story of a young bullfighter (Rudy) who is torn between the good woman he  married and the vamping (and overacting) bad woman whom he lusts after.   The scenes with the bulls are pretty good, but the rest of it doesn't come  of as well eighty years later as it may have when this film first came out.   Valentino is competent enough, but I have to ask, "What's the big  deal?"
