 Bette Davis stars as an unmarried mother in 1870's America who allows her wealthier, widowed cousin Miriam Hopkins to raise her daughter, thus saving the child and herself from any scandal.  The child's father, George Brent, was Hopkins' former fiance, and was killed in the Civil War.  Needless to say, it's a painful thing to watch her daughter calling another woman Mother.  Davis gives a sympathetic, tightly controlled performance that anchors the film.  Hopkins' character isn't well defined, although she manages to give the character some dimension.  Brent, in the presence of these two actresses staking their territories, is his customary non-presence.  Jane Bryan, as the grown up daughter, again shows that it is too bad her career in Hollywood didn't last more than a few years.  She's excellent as the spoiled, headstrong girl.  The film has a number of quiet, moving moments, although I found the pacing a little slow.  Of course, this isn't the ideal subject matter for me in a film, but I do recognize the quality of the film.  I think fans of melodrama and Davis will certainly want to make a point of seeing this movie.  I think there are other better unwed mother films, but this one also delivers.
