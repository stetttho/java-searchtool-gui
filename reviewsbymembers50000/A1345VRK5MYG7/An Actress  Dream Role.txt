 Joanne Woodward gets one of those roles that most actresses must dream about - the opportunity to play a character with three distinct personalities.  The film centres on this woman's attempt to regain her life with the assistance of a psychiatrist played by Lee J. Cobb.  Woodward does a very good job of creating various personalities and balancing the role.  I wish I knew more about multiple personalities and psychiatry to know how accurate the film is, because I found parts of it hard to believe.  The way the hypnosis is presented seems to me to be far too easy and simple, and to be honest, we don't actually get to see very much of how the doctor helped the young woman.  If you look to the film less as a case study and more as a piece of drama, you will find much to enjoy about it.  And regardless of how factual and accurate it is, The Three Faces of Eve was an important step in presenting mental illness to the public, and for that reason also, it deserves to be seen.
