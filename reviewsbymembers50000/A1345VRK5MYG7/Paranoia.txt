 Loretta Young got some of her best roles toward the end of her film career, and this was one of them.  She stars as the patient and loving wife of Barry Sullivan, a bedridden man who has become paranoid and who manages  to implicate her in his own death.  Through a winding series of events, she  must race against time to save herself from a murder charge.  Young is  excellent in the role, being given more opportunity to show her dramatic  range than in many of the other films she made.  The tension builds well  and the story manages to remain credible.  Although a small film and hardly  a classic, it is quite good.
