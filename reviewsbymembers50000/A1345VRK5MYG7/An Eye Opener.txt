 Barbara Stanwyck stars as a young nurse assigned to watch over two children inside a home where something is clearly amiss.  The children are getting worse after making improvements during their hospital stay, the doctor (who never comes) is not treating them properly, and a violent chauffeur seems to be calling all the shots.  Stanwyck decides to do something about it.  This is a very odd film, with so many strange elements combined, yet it remains fascinating.  Stanwyck gives her usual strong performance as the concerned nurse, and is well supported by Joan Blondell as her wisecracking nurse-friend, Ben Lyon as a bootlegger she becomes involved with, and Clark Gable as the menacing chauffeur.  The medical practices and terminology are very strange (and amusing), the dialogue is daring, and it's remarkable the number of times Stanwyck and Blondell need to change their clothes on camera!!  The action is also very tough, with Gable slugging Stanwyck, Stanwyck dragging around the girl's mother, and various people getting shot.  The film's pre-Code origins are obvious. It may not be great cinema, but Night Nurse is one of those films you should see that were made when the Censors had far less control in Hollywood than they soon would.  It's an eye-opener.
