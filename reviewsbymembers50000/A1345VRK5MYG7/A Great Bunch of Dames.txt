 This film tells the story of a young man in Italy and the English and American women who had a profound impact on his life.  When his father wants little do to with his illegitimate son, he is taken care of by his father's English secretary Joan Plowright and her art-loving friend Judi Dench.  A friend of his late mother, wealthy American Cher, becomes a benefactress.  Since the story takes place in the 1930s and 1940s, WWII figures prominently into the film, as the women assume that Mussolini isn't as bad as the press outside of Italy report.  Chief among his supporters is Maggie Smith, the widow of the former British Ambassador.  The women all learn truth about Mussolini as their young charge learns how to be a man.  With a cast like this one (Cher, Dench, Plowright, Smith, and Lily Tomlin), of course the acting is very good.  Director Franco Zeffirelli does a terrific job establishing the atmosphere and mood of the time, with beautiful shots of Florence, the Italian countryside, and great works of art.  The film does tend to wander a bit and does lack credibility in a few places.  But this is a rare chance to see such great actresses together, and with a few good moments of dramatic tension, it's an easy film to watch.
