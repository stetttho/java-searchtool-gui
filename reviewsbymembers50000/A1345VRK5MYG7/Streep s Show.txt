 The great Meryl Streep stars in this true story of Roberta Gaspari, a woman who teaches violin music classes in East Harlem.  It begins with how she got her start as a substitute, even bringing in her own violins, trying to build a program despite the skepticism of her colleagues and some parents.  It follows through her story up to their climatic concert to try and save the program when budget cutbacks leave it by the wayside.  The less interesting parts deal with the teacher's private life and both of her boyfriends.  Streep is her usual terrific self, with a very real, honest, and detailed performance.  The supporting cast of Angela Bassett, Aidan Quinn, Gloria Estefan, Jane Leeves, and Cloris Leachman is fine, although none of them is given much time to really shine.  It's all Streep's show.  The focus of the film needs to be sharper, spending more time on the school and students, and less time on her private life.  The audience does get to know a few of her students, and that helps to involve the audience more in the film.  It is the students that make the emotional core of this film as strong as it is, so that at the end, you can't help but cheer for the kids on the stage and the lady that made it all happen.  And as a teacher, a film like this helps to remind me of the power we have to affect the lives of those we inspire!
