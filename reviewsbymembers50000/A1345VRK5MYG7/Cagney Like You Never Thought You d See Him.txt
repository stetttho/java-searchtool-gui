 James Cagney IS this film.  Yes, the songs are entertaining and the story is well told (which is surprising to hear from someone like me who does not like musicals).  But from the moment he comes on camera, he takes control  of the film.  The word dynamic is usually used to describe this  performance, and that's because it's the perfect word.  Cagney sings, he  dances, he jokes, and he delivers dramatically, too.  Surprisingly, he was  a great dancer, with a sort of stiff legged kind of style I've never seen  before, but it works.  The movie is very patriotic, and sometimes it seems  to be too much, but you don't really pay attention to that because Cagney  fills the screen.  What a star performance!
