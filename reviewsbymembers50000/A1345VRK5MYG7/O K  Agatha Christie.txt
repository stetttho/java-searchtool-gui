 An American movie production invades a small English town, and if that weren't enough to cause a disruption, murder comes with it.  Once again, Miss Marple comes to the rescue, with her incredible knack for detail and deduction, as well as her understanding of human nature.  Miss Marple is played by Angela Lansbury, who doesn't quite capture the famous character, but is entertaining in the role nonetheless.  Rock Hudson is the director, Tony Curtis the producer, while Elizabeth Taylor and Kim Novak are the stars of the American production.  Their performances are alright, with Novak seeming to have a lot of fun, but nothing special.  Actually, that's part of the problem with the film - it's competently done, but nothing more.  There's some good dialogue between Taylor and Novak, but on the whole, the film lacks energy.  It could have been a lot better, although it is certainly watchable.
