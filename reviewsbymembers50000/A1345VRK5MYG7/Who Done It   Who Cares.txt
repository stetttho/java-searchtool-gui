 Bud Abbott and Lou Costello star as two guys trying to get into radio writing and performing, who stumble into a murder committed live on the air, and in order to make a name for themselves, pretend they are detectives that can solve it.  The murdered man is the president of the network.  Along for the mystery are such familiar classic film faces as Patric Knowles, William Bendix, Mary Wickes, Louise Allbritton, and Jerome Cowan.  There's not much to the mystery, as it pretty much forms the thread for linking together the boys' antics and slapstick routines.  So don't expect to be on the edge of your seat through the movie, waiting for the solution.  Costello is especially manic in this one, bouncing off of everything and everyone.  I did enjoy seeing them make fun of themselves a few times, and there were a some clever moments.  It's an Abbott and Costello film, so you get what you get.  It's not the best I've seen from them, but it's better than a number of their other films.
