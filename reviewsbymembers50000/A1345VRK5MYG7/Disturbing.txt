 Edward Norton, one of today's finest actors, stars as a former white supremacist recently released from prison who tries to save his brother Edward Furlong from following in his footsteps.  The movie deals with the current part of the story in colour, while the back story explaining Norton's past is presented in stark black and white.  The viewer gets to see the language and violence of hate that spewed from Norton, and very little is held back.  It's disturbing to watch.  His "conversion" away from racism is not as explicitly presented, and I found it to be a weaker part of the story.  Considering the depths of his white supremacist beliefs, not enough detail and time is given to explaining why he turns around.  Norton is riveting in the central role, bringing an all-too convincing charisma to a character that at times repulses the viewer.  Furlong, usually a weak actor in my opinion, is stronger than I have seen him before.  The supporting cast are fine.  The black and white and colour cinematography are excellent and used to great effect.  I don't want to spend time analyzing the speeches given and the film's point of view, because at the end, regardless of where you stand politically, the message is pretty clear.  At times, it's not an easy to film to sit through, but I don't know if racism, a topic of many a film, has ever been presented in so direct and disturbing a way.
