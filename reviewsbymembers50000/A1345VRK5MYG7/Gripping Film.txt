 Dolores Claiborne is a difficult film to pull off, because the story shifts between past and present.  Yet director Taylor Hackford manages to weave the various time frames together with such success and style.  A formidable Kathy Bates stars as the title character, a woman being investigated for the murder of her elderly employer.  The detective on the case, Christopher Plummer, wants to get her because years earlier he investigated her for the murder of her husband, but was not able to make anything stick.  Her long estranged daughter, Jennifer Jason Leigh, shows up, a woman on the edge who suspects her mother is guilty of both crimes.  As the investigation develops, the story of Dolores, her abusive husband, and her daughter is reminisced about, so that the truth and family secrets can come out.  This is a gripping film with a great visual style.  The present time sequences are filmed in washed out colours, very grey and pale blue, while the sequences from the past are photographed with vivid colours, as if the past is more alive than the present.  The climax of the film when we learn the truth of all that happened is particularly stunning and beautiful.  The performances are uniformly excellent and forceful, with Bates and the writer creating an original, unforgettable "heroine".  Dolores Claiborne will keep you glued to the screen from its arresting start to satisfying conclusion.
