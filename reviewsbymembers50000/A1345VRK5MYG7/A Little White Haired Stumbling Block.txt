 Alec Guinness leads an inept group of thieves who cleverly steal a considerable amount of cash, but find one stumbling block to their success - a little old lady. She is the landlord of the house that Guinness is staying in, under the guise of being a professor and his gang are also professors practicing for a concert. He actually uses her in his plan, but that proves to be all the help she gives. Katie Johnson, as the old lady, is hysterical without much effort, exactly right on target as the proper, overly helpful, good citizen that finds herself mixed up in a crime that will cause her great personal scandal. The scene where she tries to keep apart her tea party friends and the gang is very, very funny. Guinness is, of course, his usual comic genius, and his gang all score too, including a young Peter Sellers. This is a perfect example of the "little" films that England turned out during the Forties and Fifties that remain just as entertaining today as they did when first produced. It's a terrific example of black comedy.
