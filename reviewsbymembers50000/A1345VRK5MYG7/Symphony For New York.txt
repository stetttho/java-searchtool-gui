 James Cagney stars as Danny, a boxer otherwise known as Young Samson, who sacrifices much so that his younger brother, played by Arthur Kennedy, can pursue his gift for music.  Ann Sheridan, a dancer from the neighbourhood, is the girl Cagney loves, but she wants badly to get out of their old neighbourhood and to make something of her life, and she wants it so much she ends up in a destructive relationship with ambitious dancer Anthony Quinn.  Cagney is strong as usual, but more sympathetic than other films, as the man with the big heart.  Sheridan gives a strong performance as well, really delivering in a number of scenes with simple reaction shots.  Kennedy is equally passionate as the composer whose symphony captures the life of New York City.  The supporting cast is full of familiar, welcome Warner Bros character actors like Frank McHugh, George Tobias, Jerome Cowan, Donald Crisp, and Lee Patrick.  New York City also becomes a character, thanks to the evocative music and the backdrop atmosphere.  People have said the ending is too sentimental, but Cagney and Sheridan pull it off and make it work.  The more Cagney films I see, the more amazed I am by his talent.  The film is a showcase for him and also New York.  It does both proud.
