 Here's something you wouldn't expect:  A film that takes the sombre topic of the Depression and turns it into a comedic musical.  Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler, and Aline MacMahon star as chorus girls looking for a break as Broadway shows keep closing due to the impact of the Great Depression.  Ruby has fallen in love with a composer, Dick Powell, who turns out to be quite wealthy and able to finance his own musical.  However, his stuffy brother does not approve of the match and decides to do something about it.  A comedy of errors ensues.  The cast are all good with this kind of material, with Blondell and especially MacMahon as standouts.  The songs are dated for my tastes, although the finale "The Forgotten Man" still packs a punch and is well staged and performed by Blondell.  The movie has the kind of spectacle you would expect from a Busby Berkeley choreographed musical.  It's interesting to see a movie take the topic of the Great Depression and turn it into a funny and entertaining musical.  Oddly enough, it works quite well!!
