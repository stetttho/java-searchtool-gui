 State of the Union takes a look at all the behind the scenes action that goes into the making a politician, such as the promises, deal making with interest groups, using the family in the campaign, etc.  In other words,  the same games being played even today in politics.  It's the story of a  businessman played by Spencer Tracy who gets talked into running for  President, and along the way he loses his ideals and begins playing the  games, under the familiar but false assumption that he'll just do it until  he gets elected.  Katharine Hepburn stars as his wife and conscience, a  woman who wants him to speak the truth and say what's really on his mind,  win or lose.  Tracy and especially Hepburn are excellent in their roles,  making a lot of dialogue sound fresh and real.  Angela Lansbury is cold but  convincing as a newspaper syndicate owner who is a behind the scenes player  in the political game, pushing Tracy (with whom she's in love) into the  presidential race.  Van Johnson is a lot of fun as the aide with the dry  sense of humour and realistic approach to everything.  There's a good mix  of laughs with dramatic moments, and surprisingly, the message behind the  movie remains very current and rings true, over fifty years after the film  was made.  It would be interesting to watch this film along with some of  the recent films made about politics and the White House.
