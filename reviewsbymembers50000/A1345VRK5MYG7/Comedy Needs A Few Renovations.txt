 Jack Benny stars as the terminally exasperated husband of Ann Sheridan.  Eager to own a part of history and get out of city living, she has  purchased an old country home where George Washington once spent some time,  and now Benny must come to terms with a house in need of major renovations,  and separation from the city where he loved to live.  Benny gives a one  note performance that wears thin after a while.  If the character had been  better written and developed, and if a more accomplished actor had played  it, the film as a whole would have been better.  It's hard to imagine that  someone so beautiful and warm as Sheridan would want to be stuck with him.   The supporting cast is excellent, with Hattie McDaniel as the maid, Charles  Coburn as the wily uncle, and especially Percy Kilbride as the local  contractor contributing funny moments.  More time should have been spent on  the comic possibilities of the renovations to inject more humour.  There  aren't many laugh out loud moments but it is amusing (especially the  drinking scene near the end), and at 93 minutes, it's easy to take.
