 Pat and Mike must have gotten a lot of attention when it came out in the early Fifties, since it has a strong message about relying on yourself and women being equal to men and doing more than their traditional role.   Hepburn and Tracy are both very good in their roles as sportswoman and  manager.  Aldo Ray, as a boxer who may have had too many shots to the head,  has a lot of funny moments that liven up the film.  The movie has a great  message, but the laughs aren't as strong as I was expecting, and although I  enjoyed it, the film is not at the same level as a lot of the other  Hepburn/Tracy films.  But I'm sure their fans will like it.
