 The Spirit of St. Louis is a largely entertaining look at an important moment in history.  I have two issues with the film.  First of all, there are too many flashbacks that interrupt the story, although I understand  their purpose of keeping the movie interesting through some of the  uninteresting parts of his flight.  Also, Stewart is too old for the role,  but being the great actor that he is, he still pulls it off convincingly.   This isn't the kind of film I would expect from director Billy Wilder, but  he manages to create tension during the flight that surprised me since I  knew how it would end!  The film also gives the viewer a good idea of some  of the technical aspects that went into creating Lindbergh's successful  attempt, and the viewer also gets a good feel for what it must have been  like to be inside the plane.  Although not a perfect film, The Spirit of  St. Louis entertains and informs, and I enjoyed it.
