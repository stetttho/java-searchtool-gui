 Rock Hudson stars as a hypochondriac who misinterprets a conversation his doctor is having about a dying man and believes he is the man that is on his way out.  He confides his situation to neighbour and pal Tony Randall so they can find someone for his wife, Doris Day.  Of course, there are a lot of crazy mix-ups that you would expect with this kind of film.  I honestly can't say I laughed very much.  I've never found any of the star trio to be particularly appealing, so there probably wasn't much of a chance of me really enjoying this at all.  Paul Lynde plays a cemetery plot salesman and is really funny.  The movie is a pleasant time filler, but there's not much here that's fresh or even interesting, and I suspect audiences today will think they've seen it all before.
