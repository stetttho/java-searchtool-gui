 Robert Taylor stars as Ivanhoe, the courageous knight who wants to rescue King Richard from captivity in Austria to restore England's throne to its rightful heir.  George Sanders (always a great villain) is the jealous, ambitious knight who stands in his way, while Joan Fontaine and Elizabeth Taylor are the women who love Ivanhoe.  The film moves along at a good pace, with plenty of action (the castle attack is a highlight) and pageantry.  It will remind you a lot of The Adventures of Robin Hood, although Taylor is good but no match for Errol Flynn in his prime, and Fontaine is o.k. but pales next to her sister Olivia de Havilland.  The film illustrates a lot of the political and religious conflicts that existed at the time, but the colourful action and heroics are the focus.  It's a well crafted film that entertains.
