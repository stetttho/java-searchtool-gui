 Friendly Persuasion is another of those "they don't make them like they used to" films.  Gary Cooper and Dorothy McGuire star as the parents of a Quaker family who find their traditional beliefs and way of  life being challenged during the American Civil War.  A simple trip to the  County Fair exposes the family to dancing, gambling, music, and violence,  all things their religion does not support.  The ultimate test to their  traditions arises when the need to defend their homestead from Confederate  raiders forces some difficult personal decisions, especially for their son,  well played by a young Anthony Perkins.  In a violent world, it's very  difficult to avoid conflict and violence, a message we understand even more  clearly today.  The film presents their challenges simply, honestly, and  with much humour (the goose is a riot).  Cooper and especially McGuire  excel in their characterizations, as does Robert Middleton as Cooper's  Methodist friend.  This is an excellent family film.
