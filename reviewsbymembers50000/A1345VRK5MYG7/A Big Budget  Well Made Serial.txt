 Errol Flynn, Ronald Reagan, Alan Hale, Arthur Kennedy, and Ronald Sinclair star as Allied airmen whose plane crashes in Germany following a bombing run.  Against considerable odds, they must try to escape across Germany to return to England with valuable information they have picked up.  Hot on their heels is Nazi major Raymond Massey, while they are also aided by sympathetic Underground member Nancy Coleman.  The actors are all fine, not given much in the way of characters to develop.  That's not the emphasis of this film.  It's all about good old fashioned adventure and escapism.  Director Raoul Walsh was famous for his action films, and this film does not disappoint.  There are plenty of escapes, chases, and explosions that keep the film moving right along.  It sometimes almost feels like a big-budget, well made serial.  There are also a few good moments of humour, especially when Reagan attempts to confuse Massey with a description that is complete nonsense.  Unbelievable as the film can be, it's well made and very entertaining, with more than enough chases and action to keep the attention of any viewer.
