 John Barrymore stars as a composer and hypnotist who takes control of Marian Marsh through hypnosis and turns her into a great singer and his lover.  Barrymore gives a striking performance as the sinister, yet humorous Svengali, sometimes a bit hammy but acting circles around the rest of the cast.  The sets and photography are strange, yet stunning, creating an eerie, almost other world feel.  There are a number of great camera shots, including a long shot that moves from Svengali's apartment to another building that must have been a real challenge technically back in 1931.  It is a very talky film with little action, but the visual presentation of Barrymore and the sets helps to make up for it.  It's not a great film, but it does leave an impression.
