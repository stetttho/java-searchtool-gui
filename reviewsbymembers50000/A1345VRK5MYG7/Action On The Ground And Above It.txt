 This quick little programmer from Warner Brothers stars Lyle Talbot as a hotshot pilot (was there any other kind?) who finds himself mixed up in a plot to steal important government military information.  His stewardess girlfriend Ann Dvorak also becomes caught up in the plot.  However, character and dialogue aren't what this film is about.  Like any Warner Bros film, the emphasis is on action, and director D. Ross Lederman provides the viewer with plenty of aerial action (and ground action as well).  The movie moves along quickly and tightly and is finished in just over an hour.  As programmers go, it is well done and entertaining, delivering exactly what you would expect.
