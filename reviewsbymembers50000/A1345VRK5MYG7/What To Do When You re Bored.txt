 Bored war vet "Bulldog" Drummond places an ad in the newspaper looking for something to do, and the answer arrives in the form of a pretty blonde whose uncle is being held captive by a mad scientist and his  partners in an asylum.  To say that the plot is farfetched would be an  understatement.  There are so many holes you stop counting and just  "go with it".  Ronald Colman as Drummond gives a fun, charming  performance, and is one of the main reasons to see this early talkie.  Another reason is his sidekick, Algy, played well by Claud Allister.  He  provides much of the film's humour.  Joan Bennett is awkward as the  heroine, and would develop into a much better actress as she became older.   Bulldog Drummond is a breezy action film, and if you overlook the  ridiculous plot and instead focus on the humour and Colman's performance,  you will enjoy the movie.
