 I can only add to the superlatives expressed by the other contributing reviewers for 12 Angry Men.  There is a lot of inherent drama in a group of diverse people being holed up in a room deciding the future of another man, a future which may include capital punishment.  This film capitalizes on all the possibilities.  In these circumstances, twelve distinctly different personalities and points of view come into play, as tempers flare, egos clash, and personal motives emerge.  These jurors decide the fate of a young boy from a slum accused of murdering his father.  Each character gets to reveal aspects of himself, all of which contribute to his own decision.  Of course, the acting is excellent.  Fonda gives his usual excellent performance, while Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, Jack Klugman, and Jack Warden standout as other jurors.  This movie stresses that they cannot vote guilty if they have a reasonable doubt, and if they aren't sure, that means they cannot convict.  It's a window into the process, but add the performances and the sweltering heat inside the jury room, and you have high drama as well.  It's a sensational film.
