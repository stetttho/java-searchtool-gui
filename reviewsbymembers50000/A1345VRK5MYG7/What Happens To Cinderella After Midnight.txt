 Claudette Colbert is essentially Cinderella in this clever twist on the Cinderella storyline.  She's a penniless, but resourceful American in Paris, who through a few twists of fate, ends up impersonating a Hungarian Baroness, joining the upper echelons of society in the process.  Her fairy godmother is John Barrymore, who assists her in her charade to entice Francis Lederer, a playboy flirting with Mary Astor, Barrymore's wife.  Don Ameche is the cab driver who has fallen in love with the real Claudette, and he wants her back.  If it sounds complicated, it is, but in the hands of screenwriters Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, it makes perfect sense.  The script is tightly and smoothly written, with terrific dialogue and screwball comedy mixed together.  Wilder and Brackett take the Cinderella idea and make it something entirely different for adults.  Colbert proves again in this film what a wonderful comedienne she was, giving a shrewd performance as the girl who charms everyone.  She's given hilarious support by Barrymore, who enlivens every scene he's in, especially his phone conversation with Colbert and Ameche.  The rest of the cast are terrific as well.  Director Mitchell Leisen does his usual classy job in a film that reminds you just how smart and fun classic Hollywood comedies could be in the hands of people like Wilder, Colbert, Barrymore, and Leisen.
