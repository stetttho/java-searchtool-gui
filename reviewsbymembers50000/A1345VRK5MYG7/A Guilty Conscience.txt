 Humphrey Bogart stars as an engineer who has fallen in love with the younger sister of his shrewish wife.  Having recovered from a car accident faster than anyone suspects (his wife didn't receive a scratch), the seemingly incapacitated engineer kills his wife on a mountain road while everyone else thinks he's home in a wheelchair.  But funny thing is, he starts finding clues that she might not be dead, despite the obvious evidence. Tricks of a guilty mind, or something else ...?  Hmmmm.  Bogart is pretty good as the wife killer, or at least good enough that you almost feel sorry for him.  Alexis Smith is alright as the younger sister, while Rose Hobart is appropriately grating as the late(?) wife.  The formidable Sydney Greenstreet is fun as the family friend/psychiatrist.  The idea behind the story is a good one, although it is highly improbable.  But the dialogue isn't nearly as sharp as it could have been and the characters played by Bogart, Smith, and Hobart aren't likeable or developed enough to be interesting.  It's a good premise with a satisfactory climax, but it could have been better.
