 The Desperate Hours is a very suspenseful tale of a family that is held hostage in their own home by three escaped convicts.  The story is fascinating to watch because they must adapt to having these strangers in  their home, and in some cases, they most go on about their lives and go out  in public without telling anyone what is happening at home.  It seems  unrealistic that it could happen that way, but it makes sense in the movie.   As usual, director William Wyler gets top performances from his cast.   Fredric March is terrific as the father who feels frustrated and helpless  that he is unable to free his family from the terrorizing of the convicts.   Martha Scott does well as his wife.  Humphrey Bogart, as the leader of the  convicts, gives the good performance that you expect from him, and the rest  of the cast is good, too.  (If I'm not mistaken, the actor playing Kobish,  one of the  convicts, went on to be the voice of Fred Flintstone.)  The  Desperate Hours presents a story that will keep you in suspense, and it  shows how people can find the courage to protect those they love.
