 Considering the impact that The Best Years of Our Lives retains today, I can only imagine the powerful impact the film must have had on audiences when it was released just after the war.  It's a very honest look at the  difficulties and adjustments facing both soldiers and their loved ones when  they return home after experiencing the horrors of war and death.  The  movie looks at three soldiers dealing with different aspects of the  re-adjustment.  Fredric March must reconnect with his wife and job, and  finds comfort with the bottle.  Dana Andrews must find a job and get to  know the girl he married quickly before going off to war, a girl that was  more in love with his uniform than the man in it.  Harold Russell must  learn to adjust to civilian life and his fiancee without his arms, having  lost them during the war.  There are too many great scenes to recount.  The  performances are incredible.  Myrna Loy is at her best as March's patient  wife.  Teresa Wright, one of the best and most reliable of the actresses of  the Forties is excellent as Loy and March's daughter who falls in love with  Andrews.  Dana Andrews gives his greatest performance,  and Harold Russell  is unforgettable as the soldier with the biggest obstacle to overcome.   William Wyler scores again with another mature, expertly acted,  dramatically charged film that reminds us about the power of moviemaking.
