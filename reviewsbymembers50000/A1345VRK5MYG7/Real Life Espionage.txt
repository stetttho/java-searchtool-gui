 This is the story of a British plot to trick the Germans during WWII into believing that, despite all appearances and obvious logic, they were going to invade Greece rather than Sicily.  Clifton Webb stars as the officer that cooks up the plan, which essentially involves having a body wash up on shore in Spain with planted information that will do the misleading.  A shiny Gloria Grahame co-stars as the woman who seems to be engaged to the man who never was, since they must create an identity for him.  Sound confusing?  It's not really as it unfolds in the film.  The plot is quite interesting, especially given the fact that we know it's mostly true, although things happen quite quickly and it seems that this operation was much easier than I suspect it was.  It's certainly not the greatest war/spy film ever made, but it is fun to watch the plot unfold and come together.  It was definitely a brilliant, risky plan.
