 Clark Gable stars as the captain of a WWII submarine preparing to battle against a Japanese destroyer that has been responsible for the destruction of four American subs, including Gable's previous command.  Burt Lancaster is his executive officer, the man who was slated to command the vessel until Gable convinced the Navy brass he had earned another shot.  Needless to say, this creates tension between the two, and it filters down to the crew who resent the new captain and take a dislike to his repeated drills and style.  Gable has to earn their respect, as well as Lancaster's.  Run Silent, Run Deep keeps a sharp focus and I liked that.  There are some interesting supporting characters, but needless subplots can be distracting and cut from the tension.  This film has none of that.  It's all about whether the American sub can finally defeat the Japanese, and the film steadily develops the tension leading up to the climatic moments.  Gable and Lancaster are both very strong here, maintaining the tough edge that a good captain needs.  The battle sequences are well executed and the viewer is given a good sense of what it is like to be aboard a submarine, especially during a battle.  Tightly edited, written, and directed, this is one of the better war films I have seen.
