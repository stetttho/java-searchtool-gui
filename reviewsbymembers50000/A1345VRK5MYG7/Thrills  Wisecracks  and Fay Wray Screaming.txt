 Lionel Atwill is the artist and owner of a London wax museum that is torched by his partner to get the insurance money.  Years later, having been injured in the blaze, Atwill turns up in New York, preparing a new wax museum for opening. If only he could quickly re-create some of his lost masterpieces.  But of course, he's gone a little mad and he comes up with a way .... Enter Fay Wray, the spitting image of his lost Marie Antoinette.  Hmmm.  I'm sure you get the idea.  This is a most unusual Warner Brothers' early Thirties film.  Filmed in an early, two strip Technicolor, the film has a remarkable, almost unreal feeling about it, much like the wax figures.  It's an unusual subject and genre for the studio to have tackled, but director Michael Curtiz keeps the action moving, so the film never gets dull.  Atwill is appropriately creepy, Wray screams with the best of them, and Glenda Farrell, as the wisecracking, adventurous reporter out to expose it all, steals the show with her lively, energetic performance.  It's got the thrills and the humour necessary to entertain, plus a few memorable moments.
