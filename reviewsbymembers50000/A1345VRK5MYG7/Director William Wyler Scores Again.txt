 I was surprised by how honestly and maturely this film dealt with its subject matter of a marriage slowly falling apart.  It's not what I expected to see coming from 1930's Hollywood.  Walter Huston and Ruth  Chatterton star as the Dodsworths, a wealthy American couple who go to  Europe after his retirement, and while there, discover how little they have  in common with each other, and how quickly they are growing apart.  She is  a vain woman who wants to regain her youth and live a glamourous life,  while he is a practical man who wants meaning to his life.  Huston is  excellent as the conflicted husband, while Chatterton unsubtly tackles her  unlikeable character with some success.  Mary Astor is terrific (as always)  as the woman that Dodsworth should be with.  Dodswoth's pain at his  disintegrating marriage and life is honestly portrayed, and the ending is  very satisfying.  This is a terrific film from start to finish, and  audiences today will find it both relevant and accurate.
