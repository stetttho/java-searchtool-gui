 The legendary Howard Hawks directed this WWII classic about the Mary Ann, a B-17 bomber lead by Captain John Ridgely and featuring crew members Gig Young, Harey Carey, Arthur Kennedy, Charles Drake, George Tobias, Ray Montgomery, and John Garfield.  On a routine mission to Hawaii, the crew arrives just hours after the Pearl Harbor attack and find themselves thrust into war.  Other stops include Wake Island and the Philippines. Of course, one of the purposes of this film was to rally the American spirit, and it features some of the anti-Japanese dialogue you'd have to expect.  But the film succeeds beyond the propaganda value.  The action sequences are well filmed and exciting, with terrific aerial action and some good ground sequences, too.  The camraderie amongst the crew is credible.  Each member has his own small "back story" as you would expect, but these fine character actors make it all very believable (Harry Carey is a particular standout).  This film is a true WWII classic.
