 Humphrey Bogart is an artist who paints pictures of his wives as the angels of death right before he kills them.  He's been painting a lot in his studio and he won't let wife Barbara Stanwyck see his portrait of her.  Hmmmmm?  Could this mean ...?  The film starts slowly, and doesn't really hit its stride until Stanwyck starts doing the math and adding up the clues.  Up until that time, not much happens.  Bogart is O.K., but this certainly isn't one of his top performances.  Stanwyck is very good once she's given a chance to act later in the film. Alexis Smith, as the intended next Mrs. Carroll, doesn't much register with a distant performance that reveals nothing of her character (although the script gives her little to do anyways, other than a few good exchanges with Bogart at a tea party). I enjoyed the last thirty minutes a lot, but I wish the script and director had managed to make the first two-thirds more interesting. The story has more potential than the film delivers.
