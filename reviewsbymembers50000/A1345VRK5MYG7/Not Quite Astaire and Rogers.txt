 Hold That Ghost is probably my favourite of the Abbott and Costello films.  I remember seeing it as a child and enjoying it for the "trick" rooms in the mysterious house and for the great moving candle scene.  Upon  viewing it as an adult, the scene that had me in tears laughing so much was  the hilarious dance number between Lou Costello and Joan Davis, an  excellent comedienne who adds so much to the film.  That scene alone makes  the movie worth viewing.  But you also get scream queen Evelyn Ankers and  even the Andrews Sisters.  Not all of the A&C films were winners, but  this one definitely is.
