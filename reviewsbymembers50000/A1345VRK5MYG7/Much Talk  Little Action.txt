 In an odd bit of casting, Marlon Brando stars as Napoleon Bonaparte, the French general that became such a key figure in European history.  The film traces his rise and fall through his relationship with the title character, a French seamstress played by Jean Simmons.  Considering the man of action that Napolean was, there's not much in the way of action here.  But people do talk a lot.  Yet the script gives them very little of interest to say.  I can't say that I learned much more about Napolean or was able to understand much about his character.  Brando is an odd choice for the role, and his performance is not very successful.  Simmons fares better, while Merle Oberon as Josephine is completely wasted in her role, disappearing without having an opportunity to do much of anything, save one good scene following her split with Napolean.  The film looks good, but it doesn't come together well, and I was left feeling unsatisfied.
