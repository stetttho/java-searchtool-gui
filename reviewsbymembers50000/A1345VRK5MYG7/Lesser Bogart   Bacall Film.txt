 Dark Passage is the least well known of the Humphrey Bogart/Lauren Bacall films, and with good reason, since it is not of the same quality as their other three films.  Bogart plays Vincent, a man wrongfully imprisoned for  the murder of his wife, who escapes and is greatly aided by Irene (Bacall),  a woman familiar with his case who believes his innocence.  Bogart remains  out of camera range for the first part of the movie, and is then covered  with bandages following surgery to alter some of his facial features.  The  story is somewhat far fetched, and the climax seems a bit rushed.  Bogart  and Bacall give good enough performances, and Agnes Moorehead pulls out all  the stops as Madge, the shrew that has complicated both of their lives.   The film is entertaining, but it's not up to the level of their other  films.
