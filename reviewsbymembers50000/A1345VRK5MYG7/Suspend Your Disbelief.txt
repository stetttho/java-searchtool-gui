 This film has raised a few eyebrows over the years, since the subject matter is of a grown man falling in love with a woman pretending to be a twelve year old girl.  However, upon viewing, you will discover that this comedy presents the material in such an innocent way, you simply have to suspend disbelief and enjoy the complications that ensue.  Ginger Rogers is the woman/girl who pretends to be the child to get the child's fare on the train since she is short on cash, and Ray Milland is the officer she meets on the train who takes care of her.  She ends up at the military school where he works, and she causes quite a sensation amongst the young cadets.  But more than that, she stirs up things in the relationship between Milland and his fiancee.  Rogers does as well as anyone could playing a twelve year old in pigtails, making it almost believable that she could fool everyone.  She's a lot of fun and well matched by Milland.  Diana Lynn is terrific as Milland's fiancee's young sister, the only one who sees through Rogers' masquerade.  There's a number of really funny moments, such as Rogers fending off the juvenile advances of the young cadets, and the hair "epidemic" of the girls at the dance (I don't want to give the funny visual away). Billy Wilder's clever dialogue is a treat to listen to (as usual) and deceptively adult.  If you accept the premise of the film at face value, you'll find a number of laugh-out-loud moments and endearing characters in this comedy that is one of my favourites from the early Forties.
