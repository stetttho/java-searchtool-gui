 I've had the advantage of seeing The Petrified Forest as a movie and on stage.  Taking into account the fact that the stage production I saw wasn't the greatest, I still think that the movie version captured the story  better.  The story is dated and clearly belongs in the time period it was  made, but that works in the film.  The performances also work.  Leslie  Howard, sort of a forgotten Thirties' star these days, manages to make some  difficult dialogue play well.  Humphrey Bogart, in an early role as the  young gangster, makes his character an interesting and sympathetic figure,  despite not having many moments to really develop the character with  dialogue.  Bette Davis brings a lot of conviction to her role as the young,  full of ideas waitress that Howard falls in love with. The Petrified Forest  is a hostage drama, but it's more than that.  It looks at life, growth,  love, and disillusionment.  It presents a nice contrast of characters,  since Howard and Bogart are both at the end of their roads, having gotten  there in very different ways.  Bearing in mind that the film/play was  written for an audience in the Thirties, today's movie fan will still find  truths and entertainment in it.
