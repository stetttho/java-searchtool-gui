 Little Caesar was one of Warner Brothers' first gangster movies, and it helped to establish the genre and make it a prominent part of the Warner Brothers' output.  Edward G. Robinson was an unlikely star, and this was  the film that put him on the map.  His performance as Rico is never boring,  although it has little subtlety (which usually works for the character).   The story is well structured, chronicling his rise and fall.  But the lack  of a musical score (typical for an early sound film when they were still  learning about the medium) is noticeable, and the pacing is off.  The main  character of Rico is pretty unlikeable, which affects viewer involvement in  the movie.  As an early sound film, it has historical interest, but as  entertainment, it is not as successful.
