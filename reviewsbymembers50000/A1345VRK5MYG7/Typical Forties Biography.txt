 Fredric March stars as the famous writer, who despite all the honours that would come his way, had the mud of the Mississippi River stuck between his toes and never got past the plain spoken humour and truth that were a part of him, whether the academics appreciated it or not.  The film spans his whole life, taking highlights from various points and tying them together with his famous works and quotations often associated with him.  March is quite good in the role, a challenge given the impression everyone already has of the famous writer.  Alexis Smith plays his wife and biggest fan.  There's not much to the role, and she does what she can with it.  His early adventures are a lot more interesting than his later life, although March is more effective as the older Twain.  I particularly enjoyed the early riverboat scenes.  As with any biography from Forties Hollywood, it approaches its subject with reverence.  That's fine, but it doesn't always make for exciting viewing.  The film is directed without style or edge, and although it's easy to watch, it's not very inspired or engaging.  I think Mr. Twain would have wanted a sharper script!
