 Towards the end of the Civil War, Union spy Errol Flynn is sent to Virginia City to stop a secret Confederate shipment of gold from reaching its destination, thus giving the South money to finance its failing war effort.  Randolph Scott is the Confederate soldier in charge of the operation, and Miriam Hopkins is the dance hall girl/Confederate spy who helps to set it all up.  Fans of Dodge City will find this Flynn western to be a disappointment, since it lacks the colour and spectacle and sense of fun of Dodge City.  Flynn walks his way through the role without much conviction, but then again, he is saddled with less than acceptable co-stars.  Scott is boring in his role, and poor Miriam Hopkins was a terrible choice for hers.  She is very out of place in the story, not convincing as a spy and even less convincing as a showgirl!  This role needed Ann Sheridan or Alexis Smith.  But an even worse bit of casting is Humphrey Bogart as a Mexican (!) bandit.  Max Steiner provides a rousing Western score, but sadly, the story defeats it.  Some of the action is good, but the film never involves the audience much, and the ending left me cold.  Errol Flynn and director Michael Curtiz made several other films together that are quite a bit better than this one.
