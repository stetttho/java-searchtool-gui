 This is a great movie based on a great novel, and I am surprised by how honestly the film captures the raw humanity of the book.  Steinbeck weaved social commentary into the story, and the movie makes many points about the  human condition and spirit without being heavy-handed.  The story of the  Joads and their fight for survival rings very true, thanks to the realistic  performances and the atmosphere created by director John Ford.  Henry Fonda  gives one of the best performances I have ever seen him give, and his  "I'll be there" speech is one of the great movie moments.  Jane  Darwell is also very impressive, and her direct, down-to-earth style of  acting makes the quiet strength and the suffering of Ma Joad seem very  real.  The Grapes of Wrath is an American classic, both as a novel and as a  film.
