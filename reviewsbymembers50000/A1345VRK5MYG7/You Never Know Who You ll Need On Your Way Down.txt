 Kirk Douglas gives another intense, memorable performance as a tough, manipulative Hollywood producer who uses a lot of people on his climb to the top, and even though he starts them on their way too, they are reluctant to help him when he needs them most.  Barry Sullivan is the B-director that Douglas helps make a top flight director, Lana Turner is the alcholic actress that Douglas turns into a star, and Dick Powell is the reluctant writer that Douglas brings to Hollywood and makes rich and famous.  However, each one bears scars from their experiences with the ruthless producer.  The performances in the film are all excellent, with special praise going to Lana Turner, who really delivers an emotional, tough portrayal in a career hight-point.  The insights into backstage Hollywood are also interesting in this tough drama that reminds us that we should be good to the people we meet going up the ladder, because we may need them when we are on our way down.
