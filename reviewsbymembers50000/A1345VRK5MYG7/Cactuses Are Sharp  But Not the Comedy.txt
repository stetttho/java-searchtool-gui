 James Cagney stars as a pilot who agrees to "kidnap" the daughter of an oilman as she is about to elope and fly her to him before the marriage can happen.  He will be paid ten dollars a pound for her, money he needs to keep his plane from being re-possessed.  Bette Davis stars as the oil heiress and Jack Carson (did he ever actually get the girl in a movie?) is her singer-fiance who wants the publicity their marriage will bring.  I can't say this is the funniest comedy I've ever seen.  Davis spends most of the movie hollering and getting cactus needles pulled from her backside.  It's a far cry from the kind of films for which she's usually remembered.  This isn't Cagney's best work either, although he appears to be having fun.  There are some fun moments, but you tend to expect more from a star pairing like this.  Fans of these to great actors (like me) should watch this film, even though it is little more than a footnote in their careers.
