 Murder on the Orient Express is one of Agatha Christie's most famous stories, and in this film it is brought to life by an amazing cast.  Businessman Richard Widmark is found dead with multiple stab wounds while aboard the famous train, and it's up to passenger and detective extraordinaire Hercule Poirot, played by Albert Finney, to solve the crime while everyone waits for the tracks to be uncovered from fallen snow.  Surprisingly, my only criticism of the film is the lead performance by Finney, which is mannered, difficult to understand at times, and not at all what I picture Poirot as being like, having read a number of Christie's books.  The rest of the cast is terrific, with special praise going to Ingrid Bergman and Wendy Hiller.  The final scenes of revelation are very well done, and whether or not you already know the story and solution to the crime, I think you will find this movie to be very entertaining.
