 I should probably make a few things clear before I review this film.  First of all, I have always loved courtroom dramas.  Secondly, I also enjoy a good Agatha Christie mystery.  Since this film is a combination of both, it's hardly a surprise I enjoyed it so much.  Tyrone Power is accused of murdering an older woman he was involved with, and it's up to barrister and heart patient Charles Laughton to defend him.  Power's best hope for help is his wife, Marlene Dietrich, while Laughton is forever being babied by his nurse, Elsa Lanchester.  There are a series of surprise revelations that take the viewer on a winding road to the truth, and the trip is a lot of fun.  The performances are all excellent.  Laughton gets to ham it up, and he does so with relish and style, while Power is surprisingly impassioned and convincing.  Both Dietrich and Lanchester give their usual quality performances, and it's fun to see an older Una O'Connor as the dead woman's maid.  O'Connor was a very distinctive character actress that added a lot of humour to many a film.  There are some great lines in the film delivered by Laughton (evidence of director and co-writer Billy Wilder's hand), and when added to a terrific mystery, you have the makings of a good evening's entertainment.
