 Paul Muni is terrific in this story of a returned WWI soldier unable to find the kind of work he wants to do.  When he is accidentally mixed up in a hold-up, he ends up being sentenced to ten years in a brutal chain gang.  He escapes and starts a new life for himself, but can the hunted man ever really escape his past?  There are a number of reasons for recommending this fine film.  Muni, not always the most subtle of actors, really delivers with this performance.  His wordless response to finding out he will not be pardoned is unforgettable.  The story and dialogue are presented in a very frank way, not attempting to gloss over anything.  The scenes in the chain gang and prison camp are riveting and disturbing.  This is not a feel-good movie, but a tough social drama and character study that will involve you every step of the way.  Muni is an Everyman, trapped by circumstance and driven by necessity, and his struggle is not one you will soon forget.
