 Marlon Brando gives a stunning performance as a former boxer who finds himself in the middle of a battle involving a mob boss who has overtaken a dockworkers' union and the law that wants to take that boss down. The film is most famous for the scene in the back of a cab where Brando tells his corrupt brother Rod Steiger that Steiger guided him wrong, telling him to take falls instead of letting him become the boxer he could have been.  He could have been a contender, but instead is just a "bum". But there is more going on than just that famous scene.  This film is compelling in tbe way it presents one man's internal conflict over his own actions and whether he should inform, as well as his conflict with the mob he has grown to hate, but also fears.  Brando plays all sides of these conflicts with such charisma and depth. He is well supported by strong performances from Eva Marie Saint, Steiger, Karl Malden, and especially Lee J. Cobb in an explosive role.  Director Elia Kazan packs a number of scenes with a real dramatic punch, building to an unforgettable climax.  There is a toughness and strong urban feeling created by the stark black-and-white photography and location shooting.  On The Waterfront is both a social drama and character study, and in all respects, a great film.
