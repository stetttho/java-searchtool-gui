 Bette Davis stars as Miss Moffat, who inherits a home in a Welsh mining town and decides that she will educate the young, especially the boys, who are otherwise doomed to a life in the mines.  One student, played by John Dall, gets her attention when he reveals depth beyond what she expected, and before long, they are working hard towards getting him a scholarship to Oxford.  However, the housekeeper's conniving daughter threatens to ruin everything.  Davis is very good as the crusading, very emotionally controlled middle-aged teacher, only once in a while letting us see her act.  The supporting cast are all good, with Dall especially strong as the student fighting against his background.  There is the occasional moment of stiff dialogue, but there are also some terrific lines as the intense relationship between teacher and student is explored.  Irving Rapper doesn't have much punch as a director in this or any of his other films that I have seen, but the story is the kind that will draw you in and having you rooting for the underdog.
