 King's Row starts off with a view of a sign that announces that the town of King's Row is a great place to live and have a family.  The rest of the movie shows you just how untrue that sign was.  The film turns the romantic  view of life in a small town upside down, exposing a lot of vices and  prejudices.  The performances are a mixed bag.  Ann Sheridan gives one of  her best performances as the girl from the wrong side of the tracks  (literally), and Ronald Reagan surprises with an effective job as the  victim of a sadistic doctor.  But Robert Cummings is sometimes laughable as  the very idealistic young doctor and Betty Field is over the top as his  troubled girlfriend.  The supporting cast is generally fine, with an  especially fine performance by Nancy Coleman, who should have become a star  but didn't.  The movie is both dramatic and entertaining, and if you like  stories about small towns like I do, then don't miss this one.  It's an  eye-opener!
