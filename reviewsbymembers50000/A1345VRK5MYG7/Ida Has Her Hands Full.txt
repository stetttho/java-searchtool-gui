 Ida Lupino stars as a tough torch singer who comes to the aid of her family, all the while trying to deal with her own heartbreak.  One sister, Andrea King, is trying to raise her son while her husband, John Ridgely, recovers from the War in a psychiatric ward.  Another sister, Martha Vickers, is afraid to start dating/living life.  Her brother, Warren Douglas, is working for a gangster, Robert Alda, and getting himself into tighter and tighter situations.  Then there is the couple across the hall, Dolores Moran and Don McGuire, whose personal problems spill over into the family as well.  And while all that is happening, Lupino embarks on a difficult romance with Bruce Bennett, a troubled pianist worn down by life.  Obviously Ida has got her hands full.  Lupino is very good in the central role, able to mix toughness with tenderness in a way that few actresses can.  Alda is surprisingly good as the gangster who uses everyone, but can't get Ida to fall in love with him the way he has fallen for her.  The rest of the cast are strong as well.  I like the way director Raoul Walsh starts the film off with the great rendition of "The Man I Love", which helps to set a mood and atmosphere.  The film gives the viewer a real sense of life in 1946 in Los Angeles.Walsh always paced his films well, and he keeps this film moving, giving it an edge that it needs.  Watch how Ida manhandles McGuire at the end!  Although the music, direction, and supporting performances are all important to the film's success, it is ultimately Ida Lupino that makes this film work.
