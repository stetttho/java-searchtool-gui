 A number of Warner Brothers' top stars get a chance to do something different in this wartime musical.  Dennis Morgan, Joan Leslie, and Eddie Cantor star as ... performers trying to get into an all-star performance that will feature some of the top stars of the day.  This plot serves as a link to various numbers performed by actors not usually seen in musical rolls.  That's the fun of this film.  Errol Flynn's considerable charisma is on display in his bar room Cockney song which also demonstrates his physical agility.  Bette Davis puts in a game effort singing "Their Either Too Young Or Too Old", which also includes her being thrown about in a dance number.  Alexis Smith also gets tossed around, lifted, and twirled in another dance number.  Olivia de Havilland, George Tobias, and Ida Lupino are jitterbugging twits in a number that shows de Havilland's sense of humour and willingness to look silly.  Ann Sheridan sings to a group of girls about love, looking very beautiful as she does so.  Alan Hale and Jack Carson do a long duet, while a very awkward John Garfield sing-speaks "Blues in the Night."  Humphrey Bogart has an amusing bit where the always amusing S.Z. Sakall browbeats the tough guy.  Perhaps best of all is a rousing all-black number featuring Hattie McDaniel that is full of energy.  Thank Your Lucky Stars isn't a great musical jammed with memorable songs.  It's memorable because of the performances of its non-musical cast.  The connecting plot is passable and sometimes interferes with what the audience really wants to see, but not enough to be a liability.  Fans of film will want to see this one at least once.  It's one of a kind.
