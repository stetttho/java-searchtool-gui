 The Roaring Twenties came at the end of the gangster cycle of movies in the Thirties, and it's a fitting end.  The film takes sort of a documentary approach to the era of Prohibition, from its beginning to its finish after  fourteen years.  At the same time, it chronicles the rise and fall of a  gangster played by James Cagney, who becomes a big shot, only to lose it  all.  Cagney is, as usual, riveting in his role, with some great scenes at  the end of the movie.  Priscilla Lane is the idealized love of his life who  can never return his love because of her dislike for his lifestyle.  Gladys  George is excellent as Panama Smith, a speakeasy hostess who really is  Cagney's soulmate, even though he doesn't realize it.  Humphrey Bogart has  another one of the bad guy gangster roles that he had a lot of in the  Thirties. The movie is well directed and moves along quickly, and although  it doesn't really offer anything new to the gangster film genre, it does  give the viewer a good overall look at the era, with a finale that is truly  memorable. It's worth seeing.
