 James Stewart is the irascible but devoted family man and Virginia farmer trying to keep his family together during the dying days of the Civil War.  He forbids his boys (and he has lots of them!) from joining the War, despite the pressures being put on them by others.  But in the end, despite his best efforts, Stewart can't keep his family from being touched by the tragedies of the War.  It's hard to remain neutral when the world is falling apart around you. The movie starts out in a light-hearted way, with Stewart's stubborness coming across with humour.  But the film's tone changes throughout its running time and becomes darker, as his stubborness becomes more like arrogance, and the realities of war penetrate the family's isolation.  Stewart learns some hard lessons.  He can't control everything and everyone. James Stewart dominates the film, with a forceful performance that anchors the film.  The supporting cast is good, but no one is given enough time to really standout.  There is enough action mixed with the human drama to keep the film moving along.  Shenandoah isn't a landmark film or a great example of a western, but it succeeds very well in presenting a moment of crisis in a man's and his family's life.
