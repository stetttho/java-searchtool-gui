 Humphrey Bogart stars as one of the righthand men of a Chinese warlord (played by Lee J. Cobb) who takes off from his boss and poses as missionary priest.  Gene Tierney also stars as one of the workers at the mission, while E.G. Marshall and Agnes Moorhead co-star as the mission's doctor and his wife.  Bogart as a priest is a little farfetched, and he never quite seems to get completely into the character.  The rest of the performances are acceptable and the setting of the Chinese mission is an unusual one.  It may have been more interesting if the script had further explored the growing attraction between Bogart and Tierney (who thinks he's a priest) and spent a little more time concentrating on Bogart's effect on the Chinese villagers.  The movie is interesting enough, but has little impact.
