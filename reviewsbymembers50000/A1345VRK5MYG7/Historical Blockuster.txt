 Anthony Adverse is a film that I like and would recommend despite certain shortcomings.  It's the story of an orphaned boy who grows up during the Napoleonic era, and faces a series of trials in his life as he battles for  his soul.  If that sounds dramatic, the movie definitely is.  Fredric March  plays the title character, and although I don't think he was the best  choice for the role, he's good enough.  A young Olivia deHavilland plays  his girlfriend, but can only do so much with an underwritten part.  The  supporting cast is excellent, containing some of my favourite character  actors from that time.  Claude Rains and Gale Sondergaard are good as the  villains.  Some of the scenes (especially those in Africa) are a little  hard to believe, but it's never boring.  And maybe that's the reason why I  would recommend the movie.  It has action, romance, many locales, and  history, all presented on a grand scale.  It's a blockbuster in a way that  we don't see very often these days.
