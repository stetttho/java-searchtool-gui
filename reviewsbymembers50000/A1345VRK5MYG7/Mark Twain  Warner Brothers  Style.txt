 I've never read Mark Twain's novel to be able to say how closely this movie follows to the original story.  It certainly has the Warner Brothers' touch.  Errol Flynn is his usual dashing, dauntless self, perfectly at home  with a sword in hand.  Claude Rain again is the cunning, cultured villain,  and Alan Hale is a welcome face, although this time he is Flynn's foe  instead of friend.  As Prince Edward and his look alike beggar friend, the  Mauch twins are occasionally annoying, but for the most part quite  effective as the victims of a switch that learn to appreciate the other  side of life.  The story is fun and played with a lot of energy and humour.   Don't assume that this is an Errol Flynn video, because he really isn't  the star - the twins are the stars.  However, there is enough of Flynn to  keep his fans happy, and a good enough story and movie to keep everyone  happy (including children).
