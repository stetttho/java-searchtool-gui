 MGM's David Copperfield was a great opportunity to make use of some Hollywood's great character actors, and the film does so to great effect.  Of course, the film is based on Dicken's famous novel, although the story is condensed.  Freddie Bartholomew stars as the title character, a young boy eventually orphaned who meets a host of characters as he grows up alone.  Although Bartholomew was actually one of the better child actors in film history, he never captures this character and his performance sometimes seems forced and ineffective.  However, he is surrounded by an incredible group of actors playing memorable supporting characters. Basil Rathbone, W.C. Fields, Edna May Oliver, and Roland Young are all excellent in roles that only Dickens could have written.  They make the movie.  The film features the usual MGM production values and is well worth a look.
