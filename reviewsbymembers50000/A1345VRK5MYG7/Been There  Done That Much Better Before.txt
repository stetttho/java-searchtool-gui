 Humphrey Bogart stars as an American operating in the black market in Syria during the French occupation.  Bogart can't return to the U.S. because of his shady past.  He has no loyalty to either side ... he is his number one concern.  He becomes intrigued by Marta Toren, the mistress of a French officer, Lee J. Cobb, who wants to make peace between Syria and France.  He crosses paths with Bogart several times as both men pursue Toren and become embroiled in the political conflict. Sirocco isn't a particularly interesting film.  Bogart seems bored by the whole thing, giving a tired, been there, done that performance that makes you wish you were watching one of his earlier films where this type of character and situation was much better played out.  The characters aren't compelling enough to care about, which really kills any chance for dramatic tension.  The script is dry, the direction bland, and the film appears to have been made on the cheap.  Fans of Bogart will want to watch this if only to see him, but it ranks amongst his lesser efforts.
