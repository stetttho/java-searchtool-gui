 Key Largo gives the viewer a chance to see three of Warner Brothers' greatest stars in one movie:  Humphrey Bogart, Edward G. Robinson, and Lauren Bacall.  Bogart stars as Frank McCloud, a WWII G.I. who has seen  death firsthand, and it's taken a toll on him.  While visiting a late G.I.  buddy's wife (Bacall) and father (Lionel Barrymore), Bogart finds himself  held prisoner in their hotel by mobster Johnny Rocco (Robinson).  Bogart's  mettle is repeatedly tested as he is challenged by Robinson to fight back.   Ultimately, he has to decide if there is still a hero inside him that the  war didn't kill.  The performances are all very good, especially Claire  Trevor as Robinson's much abused, alcoholic girlfriend.  Robinson is also  terrific, and has a great opening shot smoking a cigar in his bathtub.   John Huston, the director, creates a tense, realistic atmosphere in the  movie.  You can almost feel the humidity in Key Largo.  The script is  intelligent, and it's an opportunity to see Bogart and Bacall together in a  different type of relationship on camera than most movie buffs probably  remember them for.  The movie presents memorable characters in a  suspenseful situation, and it's very well made.
