 Mrs. Miniver was an important film to come out of Hollywood during WWII.  Not only was it a critical and commercial success, it had a great message for the British about continuing the fight.  It also give the rest of the  world a sense of what it was like for the British living with the constant  threat of the Germans.  The movie has a lot going for it.  It's directed by  William Wyler, who once again does an excellent job, balancing sentiment  with drama in this story of Mrs. Miniver and her family.  Greer Garson  gives a warm performance as the model English wife and mother, and Walter  Pidgeon is solid as her husband.  The supporting cast of Teresa Wright,  Dame May Whitty, and Henry Travers add much to the film.  There are a  number of scenes that I really enjoyed, including Mrs. Miniver's  confrontation with a downed German airman, the Minivers' night in their  shelter during an air raid, and the final scene in the Church.  Almost  sixty years later, it's easy to see the emotional impact this film must  have had on audiences.
