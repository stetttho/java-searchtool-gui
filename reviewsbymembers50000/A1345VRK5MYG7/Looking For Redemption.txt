 James Cagney stars as yet another cocky character out to make fools of the Establishment.  This time it's the Royal Canadian Air Force.  Cagney, Dennis Morgan, Alan Hale, and George Tobias star as bush pilots in Northern Canada who feel their patriotic spirit roused during a radio speech by Churchill pumping up the British/Allied morale.  They decide to enlist as pilots, only to find their age and attitude working against them.  Cagney's need to do things his way leads to tragedy and in the end he must find some way to redeem himself.  Although Cagney was given a chance by Warner Bros. in the early Forties to break out of his usual mould of character in several good films, this is a step back into his typical role.  He's good, but we've seen it before (many times).  The rest of the cast are solid, with Brenda Marshall, as the opportunistic girl caught between them, giving a surprisingly strong performance.  The aerial work is fine, although it seems more remarkable due to the technicolor photography.  The film is competently directed by Michael Curtiz, but it seems to be missing some of the energy he brought to other films.  The film suffers from a "seen this before" quality.  There's nothing particularly exciting or new about it.
