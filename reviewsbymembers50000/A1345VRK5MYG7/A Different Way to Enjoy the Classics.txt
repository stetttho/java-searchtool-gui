 This box set contains four classic radio programs, and the stories will be familiar to most listeners.  Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor, and Sydney Greenstreet reprise their film roles in the Maltese Falcon.  It's an  abridged version of the story, but works well enough.  However, those  familiar with the film and novel might find it a little disappointing,  since it lacks their breadth.  Rebecca features radio performances by  Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh in this Gothic tale of a man obsessed  with his late wife, and the new wife who must compete with her memory.   This version works well, and it's fascinating to hear the Oliviers  together.  The Scarlett Pimpernel is the exciting story of an Englishman  who tries to save the lives of those being guillotined during the French  Revolution.  Both Leslie Howard as the Scarlett Pimpernel and a  French-accented Olivia de Havilland as his wife give terrific performances.  The Grapes of Wrath is a good adaptation of the Steinbeck novel, featuring  an unknown cast.  It's well done, although not quite as interesting as the  other three tapes.  On the whole, these tapes are a great way to enjoy  these stories.
