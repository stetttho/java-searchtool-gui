 Errol Flynn gives a very relaxed, engaging performance as an artist, divorced for a year from his wife, who wants her back, which would also please the couple's seven year old daughter very much.  Eleanor Parker is the ex-wife who also has feelings for her ex-husband.  With everybody still loving everybody, getting back together should be easy, but this film tosses many problems in their way.  The script is basically an extended sitcom, with mix-ups, disguises, pratfalls, and a cute kid.  Fortunately, the whole cast seems to be having fun with the material, light as it is, which helps to get past many of the contrived situations.  Flynn and Parker have a breezy chemistry here, and Forrest Tucker, as a Marine caught up in the tangle, is fun too.  Patti Brady, as the little girl, is a natural that doesn't get on your nerves like some kid actors. Humphrey Bogart has an unusual "cameo" that is worth a laugh.  Never Say Goodbye isn't great comedy but the performers play it with energy and the right touch.
