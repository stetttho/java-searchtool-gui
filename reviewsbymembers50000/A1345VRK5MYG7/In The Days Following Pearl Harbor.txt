 Wake Island details the battle for the island in the days immediately following Pearl Harbor.  Wake Island was a small, flat piece of nothing in the middle of the Pacific that had strategic importance.  When Japanese bombers began attacking, there wasn't much the American Marines stationed there could do, although the battle they put up in the face of hopeless odds was remarkable.  Needless to say, the emphasis is on the action here, as it should be, and it is efficiently and effectively played out.   There's a number of familiar character actors that give the movie a comfortable feel.  The film is competently made, and history lovers and war buffs will no doubt find it entertaining enough.
