 I recently showed this video and another Lucy video to my students, and I was happy to see that the humour of I Love Lucy has lost nothing in the change of generations.  They loved Lucy, too.  This video contains one of  her most famous episodes and scenes where she stomps the grapes in the wine  vat.  Lucy is at her comedic best in this episode.  Notice the hilarious  way she dances and runs around the vat.  I've read that the Italian woman  in the vat with her got a little carried away and nearly drowned Lucy!   That's method acting.  The other episode is also funny, although not as  famous.  Lucy's attempts at ballet are hilarious, and the "Slowly I  Turned" routine also works well.  What a gift for physical comedy the  lady had!
