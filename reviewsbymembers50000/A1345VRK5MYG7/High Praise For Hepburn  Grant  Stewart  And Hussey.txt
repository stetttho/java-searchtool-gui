 Katharine Hepburn stars as a socialite about to marry self made man John Howard. Her ex-husband, Cary Grant, brings a couple of reporters, James Stewart and Ruth Hussey, to her wedding to cover it for a tabloid. She hates any invasion of her privacy, but begins to get over it when she discovers Stewart's talent for writing. As the film progresses, it becomes apparent that a lot of the characters are in love with each other, and by the end, you're not quite sure who will be getting married. The characters also learn that perfecton is a lot to ask of someone, and it's really the flaws that we all have that define who we are and make us so interesting.  This film has become a classic of comedy for a number of reasons. The dialogue and screenplay are first-rate, with a tremendous amount of wit, sophistication, and humanity thrown in, as characters reveal themselves by both words and sometimes by just the look on their faces. This is greatly aided by a dream cast of actors. Hepburn has fun playing the tough, demanding socialite in the beginning, but then goes deeper into the insecurity of the woman underneath with a lot of honesty. Grant is at his usual classy best, delivering one liners with ease, while also demonstrating his true feelings underneath it all. But it's the reporters who come off the best. Stewart is witty, cynical, and surprisingly romantic in a performance that is not what you would usually expect from him, and Hussey is dryly funny and wise as his patient photographer more interested in him than the story. Young Virginia Weidler, as Hepburn's little sister, is terrific and very natural. George Cukor expertly weaves it all together, and topped with the usual M-G-M production values, it's a class effort all the way.
