 The always intense John Garfield stars as a boxer framed for the murder of a newspaper reporter who was about to expose the real story behind his carefully crafted public image.  Conveniently, the real killer and the only witness to what really happened are both killed in a car accident, leaving Garfield without a defense.  So he takes off, ends up in California and gets mixed up with the Dead End Kids, a girl, and an old lady who befriend him, not knowing his real identity.  There's a lot left to luck in this film as dogged detective Claude Rains chases after the boxer.  The Dead End Kids are an acquired taste, although in this film they aren't as grating as they would become in later years.  Garfield, as usual, is very watchable and believable.  Rains, on the other hand, is miscast as the detective and never for a moment seems convincing.  Ann Sheridan is equally miscast as Garfield's drunk girlfriend, although she makes a quick exit in the film, despite her uncalled-for high billing.  Gloria Dickson, the girl he falls in love with, has a few good moments, but lacks star quality.  The script has a number of holes in it, but it also has some good moments.  I particularly enjoyed the dramatic water tower sequence, as the boys must try to escape from a water tower where the water is going down.  This is very much an old fashioned movie, especially in the boxing scenes, but that is also part of its appeal, since it is a great example of the kind of film Thirties audiences enjoyed.
