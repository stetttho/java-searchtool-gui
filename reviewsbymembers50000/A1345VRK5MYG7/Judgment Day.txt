 Jack Benny stars as an orchestra trumpet player who falls asleep during a radio performance and dreams that he is an angel looking for a promotion sent to Earth to destroy it.  The world has become destructive and full of hate and conflict so Benny's angel is told to blow four notes on a trumpet at midnight to end it all.  Things get messed up and Benny finds himself Earth-bound, trying to adapt to life on the unfamiliar planet, while up in Heaven his girlfriend-angel Alexis Smith tries to find some way to resolve his predicament.  I find Benny funny in small doses, but I don't think the comedian was much of an actor or is able to sustain a character for an entire film.  The supporting cast is good, with Franklin Pangborn scoring well with his patented fussy character and great reaction shots.  The script presents some good ideas, although more could be done with the concept.  Director Raoul Walsh adds some great touches, including an amazing shot that sails over the heads of what appears to be thousands of angels in rows playing in the heavenly orchestra.  The climactic moments as Benny struggles in the 3-D billboard's coffee cup are also well shot and very creative.  I'm not usually a fan of remakes, but I think this is one film that Hollywood could remake better.  The idea is fun, but I don't think this film exploits its potential.  But it's worth a look and it's certainly unusual.
