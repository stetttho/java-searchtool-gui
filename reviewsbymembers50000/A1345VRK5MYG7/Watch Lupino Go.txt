 They Drive By Night has a lot going for it.  It's directed by Raoul Walsh, who knew how to make a tough guy movie, yet give it some heart.  It has two of the screen's great tough guys, George Raft and Humphrey Bogart.  It also  has two of the screen's best tough guy girlfriends, Ann Sheridan and Ida  Lupino.  And it has some really great dialogue that time has not dated.   It's the story of two truckers who are brothers, and it looks at the  difficulties facing truckers (sleeplessness that can lead to accidents,  suppliers that don't pay up, etc).  Bogart and Raft are good as the  brothers, although Raft doesn't have much of a range as an actor.  Raft  hooks up with Sheridan, a woman who can hold her own with any trucker.   Sheridan plays her with just the right mix of outward toughness, but  decency and tenderness, too.  Unfortunately, Lupino wants Raft, and she  won't be denied what she wants.  Lupino gives the performance that you'll  remember from this film.  She becomes more intense with every scene, and by  her last scene, she reaches a level that is amazing to behold.  With  Lupino's performance and the great dialogue, They Drive By Night is a  Warner Brothers' film that should be seen.
