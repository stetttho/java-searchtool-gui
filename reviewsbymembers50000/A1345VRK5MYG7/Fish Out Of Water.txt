 Edward G. Robinson stars as gangster Little John Sarto, a man fed up with the racket who travels across Europe in the hopes of finding class.  When he returns, he finds his gang in the hands of Humphrey Bogart, his girlfriend Ann Sothern newly wealthy, and himself penniless and still without class.  He tries to get back into his old life, but it proves to be harder than expected, and he ends up hiding out in a monastery of all places!  Brother Orchid came at the end of the cycle of gangster films at Warner Brothers.  It's a hard film to classify - it's part gangster film, part comedy, and also a character study of a man's moral awakening.  Surprisingly, these diverse elements come together well in the film.  The plot is unbelievable, but Robinson fits into the role well, bringing a history to the character through all of his other gangster performances, and also bringing his talent for broad comedy that was not seen often enough.  Sothern is terrific as his patient fiancee, while Bogart doesn't register much as the cardboard bad guy.  Allen Jenkins, one of Warner Brothers best character actors, has some funny moments as Robinson's loyal henchman.  Director Lloyd Bacon keeps the film moving right along, and although this fish-out-of-water story may sound too farfetched, its heart is in the right place and it's fun to watch.
