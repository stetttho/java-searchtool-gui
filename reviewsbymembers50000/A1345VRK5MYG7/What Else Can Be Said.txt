 Casablanca is the kind of movie that people are talking about when they use the phrase "classic movies".  What makes it so classic?  For starters, there is such a well constructed script, full of memorable  dialogue and scenes, which is all the more impressive given the chaos under  which it seems to have been written (I've read the writers didn't even know  how they were going to end it and that it changed on almost a daily basis).   Then there is Humphrey Bogart, the epitome of "coolness" as  Rick, the cynical, detached night club owner.  There's Claude Rains, witty,  charming, and sly as the chief of police, in a perfect performance.   There's a great supporting cast, including Sydney Greenstreet and Peter  Lorre.  There's a terrific musical score, as well as fine direction (in a  style that you wouldn't expect from Michael Curtiz).  If anyone considers  themselves a fan of movies, this film is required viewing.
