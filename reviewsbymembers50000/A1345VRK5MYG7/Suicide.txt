 William Powell stars as sleuth Philo Vance who is trying to solve the murder of a man who it is assumed committed suicide.  The film begins by setting up the motives of several people for wanting him dead so that his death comes as no surprise.  However, he is found dead in a locked room with no signs of struggle, shot in the head with the gun in his hand, so the conclusion of suicide seems natural.  But not to Philo Vance, who carefully pieces together a series of events that point only to murder.  Powell is fine as Vance, but does not make the same strong impression as the other famous sleuth he portrayed, Nick Charles.  The supporting cast is excellent, with the always reliable Mary Astor and Eugene Pallette among the actors.  The mystery is well presented and difficult to solve, and despite the age of the film, stands up well.  Mystery buffs will really enjoy this film.
