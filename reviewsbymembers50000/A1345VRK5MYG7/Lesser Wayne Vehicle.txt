 In one of his lesser starring efforts, John Wayne plays the leader of a construction company that goes on to help form the Fighting Seabees, an armed group of workers.  Prior to the Seabees, the construction crews building air strips and other military installations weren't allowed to carry arms.  Wayne is stubborn and determined to say the least, and he pushes to have his men armed for battle as they work on curiously named islands in the Pacific during the Second World War.  The film's focus is torn between the establishment of the Seabees and Wayne's romance with journalist Susan Hayward.  Neither plotline is developed enough, and considering that it appears to be a war film, there's not much to the fighting in the film.  It's not a bad film, but it suffers from a low budget and a script that needed much more work.  However, there is a rare chance in this film to Big John jitterbug, which is good for a laugh.
