 I've never been a fan of musicals.  People spontaneously breaking into song doesn't do much for me.  So I watched 42nd Street because I knew it was an important early musical and the musical numbers were directed by the  legendary Busby Berkeley.  In other words, it had historical value.  And if  only for that reason, I would recommend others watch it, too.  But I  actually liked the movie more than I was expecting.  There's not much to  the story, but the backstage action is fun to watch.  The musical numbers  really are an eyeful, and I can see why Berkeley has the reputation he has.   There are some great lines (most supplied by Ginger Rogers as  "Anytime Annie"), and the acting really isn't important, so  there's not much to say.  I enjoyed the title song, plus a few others.  I  have one complaint:  Ruby Keeler.  It's a real stretch for the imagination  to believe that Broadway would have cheered her as a great new star.  She  was a clunky dancer, and not exactly a vocal wonder, either.  But that  aside, the movie is entertaining, and it really is fascinating to look at  the kind of movie Hollywood produced in the early Thirties after sound came  in.  It might surprise some people.
