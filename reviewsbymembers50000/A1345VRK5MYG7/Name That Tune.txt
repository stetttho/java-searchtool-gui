 Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce star in their final film as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.  This time, the duo is on the tracks of a gang stealing music boxes that mysteriously hold key information that will lead to much money.  The music boxes are made in prison by a bank robber, who encodes the clues, but they are sold at an auction before his partners can buy them.  There's nothing they won't do to get their hands on the boxes, including murder.  There's not much new in this film that hasn't been seen in the other films of the series, although the music box angle is an interesting way of transferring information.  Rathbone doesn't play this one with much energy ... maybe he was getting tired of the role, while Bruce is his usual, bumbling self.  Although hardly the best in the series, fans of the duo will want to check it out.
