 Robert Taylor and Vivien Leigh star as a soldier and ballerina who meet on Waterloo Bridge during World War I and fall in love.  Later, believing him to be dead and unable to find work, she and her best friend Virginia Field  must provide "company for men" to support themselves.  It's a  tragic look at the desperate decisions people can make that forever alter  their lives.
