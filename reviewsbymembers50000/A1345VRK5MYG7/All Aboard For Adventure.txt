 Lauren Bacall plays an American doctor's widow who is responsible for a young Hindu prince in India.  Along with British army captain Kenneth More and others, they board an old train to escape to safety, because rivals  want the young prince dead.  Of course, the train trip is anything but  smooth and uneventful.  The film works really well, with enough quiet  moments mixed with action scenes to keep the viewer entertained.  There is  also a very credible attraction that develops between the Bacall and More  characters.  Bacall's character is quite outspoken (the kind of character  she did a lot when she got older), while More is amused by her and  attracted to her.  There's a lot of action and suspense built up, and since  this film is not well known these days, it's a nice surprise to view.
