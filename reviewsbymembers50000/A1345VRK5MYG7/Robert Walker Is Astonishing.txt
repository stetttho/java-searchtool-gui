 The first time I watched this film a number of years ago, I recall not being particularly impressed.  I recently watched the film again, and maybe because my expectations were quite low, I was really impressed by it.  Not sure why I didn't like it the first time!! Farley Granger stars as a tennis pro trying to get out of a bad marriage so he can marry a senator's daughter, Ruth Roman.  Robert Walker is an odd character he meets on the train who hates his father and wants him dead.  Unwittingly, Granger ends up in a deal in which Walker will kill Granger's wife in exchange for Granger murdering Walker's father.  And when Walker goes through with his part of the bargain, Granger finds himself in the uncomfortable position of being a murder suspect and owing Walker a murder as well. Walker is astonishingly good in his role, walking away with the film with a performance that should have been rewarded back then and better remembered today.  He's one of Hitchcock's great villains.  Neither Granger or Roman registers with much of an impact, while Marion Lorne as Walker's protective mother has a couple of very strong scenes.  Patricia Hitchcock, the director's daughter, is very amusing as Roman's sister. Pretty much all of the memorable scenes in the film involve Walker.  The film's climax is really well done and a lot of fun to watch.  There are a few holes in the story, but they can be overlooked when it has so much else going for it.  There as some great shots (typical for Hitchcock) with some interesting symbolism.   I'm really glad I watched the film for a second time!
