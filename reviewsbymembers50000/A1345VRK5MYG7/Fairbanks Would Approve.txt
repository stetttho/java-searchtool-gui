 Anthony Hopkins is the real Zorro and Antonio Banderas is the young bandit he grooms to take his place and to fight against the Don responsible for the death of his wife and the taking of his daughter.  Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Hopkin's daughter who has been raised as the Don's child.   The three stars are all excellent, bringing both their dramatic capacities and a comic touch to each character.  The story is engaging, with amusing dialogue and interplay between the leads.  The action is well staged and punches up the story.  All in all, it's great entertainment and a well made film.  I suspect Douglas Fairbanks and Tyrone Power would have approved!
