 James Cagney and Pat O'Brien star in this screwball comedy about two movie writers (infamous for their antics) working at a struggling studio who need to come up with a hit script for its comboy star, Dick Foran.  They stumble on the idea of using the baby of studio waitress Marie Wilson in a film, making the baby and the cowboy an unlikely team.  The idea takes off, but creates a lot of complications in the process.  Cagney and O'Brien are the whole show, and the interludes where they are not in the scene slow the film down.  They have such timing and rapport together they are naturals bouncing ideas and gags off of each other.  Watch Cagney in particular and his amazing timing and expressions, and it's not hard to see why he got frustrated by always being given gangster scripts.  He had a gift for comedy.  The supporting cast is OK, but pales in comparison.  The other aspect apart from Cagney/O'Brien that makes this film so successful is the way it makes fun of the behind-the-scenes elements of moviemaking, with its pampered executives making bad choices all the time.  This film takes a bite out of Hollywood.  With its high energy, satiric slant and the Cagney/O'Brien teaming, this film entertains.
