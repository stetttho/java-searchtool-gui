 As the first of the popular Airport movies, this film laid the groundwork and patterns for what would come - take a bunch of actors, some new and some veteran, give them each little melodramatic subplots, and link them together via aviation disaster.  This one concerns the problems that beset a Chicago airport when a huge snowstorm strikes the same night a looney tunes passenger decides to blow a hole with dynamite in a plane en route to Rome.  Dean Martin and Barry Nelson are the pilots on board trying to get the plane safely back to Chicago, while Burt Lancaster, Jean Seberg, and of course, George Kennedy work on the ground to solve the problems.  There's too much emphasis put on melodrama and failing marriages, but the last half of the film works well when the suspense kicks in.  The leads are all okay, but it's a few of the supporting performances that work best.  Maureen Stapleton is very believable and touching as the bomber's wife who is too late to prevent the tragedy, while Van Heflin as the bomber is appropriately intense.  Helen Hayes provides some of the film's best moments as a crafty stowaway, although the single best moment is provided by a priest towards the end who has a perfect way to shut up a panicked passenger.  Airport is very much a film of its time, but it is fun to watch, particularly once you've made it through the soap opera of the first half.  When the plane gets off the ground, so does the story.
