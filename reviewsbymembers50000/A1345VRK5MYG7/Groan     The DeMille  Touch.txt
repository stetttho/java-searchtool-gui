 For me, this movie already had two strikes against it before I even started watching it:  Cecil B. DeMille and Charlton Heston.  I've always thought DeMille movies were overproduced, empty spectacles, and that Heston performances were overripe, empty caricatures.  Well, both men were true to form in this story about the conflicts behind the scenes at a travelling circus.  Heston snarls and orders people around as the circus manager, the object of the affections of Betty Hutton, aerial star, and Gloria Grahame, elephant trainer.  Enter Cornel Wilde, the hotblooded French aerial star, and things get complicated (not really ... the story never gets that deep).  Jimmy Stewart stars as a clown with a mysterious past (I'm not kidding about that), and Dorothy Lamour is ... well ... I'm not actually sure what her purpose was in the film, other than to badly lip synch a few songs.  Other than Stewart, who in all honesty could read the dictionary and make it interesting, the performances are pretty bad.  But then again, saddled with such lousy cliched dialogue, there probably wasn't much they could do.  Yet although I seem to be trashing this film a lot, it was entertaining somehow.  The circus spectacle is colourfully presented, and if you just accept the plot, dialogue, and acting for what they are - products of the DeMille "touch", it is mindlessly fun.  That may not be glowing praise, but like I said, for a film that already had two strikes against it in my book, I was expecting worse.
