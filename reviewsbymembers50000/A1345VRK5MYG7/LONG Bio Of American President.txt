 Alexander Knox stars as Woodrow Wilson, beginning at his time at Princeton, moving on to his time as Governor of New Jersey, and of course, concluding with his important years as President.  I can't say that Wilson was the most compelling man, although his dry wit is fun, but he was around during WWI and the creation of the League of Nations, so he was important and those events help to keep the film interesting.  Knox is very good as Wilson, and he is surrounded by a large supporting cast that does well.  A lot of money was obviously put into this production, from sets to costumes.  But the film really seems quite long and a little too reverential.  Maybe the scope was too great, although I think a little trimming would not have hurt the film either.  There are obviously moments included to help bolster the American war effort during WWII, since this film was made in 1944.  In any case, although there is much to admire here and it is interesting history, do be prepared to sit for a while.
