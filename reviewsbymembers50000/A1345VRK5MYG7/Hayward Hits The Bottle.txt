 Susan Hayward pulls out all the stops in this story of a woman who sinks into alcoholism.  Her husband, Lee Bowman, gives her everything she could want, but in doing so, takes away her self-respect and identity.  This seems to be a female version of The Lost Weekend (made a few years earlier), although it's definitely more melodramatic.  Hayward gets to run the range of emotions and does so to great effect, including a catfight with Marsha Hunt, who is excellent as Bowman's controlled assistant and suspected mistress.  The movie attempts to take a serious look at alcoholism, but that takes a backseat to the soap opera elements in the story.  There's nothing really new here now, but this story must have had more bite when it was first released.  Hayward's strong performance makes it watchable, and it is interesting to view an early attempt at explaining the psychology behind this disease.
