 I hadn't heard much about this Spencer Tracy/Katherine Hepburn pairing, so I didn't know what to expect.  It wound up being a fun movie, if a little unbelievable.  Tracy stars as a scientist and Hepburn is the owner of the  home where he sets up shop.  Both have had difficult  experiences with love  in the past and have decided they are against it.  For convenience sake and  since they are compatible, they decide to marry, believing that a marriage  without love could work.  Since it's Tracy and Hepburn, the viewer  obviously suspects something different.  The movie is amusing, and apart  from the real chemistry of the two leads, it also benefits from a wry  performance by Lucille Ball as Hepburn's real estate agent.  It may not be  the greatest film of Tracy and Hepburn, but it is worth watching  nonetheless.
