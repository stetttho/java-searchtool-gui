 Is Gone With The Wind the greatest example of filmmaking?  No.  But it is one of the greatest examples of movie entertainment out there.  The proof is in the way this movie of epic length and proportion has held the  audience attention for over sixty years.  Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh are  larger than life as two of the most famous characters of all time.  Gable  in particular deserves credit for a performance that displays a wider  emotional range than we're used to seeing from him.  Olivia deHavilland is  perfect in a role that must have been difficult to bring to life and seem  real.  Hattie McDaniel is terrific, finally given a chance to show her  dramatic ability instead of simply being comic relief.  Only Leslie Howard  fails to deliver, and he seems uncomfortable with his role.  The  technicolor is beautiful, the swelling score is unforgettable, and although  I think the first half of the movie works better than the second half, the  film as a whole reminds you of the magic that movies can make.
