 Claude Rains stars as the father of four pretty, musically talented daughters who learn all about the complications of love.  The Lane Sisters - Lola, Priscilla, and Rosemary, along with Gale Page, play the loving sisters.  Of these, the non-Lane, Page, gives the best performance as the down-to-earth oldest sister, pursued by one man, but in love with another.  It's a quiet, touching performance.  The men in their lives are Jeffrey Lynn, Frank McHugh, Dick Foran, and John Garfield.  Garfield is easily the standout among the boyfriends, his hardened-by-life musician a precursor to the Method actors of the Fifties.  In a way, he clashes with the idealized family presentation and sweet goodness of this unbelievable family, yet it also helps to ground the film in reality.  It is sentimental, but everyone performs earnestly and the music adds to the atmosphere. It's a very easy way to spend ninety minutes.
