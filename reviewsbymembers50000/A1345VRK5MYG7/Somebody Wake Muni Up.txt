 A corpse-like Paul Muni stars as Benito Juarez, the Mexican leader who helped established democracy in his country, fighting against Emperor Maximilian von Habsburg, who had been made head of the country through the machinations of Napoleon III.  From the outset, the unwanted Emperor is doomed, since he does not have the support of the people, and he is fighting against a man universally respected by the Mexicans.  Muni is heavily made up and does not change his expression from beginning to end.  To say he is understated would be putting it mildly.  Brian Aherne is quietly affecting as the Emperor, a man I suspect could not have been as saintly as portrayed here.  Bette Davis is the Emperor's wife, Carlotta.  She uses her famous eyes to great effect as a woman who can barely contain her emotions, until a remarkable moment near the end when Davis lets loose.  Claude Rains again steals scenes, this time as Napoleon, while the rest of the supporting cast is saddled with less than riveting dialogue and barely registers.  The dialogue and direction is pretty heavy-handed and preachy at times, needing a dose of energy.  It's a safe bet that the history is inaccurate (Warner Brothers had a poor track record with this), but that can be overlooked if the drama makes up for it.  The sets and costumes establish the period well, but the film really never gets going enough, needing more drama and action to inject some life.  It's not a bad film at all, but I expected more.
