 Cary Grant and Myrna Loy have a very comfortable chemistry together in this comedy about a couple that decides to get out of their cramped city apartment and move out into the country.  Through stubborness and sheer ignorance, they end up making a number of expensive errors as they attempt to build their dream house.  The story is narrated by their friend and lawyer Bill, well played by Melvyn Douglas, a cynical man who learns it's easier to just let them make their mistakes.  Grant is the perfect actor to express the exasperation of the whole process.  The man had amazing comedic timing, deceptively making it look easy.  The script hits all of the potential problems with building, and the film is smoothly produced.  This is the kind of comedy that will appeal to most people, because almost everyone has had the opportunity to experience the joy that is remodelling, landscaping, decorating, or building.  There's something in here for everyone to appreciate.
