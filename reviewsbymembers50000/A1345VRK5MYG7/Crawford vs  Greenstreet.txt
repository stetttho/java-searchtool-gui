 When I saw that the movie was essentially going to be about Joan Crawford taking on Sydney Greenstreet, I knew this was one I had to watch.  Crawford plays a former carnival dancer who falls in love with deputy sheriff Zachary Scott, only to have him pulled away from her by Greenstreet, the sheriff, who is planning on advancing the weak Scott's career so that he can have some behind-the-scenes power.  Having spent most of her life moving from town to town, Crawford isn't in a hurry to leave, which sets up the central conflict of the film as she goes against the sheriff.  The film is at its best when Crawford and Greenstreet spar, setting off fireworks.  Some of their dialogue is fun, making up for other less inspired stretches of the story.  Gladys George, a terrific character actress, does very well as the owner of a night club who employs Crawford.  It's not great cinema, but in the hands of old pros like Crawford, Greenstreet, and director Michael Curtiz, it is very watchable.
