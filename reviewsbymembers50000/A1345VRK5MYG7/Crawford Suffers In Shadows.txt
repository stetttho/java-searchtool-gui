 John Garfield stars as a tough (no surprise here) violinist who becomes tangled with wealthy, unhappily married art patroness Joan Crawford.  He's looking for his big break, and with her contacts, she is able to open doors for him.  It's the beginning of what becomes an uneasy romance with her, as he must battle his music with her, and she must battle with her inner demons with him.  Crawford, linebacker shoulders in place, plays her usual mix of tough vulnerability with intensity.  Garfield is his usual self as well, hardened by life on the outside, trying to fight his love for her on the inside.  The rest of the cast is fine.  The older Crawford got, the more artificial she became, and since I'm not a fan, I find the film hard to swallow just based on her alone.  Ernest Haller does a terrific job lighting her, with lots of shadows used to great effect.  In fact, apart from the stirring music, the photography is the best thing in the film, with a number of striking film noir-type shots.  The dialogue tries for greatness, but except for a few biting comments, fails to be anything but ordinary and melodramatic.  By the end of the film, I was tired of the melodrama, and although the ending is the best part of the movie, I was not unhappy to see it end.  Fans of Crawford will no doubt love this film.  For the rest of us, enjoy the music and cinematography.
