 The tremendous cast drives this fact-based story of a ship of over nine-hundred Jewish refugees allowed to leave Germany not long before the start of WWII to settle in Cuba.  The Germans had no intention of letting the ship dock in Cuba, but it was a propoganda ploy.  As the title of the film indicates, there is a feeling of doom permeating the whole story. Max Von Sydow does an excellent job portraying the compassionate captain trying to find some way of saving his passengers despite the personal risk to himself and his family back in Germany.  An all-star cast populates the passengers with strong performances coming from Faye Dunaway, Oskar Werner, Wendy Hiller, Maria Schell, as well as Sam Wanamaker and Lee Grant who both get a memorable scene of hysteria each. The attempts on land to solve the problem of the ship make up the other part of the film.  Most of these cameos are brief, although Ben Gazzara and especially Katherine Ross standout.   The direction isn't particularly inspired, and if it weren't for the compelling story and cast, the film would have been far less effective.  It is darkly photographed, which adds to the atmosphere of the story and sets and costumes are all authentic and well done. Voyage of the Damned isn't a great film, but the plight of its characters and the fact that it really happened will keep viewers watching until the end.
