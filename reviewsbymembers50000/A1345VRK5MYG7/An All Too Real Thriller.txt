 There were a number of excellent political thrillers in the Sixties, and Seven Days in May is one of the best.  Fredric March stars as the President who is trying to push through a nuclear disarmament treaty, but he is meeting a lot of resistance.  Chief among them is General Burt Lancaster, who has decided to take over the government to continue building America's military.  Lancaster has developed an elaborate plan for his takeover, but his assistant, Kirk Douglas, has been left out.  When Douglas begins to suspect something, the tension starts to rise.  The plot sounds incredible, yet as written by the great Rod Serling and directed by John Frankenheimer, it is only too believable.  The performances are all top notch by the stars, while Ava Gardner as Lancaster's former mistress and Edmond O'Brien as an alcoholic senator supporting the treaty shine in supporting roles.  This is a smart movie that will take you back to a time not long ago when the Cold War had paralyzed the world.  This is the kind of intelligent, tense thriller I wish we could see more of these days.
