 Here's a truly old-fashioned movie that is very corny, but watchable.  Pat O'Brien plays the title role with a lot of heart and reverence.  Reagan appears briefly as "The Gipper" and I don't think he registers as  well as some people remember.  The movie gives you a lot of information  about the early game of football and it gives you a good sense of what  Rockne was like.  But it really is corny.  It's worth seeing, if only for  the "win one for the Gipper" scenes.
