 Lifeboat isn't as famous as some of Hitchcock's other films, but it deserves to be seen today.  It's a chance to see Tallulah Bankhead, who if anything, had a very interesting screen presence.  She was an original.   It's also a chance to see a very human portrayal of an African American  character (Canada Lee) at a time when Hollywood rarely did that.  There is  also a lot of commentary about the Germans and the war, which given the  time when this film was made (during the war), makes it all the more  fascinating.  The performances are good (including a very young Hume  Cronyn), and Hitchcock manages to keep the action moving despite having so  limited a space in which to do so.  If you like Alfred Hitchcock, this is  one you should see.
