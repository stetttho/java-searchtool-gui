 It seems that Paul Muni must have liked playing famous men, because this isn't the first biographical film in which I have seen him. Muni stars as the famed French writer Emile Zola, a champion against social injustice. At  first, I thought his performance was sort of hammy, but as the picture  progressed, I ended up appreciating his humour, flair for the dramatic  moment, and physical transformation. It's a memorable acting job. Equally  memorable is Joseph Schildkraut as Captain Dreyfus, an army man that Zola  defended against charges of treason. Schildkraut gives an emotional,  touching performance as the man who was wrongly convicted and imprisoned.  The film has something to say about the human condition, but avoids being  preachy. It's a very good biography about a remarkable man.
