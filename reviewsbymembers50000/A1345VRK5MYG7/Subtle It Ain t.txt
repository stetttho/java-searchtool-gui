 Looks like I'm going to go against quite a few of the other reviewers for this film by not praising it wildly.  The story is quite basic.  Pianist Bette Davis reunites with former love Paul Henreid, a cellist, hiding from him her love affair with composer and musical genius Claude Rains.  Of course, one lie naturally leads to others, until she finds herself backed into a corner trying to save her marriage and her husband's future.  All of this is played against a backdrop of unreal sets and dramatically charged classical music.  The whole premise is a difficult one to believe, although it is buried beneath lots of bravado acting, interesting dialogue, and sometimes laughable bits of conflict and action.  Rains seems to be having a great time as the flamboyant, manipulative composer, biting into the dialogue and exploiting it for all its worth.  He overpowers his co-stars, but he and Davis are good together.  Henreid attempts to give more of a performance than I have seen in other films, but he never stands a chance with this cast.  For me the grand gestures, the grand acting, the grand music, the grand dialogue was ... well ... too grand!  Director Irving Rapper needed to get a better handle on the film.  It seems a little out of control.  It's not a horrible film, but by the end I found myself thinking, "What was that all about?!?!?"
