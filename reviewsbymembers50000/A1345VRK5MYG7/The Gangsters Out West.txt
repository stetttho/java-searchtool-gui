 An unlikely James Cagney stars as the Oklahoma Kid, a gunman wanted by the law, who gets mixed up in the fight against the corruption of the newly settled and built Tulsa.  Humphrey Bogart (with the great character name of "Whip McCord") has taken over the town, and when the citizens start trying to reclaim their town, Cagney gets drawn into the fight for personal reasons.  Unfortunately, as big a fan as I am of Cagney, it's very hard to swallow him as a horseriding gunman.  He puts in a good effort at it and seems to be enjoying himself, but he just doesn't fit into the Old West.  Of course, Bogart doesn't fit in either.  Dressed all in black (a not-so-subtle message about his character), he sneers his way through the film.  Rosemary Lane as the love interest doesn't bring much to the character or film, while Donald Crisp as her father and town judge is solid as usual.  There's plenty of action and shooting, and there was some potential with the story, but this film isn't much more than a miscast, routine Western.  Nonetheless, it's worth a look to see gangsters out West.
