 Suspicion is a movie that has an ending that frustrates some, and pleases others.  Personally, I think the ending is good and appropriate, although it is a little abruptly presented.  Joan Fontaine is quite good (I don't  usually care for her performances) as a quiet, reserved English woman who  marries the irresponsible Cary Grant, displeasing her father who assumed  she would make a wiser choice.  As time goes along, she begins to suspect  that her husband may have killed someone and might be looking at her as his  next victim.  The inclusion of a character that writes murder mysteries  adds to the mood and suspense.   Grant is very effective as her husband,  Johnny, and it's unusual to see him in a basically threatening,  unsympathetic role. Hitchcock slowly drops clues along the way, and the  glowing glass of milk is an excellent effect.  Suspicion is a very good  story, and although it's not the best example of Hitchcock's work, it's  still a good movie by any standard.
