 This is the kind of thriller I like.  I find the blood and gore slasher films to be boring and unimaginative.  But Wait Until Dark builds up genuine suspense with it's clever plot and psychological tension.  Hepburn  stars as blind woman whose husband has inadvertently taken possession of a  doll with drugs hidden in it.  Alan Arkin stars as a twisted criminal that  wants to get his hands on the doll, and he enlists Richard Crenna and Jack  Weston to join him in fooling the blind woman into handing over the doll.   Hepburn is terrific as the blind woman who proves to be more  self-sufficient than she probably even thought she was, and Arkin is very  scary as the psycho who terrorizes her.  The way that the men go about  getting the doll is fascinating, and the way the film is constructed, the  viewer really feels the suspense from the point of view of someone who is  blind and that much more vulnerable.  This is a suspense film that everyone  should see.
