 Although I usually get a kick out of watching the Seventies' disaster flicks, I have to say I was kind of hoping the quake would kill off most of the cast in this one, since the characters are so underdeveloped and unlikeable, I didn't care what happened to any of them.  Charlton Heston, jaw firmly clenched, stars as an engineer in a bad marriage and beginning an affair with struggling actress Genevieve Bujold.  His wife is played by a screeching, over the top Ava Gardner, and her father is played by Lorne Greene (ok ... think about that for a moment) who happens to be Heston's boss.  Others include the necessary George Kennedy as a frustrated cop, Richard Roundtree as a daredevil motorcyclist, and Victoria Principal as Roundtree's partner's sister.  If you thought Principal had big hair in her Eighties' soap opera days, get a load of the 'do they put her into in this film.  I don't know how she managed not to tip over from the weight of it!  She must have been left with back problems.  But back to the story, or what there is of it.  A huge earthquake strikes Los Angeles, placing the lives of all these fine citizens in peril.  Skyscrapers fall, buildings explode, fires are everywhere, floods begin.  Other than a mild interest in the Bujold character and her son (she's the only touch of class in this movie), I didn't like or care about anybody else, and if you don't have that, the film is pretty much over after the special effects stop.  The effects are good for the most part, but the script and direction and acting are so poor they ruin the rest of the film.  It's a disaster alright, but probably not in the way the producers intended it to be.
