 Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor, Sydney Greenstreet, and John Huston reteamed after The Maltese Falcon to make this film, and although this movie is not in the same league as their first effort (but how many movies are?), it is  entertaining nonetheless.  Set primarily aboard a Japanese freighter, it's  basically an espionage thriller with a lot of humour thrown in, as Bogart  attempts to get information on Greenstreet's shady dealings with the  Japanese, while also romancing Astor, who may or may not be involved in the  goings on as well.  The dialogue is snappy and the performances are all  light and easy and well done, with Bogart and Astor displaying more of the  chemistry seen in The Maltese Falcon.  It's too bad they didn't do other  films together.  Although this movie isn't as great as the other  Bogart/Huston films, it's more than worth a look.
