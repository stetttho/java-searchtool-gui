 Loretta Young stars as a young model working in a department store run by a brutal manager played by Warren William.  He's hated by all his employees, since he sets a high standard and will not suffer mistakes at all.  His job is his life, giving him no time for romance or even relationships.  He's not above using people for what he needs, though, and Young finds that out the hard way.  This is one of those pre-Code films that gets away with a lot more (subject matter, dialogue, etc) than most films made just a few years later.  It's also clearly a Warner Brothers film, with it's tough talking characters and quick pacing and editing.  Some of William's speeches to his employees are really hard hitting, yet what he has to say is very true, just without normal human compassion.  William doesn't hold back, delivering a forceful performance that certainly doesn't soften the edges of this hard character.  Young is sweet and appealing, and Wallace Ford, her love and fellow employee, is good in the beginning, although his distraught moments towards the end are less effective.  It's always fun to step back into history and watch a film like this.  It's surprising just how "mature" films could be back then.
