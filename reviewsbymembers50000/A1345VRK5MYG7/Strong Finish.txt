 Evil Under The Sun follows the case of a selfish English actress who is murdered at an exclusive island resort, surrounded (of course) by a number of people who will not mourn her death.  Diana Rigg is the actress, and it's up to Hercule Poirot, played again by Peter Ustinov, to solve the seemingly impenetrable crime.  I don't think his performance represents Poirot the way Christie probably envisioned him, but he is fun as the famous sleuth.  The potential murderers are played by such recognizable stars as Maggie Smith, James Mason, Roddy McDowell, and Sylvia Miles.  Most of the actors play it very broadly, often going for laughs, with Smith being the most successful at it.  The film moves along quite slowly, really coming to life as Ustinov reveals all, solving the crime just as we knew he would.  With its poor pacing and script-in-need-of-a-rewrite, this isn't a great mystery movie.  But finding the solution will keep you interested, particularly with an ending that pays off.
