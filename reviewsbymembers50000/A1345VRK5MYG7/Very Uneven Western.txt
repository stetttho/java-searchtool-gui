 I was ultimately disappointed by this tale of the American mistreatment of the Cheyenne Indians in the years following the Civil War. Despite an incredible all star cast, beautiful photography, and a great score, this film failed to involve me as I watched it.  I think the problem lies with the script.  Very few characters are fleshed out, there are too many to concentrate on, and the story jumps around.  The Jimmy Stewart / Arthur Kennedy sequence as Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday is a lot of fun, but very unnecesarry to the film. Perhaps a more streamlined approach would have helped to focus the story more.  In any event, the film has some beautiful moments and fans of Westerns or John Ford will probably want to see this one, but I suspect many people will be left unsatisfied by the end.
