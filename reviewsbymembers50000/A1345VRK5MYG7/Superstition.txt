 Joan Blondell, Ann Dvorak, and Bette Davis star as three schoolmates who meet when they are older and find their lives tangled together.  Blondell was the wild one who did time in reform school and is now a funloving showgirl.  Dvorak was the popular one who married well and is now completely unfulfilled.  Davis was the smart who is now working as a stenographer.  When they light their cigarettes using the same match, superstition says one will die.  The film focuses mostly on Dvorak, whose life spirals out of control in a number of surprisingly frank scenes (this was pre-Code Hollywood).  Dvorak is excellent as usual, bringing depth to her character.  It's too bad she is largely forgotten today.  Blondell delivers another solid performance, while Davis barely registers in a badly underwritten role that requires her to be pleasant and nothing else.  The supporting cast is full of familiar faces, including Humphrey Bogart, Warren William, Ann Shirley, Glenda Farrell, Edward Arnold, Allen Jenkins, and Clara Blandick (Auntie Em!).  The vices of drugs and alcohol are realistically presented here in a way that may surprise you (notice Dvorak wiping her nose after what we assume is cocaine use!).  Director Mervyn LeRoy packs a lot into the film's short running time, and despite the seventy years that have passed since it was made, it seems remarkably fresh for today's audiences.  It's an intelligent, well made film.
