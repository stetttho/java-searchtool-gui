 Edge of Darkness is one of the most effective films I have seen to show the rising of the common man against the enemy.  In this film, it is a small Norwegian fishing village that has been occupied by the Nazis.  Errol Flynn (as a fisherman), Ann Sheridan (the doctor's daughter), and Judith Anderson (owner of an inn) lead the underground movement to resist the Germans.  Walter Huston and Ruth Gordon also star as Sheridan's parents, while Helmut Dantine is the heartless Nazi commander of the town and Nancy Coleman is his unhappy Polish mistress.  The film traces the lives of some of the townspeople as their resistance grows, but never gets maudlin.  The performances and the story are presented with restraint so that the bigger picture of a people engaged in a battle for their country is never lost.  The camera is used to great effect, as is the music of Franz Waxman.  Director Lewis Milestone creates a picture of heroism and shows the power of each person to stand up against the enemy. It was the sort of message that 1943 audiences needed to see as the world was at war, and audiences today can appreciate the film as a reminder of a time in our history when a lot of ordinary people did extraordinary things.
