 If you love courtroom dramas, then don't miss this film.  Humphrey Bogart stars as the captain of the Caine who has been relieved from duty by his officers who believe him to be insane.  This is one of Bogart's best later performances, twitching with paranoia, yet somehow oddly sympathetic.  Van Johnson is excellent as the officer who takes over and ends up charged with mutiny.  Fred MacMurray is also terrific as the officer/novelist with the self-professed yellow streak.  Robert Francis is adequate as the new officer who finds himself tangled in the mess.  And Jose Ferrer is amazing as the lawyer who defends Johnson.  He delivers a show stopping final scene.  The scenes demonstrating Bogart's paranoia are well done and memorable, and the courtroom scenes are full of tension.  What I liked most about the film is that when all was said and done, I had to really consider if Bogart was as bad as he seemed.  That's a tribute to his fine acting, not to mention the complex screenplay with its many layers.  Any movie that leaves you thinking is more than worth "the price of admission".
