 I'm probably one of the few people that will say that I didn't like this film as much as I thought I would, based on what I had heard and read before I watched it.  The premise is great, with the aunts burying the  bodies in the cellar and the brother who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt.  I  usually like movies with these kinds of off the wall set-ups and  characters.  I like some of the lines (especially the "galloping"  insanity), but this movie wasn't completely successful for me.  I know that  Cary Grant was supposed to be over the top with his performance, but in my  opinion, it doesn't always work.  And the part of the plot dealing with his  criminally insane brother doesn't fit in well.  Some of the scenes are  good, but overall, this film was a disappointment for me.
