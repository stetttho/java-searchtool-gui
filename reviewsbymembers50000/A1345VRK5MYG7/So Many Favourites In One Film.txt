 Henry Fonda stars in one of his most famous roles as Mr. Roberts, an officer on board a cargo ship, a man who underestimates his importance and the respect he is shown by an appreciative crew.  The reason they admire him so much is because he stands up to their dictatorial captain, played ferociously by James Cagney.  Fonda brings a lot of dignity and quiet strength to his character.  The great William Powell is Fonda's confidant and ship's doctor, and Powell plays him with wisdom and class.  Jack Lemmon, as Ensign Pulver, gets many of the film's best laughs, as he broadly plays the officer who is a lot of talk, but not much action.  Mister Roberts combines humour, honesty, and drama very well, giving the viewer a real sense of the camaraderie onboard the ship.  We also see how the human spirit can triumph under difficult conditions.  And it's also a great chance to see four of Hollywood's greatest actors in one film, each one showing what they did so well.  This is one to watch.
