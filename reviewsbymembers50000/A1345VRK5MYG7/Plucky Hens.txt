 As a fan of the Wallace and Gromit movies, I was looking forward to seeing this full-length animated feature and I was not disappointed.  Using the same sophisticated adult humour meshed with eye catching animation for the kids, the film is a winner.  It tells the story of a group of hens trying to escape from a chicken farm where they are all about to be turned into pies.  A rooster arrives on the scene making big, but empty promises of helping them to escape, so it's up to the plucky hens to save themselves. There are a lot of tie-ins to other movies that adults will recognize and appreciate the cleverness, but there's enough colourful action and adventure to keep the kids happy, too.  The voice actors all do a great job bringing the characters to life. Of course, the animation is superb and very unique and a lot of fun to watch.  The film is a real winner!!
