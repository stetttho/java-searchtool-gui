 Cary Grant stars as a French officer looking into the black market in postwar Occupied Germany.  He is assigned American officer Ann Sheridan as an assistant, a woman with whom he has had a previous relationship which appears to have ended badly. There are obvious sparks between them, and as they endure a series of misadventures (usually at the expense of Grant), they become close again, marry, and then face another series of misadventures as they try to find a way to get Grant back to the U.S. as a "war bride".  Grant is in good comedic form here, although a little sour as the Frenchman who finds the road to romance filled with more than a few potholes.  Sheridan, sometimes wasted in her earlier roles at Warner Bros, is warm and engaging and has very good chemistry with Grant.  There are a number of good lines and fun situations for the twosome, and the sight of Grant in drag, with the worst wig imaginable, is well worth a good laugh.  But I did find the pacing of the movie to be off a bit, which surprised me given that the film was directed by the great Howard Hawks.  It moves a bit slowly at times and needed a little more energy.  But it's a fun comedy that benefits greatly from its two stars and their easy, expert performances.
