 The Male Animal is a movie that has you think about such serious issues as censorship and what it means to be a man, yet it doesn't sacrifice any laughs.  Henry Fonda is perfectly cast as the professor who must learn  whether he is man enough, and he is well supported by a beautiful Olivia  deHavilland and a cast of good character actors.  Not enough attention has  been given to this movie over the years, and it deserves to be  re-discovered.  A great movie!
