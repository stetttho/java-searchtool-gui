 Three sisters face maritals problems in this film that features one of the most subdued performances by Bette Davis you will find.  Davis is the oldest sister, and the one with biggest marital problems, since she is married to a drinking, unfocused sportswriter played competently by Errol Flynn.  Anita Louise is very good as the flighty middle sister, who marries a wealthy older man (Alan Hale) for security and a chance to see the world.  Jane Bryan is also effective as the younger sister who marries a very stable and boring Dick Foran for love, and seems to have it all.  Besides troubles with her husband, Davis also has to contend with the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906, re-enacted fairly well.  Davis usually displayed more fireworks in other melodramas, but her performance matches the tone of this film.  The Sisters isn't particularly exciting or surprising, but it is well made and well acted by the stars and a great supporting cast that includes Beulah Bondi, Henry Travers, Donald Crisp, and Lee Patrick.  It's a classy effort.
