 After watching Greta Garbo play so many tragic, suffering heroines, it is a nice change of pace to see her in something different.  She plays a Russian agent sent to Paris to clean up the mess created by three other bumbling agents who are taking advantage of the opportunity to be away from their severe lives back home.  They are trying to sell the jewels of a grand duchess exiled during the Revolution.  Melvyn Douglas stars as the duchess' representative and sometimes lover, and once he meets Garbo, he forgets all about what he is supposed to be doing.  Unfortunately, both of them are put into uncomfortable positions and the complications arise.  Is Ninotchka a hysterical, make you fall down laughing kind of comedy?  No, not at all.  But I did enjoy it a lot.  Garbo and Douglas are well matched, and Garbo is particularly (and surprisingly) effective in a role that lets her finally have some fun.  The three other agents played by Sig Ruman, Felix Bressart, and Alexander Granach, are a lot of fun and provide many laughs.  This is the sort of warm, inventive comedy we don't see much of anymore.  Fortunately, we have films like this.
