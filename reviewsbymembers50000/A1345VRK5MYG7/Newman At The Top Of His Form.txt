 Melvyn Douglas stars as a cattle ranch owner faced with every cattleman's worst nightmare - foot and mouth disease which could lead to the mandatory destruction of his whole stock.  Paul Newman is his selfish son Hud, a man with an appetite for the ladies and his own interests that has caused his morally driven father a lot of grief over the years.  Brandon de Wilde is Douglas' grandson by his oldest son, a boy torn between the morality projected by his grandfather and the fun, careless image of his uncle.  Patricia Neal stars as the housekeeper, a woman wise beyond her years who has seen a lot in her life and finds Hud dangerously attractive.  These four characters are the heart of this character driven film, shot in beautiful, stark black and white that emphasizes the emptiness of the land around and the lives of those living on it.  The conflicts are well presented, with sharp, revealing dialogue, and in the hands of these terrific actors, each character comes to life.  Enough praise can't be given to each actor for their work here, although Paul Newman must be singled out.  This is as good as he gets, and that says a lot.  There's not much in Hud's character to admire, but in some ways, the viewer does.  He's dangerous and doesn't pretend to be anything else.  He lives for himself, and makes no apologies.  Hud is an unforgettable character.  This is a movie that everyone should make a point to watch.
