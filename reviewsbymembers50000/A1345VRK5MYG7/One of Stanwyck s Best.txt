 For me, the highlight of this terrific comedy is the perfect performance by Barbara Stanwyck.  Although not a conventional beauty by Hollywood standards, she is very sexy and funny as nightclub singer Sugarpuss O'Shea,  who ends up hiding out with eight stuffy professors writing up a new  encyclopaedia.  She needs to hide to protect her crook boyfriend Dana  Andrews, and the professors want her there because she can explain to them  the meanings behind modern slang, since the professors are anything but hip  and modern.  Gary Cooper plays the professor responsible for the language  sections of the encyclopaedia, and he quickly falls in love with her.  Of  course, numerous complications arise.  Stanwyck, one of classic film's most  versatile actresses, is terrific, and all of the professors (including  Cooper) deliver warm, affectionate performances.  The scene where Stanwyck  gets them dancing is hilarious.  This is classic comedy has been somewhat  overlooked, but don't miss a chance to watch it.
