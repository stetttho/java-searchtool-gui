 Gentleman Jim features what I think may be the most relaxed performance I have seen Errol Flynn give in a movie.  He's seems very comfortable and at home in this somewhat fictious account of the life of boxer James Corbett.  Flynn is cocky and charming as usual in this story of how Corbett rose from being a bank teller to world champion.  A beautiful and sassy Alexis Smith is along as the love interest, while Alan Hale is his very Irish father, William Frawley his manager, Jack Carson his best buddy, and Ward Bond his biggest rival.  Everyone is very good and appears to be having a great time.  The boxing sequences are well staged by director Raoul Walsh, and generous doses of humour are found throughout.  It teeters on corny at times, but it is all played with such energy and obvious enjoyment, the corny moments can be overlooked.  As usual for most Warner Bros biopics, I'm sure it takes many liberties with the truth, but it doesn't matter.  The film is very entertaining in its presentation of his life and how boxing evolved.
