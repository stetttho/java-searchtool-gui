 Ida Lupino tries really hard to inject some life and energy into this story of two brothers who fall in love with the same woman.  Lupino is the poor single mother who loves one of the brothers, Errol Flynn, a free spirit who composes music.  Gig Young is the other brother, and rich girl Eleanor Parker is the object of both brothers' affections.  The story is too complicated to summarize in a few sentences, with the locale shifting across Europe.  However, the story is never credible, and neither are the actors.  Flynn was no longer cutting much of a dashing figure by this point in his career, and he brings no depth or conviction to the character at all.  Parker never seems like the type of woman who could inspire anything, while Young barely registers as the other brother.  Lupino goes for it, as she did with pretty much every performance, but with this script and ill-defined character, there's not much she can do than appear continually overwrought.  By the half way mark of the movie, I couldn't have cared less what happened to any of them.  There is some good music, but the story and characters do not flow nearly as well as the orchestrations.  This film is a disappointment.
