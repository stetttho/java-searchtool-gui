 Bill Bixby stars as an American computer expert in England who meets Helen Hayes on a train on her way to Scotland Yard. It seems she's one of those murder obsessed old ladies living in one of those small, scandalous English villages who believes a murderer is on the loose and she knows who it is.  She tells Bixby, "When no one suspects you, murder is easy."  Bixby is incredulous, but when Hayes is killed in a hit-and-run accident immediately afterwards, he begins to wonder if the old girl wasn't really on to something.  A trip to the village reveals she knew what she was talking about, and he sets out to find the murderer.  Updating the Christie novel into the age of computers wasn't a great idea, and it jars with the basic story.  Bixby and Lesley-Anne Down are O.K, but they are way out of their league in the presence of Olivia de Havilland as one of the villagers and Hayes in her gem of a cameo.  The murder plot is interesting, and the climax is fun, but this TV movie is only moderately successful, and were it not for the work of its veteran actresses, it would hardly be memorable.  They elevate it into something worth watching.
