 Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn star as the liberal parents of Katherine Houghton who find their liberal point of view challenged when she brings home her fiance, Sidney Poitier.  Although he's a doctor with impeccable credentials, her parents (and later his parents) worry whether the couple understands the adversity they will face if they go ahead with their interracial marriage.  When watching this film, it is important to remember it was made at a different time in the world and would have been more controversial in the Sixties than today.  The actors are all strong, with particular praise going to Tracy, Poitier, Cecil Kellaway as a family friend, Beah Richards as Poitier's mother, and Isabel Sanford as Hepburn and Tracy's maid.  Although it's great to watch such pros in action, the script isn't always up to their level.  Some of the conflict is simplisticly presented, with a final speech by Tracy that he pulls off like only he could, but which is too theatrical.  There isn't much tension either, since it seems obvious how the film will end.  But no doubt director Stanley Kramer and the screenwriter had to be careful how the material was presented, and in the capable hands of all those involved, it runs smoothly and probably appears better than it really is.
