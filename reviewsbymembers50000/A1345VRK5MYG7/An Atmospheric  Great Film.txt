 As a rule, I'm not a fan of melodrama.  I watched this film because I knew it had a great reputation, I had read the short story by Somerset Maugham, and it was directed by William Wyler, who is always dependable.  I was  surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  The film captures well the original  short story, but it extends it to make it even better.  The beginning and  ending of the movie are simply perfect, and it's great in between.  The  photography and the musical score are excellent.  Davis is very effective  in her role as the treacherous wife, and James Stephenson as her lawyer is  extremely good.  But it's Gale Sondergaard and her nearly wordless  performance that really stands out.  She was a tall, attractive woman with  a powerful presence, and that presence is used to full advantage in this  film.  It's a well-crafted film, and even if you don't like melodrama too  much, I think you will end up really appreciating this movie a lot.
