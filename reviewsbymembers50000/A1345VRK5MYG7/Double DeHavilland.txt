 The Dark Mirror is an improbable, yet entertaining suspense story about a detective and a psychiatrist's attempts to determine which one of a pair of twins committed murder.  The movie succeeds because of the effective  performance by Olivia deHavilland as the twins.  Rather than making the  twins polar opposites (which is what most actresses whould have done and  most twins aren't), she subtlely distinguishes between the two, and her  performance at the climax of the movie is very memorable.  The special  effects to give the illusion of two Olivias are quite good, especially  given the time when the film was made.  All in all, it's an entertaining  movie and I'd recommend it.
