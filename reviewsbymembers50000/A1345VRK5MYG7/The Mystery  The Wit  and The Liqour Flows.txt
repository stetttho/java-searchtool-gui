 This was the second in the series featuring the great film team of William Powell and Myrna Loy, again starring as Nick and Nora Charles, the couple who seem to have a way with getting mixed up in murder.  The mystery itself is quite complicated, but it basically surrounds the murder of Nora's cousin's husband, although his murder is only the first.  The mystery is fun to follow (and not easy to figure out, although my hunch proved right).  But the terrific dialogue and rapport between Powell and Loy matches the mystery, and even their dog, Asta, has some hilarious scenes as well.  The supporting cast of Elissa Landi, James Stewart, and many familiar character actors are also good.  I can't compare this to the other Thin Man movies, having not scene all of them, but I'm sure this must be one of the best and fans of mysteries and this great film team will definitely want to catch this movie.
