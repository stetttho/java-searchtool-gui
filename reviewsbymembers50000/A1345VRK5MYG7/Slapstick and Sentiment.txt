 Lou Costello stars as a tinker who is mistakenly shot and killed as a traitor during the American Revolution, and then cursed to spend the rest of time until doomsday on the property where he died.  Marjorie Reynolds is also trapped there with him as a ghost, and they develop a warm friendship as time goes by. The film fast forwards as a young couple restore the estate and move in, only to discover that the rumours about it being haunted are true.  Bud Abbott stars as a visiting friend of theirs, a man who is a descendant of one of Costello's enemies.  This is not a typical Abbott and Costello film, since they are not really teamed together, despite sharing some scenes, and it is also unusual because this film not only has the expected slapstick, but it also displays a lot of heart and sentiment.  Costello and Reynolds are very effective as the unfairly accused traitors trying to put their pasts behind them (even after death), and Gale Sondergaard as the clairvoyant housekeeper is an excellent choice for that role.  Fans of the duo and people who generally don't watch their films will want to catch this one because it will probably surprise them quite a bit.
