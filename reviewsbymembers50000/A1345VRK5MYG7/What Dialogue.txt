 For whatever reason, I was taken aback by how much I enjoyed To Have and Have Not the first time I saw it, and every subsequent viewing has left just as strong an impression.  It's the dialogue that gets me each time.   It's witty, smart, wry, and in the capable hands of Humphrey Bogart and  Lauren Bacall, it's a treat to hear. Bogart gives a relaxed, assured  performance that ranks with his best, and Bacall is a lot of fun in her  first film, mixing sexiness and humour with a quiet vulnerability.  Walter  Brennan, very good as Bogart's drunk sidekick, adds to the story.  There's  not a whole lot to the plot, but there is a lot of chemistry, and when  mixed with the great dialogue, the viewer gets to sit back and just enjoy  the show that Bogart and Bacall put on.
