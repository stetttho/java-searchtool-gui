 George Brent is having a hard time managing the women in his life.  He spends years in love with Bette Davis, but she won't marry him because he isn't ready to settle down.  He marries fiery concert pianist Mary Astor, only to discover her divorce from her first husband isn't finalized.  When she won't bend to his will, he goes back to Davis and marries her, only to disappear in the Brazilian jungle, leaving behind a broken-hearted Davis and a pregnant Astor.  The story behind The Great Lie is, needless to say, a bit farfetched.  It relies a lot on the viewer suspending their disbelief.  What really keeps this film moving is the sparring between Davis and Astor.  I've always enjoyed and appreciated Mary Astor, and in this film she's given a character right up her alley.  She sinks into the roll, throwing out her lines with obvious relish and taking control of every scene she's in.  Davis is good in a quieter performance, letting Astor have the spotlight.  Brent is his usual self, and Hattie McDaniel is given more dialogue and character to work with than her standard maid role, and she is very strong.  The music is a bit overpowering and over the top, but then again, so is the whole scenario of the story.  The strength of this melodrama is Mary Astor in one of her best performances.  The film is never believable, but she makes it fun to watch.
