 It's not hard to figure out what the purpose of this film was once the final credits roll.  Produced prior to America's entry into World War II,  this movie was designed to rally everyone around the flag with its heavy  doses of bravado and pride.  For today's audience, it's laid on a little  thick, but despite that, the movie still entertains.  It's the story of the  famed Irish American unit that fought during WWI.  James Cagney plays  another flawed tough guy who is all talk and little action (other than  running away) once the fighting begins.  Pat O'Brien plays another noble  priest that always knows the right thing to say.  George Brent plays  another boring character (or should I say, boringly plays another  character?).  The rest of the cast is populated by a who's who of Warner  Brothers' character actors that have faces you'll recognize, if not their  names:  Frank McHugh, Alan Hale, Dennis Morgan, Jeffrey Lynn, and Dick  Foran.  The battle scenes are well staged, and at 90 minutes long, it's  tightly edited.  The Irish must have been very pleased by and proud of this  film, for it portrays the bravery and honour of the regiment.  There's  nothing new here, but like most of Warner Brothers' war movies, it succeeds  in its purpose.
