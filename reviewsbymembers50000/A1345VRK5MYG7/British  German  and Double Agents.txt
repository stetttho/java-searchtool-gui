 Set during the last part of World War I, this spy thriller begins with the frustrations of the British military over the way the Germans seem to know their next move before they even do.  It's obvious there is a spy or leak somewhere that needs to be stopped if they are to have any success in the War.  Boris Karloff and Margaret Lindsay enter into the picture.  Individually or together, they could be British agents, German agents, or double agents, and the true identity of each is revealed at the climax.  The two spies test each other throughout the film as a plot to kill the British cabinet begins to unfold.  The film moves along briskly, with a running time of around an hour.  I have to admit that I was occasionally confused by the plot, although by the film's final moments I had figured it all out.  Karloff, limping and with a scar, is good as the more sinister (naturally) of the two agents, while Lindsay does a competent job as his female counterpart.  The last few minutes are devoted to rallying the public at the outset of World War Two when this was produced, with a poorly concealed speech about Hitler.  It's definitely heavy handed, yet it is fun to watch as a sign of the time.  Judging by the running time, the cast involved, and the production, this film was obviously intended as a 'B' picture, and as a modest little programmer, it succeeds fairly well.   Those expecting a bigger scale production will be disappointed.
