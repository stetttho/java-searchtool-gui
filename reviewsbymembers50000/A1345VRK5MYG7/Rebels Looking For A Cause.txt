 Marlon Brando stars as the leader of a biker gang that invades a small town and turns everything upside down.  To be honest, these bikers don't seem particularly dangerous, and some of the dialogue is so rooted in the  Fifties' slang I found myself laughing out loud.  However, the Brando  performance makes the movie worth a look, and he has an interesting  relationship with the sheriff's daughter.  I'm sure this film had a much  bigger impact on its Fifties audience than it does nowadays.  For me it was  a step back into another time for seventy minutes.
