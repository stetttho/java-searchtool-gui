 Gary Cooper stars in this intense Western as a former outlaw, now reformed, who finds himself trapped by circumstances with his former gang.  Cooper is on a train that is held up by the gang, and left behind, he, Julie London, and Arthur O'Connell meet up with the gang and witness firsthand their brutality and violence.  The gang is headed by Cooper's uncle, Lee J. Cobb, who is pleased to see Cooper return.  He's planning a big bank heist, the heist to end all heists, and wants Cooper to be a part of it like old times.  Of course, Cooper must find a way out.   The tension in the film never lets up, as the threat of violence hangs in every scene.  Cooper is fine in one of his last performances, portraying a man who has tried hard to overcome his past, finding himself in a situation where he must literally fight for his survival.  London also does well as the saloon singer finally experiencing love, giving a quietly moving performance.  Cobb is explosive as usual, helping to give the film some of its tension and edge. Man Of The West is well photographed in colour, with empty spaces looming everywhere in the backdrop of the struggle.  Director Anthony Mann keeps everything simple, if not elemental, not shying away from portraying the brutality of the characters and the situation.  Other than an obviously "stagey" fight between Cooper and one of the gang (lots of easy to spot fake punches), there is a dark realism throughout the movie.   Man Of The West may not be a very well known Western, but it deserves to be seen.
