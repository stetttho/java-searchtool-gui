 Marlene Dietrich stars as Bijou, a South Seas singer who keeps getting deported from different islands because her allure drives men to fight for her attention.  As she moves from place to place, she is accompanied by Broderick Crawford and Mischa Auer.  On one island, she meets and falls in love with Navy lieutenant John Wayne.  He falls for her as well, but her reputation makes her less than desirable company for those around him.  In the end, somebody must make a sacrifice.  Director Tay Garnett keeps the film moving along with plenty of action, stunning shots of Dietrich, and lots of South Seas atmosphere.  The over-the-top brawl at the end is the film's highlight.  Wayne, in one of his early major film appearances, does little more than look earnest, while Dietrich is as exotic as usual.  It's not a great film, but it is entertaining.
