It is left for those who have not yet read the book to discover  after they select this book and begin their enjoyable reading. This book is  in humorous language and gets increasingly interesting as the page number  increases! A good read for both young and old. I have seen children nagging  their parents to read the book out for them. I have also heard my friends  saying that this book actually reminds them of their past -- they used to  read children's stories by Green and Hans Anderson. So do not hesitate, but  give it a try. The craze it brings is already enough to tell you how good a  book it is!
