 Sons is actually a book about the differences between the three  generations. Wang Lung died peacefully in the beginning. The story  continued with the three different kinds of life the three sons of Wang  Lund led. All of the three sons were concisely portrayed, with a slight  emphasis on the third, Wang the Tiger. He rose slowly to the position of a  warlord. In order to pass his position to his son as he was growing old, he  sent his son to a military school to learn western war techniques. However,  his sons turned against him by joining the New Revolutionary Army which was  against all old lords. The story is a little bit long, in a way. However,  it wis certainly worthy to be read as it shows me how men, no matter how  "straight" they are outside, have after all been self-centered.  The book is also not in very difficult language. It needs a little bit  patience, bit will make a difference in people's life. Give it a try!
