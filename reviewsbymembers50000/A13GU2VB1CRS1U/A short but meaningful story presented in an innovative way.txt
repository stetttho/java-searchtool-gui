 East Wind: West Wind  Why is there a colon in between? The story is  presented like a monologue. The wife in the story, who is a traditional  Chinese woman, speaks out her innermost feelings. She is betrothed before  her birth to a Chinese man who has gone abroad to study. The woman,  representing old Chinese ideas and the man representing Western ideas thus  have come together to solve their conflicts. The woman's brother also goes  abroad and he intends to marry a western woman, which is strictly forbiden  in ancient Chinese culture... After much this ado, it is a battle of East  Idea and West Idea. The book ends with the well-mingled culture -- a  combination of good East and West culture. The book is printed in very big  fonts and are easy to read. It does not take a long time to read, but it  tells a wonderful story. In some way, I value this higher than Pearl's most  famous work The Good Earth. A book suitable for people who are curious  about ancient Chinese culture. (Note, nowadays we Chinese no longer do such  things as binding feet or kneeling down before elders and so on) Enjoy your  reading!
