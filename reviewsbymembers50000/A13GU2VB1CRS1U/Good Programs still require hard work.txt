 I am very keen on enlarging my vocabulary, but I find it frustrating to do so. I have bought almost all Princeton Review vocabulary titles, but I find myself not disciplined enough to work on that regularly. When I first  bought Word Smart, I was able to at least learn twenty words a day and up  till now, I still can remember most of them and use them in my writing. I  have reflected and I believe I must set a time and plan ahead for  vocabulary learning. Learning vocabulary at a time best suited for a person  is better than forcing oneself to learn when it is not the time. I do agree  that the Grammar Smart is not very useful. The introduction to parts of  speech is tedious and I believe most people do know that. The Grammar Smart  CDs do help a bit, but, as one of the reviews have said in previously, they  are not highlighted. The Word Smart series are pretty good. I think if more  exercises are provided, it will be more enriching and useful.
