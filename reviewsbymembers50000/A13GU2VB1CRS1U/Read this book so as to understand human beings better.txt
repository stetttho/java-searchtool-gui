 Nobel prize winner Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth is a great book for centuries! Although it tells a story that takes place in pre-revolutionary China from an American's perspective, there are not clear traces that the  author is actually an American throughout the novel. As a young Chinese, I  am indeed impressed by Pearl's deep understanding of my culture. She has  definitely assimilated well into the Chinese society without losing her  Westerner status. She is one of the best bridges that links the east and  the west. She also holds an imaginative pen, which portrays  three-dimensional characters. The poor have their worries and the rich  have their worries too. People are never satisfied with what they have.  They want more. People do not realize the importance of things until they  lose them. These are the main ideas the author tells us in simple language,  with beautiful description and actual facts. The novel is a success  because it is a crystal clear mirror of people's selfish minds and  instincts. The author praises and criticizes. She shows black and she shows  white. The author has used good techniques of showing us how different  people's characters are in her novel by writing the small bits of life. It  is indeed the small bits of the farmer's (Wang Lung, the main character)  life that accumulate to form a clear picture of his character.  These help  you to think and make educated guess while you are reading! An indeed  great story for all!
