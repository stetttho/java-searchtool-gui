 There are quite a number of great examples in this book. Many of these come from famous poets and writers. However, the author failed to give some of the diffiult ones an explanation. Thus, it seems very difficult to  comprehend sometimes. The definition of words is pretty concise. However,  if the author had put more effort into introducing this word to the  readers, it would make learning a lot more easier. I also suggest that the  next edition include a CD Rom because it is very fun to study via  multimedia presentation. The exercises in the book are adaquant, but there  seems to be a lack of explanation. Sometimes I do find it difficult to  understand the answer. I have been n search of good vocabulary books for  almost two years. I have not found one yet, but this is certainly one of  the good ones that I have.
