 I am amazed by the rice prepared by my Zojirushi NS-ZCC10. It indeed prepares the best rice I have ever had in this country. i personally think the rice cooker prepares sushi rice the best. It is a little expensive, I acknowledge, and most of my friends do not understand why I would invest such a sum in a rice cooker. But I am still happy for the decision I made.
