 Of mice and Men is good because it is a thin book that tells a long story. John Steinbeck's description fits the incident that is to occur very well. It is straightforward and sounds very true to me. The beautiful world that  Lennie and George have imagined is not possible to be obtained at that  time. Their tragic end is well painted in the portrait of the circumstance  that they are in. It has called upon my sympathy, making me feel naturally  how unfair that society is. It is a book that will not take much time to  read, but it will definitely tell you something.
