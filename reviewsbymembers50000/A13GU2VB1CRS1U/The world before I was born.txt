 It was after reading Yeh Mah's Falling Leaves that I decided to read "Wild Swan", a book about three daughters in twentieth century, China. Amazed am I to know the life my parents and my grandparents used to  lead before I was born. This shadow of history is lighted by Jung Chang,  who evokes my feeling from her heart, making me feel sorry for her and to  realize the happy life that I have been given after those dark years...  Being a secondary student who takes English as a second language, this book  is the thickest English novel I have ever read. Yet, it is finished with no  sweat. Some stories make me anger to such a extent that I will strike my  fist on the table... The only disadvantage is I feel the book can still be  shortened. The reason is that some description is not really necessary.  Anyway, the success of Jung Chang's book is and will always be a source of  encouragement for me. She, being a person who is exposed to so little  opportunity to practice English, yet being capable of producing such a  wonderful book is my mentor. The effort she has put in will echo from my  ear to ear... A book worth reading... over and over... with different  stories bringing you to a focus point - the main idea of the story.
