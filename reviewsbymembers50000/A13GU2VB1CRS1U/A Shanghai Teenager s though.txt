 When I was strolling in a book store in Singapore, Falling Leaves intrigued me from time to time. Due to my curiousity, I opened this book and read a few lines. It was about Shanghai, the city where I was born. It  was amazing to see what was happening in Shanghai sixty years ago. The  description of various familiar places in old Shanghai is very vivid. After  reading this book, I had a better understanding of my hometown and the  reality in the 1920s and 1930s. I give it a rate of 4 stars. At least it  was a book which I could not put down. The book has drawn my sympathy  towards the author. The ending, being a strange one, somehow surprises me.  Sorry am I to know that how the author's siblings treated her. The author  has very well manipulated my feelings and after reading so, I started to  abhor those so called Two Sides People. (They smile to you, but do harm to  you behind your back.) I even intended to visit her Aunt Baba, but sorry  was I to find that she had passed away. Maybe it is because of the fact  that I am a Shanghaiese, I feel that stories like this do similarly happen  in Shanghai even nowdays. Of course, the chance is rare. The wonderful  insertion of Chinese proverbs and famous phrases is a big success. Western  Culture can very well mix with Easter one! The only thing I do not like  this book is that there are parts that are yet not clear enough. Anyway,  it is still a book worth reading. Maybe you will want to visit Shanghai  after your reading it! Welcome! Best wishes Eric Lewis
