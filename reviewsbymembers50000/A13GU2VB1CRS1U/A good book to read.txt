 I had been trying every book to increase my vocablulary until I found Word Smart. Then I purchased all the books and some of the cassetts. It is really helpful to my studyings. I rememberd 100 words in ten days and saw  about 40 of them appearing in Romeo and Juliet with annotations. It is  indeed a good book and I have introduced it to my good friend already.
