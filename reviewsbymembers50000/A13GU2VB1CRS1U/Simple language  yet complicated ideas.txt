 I borrowed this book from the local British Council library. This book is recommended to the local upper secondary school students. (Grade 9 and 10) The book is in very simple easy-flowing language. However, the idea is  complicated. The author has a magic way to make the story interesting. The  author is also able to put on readers' thinking caps. "What would I  do, if I were in such a situation?" was the quesiton that I often  asked myself as I read on. The story starts with a conflict and ends in an  open-ended way: it gives readers spaces to think. The book is a good guide  to teenagers who are in love. It alert them how much trouble pre-marrital  sex can bring. It also serves as a good guide to show teenagers who are  pregnant at such early ages what to do. It is also a good guide book for  parents who are living with teenagers. The book helps parents understand  what the teenagers of the new century are thinking so that they can get  closer to their sons or daughters. Anyway, this is a book that is very easy  to read. It is just about 200 pages, so it won't take a lot of time. Enjoy  your reading!
