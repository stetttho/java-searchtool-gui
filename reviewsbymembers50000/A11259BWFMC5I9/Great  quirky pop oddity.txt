 I can't explain it, but this album is great.  It's not the writing, it's not the musicianship... it's something else.  Imagine if you crossed David Byrne with Abba, and stirred in a generous helping of the Cranberries.  You'd get sort of an odd, latin-influenced, poppy-melodic, guitar-oriented confection.  I'm really digging this CD.  It has kind of a kitschy quality, so I don't know how it will hold up over time, but I've been listening to it non-stop for a week now.
