 This is a pretty darned good sampling of Latin music.  My wife saw the movie and immediately picked up the CD (I guess that says something good about the movie.)  We've listened to it several times over and enjoyed it quite a bit.  My one complaint is that it is uneven.  Some of the songs on the CD  aren't as good as others and it makes it hard to listen to the CD straight through.  We were introduced to several great artists through this CD, and if you are looking for some fun Latin stuff, then I highly recommend picking up some albums from the artists represented on the CD, especially: Los Amigos Invisibles, Lila Downs, and Bebel Gilberto.  And while you are at it, you should pick up Susana Baca's CD too.
