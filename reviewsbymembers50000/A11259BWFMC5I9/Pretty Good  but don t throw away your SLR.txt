 I was hoping that this camera was good enough that I could throw away my SLR and stop paying for film and developing.  Unfortunately, after using it for four months now, I can say that it's not that good.   Here's the problem... the pictures all come out blue.  The only way to correct for that is to use a flash, and then all the pictures come out in stark glaring color.  It is impossible to get good light balance in the photos.  And the camera always insists on using the flash, even when outside. Other problems include time -- You can't just point and click... the camera has to think before taking the picture, so you ALWAYS lose the candid shots and instead get pictures of the backs of people's heads.  Sometimes it can take up to ten seconds before the camera actually takes the picture... and I have no idea why.  A similar but unrelated problem is disk-access.  After you take a picture, it has to save it to the disk, and that can take five or more seconds, in which time you can't do anything. On the good side, the camera captures an incredible amount of detail.  You could probably print poster-sized pictures and still not see any pixelization.  It is remarkable. To sum up: If they can fix the color/light problems and processing time problems, then we might have a winner.  Until then, I'll have get used to pictures of the backs of people's heads, in blue.
