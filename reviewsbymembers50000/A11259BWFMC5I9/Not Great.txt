 First off, let me just say that I am a big fan of this genre of music.  I love beautiful pop melodies -- even at the expense of substance. But this album is just too light and fluffy... and not in a good way.  The musicianship is second-rate, the song writing uninspired and the production is flat.  I can't listen to it without cringing.  They have the right idea, and I hope they keep it up, but they need to make a HUGE leap forward.There are much better choices out there: Beulah, Jimmy Eat World, Guster, Pete Yorn.  Your $$ are much better spent elsewhere.
