 I purchased his more recent album, On My Way, prior to purchasing this one. I was immediately a HUGE fan. I listen to that album twice a day every day. I LOVE it. This guy is very talented.   Now, about Sha Sha. This is a pretty darned good album. It has good songs, well played and it has a down to earth modestly produced sound that I love. Sha Sha also features a lot more crunchy guitars and piano than the lovably lo-fi On My Way. For better and worse...  On the down-side, Ben appears to still be searching for his sound. He goes from sounding like he is channeling Weezer (honestly, the second song, Wasted and Ready, is indistinguishable from Weezer) to sounding like the Old 97s (Family Tree), and then Ben Folds (In Other Words.) All great influences in my opinion. But his own sound, which is clearly evident on On My Way, is far more interesting.  My recommendation: buy it. It is a very good album from a very talented guy and it won't disappoint. Then buy On My Way.
