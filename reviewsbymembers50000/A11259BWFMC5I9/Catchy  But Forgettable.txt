 After first picking up this album, I enjoyed it a lot.  Owsley is a skilled guitar player and his voice and melodies and songs are all decent.  And the album is beautifully recorded.  But after a few listens, I was bored... and I don't know why exactly, but something is missing.  It could be the lyrics, which don't seem to say anything worthwhile.  Or it could be his voice which doesn't really connect emotionally.  Anyway, I've parked the CD on the shelf and don't have any plans to play it again.
