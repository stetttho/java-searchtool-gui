 This album is hard to review. It has some very strong songs on it: Dig Down Deep, I tried, and Blunderbuss. Listen to the samples, they are a pretty good indication. They are beautifully crafted, melodic, and just generally wonderful. Brad is a tuneful writer, with an interesting, slightly unconventional voice to his credit. But among the tracks are some duds too. I'm unable to listen to the CD all the way through. I get the impression that Brad didn't have a band, but he knew a lot of different musicians, and had ALMOST an album's worth of tunes when he started. The album drifts from pop masterpieces to unfortunate rock mishaps. The good tunes sound like Jellyfish... the bad tunes sound like the Smithereens on a 4-Track. Plus, I'm not getting a lot of feeling out of these songs. Even the best tunes, while well crafted musically, aren't personal at all. I still have no sense of who Brad Jones is. I hope to hear more from Brad in the future, but, if you are planning on buying this album, be prepared for a jumble. Still, for the impressive craftsmanship on the good tracks, I give this album 4 stars. As long as I'm here, I should mention that you should check out Steve Ward's solo album... It's like this one, only more consistent and definitely more heartfelt.
