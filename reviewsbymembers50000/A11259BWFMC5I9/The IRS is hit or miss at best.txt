 The IRS is the government at its typical, bloated, inefficient best. Need help? Just dial this toll free number, where you can hear a recording. Want to contact your local office? No problem, call this other number and hear a recording.  I've been trying for about an hour to figure out how to pay an old tax debt. Where do I send the money? Who can I talk to? Don't try the website and don't try you local office. You won't find an answer and you won't get to talk to anybody.  They actually do have a online bill payment option. But get this... you have to apply. They will send you a form 15 days later. You need to fill it out and return it. Then 30 days later you will be signed up to pay your tax bill online. Isn't that just the most ridiculous thing you've ever heard? Imagine if Amazon.com worked this way... I would shop elsewhere. You should be able to file online, pay online, schedule appointments online, participate in forums online, communicate via e-mail online. Until then, this site will be no more useful than one gigantic 2,000 page brochure.
