 I know these toys are meant for older kids, buy my five year old and three year old love these things.  But watch out... pieces everywhere.  And you'll have to put it back together because the kids can't do it.  Oh, and this is VERY IMPORTANT: Keep the packaging and instructions.  You'll need them again and they are as important as the toy itself.  Lego has really blown me away with the packaging and design of these toys.  I've never seen anything so completely and beautifully designed and presented.  These toys are really an enveloping experience.
