 I've been a big fan of Jellyfish for a while, and stumbled across Jason Falkner not long ago.  I've also heard some of his work from The Grays, which was quite impressive.  So I laid down the cash to pick up this album, and I am disappointed.  Jason plays all the instruments on the album, and without the feedback from a live band (Man, Jason, this Chorus stinks, why don't we try this...) the music is stiff, and a bit forced.  My recommendation to Jason is this: Get a band, and let them have some input.  You are great in a band, and not so great alone.
