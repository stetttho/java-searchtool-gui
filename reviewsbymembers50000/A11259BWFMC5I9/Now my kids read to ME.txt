 This is a wonderful, fanciful children's story.  The artwork on this book is stunning, and the story is very sly and humorous.  The book has almost no words -- the story is told by the pictures in the book.  My kids and I spend some wonderful time together each time we read this book.  Each picture tells a story, and we take turns telling the story, describing what we see on the page.  It's really something.  I highly recommend this book for all kids 7 and under.  And even adults would enjoy this book... It'd be an interesting coffee table book.
