 I was worried before buying this album.  I knew virtually nothing about Steve Ward, except for the freebie download of his "Western Skies" that he posted on mp3.com, which I liked a LOT.  And there's nothing I hate worse than buying an album with one great song, and the rest are stinkers.  Well, no worries... this album is good through and through.  Unlike most bands in this genre (pop, rock) he sounds absolutely genuine.  He's not trying too hard to mock any particular style -- it just flows, very naturally, out of him.  It's relaxed, stylish, very personal and beautiful. It's a pop gem.  The result is an album that will remain in my CD player for years to come.
