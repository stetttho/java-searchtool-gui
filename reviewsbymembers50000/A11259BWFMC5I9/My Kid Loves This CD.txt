 Personally, I can't stand this CD. But my five year old loves it.  He absolutely adores it and wants it on all the time.  It really calms him down.  the narrator's voice is very calm and soothing and the songs are simple, quiet and peaceful.  If you have a kid with ADD, or who gets too worked up with other music or television programming, then I recommend this CD. Your child will be more relaxed, focused and in a generally better disposition.  Try it before you resort to something more drastic, like Ritalin.
