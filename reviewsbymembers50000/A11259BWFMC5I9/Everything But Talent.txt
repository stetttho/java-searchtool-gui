 These guys have it all.  They have genuine rock attitude ala Lou Reed.  They look cool.  They are a long overdue backlash to the boy band [...junk] that's been crowding the airwaves.  They are like some unrehearsed garage band that somehow made its way onto the radio and it is a blast of fresh, unproduced, rock and roll air. But they are missing one crucial element: Talent.  Maybe they'll find some along the way, but for now their songs are terrible, they can't play their instruments, and as if that weren't bad enough, they are poorly recorded. Oh well, at least it isn't Britney Spears.  If they represent the future of Rock and Roll, I, for one, say it's a welcome change.
