 I got this software bundled with an HP DVD Writer and wasted hours upon hours of my life that I will never get back. Here is a short list of problems:  * I wasted days trying to write a DVD and never got a single one to play properly on my DVD player.  * Crashes. I have found 5 reproducible crash bugs. 5.   * The controls are non-intuitive. Try clicking one of them and discover that they Un-Do all of your work. It is cruel.  * Importing. I have tried for the last three hours to work around this bug, but I can't figure it out. Trying to import a scene from a DVD, it plays fine on my DVD player and my computer, but importing it into Arcsoft truncates the 20 minute video to 11 seconds. What is that?  * Editing scenes vs Editing chapters. I wasted hours editing scenes... But the work is all lost when you go to create chapters. What is that all about? What a waste of time.  I have no idea what other software to buy, but I can tell you that Arcsoft is not it. Plainly, it stinks and I won't buy any of their products ever.
