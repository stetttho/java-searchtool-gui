 This router is weak. The support is not good. I waited 40 minutes on hold only to get some minimum-wage cholo with an attitude. He hung up and promised somebody would follow-up via e-mail. Of course the e-mail never arrived because he would have to have logged his call and risk that I would complain about him. Weak. I guess I'll bust out that amazon.com coupon and buy a router from somebody else.
