 I picked up this CD just based on the buzz, and didn't expect much... boy was I wrong.  I can't stop listening to it.  I've listened to it about 20 times now, and I'm not even close to getting bored.  The music combines a wonderful lyricism, ala Dylan, with beautiful simple homespun melodies... and it's so beautifully recorded.  It's like a bowl of chicken soup turned into music -- it tastes good, it's good for you and it makes you feel good all over.  From beginning to end, this is a great CD... all tracks are great.  Buy it.  Run, don't walk.
