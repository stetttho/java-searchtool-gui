 These were on sale for something like forty bucks, so it is hard to complain.  So far I'm happy.  The knives have an edge, they keep an edge, and no signs of rust... three months and counting.  But I've been keeping them out of the dishwasher just in case.   I could be happier with the handles (look at the picture, and you can see, you can't use the back of the blade without squishing your fingers against the cutting board. Complaints about the block are understandable... it is not as solid as some.  But it is a minor compaint.  It looks fine and serves its purpose. Overall, I'm pretty darned happy, and I imagine I'll be using these for the next ten years with no problems.  Not bad for forty bucks.
