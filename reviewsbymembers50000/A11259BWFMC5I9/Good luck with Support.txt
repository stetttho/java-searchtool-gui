 I used to think this software was great...then I updated my OS to Windows XP, and now it crashes constantly.  Oh well, I guess that's to be expected.  But what I didn't expect was the complete lack of support. Sierra's site doesn't have any mention of Complete Home, or of Home Architect Version 3 or higher. It looks like they abandoned their site five years ago. There are still support files that talk about Windows 3.1, and no mention of W95, W98, NT, ME or XP.  So, I can't recommend this product at all.  As far as I'm concerned they abandoned me and I'll have to buy another product from a different company... a company that is not named Sierra.
