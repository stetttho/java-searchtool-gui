 Before you buy a printer from Epson, read this passage I copied from their web site: Please send your correspondence to our mailing address listed below. Epson America, Inc. 3840 Kilroy Airport Way Long Beach, CA 90806-2469   Yes, that's right. You are reading it correctly. They offer "snail mail" support. Not phone support... Not even e-mail support. Snail mail. My advice. Pay extra for a company that stands behind its products. Not Epson.
