 What a weird freaking album!  No melodies... barely any songs.  Just a bunch of noises and talking (sometimes screaming) to odd drum beats.  There isn't even much traditional instrumentation, like piano, guitars or bass.  It's ODD.  No, scratch that.  It's remarkably ODD.  Which is why I keep listening.  I can't figure it out.  My wife won't let me play it in the car, and even my more liberal and open-minded friends can't listen to it.  It's a head-scratcher that will challenge your concept of music.  I don't think it's any good, but I like a challenge.  So I give it 4 Stars.
