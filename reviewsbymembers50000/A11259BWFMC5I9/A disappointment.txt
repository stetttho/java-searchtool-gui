 I was such a BIG fan of Seal's last album, that I couldn't imagine anything less than a great album from Seal.  But that's what I got... something less than great.  A LOT less than great.  This album bored me to tears.  And it was depressing.  I really tried to like it.  Really, I did.  I owed him that much, didn't I?  But alas, I can't.  It's a disappointing dud.  There's not a single hummable melody.  Completely forgettable.
