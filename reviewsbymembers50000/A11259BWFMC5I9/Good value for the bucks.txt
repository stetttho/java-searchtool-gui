 I bought this TV here on Amazon.com and picked it up same day at [a local store](I LOVE THAT!)   If I may, here's the question you are asking yourself:  Should I get a (very) expensive HDTV now, or waste some money on another regular TV, which I'll eventually replace with HDTV when the prices come down? For this price, I recommend the latter.  This TV is a bullet-proof, basic TV, with a very good picture.  Definitely worth the price, and I guarantee you won't have any regrets.  It may not be your home-theater dream screen, but it is a great bargain with a much better than average picture.   To sum it all up: Get this TV, and retire it three years from now when you buy your HDTV (at a significantly reduced price.)
