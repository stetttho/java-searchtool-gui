 I guess they figure I'm some sort of criminal for wanting to listen to the CD on my computer because they placed some lame copy protection on this disk. I've wasted the last half hour of my life trying to play it on iTunes and I can't. That's where I listen to my music. If I can't play it in the player of my choice it is useless to me.   I don't know why these record companies don't get it; I bought the music, let me consume it. So, guess what guys, I've learned my lesson: Never buy a CD from Epic again.  I'm returning it today. And I am so angry I might just scream.
