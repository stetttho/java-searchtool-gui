 It is hard to put into words just how incredible this album is.  I originally bought the album, based on the work Daniel Lanois had done as a producer.  I gave it a listen, and it bored me, so I parked it on the shelf for over four years, just listening to it every now and then.  The initial problem I had with the album was that it did not rock... at all. Then something happened.  After about the 5th listen, I fell in love with it. Now, some ten years, and literally thousands of listens later this album is my favorite album of all time. Yes, it is THAT good.  It compares favorably to Peter Gabriel's SO, U2's Joshua Tree and any other album you can name.  It transcends all trends and fads, and never sounds dated. It is a peaceful, uplifting, heartfelt, warm, deep and sensual sonic landscape that sounds both homespun and electronic at the same time. If you buy this album, be patient. You may not like it at first, but the more you listen, the more you will like it.  Keep listening and you will eventually love it.
