 Without a doubt, this book (and anything else by Mr. Burke) is a must have for any teacher of Reading or English.  How Mr. Burke finds the time to put together such wonderful resources is beyond this mere mortal of an English teacher, but I would be lost without Reading Reminders.  I literally put some of the strategies to work the day after I bought the book.  Several of my collegues rushed out and bought it after seeing the results I was getting.  If you have struggling readers, this book will breathe new life into them--and you!
