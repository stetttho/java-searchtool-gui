 I read this book this past summer and I am re-reading several chapters.  This book puts classroom discipline in perspective.  It's about helping children make the right choices and establishing clear and firm boundries in the classroom.  It is easy to read, and it is easy to implement.   The author gives lots of scenarios (to which we can really relate) that demonstrate his techniques in practice.  In the first few chapters, Dr. Mackenzie helps us analyze why we have problems in the classroom and he helps identify patterns in our teaching that might be contributing to the problem.  Once we recognize the pattern, then it's just a matter of implementing the "fix."  The second half of the book provides specific strategies for implementing an effective discipline system that keeps kids, parents, administrators, and teachers happy.  He also includes chapters on dealing with ADD/ADHD students and a simple and effective plan to get kids to do their homework. The book is not biased toward any grade level.  His examples cover pre-school through 12th grade.  So far, the best classroom management book I have read.
