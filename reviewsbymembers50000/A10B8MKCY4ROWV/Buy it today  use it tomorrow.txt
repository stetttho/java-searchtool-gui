 How many times have you purchased a book hoping to find meaningful and useful strategies and ideas that you can use in your classroom right away only to find out that the book is filled with theory?  If you are looking for a book that you can take into your classroom, open to a certain page, and start using a strategy immediately, this is the book. What make this book different is that it backs up the theory with practial strategies that you can put to work right away. I have never been a fan of group work.  It is difficult to manage and usually results in chaos.  However, this book has dozens of practical strategies that can be used at any grade level and in any content area.  Each strategy has step-by-step instructions and visuals to show where students should be in a group and what each students role should be.  There are also guidelines for assessment, classroom management, physical room arrangement, and student and teacher roles.  After reading this book, I cannot wait to put some of these things to work in my classroom.
