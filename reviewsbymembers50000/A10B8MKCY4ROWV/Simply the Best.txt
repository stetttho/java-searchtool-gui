 I've read at least a half dozen of the top poker theory books, and I learned more from this one book than from all of the others.  The wisdom Brunson espouses in this book is simple, yet it is so profound that it will change the way you view yourself and your opponents at the poker table.    The book is mainly a collection of articles Brunson has written over the years for various poker magazines.  However, each one contains nuggest of poker genius (mostly related to No Limit Texas Hold 'Em)in plain simple English that authors like Sklansky and Malmuth have complicated with mathematical theories.  Brunson is a simple man and he tells simple stories.  The bottom line: poker is a game of people and if you understand the people you play with, then your decision making process is simplifed.  The cards are secondary (although he does admit that with the influx of new players in the last few years, even he has to have good hands to make a move!).  Even if you don't appreciate his wisdom, the stories he tells about the Texas roadgames of yesteryear are worth the purchase price.  Somebody needs to make a movie of this guy's life!
