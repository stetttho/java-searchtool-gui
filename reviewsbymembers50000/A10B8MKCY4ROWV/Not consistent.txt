 I purchased this book to help me plan a unit for teaching Bless Me, Ultima to a class of 10th graders.  It offers some wonderful suggestions for intro activities and ways for students to work through the book.  For example, the author recommends using 4x6 note cards to summarize chapters and he outlines a unit portfolio for students to turn in at the end of the novel.  However, the quizzes and tests aren't very good.  The quizzes for chapters 1-8, for instance, have questions that require knowledge of chapters 9-12!  The glossary at the back is helpful, but the information and glossary in the Cliff's Notes is far more useful as a teaching guide
