 This video spends about 10 minutes on tells, all of which are excepts from Howard's first two DVD's.  The rest of the DVD are excerpts from "Secrets of No Limit Hold Em" and cover basic play, pre-flop, flop, turn, and river strategies.  Don't waste your money if you have the other DVD's.  If you really want the goods on how to play limit and no-limit poker, buy Phil Hellmuth's book, "Play Poker Like the Pro's."  I've made money using his strategies.
