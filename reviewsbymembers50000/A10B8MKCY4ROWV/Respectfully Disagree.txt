 I disagree with the other reviews on this site.  This book is targeted for the tournament novice.  If you are out there winning thousands of dollars in poker tournaments, then you obviously don't need this book.  However, for someone who has no idea how a live poker tournament works, this is an excellent reference guide.  Yes, some of the advice falls under the category of "duh" (e.g. "Fold marginal hands"), but I've played in several tournaments and many live games, and have made a lot of money off of the people who don't follow the advice outlined in this book.  Notice the subtitle is "How To Win at Low Limit Poker."  The key word is "Low Limit."  This book is not for high rollers.  However, it does provide sound strategies that, when coupled with experience, can produce winning results.  I've won two online tournaments employing some of the basic strategies in this book.  I'll admit it is a bit pricey for the content, but it is a cheap investment if you make the cost back with a winning hand or two.  This book coupled with Larry Phillips "The Tao of Poker" forced me to look at how I was playing and my decision making process.  What might be common sense advice to one player may be news to another.
