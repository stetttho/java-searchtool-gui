 If you are looking for dirty tales from the kitchen, then pass this book up.  However, if you are looking for an in depth analysis (expose, really), then this is worth your time.  Written in the vein of The Jungle and Silent Spring, Fast Food Nation disects, not just fast food restaurants, but the industry as a whole.  From french fry manufacturers, to cattle farmers, to slaughterhouses, Schlosser delves into the side of the fast food industry that we never see.  Of particular interest are the chapters dealing with the brutal working conditions that slaughterhouse employees must endure and the safety violations committed by large meat-packing firms.  Schlosser is not afraid to name names, and you will be shocked to read how much control fast food companies exert over meatpackers, how horribly fast food companies treat their employees, how unkindly these companies regard their customers, and how lives have been ruined by the power and authority of fast food companies.  If, after reading this book, you choose to patronize fast food places (and he does identify companies that are worthy of our business), then at least you will be making an informed decision.
