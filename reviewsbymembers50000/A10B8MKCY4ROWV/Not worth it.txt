 I had high hopes for this album with the return of veteran U2 producer Steve Lillywhite.  However, I was sadly disappointed.  There are maybe three good songs on this album.  The rest are just unlistenable.  All That You Can't Leave Behind was such a great refresher after the disappointing POP.  While this album continues in the ATYCLB vein, it doesn't even approach the melodic or lyrical quality of that album.  I'm glad I didn't waste any more money on concert tickets to see this stuff live!
