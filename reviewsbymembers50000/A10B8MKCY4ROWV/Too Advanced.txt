 I disagree with some of the reviewers.  I have been playing in poker tournaments for 6 months and have made one final table, finishing 5th.  Before I started reading poker books, I just played by gut instinct, and I think I was better off.  This book is heavy on theory.  Sklansky talks extensively on determining the Exptected Value of a hand and gives lots of mathematical equations to figure out EV, pot odds, and hand winning percentages. Frankly, I don't do math, so all of that went right over my head.  The main concept that this book puts forth is the Gap Concept, which is useful.  Basically, that means you need a better hand to call a raise (or reraise) with than you do to initiate a bet or a raise.  In other words, if you are going to limp in with a hand, you'd better like it enough to call a raise with it.    I'll give this book a second read, but the math really turned me off.  I found Ken Warren's book "Winner's Guide to Texas Hold 'Em" more useful, even though it isn't geared towared tournament play.  One thing I did like about this book is the hand scenarios.  It's interesting to see how you would play a hand measures up to what a pro says you should do. If you are a beginning poker player, you might want to look elsewhere for tournament advice.
