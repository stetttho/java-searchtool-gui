 This isn't the caliber of book one hopes Kellerman would write. The characters tend to blend together, and despite 436 pages in which he could have developed some complexity, they are all pretty one-dimensional.  Maybe the dad has a trace of goodness in him (wow -- he shows a trace of affection to his children), but most of the book is spent figuring out if someone is "good" or "bad," instead of exploring characters who have a MIX of emotions, motivations, and actions. Kellerman, or his editor, thankfully did a little bit of research on California, so the book is missing the blatant bloopers, and some of the tediousness, of Monster. The exact circumstances of Joanne's death come as a bit of a deus ex machina, and the actions of Mate's killer are inconsistent.  (I'd elaborate but that would be a spoiler.) The previous reviews indicating that several characters in this book seem fixated on the idea of weight gain as an obvious symptom of mental illness and something definitely repulsive are accurate.  Yet, keep in mind that Joanne was a 5'2" woman who started at 110# and gained roughly 100#.  Two hundred pounds at 5'2" is presumably more dangerous than 200# at 5'9". I don't see this book as advancing the stories or characters of either Alex or Milo.  You might pick this book up at the drugstore if you're looking forward to a wait of several hours somewhere (as I did), but it's NOT a book you should run out and buy.
