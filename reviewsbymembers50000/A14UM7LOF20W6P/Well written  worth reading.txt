 This is a well-written page-turner centering on the adventures of a foreign correspondent caught up in French foreign intrigues.  The book has a few faults.  Among the faults are announcing the death of Arthur  Bowman on page 3 and then "flashing back" for the next 250 pages  until Arthur Bowman finally dies on page 254.  Too much of the book is  spent with the reader KNOWING that Arthur Bowman dies, and even WHERE he  dies, and just waiting for it to happen.  The female characters in the  book are superfluous -- they're either in the book as decorations or a  cheering section.  Lastly, for all the research has done, and real-life  experience the author obviously has on the subject, it's jarring to see the  author describe a CIA bulletin board reminding agents to "get their  malaria shots."  There's no such thing as a "malaria shot."
