 The author skips back and forth from topic to topic.  Is he talking about the White House budget?  Or the sexual escapades of Presidents?  Or the infighting of presidential assistants?  Or perhaps the competition among White House residence staff?  Or life on Air Force One?  Or administration-press relations?  Perhaps contingency plans for responding to nuclear attack?  Maybe Secret Service tactics and resources?  You never know what may turn up on the next disorganized page.  He dwells at length on the sexual escapades of the Presidents, crediting almost every rumor as true (somehow exempting Bush).  There is some good discussion about White House budgets, and how the grandeur and privileges of the White House affect governmental decision-making.  One particularly interesting passage is on how White House chefs refused to follow presidential orders to stop serving heavy French cooking and serve lighter American food.  "When they wanted a lighter meal, [the chef] said he was going to teach them how to dine."  What really brands this book as glorified gossip-mongering is the very lengthy digression into Clinton's supposed sexual wanderings with Flowers and others _as governor of Arkansas_.
