 This is an autobio and discussion of the environmental movement and activism by the 24-year-old president of the Sierra Club.  Toward the end of the book he includes a meeting he had with a British Columbian Native American group, who criticize the environmental groups out to "save" their forests.  The local people say, "It is our turn for environmental development....  You take food from our children's mouths.  You're trying to stop us from improving our condition.  You are no different from those who tried to kill us with their guns."  Werbach mentions, "I learned an important lesson on the trip.  Environmentalists, in a rush to save the natural world, often forget to consider the implications of their actions.  Our dedication leads to a self-righteousness that bowls over friends as well as enemies."  Yet his book title, and apparently his philosophy, remains, Act Now, Apologize Later.
