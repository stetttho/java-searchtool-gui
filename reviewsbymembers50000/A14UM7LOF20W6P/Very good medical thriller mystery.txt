 This is a very good medical thriller -- the plot's complexity and the twists and turns remind me of Dashiell Hammett's _Maltese Falcon_.  It's hard to know the motivation behind the other reader review from the anonymous "reader from New York."  That reader doesn't like thrillers, and apparently considers anyone with a nurse's license to be fit only to empty bedpans, and so decided to anonymously trash this thriller by Echo Heron, RN.  If you like murder thrillers, in a hospital setting, you'll like this book.
