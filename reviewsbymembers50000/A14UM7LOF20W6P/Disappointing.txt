 Yet another disappointing tale of a bio-tech company catering to the wealthy by cloning replacement parts.  Throw in a little bit of the impossible -- the technology existing for decades, and clones grown on an island off the US coast -- and you get this book.    I do agree with the other review -- PLEASE finish a book before reviewing it!!!
