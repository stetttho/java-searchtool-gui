 This book focuses on the World War II infantry soldier.  McManus does a great job of balancing facts, context, and individual soldiers' memories of the war, including excellent presentations on soldiers' food, equipment, weapons, fighting conditions, attitudes, leadership, and motivation -- not to mention a detailed refutation of a "scholarly" study of how most soldiers avoided combat.   Now, as one reviewer said, if you've read 100 books on World War II, everything you read on the same subject has some repetition to it.  But if you've only read 20 or 25 books, like me -- or if this is going to be your first book on World War II -- this book will be well worth reading. McManus especially manages to convey that American soldiers were effective and proud, while staying away from the "American soldiers do no wrong and defeat every enemy" fallacy, and avoiding portraying combat as something glorious. The passages on fatalism were well-done, as soldiers realized that the probable outcomes for them consisted of getting killed, wounded, or captured.  Wounding was preferable.  One soldier writes, "My glove was blown off and a big spurt of blood reddened the white snow....  I could not believe this had happened to me.  I was not meant to be shot.  Acceptance came slowly as two medics worked on me.  My thoughts turned to good thoughts.  I was still alive.  I should have been killed.  I was OK and I was getting out of this frozen hell."  And another soldier reports, "Sgt Glisch came walking by me, heading rearward.  There was a hole in his helmet and blood running down his face -- a face that was covered with a boyish grin.  That million dollar wound!   I felt left out, and wished I had a bullet through an arm or a leg." If you're interested in human nature, US history, psychology, conflict, armed conflict, warfare, and/or World War II, this is a great book!
