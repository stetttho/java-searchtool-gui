 This book is a good quick read, well-written and a page-turner.  The interplay of the characters is entertaining and inviting, even the final "Charlie Chan movie" type scene where the characters are brought together and the murderer revealed -- the only thing missing in the book is the lights being turned off and the quick scuffle as the perpetrator tries to escape.  The author uses occasional deft and subtle humor and brings in interesting tidbits from Spinoza.   The description of the first murder crime scene (paperback page 78) led me to a correct guess of the murderer's identity.   And strangely for a book where much of the plot turns around the type of glove Bernie wore for the burglary (rubber, with the palm removed), the cover shows Bernie taking the nickel from the safe while wearing a complete leather glove.
