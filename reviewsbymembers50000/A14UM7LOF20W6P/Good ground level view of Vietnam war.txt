 This book, while a moderately quick read, is well-written from the perspective of a tank crewman, later tank commander, in Vietnam.  He talks about the good and bad, the brotherhood and the racism, the brave and the cowards, the committed and the ticket-punchers, the soldiers desiring to help the people and those who hated and abused the people.  He eloquently talks about his torn emotions -- his desire to put in an 'honest tour of duty' and support his platoon vs. his desire to get a job in the rear to protect what he sees as his declining remaining luck.       More than anything, you feel as if you were there with him, and can understand what it was like to be a tank crewman in Vietnam '67 and '68 -- while making it very clear that if you WEREN'T there, you CAN'T understand.
