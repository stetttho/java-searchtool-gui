 This inspiring book is written by two amazing people who found themselves at the right time and place, with the right knowledge, insight and determination, to develop and implement plans to save the mountain gorilla. The book covers a wide variety of topics -- from the lives of the mountain gorilla, to the human problems of East Africa (particularly the genocide in Rwanda), to the perplexing life of Dian Fossey, to the politics and reality of conservation, and how their mission affected their own lives, all told with clarity, empathy, and even a bit of humor. You cannot miss with this book!
