 This is an incredible book on a reporter's year as a teacher in an inner city school.  Ms. Sachar provides a needed and welcome inside perspective on many of the controversial issues in education. Teachers cannot use the same techniques that are used in industry:  software engineers don't deal with programs which don't WANT to run, and lumbermills don't have to convince their lumber to WANT to be cut.  Nor does the lumbermill have to deal with the trees' parents.  One tree is just like another:  line it up and cut it.  Yet, teachers work with students who are all different, and whose intrinsic motivation is crucial to the teacher's success in changing them.   Emily Sachar deeply explores the issues of racial tensions and preferences among the staff and students, social promotion, the problems of eliminating ineffective administrators and teachers, needless paperwork, unreasonable expectations, inadequate facilities and funding, the despair and wonder of teaching, and more. These are woven through the personal and moving narrative of her year-long odyssey as a new teacher. This is a superb book, which I highly recommend.
