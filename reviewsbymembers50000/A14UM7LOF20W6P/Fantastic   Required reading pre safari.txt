 This is a fantastic book by a Maasai warrior who was brought up traditionally, schooled in local schools, employed as a park warden and tourist guide, and then able to fulfill his dream of education in Germany  and the U.S.  Not only does he give us a view of his culture, he shows us  our culture through his eyes.  The book is both a well-written view of  what the traditional Maasai life is like, as well as their sense of values,  and the life story of Tepilit himself and his reactions as he grew up  Maasai, and was introduced to modern life and technology.  It will  broaden ANYONE'S understanding of this culture, but would be especially  valuable reading pre-safari.  For instance, on safari you'll see young  Maasai in the ceremonial black clothing who have recently been circumcised.   With this book you'll understand the full significance of that ceremony.
