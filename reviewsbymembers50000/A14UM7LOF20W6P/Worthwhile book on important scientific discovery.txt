 This book by James Watson tells his story, in the years he worked on the structure of DNA.  As another review noted, this is the story "warts and all," including his and others' worries about grants being renewed, family, relationships, jealousy, pride, food, and living in England where the labs and accomodations were always cold in winter. I know almost no biology, and while a lot of the discussion was over my head scientifically, I followed the gist of it. The ghost of Rosalind Franklin continually follows James Watson.  I've heard Dr. Watson speak publicly twice, and each time he was asked about her.  When he was interviewed on NPR, the interviewer persistently went into the interactions between Watson and Franklin.  The gist of his response is that she lost the recognition she should have gotten because she refused to collaborate and work with others, and she refused to work with models.  Clearly, while Franklin's X-ray photograph of DNA was a major step in pointing Watson and Crick to the double helix AT GC structure of DNA, it was NOT a self-sufficient proof of the double helix, as she herself refused to consider a helical structure of DNA.
