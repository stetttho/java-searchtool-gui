 This is a good first draft of a mystery novel, with some good characterizations and plot and use of suspense, but it's just not a final product.    The book is too drawn-out, and the author repeatedly hits us with the same descriptions as if the reader isn't bright enough to "get it" the first two times a scene or concept is described -- such as the drug king-pin's desk with the built-in phone, and why this squad is called the "100% squad."  The plot device of the young neighborhood kid, "Salsa," being simultaneously accepted into the inner circle of the drug king-pin, at the same time "Salsa" is virtually the foster son of a detective, and torn between the two worlds, is not credible.  The use of untranslated Spanish dialogue would be frustrating to a reader who doesn't speak Spanish.  Author E.W. Count's later book, "Cop Talk," is a much-better factual recitation of NYPD detectives' lives and work.
