 This is a well-written book, deftly bringing the reader into the complex world of horse racing and writing a book with scarcely less information and emotion than if the protagonists themselves had written the book. Although the author does offer a glimpse of the underside of horse racing, she keeps her rose-colored glasses on as she affirms that everything is wonderful, the horses run because they love to run, and everyone is either happy, or at least brave;  why, even the prostitutes are glad to join the party scene.  Yet in the background, horses are injured, jockeys suffer severe injuries while racing with no medical help, and even Seabiscuit's jockey needs to hide the fact that he's blind in one eye.  Jockeys ruin their bodies while drastically reducing to ridiculous weights (right before engaging in a demanding and dangerous sport) because that's what's allowed by the racing rules, and the Racing Commission ruins lives by making tyrannical and unappealable decisions.
