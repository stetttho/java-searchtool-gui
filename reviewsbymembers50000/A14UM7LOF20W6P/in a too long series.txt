 *spoilers* This 1996 third book in the Joanna Blalock/ Jake Sinclair series was in the running for Most Outlandish Plot of the Year, and may have won.  Try this:  large HMO is keeping an eye on profits, so it plants devices in its patients which can release fatal poison by remote control, in case their care gets too expensive.  The bodies pile up -- average of one every 35 pages -- as the HMO's military/ CIA-trained assassin now targets Joanna.  Will this assassin, who has no trouble at all killing others, manage to do Joanna in?   We are CONSTANTLY reminded of how beautiful Joanna is, and most characters are described by how well they're aging.  As a preview of Jake's police brutality seen in future books,  Jake pulls his handgun on two of Joanna's neighbors who are making too much noise late at night. It's more of an "action" book than one where the characters, especially the "good guys," face any moral choices or tests of character.  The good guys do their jobs, squabble with coworkers, and -- if they're male -- try to date Joanna. For an author who lives in California, Goldberg is unfamiliar with California law:  death by gas chamber was outlawed in 1994, and the handgun wait period is 10 days, not 14.
