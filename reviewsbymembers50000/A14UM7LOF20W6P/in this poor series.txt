 *spoilers* This 2000 book follows the typical "action" book where an evil greedy doctor causes havoc until he's caught, with far-right religious fanatics thrown in for laughs. In this story, after a large bomb explosion in Los Angeles home with sixteen dead and twenty-eight injured, the FBI demands that all the injured be treated at our heroine's hospital, Memorial Hospital, AND that the incredibly brilliant, beautiful and desirable Joanna perform all the autopsies herself -- autopsies which largely involve examining small body parts. Of course, as always, Joanna is perfection itself: her supervisor can't "believe someone so young and pretty could have that much brains."  And her sometimes-boyfriend Jake? Joanna says, "He was so damn good-looking." Lest we miss the point, ten pages later we read, "Jake was so damn good-looking."
