 This book is well worth your time.  My favorite aspect of the book is that the characters have mixed motivations:  the good guys have a bad side, and the bad guys have a good side.  The book is a page-turner, well-written, and has its fair share of plot twists.  The only quibbles I have are that, in the denouement, the guilty party seems a bit too omnipotent and omnipresent, and that the end drama was inserted into the Prologue, and trumpeted on the front art and back cover.  I'd rather read the book wondering what problems are going to happen at the seminar, instead of feeling like I had read the end of the book before going to Chapter 1. I also wish those who write reviews would read the reviewed book first.  In this instance, the "#1 reviewer" comments that agency owner Wong "has not even shown up at the office in months.  Unless he sells [three key employees] the company, they will quit and start a new company. At least half the present clients of Wright and Wong would come with them.  Wong agrees with the stipulation that the threesome come with him on a retreat first."  In fact, according to the book, Wong had been gone two weeks at most -- from "the annual holiday bash" to late December.  Wong took 18 weeks a year vacation, not 18 weeks in a row.  The workers calculated that _all_ the company's clients would come with them.  And Wong's stipulation was that the three go on a retreat _without_ Wong, not with him.  Maybe Ms. Klausner, who managed to post _85_ reviews in November 2001, should cut back on her production in favor of accuracy.
