 This is a terrific book.  It combines moderately large type with clear writing and lots of well-chosen photographs in telling the life story of Marian Anderson.  Complex ideas such as segregation are conveyed in a direct and understandable manner. I believe this is a better book than _When Marian Sang_, which has beautiful artwork, but has an inadequate text -- at the same time being too complex and too narrow. This revised version of _Marian Anderson: A Great Singer_ would be appropriate for elementary students, and for anyone who would like a quick and thorough review of Ms. Anderson's life, together with over twenty well-chosen photographs, and a timeline, vocabulary, and list of additional resources.
