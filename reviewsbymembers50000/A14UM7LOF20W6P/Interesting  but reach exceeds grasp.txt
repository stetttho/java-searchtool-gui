 This book provides an overview of how money laundering works;  since so much of money laundering is in support of the drug traffic, the author also spends time on the drug business.  The introduction and conclusion are worthwhile, but much of the vast middle of the book is simply throwing case after case at the reader, with little direction.  There is an interesting section on Noriega.  Even as a layperson, I saw several errors in the book.  For instance, Robinson writes that "practically every bill in circulation throughout the entire country bears microscopic traces of cocaine.  In other words, practically every bill in circulation has at some point been used in a drug deal."  The conclusion of the latter sentence is not only unwarranted by untrue.  There is a two-fold reason much of our currency contains traces of cocaine.  First, the chemical structure of cocaine is such that bits of cocaine easily lodge in the microscopic crevices of US currency.  Second, US currency is regularly counted by bank and post office money counting machines, which exert enough pressure on money to strip off some paper fibers and expose the cocaine, distributing it among other bills being counted.  Microscopic cocaine on currency does _not_ mean that the money's been used in a drug deal.  Robinson shows a fundamental misunderstanding of criminal justice when he claims a not guilty plea is equivalent to the suspect's lawyer lying on the suspect's behalf, or countenancing perjury.  Instead, a not guilty plea is simply putting the government to its proof.   The book is definitely interesting and readable, yet the mistakes I've noted and others have pointed out indicate that it's not a trustworthy source of information.
