 As for the plot and attractiveness of the book, I agree with the review that suggested Kellerman was mainly "filling the pages."  In particular, if an author is going to set a book in California, the author should be familiar with California.  It is illegal for an employer to ask an employee's marital status, yet the hospital requires its employees to update resumes which include a "marital-status blank."  One of the victims dies survived by two parents, but without a will.  Kellerman incorrectly states, "With no will, the state takes most of it and [her] parents get the rest."  One gets the impression that editors either don't care to, or don't dare to, point out the mistakes of well-known authors.
