 This is a great book for anyone interested in more insight on the  personalities and training of new Navy pilots.  The author was granted  extremely open access to all parts of their training, including many  ride-alongs in Navy planes.   Yet the author seems to present an  even-handed view.  He uses military lingo, but explains it and doesn't use  the lingo (like a number of authors in the field do) to impress the reader  with his knowledge.  He is, instead, an educated layman who brings us along  with him.  The book is presented as a series of vignettes of Navy  trainees, including some of their family and childhood background -- but  just enough to help us understand their personalities and motivation.   Included also are views and perspectives on broader issues -- such as  military accidents and the Tailhook scandal -- especially as they affect  the new pilots and the current Navy.
