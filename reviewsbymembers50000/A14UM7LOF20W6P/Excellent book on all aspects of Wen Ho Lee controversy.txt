 It was a difficult job to write a book which completely, and yet readably, presents the background and all aspects of the Wen Ho Lee controversy. On the one hand, Wen Ho Lee's supporters present a view of a scientist who, for no reason except his national origin, was persecuted by the government. On the other hand, the Justice Department portrayed Lee as an evil and incredibly dangerous master spy. The truth is not just in the middle, but multi-faceted. Wen Ho Lee acted suspiciously. He contacted, and gave non-classified information to, foreign governments. He repeatedly downloaded very comprehensive and secret information on the US atomic bomb program to non-secure computers and tape drives - a security lapse which could have been devastating.  On the other hand, the Justice Department was operating under political pressure to find a scapegoat to prove the administration was not "soft on China." They held Lee without bail, in solitary confinement, under threat of life imprisonment, for 278 days, with no evidence that Lee gave secret information to a foreign government. (In comparison, when John Deutch, former CIA Director, was discovered to have stored very sensitive national security secrets on his internet-connected home computer, which was used by a household member to access pornographic internet sites, nothing was done to him except that he lost his security clearance.) The book gives plausible reasons that Lee may have downloaded the information, consistent with Lee's character and past actions, which do not involve spying. This is a very well-written, balanced, and thorough book; I recommend it to anyone who wishes to learn more about the Wen Ho Lee controversy.
