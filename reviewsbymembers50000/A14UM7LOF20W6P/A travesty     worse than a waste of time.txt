 This video is a travesty.  It claims to be based on the excellent children's book _Hatchet_ by Gary Paulsen.  This video adds gratuitous profanity to the story, not in the book's text, which makes it unsuitable for many classrooms and age levels.  The video also butchers the plot of the book, and has Brian doing idiotic things which he doesn't do in the book.  For instance, Brian uses the blade of his hatchet to mark days in stone.  Brian wildly hacks at the lake's water with his hatchet to catch fish.  And Brian adopts orphaned bear cubs, managing to catch enough fish for them to grow up on (which they seem to do in a day).  In one of his author tour appearances, Gary Paulsen himself said that he didn't like this film (I don't recall his exact words).  ...  This video is not only a waste of time, but is seemingly written/directed by folks who were intentionally trying to wreck the feeling, sentiment and message of Paulsen's book.  This is not a mere jazzing up, or telescoping of events to fit the movie time and format.  This is really bad.  Skip this piece of junk;  get the _Hatchet_ unabridged audio book instead.
