 The other reviews are right -- 86 pages or so is way too long to go on about his sperm problems and an almost minute-by-minute account of their artificial insemination and delivery.  Roker should realize his subtitle is "Adventures in Fatherhood," not "Adventures Getting to Fatherhood."  I happened to read the book from middle to end, then beginning to middle, so I avoided being turned off like others.  Following the second pregnancy is a section on the adoption of his first daughter, with his first wife, follows through page 114.  Then, the real book starts -- the bit about being a father (and being his father's son), not on technically becoming a father.  This is less a book than a series of essays, but they're very good essays!  We go from the times his bus driver father took him to work with him, to the time his third grade daughter was called a racial epithet in school, to that first phone call to his daughter from a boy.  Roker touches on many universal fatherhood experiences, such as the feeling we get when someone sees a father with his children and asks if we're "babysitting."  One day his daughter and he were inundated with fans at an amusement park.  Roker reports, "The park's head security officer came over and asked me if I wanted some protection.  Hey, I'm no Michael Jackson here.  First of all, I'm still black."  It's not a deep book, except glancingly, and perhaps we'd be lost if we didn't already know Roker from TV.  But it's well-told.  I recommend it, especially if you can borrow it!
