 This book lost all credibility when I read the authors' attack on fundamentalism.  I am a former fundamentalist, so I might be expected to have an apostate's bias against fundamentalism, but these authors are not only inaccurate but almost comically biased.  The authors claim that the fundamentalists' belief in the truth of the Bible is "borders on idolatry," that fundamentalists are "often parasitic" and define themselves not by belief in their scriptures or truth, but by their opposition to "other approaches."  Instead of examining the mainstream Christian fundamentalist beliefs, the authors simply define all fundamentists as having "a totally closed world view," and damn all fundamentalists by guilt through supposed association with the Ayatollah Khomeini, David Koresh and the Taliban.   Lastly, the title is misleading, especially when sold in secular stores, as mine was.  The title would more accurately be, _A Liberal Christian Response to Philosophy_, instead of the current title.
