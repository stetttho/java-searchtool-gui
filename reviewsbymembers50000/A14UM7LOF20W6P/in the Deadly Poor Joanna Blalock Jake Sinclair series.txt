 *spoilers* This follows the typical "medical action" book where an evil greedy doctor causes havoc until he's caught. Thankfully, this book is graced by the absence of Neanderthal hero Jake Sinclair. The plot involves the beautiful ever-youthful and desirable genius Joanna being whisked off to a naval ship off Alaska, where she investigates a mysterious illness coming from an iceberg containing a magnolia. As if that isn't enough, a repeat of the Poseidon Adventure is in the offing. Bloopers and fractured history abound in this book. While the Viet Cong committed atrocities, they were never reported to have severed the arms of an entire village's children because the children received American vaccines.  Potassium-argon dating is used to date MINERALS which have been melted in the past, and could not be used to date iridium dust from a meteor. When used on rocks, potassium-argon dating can be used back four billion years, not the "billion years" as Goldberg claims. Twin scientists working together show up in this book, as another set of twin scientist coworkers will show up in Brainwaves. The "space suits" used for contagious autopsies are NOT "identical to the ones used in space walks."  This book is not recommended.
