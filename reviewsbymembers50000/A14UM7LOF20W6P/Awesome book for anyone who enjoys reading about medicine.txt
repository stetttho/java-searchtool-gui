 Wow!  This is a fantastic book for anyone who enjoys reading medical fiction or lay medical fact, or enjoys watching E.R. and other medical shows.  In this book, 40 nurses tell you, in their words, what nursing means to them, in the context of first-person narratives of events in their daily job experience.  These stories are, in turn, moving, funny, and shocking -- and always fascinating.  You will "be there" as nurses care for the dying with relatives in denial, or on the psych ward, and the burn ward.  You will see how precious, and occasionally cheap, life is considered in Labor and Delivery, and go along as nurses provide home care for those in poverty and former Hollywood stars.  You will see the Oklahoma City bombing from a nurse's perspective, and spend a long day on a Hollywood set as a set nurse.  You will even travel with a nurse to a clinic in a small village in Papua New Guinea.  In this book, there are several stories focusing on the decision of how to care for the dying -- especially those whose prognosis is probable but not certain.  As we look at each instance of care-giving, we see how some in the medical profession have -- and do -- discriminate on the basis of race and income.  We see how, for every patient, hospitals and insurance companies skimp on care to increase profits.  Each patient comes in, not with mere symptoms, but  with a personality, dreams, fears, background, and family.  Through the intimate act of nursing, each patient touches the nurse's life, and the nurse touches each patient's life.  Ms. Heron says, "What nurses witness and get involved with on a daily basis -- death, birth, extreme despair, suffering, life-altering trauma, extreme joy, rage, disease -- are phenomena most 'normal' people experience only a few times during an entire lifetime."  This book will entertain you, move you, and shock you.  And you will leave with a better understanding of what it means to be a nurse.
