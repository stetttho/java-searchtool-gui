 Is there any plot involving the upper ranks of the CIA or FBI which is realistic?  Probably not.  A secret cabal of CIA agents meeting secretly in an underground room plotting against the FBI?  I doubt it.  The same group planning the murder of an FBI informant and FBI agent?  No.   "Ordinary folks" with get-away mansions in fake names?  Hardly.  Politicians being bribed to vote for third world aid?  No way.  I almost got the feeling that this book was intentionally campy.  While the main evil guy is totally evil, it's nice that the other characters are allowed to have second thoughts, characters that aren't totally good or bad, and make mistakes.  It's worth reading, though, if you don't expect a masterpiece.  What I _would_ like to stop is the trend of reader reviews along the line of "I stopped reading after 60 pages, but I know it's a terrible book."  If you don't read the book, don't review it.
