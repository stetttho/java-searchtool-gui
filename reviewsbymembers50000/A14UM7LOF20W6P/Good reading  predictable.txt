 Sandy Jensen's comment is precise:  this is a well-written, readable, interesting, engaging, but predictable book.  It's one of those thrillers that is fun to read but quite forgettable once read.    Despite the  proof-readings a Palmer book should go through, these bloopers slipped  through (paperback version):  a passed football is "still rising"  40 yards downfield, but lands 60 yards downfield (p. 288);  Palmer has a  Colombian woman say "pardon YOU" in Spanish (Perdone _usted_,  senor) instead of the intended "Pardon me" (perdoname) (p. 422).
