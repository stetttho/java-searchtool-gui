 While the premise is interesting, the author throws in too many sub-plots and alternative plots, which are never resolved, gratuitously throws in rape/prostitution scenes, and extends the final scene (the ship with  nuclear device being pursued with conflict of whether to board or destroy  it) by an extra 100 pages.
