 At first, this book seemed like one of those rah-rah "American soldiers make no mistakes and defeat every enemy" books, as the authors start their book by writing about the original development of special tactics forces. But it soon developed that these authors offer a close-up and detailed, but relatively objective, perspective on a number of recent US military actions using special tactics units, including the Iranian hostage rescue attempt, Grenada, TWA 847 and the Achille Lauro, Panama/ Noriega, Desert Storm, Somalia, the planned Haiti invasion, and Afghanistan.  The authors tell what went right, and what went wrong -- on the tactical, strategic, and political fronts.  They don't pull the punches on how interservice rivalries, and poor planning and intelligence, caused a number of problems.  A lot of depth is added to events that most of us are familiar with just from newspaper articles. The authors also offer insight on the type of soldier who joins these units -- not Rambo types, or Tom Clancy "warrior" ethos heroes, but level-headed well-trained soldiers. Anyone interested in recent history, politics, or military history would enjoy reading this well-written book.
