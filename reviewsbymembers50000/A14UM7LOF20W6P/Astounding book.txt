 This well-written book is easy to read and well worth reading from several  aspects.  First, of course, is the detailed and highly anecdotal  recounting of what it was like to be a front-line American soldier in  Europe during WWII, while reminding the reader that the only way to truly  know what it was like is to have actually been there.  He goes beyond  this with cogent accounts of the soldiers' training, leadership, tactics  and strategy -- how each battle and campaign fit into the big picture.  He  gives praise and criticism where he feels it is due -- sometimes both to  the same person (Patton and Montgomery, for examples).  Ambrose always  explains his reasoning -- WHY something was right, or wrong.  The  interested reader can draw lessons in management from the many accounts of  effective and ineffective leadership.   Sadly, Ambrose recounts  everything that was ineffective about the "Replacement Depot"  system of putting poorly-trained soldiers into combat "cold" on  an individual basis.  Yet this is what the Army did in Vietnam also.   Through the individual, Ambrose also steps back and looks at societies as a  whole.  Americans came as liberators of Europe, but African American U.S.  soldiers back home could not eat in public diners, while captured German  POWS could.  As another reviewer notes, while the jacket blurb says  "Ambrose shows that free men fight better than slaves," that is  NOT the point of this book -- and is not something Ambrose argues.   Ambrose's conclusion:  In the words of a GI, "We were miserable and  cold and exhausted most of the time, we were all scared to death....  But  we were young and strong then, possessed of the marvelous resilience of  youth, and for all the misery and fear and the hating every moment of it  the war was a great, if always terrifying, adventure.  Not a man among us  would want to go through it again, but we are all proud of having been so  severely tested and found adequate...."
