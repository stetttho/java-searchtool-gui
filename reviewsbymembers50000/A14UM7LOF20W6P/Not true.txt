 It's disappointing to take home a book which is subtitled "Tales of a Country Doctor," and then read in the fine print of the prologue, "There will be some who ... will complain about the _fact_ of a  particular matter [being] ... in need of correction....  You are in the  minority.  The sooner you learn ... that the greatness of Truth is that it  transcends the lowly fact, the better off you will be."  In other  words, not only is this another Palmer wannabe, but it's pure fiction  masquerading as down-home fact.
