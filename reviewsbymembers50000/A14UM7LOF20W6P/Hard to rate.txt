 This book is hard to rate.  It has the "Richard Jewell, suspected Atlanta bomber"-type plot line, of a schoolteacher first hailed as a hero, and then dragged through the mud as a suspect in a bombing.  In  one sense the book is "reported," but the author does a good job  of portraying the main character's life frustrations as a single parent  struggling to be a good father and good schoolteacher.  The author also  catches the bizarre aspect of life, where the teacher's innocuous actions  of visiting the bathroom and not immediately telling the police about his  bookbag, together with a few details of his prior life, are suddenly  magnified into proof that he's the bomber.  On the other hand, there's  the tiresome "Muslim bomber" stereotype, and the ending sequence  which is both unbelievable and disappointing.  It's definitely readable  but has significant flaws.
