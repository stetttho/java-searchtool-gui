 This book is another in the "evil tobacco company taken to court" genre.  It is a quick read, heavy on the stereotypes, and pretty light on believability and facts, but it does a good job of characterization and use of suspense.  I doubt a real court would allow either the "surprise witness's" arrest for embezzlement, or the attempted bribing of a plaintiff's counsel, to be presented to the jury.  Nor would the plaintiff's blindness be allowed to negate the proven defense that tobacco companies complied with federal law in warning their customers.  It's not worth buying, but is worth borrowing from the library for an afternoon's reading.
