 This book is execrable. It's much more of a comedy/fantasy book than a thriller. Other reviews have the plot's inconsistencies accurately listed. The book suddenly stops as the heroines have been captured by the bad guys. Will they be killed? Escape? Sorry, Cook's deadline arrived and he stopped writing. The bad guys are about to helicopter away from their human cloning lab, with the US attorney and federal marshals at the gate. Do they really expect to set up a new facility in the Bahamas, having brought out only the information on their zip disks, with no problems resulting from what the marshals are about to discover? Don't fall for the 5 stars amazingly given by the #1 reviewer -- I suspect those folks post so many reviews they can't have read the books they review. Cook has decided to emulate Clancy by ripping off the reading public through lending his name to unprofessional writing -- but at least Clancy finishes his books!
