 This 1995 book is a standard puff piece for the FBI lab, spending 380 pages without one negative word about anything at the lab -- all testing is rigorously and honestly done, and the defense is always informed of exculpatory evidence.  Fisher's starry-eyed view of the FBI lab has been disproven by recent revelations in the press and in books such as John Kelly's _Tainting Evidence_.  This book does provide an interesting and readable account of the different techniques used by the FBI to analyze evidence, including many accounts of how those techniques solved real cases.  On the plus side, the book is very well-organized, with each chapter covering a separate area of the lab -- chemistry, explosives, fingerprint, document, etc.  The book includes a helpful index.  On the negative side, there is not one drawing or picture in the whole book.  These would have been very helpful in visualizing the instruments, techniques and results Fisher describes.
