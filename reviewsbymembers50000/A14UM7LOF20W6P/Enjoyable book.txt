 I enjoyed the book.  It takes place outside of Kinsey's hometown of Santa Teresa, for a change of geography and townfolk.  Grafton masterfully weaves the bits of the plot slowly together, in a very readable style.  It's  surprising how even best-selling novels let factual errors in.  On hardback  page 123, Kinsey thinks, "Who wants to [travel to] an area where  smallpox and cholera still run rampant....?"   Yet smallpox was  eradicated world-wide in the 1970's.  Kinsey also worries about carrying a  concealed weapon in the new town (same state) without permit;  yet I  believe a concealed-carry permit issued anywhere in a state is good  everywhere in the state.
