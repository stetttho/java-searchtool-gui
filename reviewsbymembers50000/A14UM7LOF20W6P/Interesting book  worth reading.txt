 This journalist-written book is worth reading if you're interested in police culture, particularly how women officers fare with the public and their male colleagues in the NYPD. I was troubled by the impression given throughout the book that the book was totally true:  indeed, the book is subtitled "True Stories of Policewomen," and full names of her subjects are used throughout the book, starting at the first sentence.  The cover picture depicts a female police officer. It wasn't until I got to the Afterword at the end of the 263-page book that I discovered that not only are subjects' names false, but the characters are composite characters.  Now, there had been one hidden line at the end of a paragraph in the middle of the five-page Foreword, which I missed, that said the author was preserving the subjects' "anonymity," but didn't say that composite characters would be used.  The usual convention in situations where an author is using fake names, and especially composite characters, is to make that blatantly clear up-front.
