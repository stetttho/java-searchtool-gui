 This is a cookbook, with a little incorrect Beanie info, masquerading as a "Beanie Handbook."  Don't be misled by the title, and don't be misled by the star rating here.  If you want a cookbook, there  are lots of those available -- including a number of fun cooking projects  for kids.  If you want a Beanie book, there are several available -- don't  overlook some of the comprehensive Beanie magazines.  This is just a  rip-off designed to sucker in folks, including young children, who will buy  the book relying on its misleading title.
