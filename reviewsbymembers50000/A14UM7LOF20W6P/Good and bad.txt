 This book is written in the typical engaging and page-turning Cook medical suspense style.  The character of Kim, and her search for self-confidence and family history, is particularly well-developed.  Likewise the Salem  witch trial history bit is well-done.  However, large parts of the book  are rather poorly-done and/or over-done.  The extensive plot line about the  night creatures who, for a start, kill Edward's dog is just incredible.   The evidence of these creatures' identity is all around the researchers and  they unbelievably ignore it.  Cook uses these creatures to turn a workable  and enjoyable medical suspense plot into an over-done gothic novel.  Cook  also incorrectly casts Prozac and other depression-lifting drugs as  personality-changing drugs.  The end scene of the medical research facility  is unbelievable, and the reader is likewise disappointed with Kim at the  end -- she's spent the novel finding her own strength and independence, and  she winds up happy mainly because she's with a man.
