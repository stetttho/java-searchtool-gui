 This is a well-written page-turner.   Yet the characters, once you discover their motivations, are fairly one-dimensional:  pretty near everyone is a "goodie" or a "baddie."  Not much complexity or soul-searching among the characters.  Also, the ending (which I won't reveal), is such a wildly impossible out-of-the-blue deus ex machina invention that it destroys any delusion the reader may have had that the author was writing about realistic events and characters.
