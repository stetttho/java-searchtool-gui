 I'm amazed that this book became a best-seller -- it must have been the catchy title. The book swings back and forth between political commentary (containing many factual errors) to inconsistency and silliness.  Moore can't even keep the definition of his central term straight:  does "white" mean those who share a skin pigment, as when Moore writes, "every time I see a white guy walking toward me, I tense up," or does "white" mean "conservative attitude," as when he claims that the "Stupid White Virus ... has even infected ringers like Colin Powell [and] ... Condoleeza Rice," concluding at the end of the book that the Democratic party is as bad as the Republican, and so we should vote for independents like Ralph Nader and Jesse Ventura? The only positive thing about this book is that Chapter One contains a good analysis of exactly how Florida stole the votes of thousands of African American and other Democratic-leaning voters.  One decent chapter, though, is the equivalent of a magazine article, and does not justify buying this book.
