 They should put a page limit on these things.  486 pages is way too much.  I skipped 50 pages in the middle and wound up still in the same discussion, having missed none of the plot.  Much in the book is good.   But it  doesn't take a dozen repetitions of the same thing over and over for the  reader to get the point.  The author starts off making a big point of  the female MD protagonist being black.  "There were no other black  people in the [board] room.  Rae was used to this....  An advantage -- she  now understood.  Being different had taught her to be tough, resouceful,  and self-reliant."  Yet none of the book seems tied to her experience  as a minority. And a mere TWO pages later, the author makes prejudiced  and bigoted comments about nurses as a group:  "[Married Dr. Marco  Donavelli] was called Il Magnifico ... because of his reputation with the  nurses.  No one hopped in and out of bed with more of them than Marco did.   It was not just his looks....  What drove most nurses to his bed was his  skill in the operating room."  Was this supposed to be a book to  expose prejudice, or create it?
