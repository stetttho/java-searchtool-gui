 While "Q" doesn't have the blatant inconsistencies, dangling plot lines, and poor writing of "P," the writing in this book simply isn't up to the previous standard of this series. This story could have been well-told in roughly half its 380 pages. While I don't object to scene-setting and description, Grafton's style here is too predictable: EVERY time Kinsey meets someone, there will immediately follow one or two paragraphs on what the person is wearing. The repeated health problems of her police buddies -- and the junk food ecstasies -- get old with constant repetition. Virtually every time Kinsey knocks on a door, or makes a phone call, she gets solid information from someone willing to talk with her.  In real life, investigators -- much less non-police investigators -- much more frequently knock on doors and make phone calls when folks aren't home, or won't talk. This book is a pass.
