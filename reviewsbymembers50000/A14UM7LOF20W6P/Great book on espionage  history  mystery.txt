 I have read a number of books dealing with some of the same cases Volkman  describes.  Volkman is not only easy to read, but also does a great job  presenting the facts of the case, the milieu of each case, and how each  case affected history.  He describes, somewhat, the mindset of espionage  officers who sometimes prefer quantity over quality, and tradecraft and  history as incidental to the cases.  He includes some photographs and a  helpful index.  He often throws in details I don't remember seeing in other  more detailed and lengthy works.  Some of the cases Volkman writes about  are the "Trust" operation (early Soviet sting of anti-Soviets),  Cuban doubling of US agents, British doubling of Nazi agents (Double  Cross), code-breaking, atomic bomb secrets, the Wallenbergs in WWII, WWI  German sabotage in U.S., the Angleton/Philby mole affair, etc. Volkman  is both willing and able to point out each country's successes and failures  -- even when success is based on happenstance and failure is based on  incredibly poor judgment.  Here's one passage:  "[in 1978], Hu  Simeng worked for the Chinese, who did not know that she also worked for  the East Germans, who did not know that she was a Chinese asset, but who  did know that she worked for the CIA, which didn't know she also worked for  both the Chinese and the East Germans.  The material she provided the  Chinese was in fact East German and KGB disinformation, but the Chinese  knew that, so they provided disinformation for Hu Simeng to give to the  East Germans...."  Criticisms include that he occasionally reaches  too facile a conclusion (Wallenberg was killed by Soviets in 1947 instead  of the lengthy imprisonment other sources describe), and at least one minor  factual error (the bomb "Fat Man" was dropped on Nagasaki, not  Hiroshima).  In sum, an excellent book for anyone mildly interested in  the topic, or very interested.
