 Wow!  What a great book! This extremely well-edited book covers the topic of the white supremacy movement.  It is detailed, yet concise;  readable, yet informative.  In one 150-page package, using clear type and appropriate subheadings, the book carries the reader through a tour of the history of white supremacy in the US -- particularly the Ku Klux Klan, the skinhead movement, the rise and spread of racist music and video games, the World Church of the Creator, and racist movements in Europe.  It includes a useful index. One very moving chapter is "Personal Encounters with White Supremacy."  This chapter includes first person or interview accounts from a former skinhead, the head of the World Church of the Creator, a woman who married a white supremacist, an activist stalked and threatened by white supremacists, and a white woman who was paralyzed in 1997 by skinheads when she stood up for an African man they were attacking.  The book ends with suggestions on how white supremacy can be combated, including the story of Billings, Montana, which in 1993 united against vandalism against Jewish families. The book has no pictures -- which may be a good thing:  one cannot skim through looking at the pictures, but one is drawn to the text.  It's also a bit pricey:  books like this one should be as accessible as possible.
