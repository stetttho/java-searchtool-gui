 Wow -- great book.  The author goes to a very eminent psychiatrist for emotional and marital problems.  At first it seems the doctor is just "controlling," demeaning, and manipulating her life.  He also  starts giving her the barbituate Sodium Amytal during office visits, which  he claims will help her remember past hurts.  After 18 years and  $100,000 of treatment, she comes out of an Amytal session earlier than  expected with the doctor raping her.  How will this life-long intimidated  woman respond, especially when a number of those she turns to are sure she  must have imagined or "dreamed" the rape, and an equal number are  afraid to cross the famous psychiatrist?  A compelling story of a woman  whose early life history set her up for continuing domination and abuse by  the psychiatrist she turned to for help.
