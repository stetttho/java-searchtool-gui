 This is a fascinating book if you can put up with a murder every few pages, knowing that these murders took place in real life.  The author weaves information about the history of each method of detection in with the details of each crime -- kind of like Crichton's book "Five Patients."  The author is occasionally given to a little bit of hyperbole, but it's an excellent read for anyone interested in forensics.  Here's one of the stories:  It's about a woman who planted cyanide-laced Excedrin in various stores, to cover up the fact that she used cyanide-laced Excedrin to kill her husband.   The twist is that when her husband died, the doctor mistakenly recorded the cause as emphysema, not poison.  Because of the mistaken diagnosis of the cause of her husband's death, the widow/ murderer would only have gotten $31,000 insurance, instead of the $176,000 insurance she would have gotten if his death was accidental poisoning.  She wanted the extra money badly enough that not only did she call the doctor several times to ask him if he could have been mistaken, but she called the police to ask if her husband's death could be related to a local cyanide/Excedrin death (caused by her planted Excedrin in a drug store causing an innocent death).      Investigating as she requested, not only did the police prove that her husband was poisoned, but the police proved that she was the one who did the poisoning, earning her a 90-year prison sentence.
