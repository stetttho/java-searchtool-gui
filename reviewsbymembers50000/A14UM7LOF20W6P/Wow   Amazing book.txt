 "Ain't it a trip where heroes come from."  Chris Crutcher thus sums up the greatness found in many unexpected places.  His book swings from this greatness to the loneliness, despair and even horror we find among the commonplace.  "One thing I know:  Families can get pretty messed up while they're looking pretty good." This is a superbly-written and very moving book.  Although it's a "teen" book, the plot is better, and the characters more "deep," multi-faceted and developed -- including many of the peripheral characters -- than many bestsellers in the "grown-up" book market. Many deep issues are explored in this book;  it will make both adult and teen readers think. Yes, the book's conservative Christians are narrow-minded, but guess what?  That's that way it usually is in real life.  The new bookcover displayed on the amazon site doesn't fit the book's description of Eric "Moby" Calhoune's body or swimsuit -- it'd be nice if cover art were approved by the author. I highly recommend this fantastic book!
