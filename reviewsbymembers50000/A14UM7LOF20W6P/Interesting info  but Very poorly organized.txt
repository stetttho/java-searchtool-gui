 This book has lots of info on flying and safety -- as one would hope from the former Inspector General of the Dept of Transportation -- but it's very poorly organized.  Her gripes about petty bureaucracy are intermingled with stories about how she learned to fly which are tangled with stories of herself as a commercial passenger, and somewhere almost lost in there is the information about the deficiencies in the equipment and operations used in commercial air travel.  In the chapter on safe landings, for example, she slaloms into gripes about FAA managers misusing free air tickets.  Toward the end, she advises passengers on which "Airline Safety Rule" to cite, but no mention of where these are found in the Code of Fed Regs or statutes.   What we basically have here is a good first draft of a book that needs to be strongly edited (organized) into something readable -- something that can be referred to without thumbing through 357 pages.
