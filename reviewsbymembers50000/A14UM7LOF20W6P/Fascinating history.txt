 This is a fascinating book which provides insight into Richard Helms and the CIA's activities from the end of WW II through the seventies, including revelations on Watergate, Chile, Iraq, Cuban Missile Crisis, Castro, Bay of  Pigs, and the presidents of that time.  The book goes on at length  discussing when, to whom in Congress, and about what, the CIA may lie.   The book's faults are that it assumes too much historical knowledge of  the reader, and a bit too much flitting back and forth time-wise.
