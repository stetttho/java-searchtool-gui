 What a terrific book! I started this book and almost abandoned it unread, because the first three chapters were sort of disjointed and uninteresting.  The "letters to Larry" parts seemed distracting.  But, I had previously read another book by Chris Crutcher, and so hung in there. About the fourth chapter, everything came together.  Letters to Larry were a nice additional reflection.  The plot is interesting and well-done.   Each character is well-defined, and is "seen" through multiple points of view.  Teens (and adults) reading this book will have a renewed ability to think about others in their totality -- to consider how that person got his/her behavior, and to look at others' points of view. I believe this book will be beneficial to all teens, and especially those who are having trouble controlling their anger, or are going through difficulties or abuse in their lives -- particularly difficulties with parents and authority figures.  The author, through his characters, offers advice on how to deal with anger problems. I highly recommend this book for those in the appropriate age levels.
