 This book about Harvard Med by a medical columnist in the area, sure enough, imparts a lot of information about Harvard Med.  But along the way it suffers from being cumbersome and somewhat disjointed -- the author constantly flips back and forth between the history of Harvard Med, the stories of graduates, the stories of students, the stories of professors, and discussions of research medicine vs. specialization vs. general practice.  Mixed in with these are the author's own experiences -- as a neighborhood boy visiting the campus, and as a coddled medical columnist who was allowed to audit the med school's fundamental gross anatomy class, and whose every ail is treated by the country's leading Harvard doctors.  After reading the book you'll know more about Harvard Med, but you'll probably see your doctor for dizziness.
