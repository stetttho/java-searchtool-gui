 The strongest point of this book is that it's a well-written suspenseful page-turner with no visible factual bloopers. With this book, you're guaranteed a day or so of compelling reading.  As the other reviews mention, this book could benefit from more complex characters. Most characters are totally "good" or "bad" (except for one revelation at the end).  One chilling sentence in light of recent events is the book's prediction on future terrorism: "So who's next? Are we going to get a 747 impacting the World Trade Center...?"  I agree with the other review that the ending is inconsistent with the book. When the responsible parties are revealed, it is just inconceivable (even with fictional poetic license) that such parties would take the actions they did for the purpose they did. It's also never cleared up how the communications were intercepted (if we believe the "I really tried to stop them" statement), and it's a bit inconsistent that the "bad guys" could so convincingly pretend to be FBI agents, down to minute behavior and ID, and yet not know the location of the FBI academy.
