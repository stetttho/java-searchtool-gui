 Dockery's book is titled "a history," but it's not. This book is an Ode to the Navy Seal, and there are many personal stories in the "there I was in the jungle" and "the making of a Navy Seal" veins, but any type of overview, or where the Seals fit into the overall strategy, or critical analysis of how the political considerations driving the civilian leadership either directed or limited the actions of the Seals, is largely missing.  Analysis is largely limited to "the President said go, and we went."  Even the Gulf of Tonkin incident in August 1964, widely acknowledged to be mistaken, is accepted at face value.  The many interviews quoted at length give the book a very episodic feel.  There is, I believe, not one negative word about the Seals, or their success in Vietnam, in this book. The pictures and narratives are good in giving the reader a sense of what it's like to be a Seal, how the Seals operate on their missions, the tools they use, and how important the concept of "team" is to the effectiveness of the Seals.  Buy it for this purpose, if you wish, but not to gain any concept of history.
