 This book gives a good overview on how an author's character can be wounded, and the expected treatment (often simplified) and course of recovery.   If an author is looking for guidance on realistic hospital practice, dialog, medications, equipment, or lingo, the author better look elsewhere -- these items are either simplified or missing.   Equally missing is any mention of the role of non-MD caregivers in hospital care, in particular nurses.  The reader of this book would come away with the impression that the only function of nurses in hospitals is to hand surgical instruments to the surgeon in the O.R. -- especially sad since this is supposed to be a guide to OTHER AUTHORS for them write realistic fiction.  For example, when Doctor Page is discussing how suspected belly wounds are monitored during their hospital stay, he says,   "The trauma surgeon will return to the bedside over and over to reevaluate the patient until he is certain no injury exists."   Not hardly!  In real life, it's the nurses who provide the hour-by-hour patient care and monitoring.  The prospective author who is interested in a realistic view of what goes on in an emergency room and other hospital settings would do well to read any book by Echo Heron, RN, including the factual Intensive Care, or Condition Critical, or Mercy (the latter is a medical novel).
