 The promise of this book, stated on the back cover, is to uncover a "deception [by Churchill] that propelled ... Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union."   That promise is never delivered on.  The writing style is merely passable.  After a few false starts, the book goes into a very long digression into German and Nazi history which has nothing to do with the book topic.   The author constantly belittles Churchill as the self-indulgent imperialistic "old bulldog," "that damned warmonger at 10 Downing Street."   Yet while the author once calls Hitler a "demon," Hitler is virtually praised as the misunderstood hope of a unified Germany, a man who by May 1941 had reached as far geographically as he wanted -- a man who only bombed London in an attempt to reach peace with England, and who was willing to give up France if England would only agree to peace.  The holocaust?  Why, blame that on Churchill -- the holocaust was started when Germany was tricked into invading Russia.  Why did Hitler invade Russia?  The author can't make up his mind.  Sometimes the reason for the Russian invasion is to convince England that Hitler's desire for peace with England is sincere, and other times Hitler was tricked into invading Russian because there was ALREADY a de facto peace treaty between Germany and England reached in May 1941.  Somehow thrown into the mix is that by reaching peace with Germany and encouraging Hitler's invasion of Russia, this would force the U.S. to come into the war.  Whether Hess' flight into Scotland to meet the supposed leader of the British "Peace Party" came out of Hess' deluded mind, or was a secret mission from Hitler, that surely doesn't translate into either a "secret peace" or an intention on Churchill's part to cause Hitler to invade Russia.
