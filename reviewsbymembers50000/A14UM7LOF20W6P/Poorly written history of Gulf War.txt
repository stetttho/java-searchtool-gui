 This is a history of the 101st Airborne Division's  role in the Gulf War.  It starts off by being incredibly schmaltzy.  The author writes about his father, "My father wore the [division Screaming Eagle  shoulder patch in WWII....]  [O]nly the Screaming Eagle is engraved on his  headstone, as it had been on his heart.  I'd worn it in the jungle where it  seemed a talisman and inspiration."  He goes on to describe  incidents like one battalion commander publicly promising to his unit's  families, "I'm going to bring every guy back alive ... every one of  your husbands ... will come back alive."  Is this a war or a camping  trip?  The schmaltz continues after the war as five division deaths are  lamented.  "Five from the ill-fated crew had settled all accounts on  this earth....  We had been so fearful there would be many, many more.  We  had to be grateful....  But it was a guilty gratitude."  More  serious problems in this long 440-page book include failing to put events  in perspective.  The author brings in many anecdotes, often in the form of  lengthy quotes from soldiers he interviewed for the book, without letting  the reader in on the secret of what this soldier's role was, what the unit  was doing, why the unit was doing it, etc.  Not only is the author's  writing style disjointed, but the author cannot get his tenses straight.   He usually writes of these past events in the past tense, but then lapses  into current tense, and even into future tense on occasion.  I enjoy the  genre, but this particular book is a definite pass.
