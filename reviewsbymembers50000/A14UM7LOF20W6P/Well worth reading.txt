 This book is well worth reading for anyone interested in psi in general, or remote viewing in particular.  For a more comprehensive overview of remote viewing, I also recommend Jim Schnabel's _Remote Viewers : The Secret History of America's Psychic Spies_.  You'd also enjoy a book by another remote viewer, Joseph McMoneagle's _Mind Trek : Exploring Consciousness, Time, and Space Through Remote Viewing_. If you have a chance to hear David Morehouse speak, or to attend one of his classes, do so! As an aside, the previous reviewer who disbelieved the book because "there were no ovens at Dachau" is wrong:  there were five ovens at Dachau, each with a capacity of several bodies.  Check the web.
