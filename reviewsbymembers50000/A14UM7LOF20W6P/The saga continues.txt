 You'll enjoy this book IF you've read and enjoyed the previous books.  This would not be a good book to start your Hillerman reading.  The Navajo lore, and sense of being and place, which centers and enriches some of Hillerman's previous books is barely touched on here.  I found the plot plausible, but the book is a very quick read compared to other in the series:  I'd get this one from the library.
