 Rowling's heart seemingly wasn't in writing this book.  Plot?   Someone's trying to kill someone in Hogwarts;  half-way through the book, it's telegraphed that Draco is trying to kill Dumbledore.  Dumbledore is investigating the past of Voldemort.  That's it, folks.  There is a bit of the glimmer of the old excitement, such as when Harry slips a luck potion to a friend, Harry tries to find out how Draco is disappearing from Hogwarts, figuring out if Snape is really on the good side, the mystery of who the "half-blood prince" is, Hermione's doubts about using the book, and girls all over Hogwarts trying to slip love potions to Harry.  The portraits of the Weasleys' life is well-done.  But these are few and far between.  There are silly "love" plots, without much depth.  Various students kiss repeatedly, and their friends go "eeewwwww."  Most of us have read the previous books, but Rowling counts too much on our memory of tiny details over a two-year span.  She won't tell us about Quidditch scoring, the difference between an O.W.L. and a N.E.W.T., how the invisibility cloak works, where Harry got it, etc.  The book is a really quick read for its length, and the development of plot almost exclusively through dialogue is way over-done.  The list price of $29.99 seems a bit misleading when it's sold many places for about $19.  I really hope Rowling gets her spark back with the next book.
