 I agree with the other two reviews (not counting the 5-star ad which is the first "review," with such nuggets as "A reader would have to be BRAIN DEAD not to enjoy this tale").  This is a good  hospital suspense book.  Several times the protagonist Timmie will reach a  conclusion and forget to share that with the reader.  And the secondary  characters do blur into each other.  The major fault I found with the  book is its length -- 497 pages!!  In reaching this length, the author  throws in too much repetition of dialogue, reflection, and plot.  The  author really does not have to repeat something 10 times to have the reader  get the point.  This would have been a much better book at about 350 pages.
