 This is a true story with true characters and events, not a fictionalized "this could have happened" history. This is the story of the civil rights movement in 1965 Selma, Alabama.  After the events shown in the video, Lyndon Johnson made the following speech -- one of his best: "At times history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in man's unending search for freedom. So it was at Lexington and Concord. So it was a century ago at Appomattox. So it was last week in Selma, Alabama. "There, long-suffering men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as Americans. Many were brutally assaulted.... "There is no cause for pride in what has happened in Selma. There is no cause for self-satisfaction in the long denial of equal rights of millions of Americans. But there is cause for hope and for faith in our democracy in what is happening here tonight...."  You may wish to find the entire speech and read it -- it's available on the internet. This movie is appropriate for school use for 5th and 6th graders and up. "Selma, Lord, Selma" never fails to bring tears to my eyes.  A good companion video is "Ruby Bridges."
