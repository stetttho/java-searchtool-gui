 I took this book with me on an ER visit, and the wait to see the doc lasted longer than it took to read this quick read.  There are some plot twists and plot devices that are nicely done.  But the characters are essentially unlikable, and there are too many unrealistic, improbable and/or deus ex machina events to make this overly-quick read a good book.
