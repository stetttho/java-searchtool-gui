 While the subject of the book is fascinating, and there is some  interesting information in the book, the book would greatly benefit from  substantial editing, with emphasis on writing style.  The book suffers  from a number of writing faults.  If it's a book about "the  coevolution of people and plagues" (its subtitle), why are the  author's world travels constantly thrown at the reader?  "One of my  most searing memories is of being surrounded on a street in Hyderabad by a  crowd of lepers....  I reached Vellore, a cheerful and relatively clean  market town, after a hectic 120-kilometre bus ride from  Madras...."  If the reader makes it past the travelogue, the reader  will still have to get through the prose and commas.  "Yet the AIDS  virus, despite its fearsome aspects, has had just as much difficulty in  spreading through the human population as syphilis or typhoid, and has had  to make equally dramatic compromises in order to retain its ability to  spread" is a typical sentence.  The subject would be much better  served if the author could stay on topic and the book was presented as an  adventure to be discovered and enjoyed instead of making each sentence (and  the book itself) a puzzle to be penetrated.
