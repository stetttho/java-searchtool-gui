 I wasn't that impressed with Stupid White Men -- most of the book was just a rant -- but after I heard Michael Moore speak I bought this book.  It is much more fair and balanced -- if that isn't an insult nowadays -- than Stupid White Men. This book is loaded with well-cited facts supporting Moore's arguments and suggestions, including some pretty flattering comments about conservatives.  Moore nicely ties together humor and preaching, including a great chapter written by "God."  Anyone who calls this book a "rant" hasn't read it. I won't repeat all the substantive stuff you'll see in the other reviews;  I'll just say that if you're concerned about the future of this country, READ THIS BOOK !!
