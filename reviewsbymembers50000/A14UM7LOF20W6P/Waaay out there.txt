 *spoilers* The bizarre plot is that incredibly rich men screen their prospective wives for genetic compatibility, and then use surrogate mothers to birth children which will be close genetic matches, available to be killed to provide organ transplants for the father, if needed at a future date.  The children are raised "like animals" under lock and key in a mountain-top compound in Los Angeles County.  Meanwhile, the doctor in charge of this compound -- which is owned by organized crime, no less -- maintains his job as a respected surgeon at Joanna Blalock's hospital.  The book opens with an attempted sniping by a man with a Ruger Mini-14 shooting .50 caliber bullets.  However, the Ruger Mini-14 shoots .223 caliber bullets. There are almost as many murders in this book as there are references to how beautiful Joanna is. This book has few redeeming qualities;  it's a definite pass.
