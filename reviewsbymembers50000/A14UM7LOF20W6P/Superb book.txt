 This superb "personal story" chronicles the adventures of Caroline Paul as she applies to, and joins, the SFFD as one of its first women firefighters.  The story is a somewhat quick read, but very well-written, and gives the reader a sense of what it's like to be a firefighter, along with her personal experiences and reflections on her acculturation into what she first thought of as the "racist, sexist, fire department."   Paul skillfully combines her own story with the stories of others and history into a compelling account.  She doesn't fall into the trap of assigning "good" and "bad" to people.  She almost always explains the lingo she uses -- waiting, however, til the end to explain what a "full box" call is, and waiting to explain why firefighters (somewhat counter-intuitively) ventilate fires.  At least a few photos would be helpful, too -- at least of the media event where she and her sister persuaded the government to release her animal rights-protestor brother from jail, and of the equipment and techniques she describes.  As a final note, the author photo appears to be of the author, in lipstick and make-up, daubed with a bit of dark smudge, wearing her fire helmet.  Is the photo really meant to represent how she appears at work?
