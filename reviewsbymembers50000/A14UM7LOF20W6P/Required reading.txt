 This book on the naval air war over Vietnam should be required reading not only for all military pilots, but for every military and civilian official who is involved in planning strategy, tactics, or military weapon  procurement.  But don't get the idea it's a boring book;  besides giving  the reader a clear view of what happened in the air over Vietnam, the  author makes his points in a very readable fashion, not by preaching but by  simply pointing out what we did, and why we could have done so much better  -- in the conduct of the war, in providing better (often SIMPLER)  equipment, and in better training.   It's definitely worth obtaining  from an out-of-print dealer or from your library.  Even if you have no  connection with the military, this will expand your understanding of that  period in US history.
