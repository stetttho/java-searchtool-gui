 The plot outline is good, but it's poorly executed. Once the author thinks he has a funny idea, he repeats it several times since we weren't bright enough to get it the first time. The trial is out of order -- Buckley has the prosecution and defense call witnesses almost in random order.  Judges would not need to recuse themselves because they were appointed by the victim's predecessor.  The Perry Mason TV series didn't have "trials," but preliminary hearings.   The characters are largely one-dimensional, and the writing style is a bit silly. These might be overlooked, but in his Acknowledgements, Buckley claims he had the help of several "distinguished attorneys," plus "a peerless editor," and "the keen eyes of Gregory Zorthian and William F. Buckley Jr.," AND a relentless and superb fact checker.  In other words, Christopher Buckley had to work fairly hard to produce the merely-mediocre execution of what could have been a good book.
