 What a neat book! I'd almost given up on Gary Paulsen autobiographical books after reading his motorcycle-themed book.  But yes, Gary shows here he can write an engaging book about his past. With a wry, understated sense of humor, he takes us through his experiences with boats -- from the first time he was entranced with the sea, to his future plans. He tells stories of events that most authors would rather forget -- from his initial brash overconfidence, almost getting "taken" by a fast-talking boat salesperson, and how he came close to death several times through lack of knowledge and clues about sea conditions that would be obvious to experienced sailors. This book is even interesting reading for adults who want to know more about Gary Paulsen. The title has a nice twist to it -- Paulsen writes how the sea "caught" him in the sense of being his captivated by the sea, and how the sea several times "caught" him in the sense of almost killing him.
