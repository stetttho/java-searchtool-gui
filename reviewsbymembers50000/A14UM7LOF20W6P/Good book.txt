 This is a book worth reading -- a compelling plot with interesting twists and turns.  Protagonist Harry Bosch is neither too perfect, nor too flawed.  His girlfriend has her own personality, motivations, and job;  she's not there for mere decoration.  The quick conversations between Bosch and Chandler during courtroom smoking breaks are a nice touch.  The aspects of the case which cause Bosch to examine his own past, and motivations, separates this from the too-common "good guys versus bad guys action" type books.  It's also good to read a book which doesn't rely on a deus ex machina ending. There are a few bloopers along the way.  Lawyers would not abide a US district judge who commented on their opening arguments to the jury with "They may make some highfalutin allegations, but just because they say it doesn't make it true.  After all, they're lawyers [pronounced lie-yers]." A real estate agent would be unlikely to hold an open house because she has two interested buyers.  (Open houses are held to _get_ buyers, not because you have them.) Improper statements made in court are _not_ "struck from the record."  If the statements were deleted from the record, it would be impossible to argue their effect to the court of appeals. If an attorney died, attorney fees would still be owed -- to the attorney's estate. If Mora's divorce took place in California in the mid-1980's, mental cruelty would not be a ground of divorce -- that was eliminated in 1970.  Connelly's use of the term "loss of consortium" is outside the usual context -- the term is usually used in cases where an injury to one spouse prevents marital relations, not a divorce where a spouse decides to stop relations. In all, it's a worthwhile and entertaining book for a day or two's good read.  See if you can figure out who the Follower is before Bosch does!
