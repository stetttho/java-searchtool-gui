 As the other reviews indicate, the book is well-written, and offers insights not only on tank repair and crew training, but also on the strengths of the different tanks involved in World War II, and how that affected the course and tactics of the war.  In that sense this is a valuable book.  Yet the book is unnecessarily confusing, in a way that could have been easily corrected, for a book that's intended for a mass market.  The author frequently switches designations for the tanks involved, forcing the reader to keep in mind that a "Sherman" is the same as a "M4," which we must remember is quite different from the "Mark IV," sometimes referred to as the "Panther" or "PzKw IV."  While the physical differences and armor depth of the different parts of the different tanks are explained in text at length, there are _no_ diagrams or photos with legend to explain what the author is referring to.  The author may be safe in assuming the readers know what a turret is, but he also frequently refers to the "glacis plate," and other tank parts, apparently assuming everyone knows what they are and where they are located.  The author repeatedly refers to the importance of obtaining a wrecked tank's "'W' number," but feels no need to tell us where it was located.  Likewise, the book contains three hand-drawn maps, not referenced to the text.  More and better maps, better coordinated with the text, would be helpful to those of us not intimately familiar with World War II European geography.  Further, the appendices could have been profitably integrated into the text -- perhaps in the introduction.
