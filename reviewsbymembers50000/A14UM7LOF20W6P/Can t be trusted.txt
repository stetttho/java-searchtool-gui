 This is an interesting book, with interesting stories, although there are so many factual lapses and inconsistencies that no story in the book can be taken at face value without independent verification.  This is, of course, undesirable in a history book. Wright, for instance, reports that during the Vietnam war, a TV cameraman pictured an American soldier setting fire to a Vietnamese hut.   Wright identifies this village as My Lai, and the televised hut-burning as the start of the My Lai massacre.  In fact, the televised hut-burning was at Cam Ne in August 1965.  The My Lai massacre happened in March 1968, and wasn't publicly revealed until November 1969. Wright's mortality figures from the Civil War are equally perplexing.  Most sources, including Wright, say between 3 and 4 million Americans served in the War, on both sides.  If, as Wright says, 600,000 died in the War, that's a mortality rate of between 15 and 20%.  But in the same paragraph, Wright gives a mortality rate of 13.4%.   And later in the book, Wright says 1 of 65 soldiers died in battle, and 1 in 13 died of disease -- which would be a mortality rate of 9.2%.   While Wright doesn't need to solve a mystery that's unsolvable due to incomplete records, he should explain why he gives three different figures for the same event. Wright says that "Amazing Grace" was originally a Negro spiritual.  In fact, Amazing Grace started as an English hymn written by former slave-trader John Newton.  Later, the hymn's  music, taken from an American folk song or "plantation melody," was added. Further, Wright's habit of repeating anecdotes from chapter to chapter, almost verbatim, such as John Jones and the "Bread Riot," is distracting. In sum, no matter how interesting and educational most of the anecdotes are, if the information given can't be trusted to be factual, the book should sadly be passed up.  With a bit of editing and fact-checking it would be a good book.
