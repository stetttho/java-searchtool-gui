 This is a fun quick book to read -- lots of interesting stories, and it adds some insight into the job of flight nurse. The author does a good job of not talking down to the reader, explaining most medical terms as the stories go along. The book is a real quick read -- glad I picked it up at the library.  After the pages of portraying how professional and dedicated flight medical staff are, it was a bit jarring to read about how their week-long annual conferences are "really nothing more than drinkfests," and the author thought it was a blast to get so drunk she couldn't sit through a class the next morning.  Let's hope she doesn't need to use the techniques she was too drunk to learn on her next patient! I also wish the book had given a better view of the author as a person -- sometimes she writes about her feelings, but it comes across as more of a report than insight.
