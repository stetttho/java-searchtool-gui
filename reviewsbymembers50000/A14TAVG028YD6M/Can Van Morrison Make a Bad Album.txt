 I believe not I love this disc I play it when I'm sitting in my pool and I just hear the sweet melody of "Celtic New Year" or "Stranded" this CD is great believe me I love every single track and it is a powerful CD! I just can't believe he doesn't sell alot of records expcept Moondance which sold 10 million world wide. But I'm angered in the fact that people don't find his music good! Or maybe they just never really heard of him well in my eyes this is just as good as any other Van Morrison CD ENJOY!
