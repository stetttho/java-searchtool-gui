 Ray of Light showed Madonna as a great song writer in her own right. As I can't tell you the billboard staticts of this album since I don't have them right now I do know the singles I know that Frozen peaked at #2 on the billboard charts and it is easily one of the most inspirational songs!  This album talks about how she acted in the past "Your Frozen when your heart is not open"  Same with "Nothing Really Matters" told you that in the 80's she just wanted to make herself happy not everybody around her.. Other good songs on the album are "Subsitute for Love", "Power of Goodbye", "Swim" and "Sky fits Heaven" Go get lost in the RAY OF LIGHT !
