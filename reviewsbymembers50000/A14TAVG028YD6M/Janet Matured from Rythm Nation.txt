 This album is very sexual and mature she expresses herself in such a beutiful way. With her first single "That's The Way Love Goes" which peaked at #1 for 8 straight weeks.  Then she release a nice little dance tune "If" which is personally one of my favorite songs.  "If" peaked at #4 on the billboard charts.  Then her next #1 of the album was her great slow jam "Again" which I can never seem to get it out of my head. her other slow songs include the sexy and mature "Any time, Any Place" which peaked at #2 on the billboard charts. her other singles "Because of love" which is a high tempo dance beat song, and "You want This" which is another great dance song.  Songs that are good that were not singles are "This Time" her anthem against men who cheat. And "Funky Big Band" adds some great funk to the album. This album was considered the matching success to Rhythm Nation 1814.. "Janet" went to be 6x platuim same as Rhythm Nation 1814 and went on to be #1 for 6 weeks straight... but Rhythm Nation 1814 was #1 for 4 weeks straight. Big difference  is the albums sold world wide "Rhythm Nation 1814" approx sold 25-27 million albums world wide. While "Janet" approx sold 21-23 million world wide. But Their both two great successes in miss Jackson's life
