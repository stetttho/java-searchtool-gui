 Shakira is defintley a great latin pop singer , in English and Spanish.  Personally I like the spanish album, due to fact she sounds so much better when she sings Spanish such as the awesome latin duet "La Tortura" and the great remix they give with it.  "En Tus Pupilas" and "La Pared" start the album off with a bang great latin tunes and vocals by Shakira. "No" a great Shakira song on the album that you will just fall in love with.   "Dia Especial" and "Dia De Enero" personally are my favorite songs on the album with "La Tortura" and "No" this album is the biggest latin release in a while pick it up!   Overall Effect: 5/5
