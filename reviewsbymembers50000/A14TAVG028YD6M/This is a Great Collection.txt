 J.K. Rowling gives you all six hardcover books, and she justs gets better and better as Harry gets older.  She has shown the world of true magic and wizardely.  Gave kids and adults interesting stories for us to enjoy over a span of time that will always be remembered.    This is the collection you want if you don't have any of the Harry Potter books, if you don't care for the hardcover books I advice you to get the soft cover collection.    Overall: To me Rowling continues to get better and better and this is a colleciton that proves it I gives this a 5/5.
