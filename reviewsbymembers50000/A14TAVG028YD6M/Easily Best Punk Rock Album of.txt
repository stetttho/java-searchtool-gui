 With their big mega hit since "Dookie", "American Idiot" has been their best album to me. With opening out to the great rocker "American Idiot" and the great rock ballad "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" also "Jesus of Suburbia" and a amazing nine minuite song.  To me "Holiday" right now is the best song on the album including with the song "Wake Me up when September Ends" along with "LetterBomb" and "She's a Rebel."
