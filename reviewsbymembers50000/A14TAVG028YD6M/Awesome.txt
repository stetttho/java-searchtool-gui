 Toni Braxton releases her newest album since "More Than A Woman" which sold an estimated total of 500,000 copies.  But "Libra" has a nice strong mixture between rnb and hip hop.  In her first song "Please" is a fast RnB hit with some hip hop.  Then the best song on the album "That's the Way Love Works" best ballad song I have heard in a long time it is well performed.  Other great songs on the album are "What's Good" and "Take This Ring" And she finishes of her album with "Finally" and "Shadowless"  Toni Braxton's mixture of hip hop is great, I know that her older albums such as "Toni Braxton" and "Secrets" had that classic RnB feeling, but this album much better than "More Than A Woman"
