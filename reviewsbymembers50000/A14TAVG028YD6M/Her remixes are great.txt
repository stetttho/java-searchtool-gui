 Britney Spears has been known for great singles, and as most people say have the rest of her album full of filler.  Well, I never listened to her albums, untill her greatest hits and "In the Zone" which I thought was an album of all great songs.  Well, Britney gives a solid effort on the remixes on "Toxic" which is one of her better singles and some traditional favorites such as "Baby One More Time" and "Im A Slave For You"  "Me Against The Music" another great song with her and Madonna. Also some other great remixes are "Early Mornin" "Everytime" and "Touch Of My Hand"
