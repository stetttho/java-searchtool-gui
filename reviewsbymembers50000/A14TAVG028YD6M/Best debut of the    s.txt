 Whitney Houston had probelly one of the best debut albums in the 80's, but this album is much more than that. THis album is amazing with her great vocals.  She has a alot of ballads the best ballads are "YOu Give Good Love", "Greatest Love Of ALl", "Saving All My Love For You", and "Thinking About You" Those are the stand out ballad tracks but still every song is listenable! Her one great dance song on the album is "How Will I Know" My personal favorite.  This album hit #1  for 14 weeks straight on the billboard charts and was certified 12x platuim which means it sold around 12 million at that time . To this date "Whitney Houston" the ablum sold approx 28 million albums world wide. GO WHITNEY!
