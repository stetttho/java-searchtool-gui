 The season was full of suspense about who else was on the island and what was down that steel hatch.  The complete set has all of the episodes and over eight hours of bonus features and some funny bloopers.  I found the bonus features very interesting and the season is amazing and the start of a very succesful show.  However, after watching a couple of the 2nd seasons episodes I don't feel it being as strong as this one, but it is still very interesting to watch.
