 This CD amazed me in so many ways.. I didn't like the first single "Breakyaway" but the song "Since You've been Gone" is such a great little rocker from Miss Clarkson and the song peaked # 2 on the billboard charts the song itself went 3x platuim same as the album which went 3 x platuim. I love the new single "Behind these Hazel Eyes"  But these are not the onyl good songs.  I like the songs "Because of You", "Addicted","Gone" and "I hate Myself for losing you" This album is well worth anybody's money!
