 Mariah sure does shine when it comes to her singles hitting #1 on the billboard charts. MY All and Honey where her #1 hits from the album but are not the only good songs from the album.  For example "Butterfly" I love this song... Same with "Breakdown", "Fly Away(Butterfly Reprise)" and "Close My Eyes" Of course "My All" and "Honey" are great Mariah songs but so are some others on the album not saying all them but the ones I mentioned sure will do it.
