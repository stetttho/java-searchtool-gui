 Ok wow it's hard for me to find a CD I don't like but this I was hoping for a great comback CD from miss lopez but I get so off vocals and bad song writing yeah a few good songs that is it.  STand out tracks are "Get Right", "Hold You Down", and "Step into my World" and those tracks arn't very great their the only songs on the album that I can bare to listen to..
