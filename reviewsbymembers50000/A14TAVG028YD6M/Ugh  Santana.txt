 "All That I Am" is not all the I hope to expect, well quite frankly I would think he would retire instead keep trying to release more and more albums.  "Supernatural" was a great album but as all great albums are extremely hard to mimic or beat and in this Santana isn't able to that.   Yeah, I will admit there are a few good songs on here such as "I'm feeling you" which is the only reason I gave this album a 2, also "Twisted" and "Cry Baby Cry".
