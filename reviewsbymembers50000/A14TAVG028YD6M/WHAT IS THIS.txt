 This ablum I can berely find a song that is good that wasn't a single. Yeah his singles are great but the whole album? No he doesn't even have Connfesion Part 1 and he making everyone buy that new album for only 4 more songs! Usher before releasing an album make sure all the songs are on it and stop taking our money! Yeah he has a nice voice and he can dance that is about all he has going for him.. Unless he starts writing better SONGS! and making the album overall good not just his singles.
