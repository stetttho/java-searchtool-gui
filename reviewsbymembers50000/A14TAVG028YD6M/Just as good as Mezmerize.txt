 Mezmerize had alot of songs that were catchy such as "BYOB" "Revenga" and "Violent Pornography"  Hypnotize is very similar to Mezmerize being very agressive with songs such as "Attack" and "Kill RockNRoll"    System of a Down has always been known for their great song writing,and they really have shown it on these last to albums "Hypnotize" and "Mezmerize"   The remain to hit #1 albums on Billboard because of their unique still in song writing vocally performing their songs.  With agression tone and sure madness.  If you bought any other Systeem of a Down CD, this is a great buy and a great follow up to "Mezmerize"
