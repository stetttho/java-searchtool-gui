 Alanis expresses her self angry on the inside then deeper down in the album she expresses her self as smart song writer and with her unique vocals she makes this album work and I can't wait to get the 10th anverisary acoustic edition of this album. This album hit # 1 on the billboard charts for 12 weeks straight and was 11x platuim which means it sold around 11 million copies in its time.. "Jagged Little Pill" sold approx 27 million albums world wide to date. Every single track on here is good and has it's own unique meaning with Alanis witch makes this album so special. I believe she is the best female song writer in the world.
