 This album shocked me I bought due to a friend send it will be the best rock album of the year and so far their isn't much competition.  I love the songs "Burn","Just Like You", and "I hate everything about you" Those are the singles and great songs on the album. But the other stand out songs on the album include "Scared", "Home", and "Born Like This"
