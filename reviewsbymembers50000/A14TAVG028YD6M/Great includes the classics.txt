 I always wanted a greatest that fitted all the songs I love by Jonny Cash, now this is it.  A two disc set of the legendary country singer.  With a couple of (live performed)songs such as "A boy named Sue",and "Folsom Prison Blues"  Also the classic song "Ring of Fire" and "Ballad of a Teenage Queen"  With "Men in Black" and "I Walk the Line" also with neat little duet with duet named "Wanderer"   I have always been a fan of Jonny Cash now, I have truly the essentials.    Overall: 5/5
