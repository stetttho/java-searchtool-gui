 Well I was expecting no filler on the album, but their isn't much of it.  With her single "Crazy in Love" is a great dance tune and it hit # 1 for 8 weeks straight on the billboard charts. "Baby Boy" another great dance song hit #1 for 9 weeks straight on the billboard charts.  I loved those two singles and I bought the cd after that, but she released to more great songs "Me Myself, and I" which hit #4 and the great dance tune" Naughty Girl" peaked at #3 on billboard charts.  Other songs beside the singles that stick out on the album are "Hip Hop Star", "Dangerously in Love 2", "Yes", "Signs" and "The closer I get to you" The album itself hit #1 on the billboard charts and was certified 3x platuim. Go BEYONCE!
