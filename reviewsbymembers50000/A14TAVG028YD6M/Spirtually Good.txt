 With there multi platinum album "A Rush of Blood to the Head" with their big single "Speed of Sound" which is very catchy with great vocals and lyrics.    "Fix You" and "White Shadows" are two personal favorties of mine, with their combination of guitar and high vocals.  I also like the songs "Talk" and "What If?"  This album has already been very succesful, hitting #1 and being 3x platinum,  I give this album and overall effect of : 4.5/5
