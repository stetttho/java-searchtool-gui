 As her bubble gum pop routs she kinda matures on this album and makes more flexiable songs.  "Me Agaisnt the Music" is a nice duet with Maddona and a great dance song.  Her Next Single "Toxic" which is the reason why I bought the album.  Her Next single" Everytim" I didn't like this song at first but it grew on me and I learned to like it alot.  Another great dance song on the album are "I got that BOOM BOOM" and "Outrageous" I personally respect her more as an artist because she is now wrighting her own stuff other songs that stand out are "Showdown" "Touch Of My Hand", "Shadow", and "Early Mornin"  I strongly adivise to ignore the bad reviews and try something new and buy this album
