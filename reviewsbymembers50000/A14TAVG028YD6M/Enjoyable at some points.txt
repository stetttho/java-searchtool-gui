 I love Celine Dion and her music, this is an album for some hard core fans.  Of course her beautiful voice saves the album alot, but there are still somes songs to give credit due when credit is needed due such as the song "Beautiful boy" and "Miracle"  This album is recommened for hard core fans,not the casual ones I personally enjoyed this album somewhat and I give it a 3.5/5 for Celine Dion.
