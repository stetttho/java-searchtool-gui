 This album is a great follow up so what the sales of it didn't match her first album!  Did Michael Jackson ever match "Thriller" I think not so don't judge of the previous album.  Well  of course the stand out tracks on this great album is "Emotions" a great tune she sings her best on this song I can't believe her vocals can hit this high! "And You Don't Remember" another get Mariah Carey song... nice tune.. one of my favorite Mariah Carey songs is "Can't Let Go" nice melody great vocals same with her inspirational song "Make it happen" this is my favorite Mariah Carey Song that sends such a strong message. Other stand out tracks " So blessed", " You're So Cold" and "Till the End of time"
