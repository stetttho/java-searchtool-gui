 Ozzy has been around for quite a while now.. And nothing makes me feel better than listening to him sing so energetically... "Gets Me Through" and "Facing Hell" are two great rockers to start of the album.. than one of my favorite ballads "Dreamer" can easily make me cry. Their is easily no filler on this great album. I love the rocking "Junkie" and "Black Illusion" same with "Alive." But my personal favorite song on this album is "Running out of time" great lyrics great melody and vocals ozzy out dones himself on this whole album YOU ROCK OZZY!
