 With the superbowl exposing her breast she is now known for that which I don't know why but people are just that immature to judge someone just on one innocident.  Well I bought this album due on the single I heard " All Night(Don't Stop)." I was like yeah I'm feeling her on this album and I did. She's still her sexy self on some of the songs and others she just want to dance and fun such as "R&B Junkie" ,"Damita Jo", "Island Life, and "Just a Little While."  This album debut on the billboard charts at #2 it was certified platium.. Yeah I know she can be better than just 1x platuim while she ussualy averages 5x or 6 x platuim.. but it's ok we still love you Miss Jackson!  Money Well spent. This is one of the most underated albums of 2004
