 I bought this album after I heard the first two singles "Rich Girl" and "What are you waiting for." Which I did like both of them.  Then her powerful pop anthem "Hollaback Girl" boosted the sales of this great album "Hollaback Girl" did hit #1 of the billboard charts.  The singles arn't the only good songs on the album "Cool" is a great slow song which I heard is becoming a single soon, but The song "Bubble Gum Electric" gives u the spark to get up and get moving. I also like the songs "Luxiourous" and "Crash."  This album would be money well spent
