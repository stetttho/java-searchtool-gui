 With her first single "Stupid Girls" peaking at #13 on the Hot 100..  Is the weakest song on the album..  "Who Knew" a great emotional ground breaking rock track that other artists inspire to record.. Same with "Long Way To Happy"  "Nobody Knows" a beautiful ballad same with "Dear Mr. President" ft the Indigo Girls.. with her bashing the president's wacky ideas.. Pink defintely went back to some great RnB/Dance tracks such as "Cuz I Can" "I'm Not Dead" "U & Ur Hand" and "Leave Me Alone(I'm Lonely).  Then my favorite tracks "Runaway" which put goosebumps down my back.. P!nk is back!  Then "Conversations With My 13 Year Old Self" is defintely the best track on the album.
