 This album is great lyrical and musically.  The album starts off with the two rockers "Perry Manson" and "I Just Want You" then comes a great ballad that can knock you out in a heart beat "Ghost Behind My EYES."  I love the additional two rockers "Thunder Underground." with their ripping guitars and "Tommorrow" one of the only songs that ozzy screams on and it is so motivational it gives me goospumps!  I also like the song "Desire." And my favorite song on the album is the extra song and ballad on the album which is "Aimee."  This is an Ozzy Essential.
