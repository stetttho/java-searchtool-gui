 THis album shocked me and I was expecting the album to sell real good "Stripped" debut at #2 on the charts and was 3x platuim.  But her singles and songs still amaze me with her vocal ability.  Her first single "Dirty" is a great dance tune that just wants you to get up and get dancing.  Her next single "Fighter" was an anthem great song with vocal range good as Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. "Can't Hold Us Down" another great uptempo song.  Her biggest song was "Beutiful" which hit #1 for 12 weeks straight on the billboard charts. This is album has so many good songs with her beutiful voice of hers.  Such as "Soar" and "Infauation" which are both great songs. Other Stand out songs "Voice Within", "Make Over", "Cruz", and "Loving Me for Me" A great album you will love it in a heart beat!
