 I love Mudvayne their a great band with great singing, lyrics, guitars, and drumming.  The album fits well together and Their are some stand out songs such as "Determined","Happy?" and "Fall into Sleep" are my favorite songs on the album but I occasionly will listen to "Pushing Through" and "Just" this album is still great I just compare everything Mudvayne does to "LD.50" but still this album is still well worth your money.
