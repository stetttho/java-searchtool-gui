 This album set MJ as a standard not to do worse than this sadly he wasn't able to match "Thriller" but he was close a couple times.  He is a great artist in his own right and he was found innocent of all charges that he was accused of so their should be no harm.  Just listen to his music not to what the tabloids say or what the 5:00 news says "Thriller" is now close to 60 million copies world wide sold! MJ will never led up and hsi music will continue to sell that way it is becuase he is a musical genuis.  His music will soothe you in a way no one has ever had You would want to get up and dance like their is no tomorrow to MJ!
