 This game are for very series gamers or gamers that just love RPGs.  With the orginal of you fulfilling the nereverine prophecies you now get additional two stories to you being nerrevine.  Tribunal is probelly better than the Bloodmoon quests souly on the purpose that at the end of the quests when you go to kill Sotha Sil , alittle surprise comes with Alamexia and Tribunal fits more around the nerevaine then the Bloodmoon quests to me I can't wait untill Oblivion comes out.
