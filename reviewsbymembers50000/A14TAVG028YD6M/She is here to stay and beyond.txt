 Janet Jackson proved that 80's and 90's are not just were she had all of her hits.. All for You proved to the world !  Maybe not in sales but it was 2x platuim in the USA and sold around 5 millions copies world wide to date.. Well with "Doesn't Really Matter" hitting #1 for 3 weeks straight on the billboard charts showing she is the still a force to mess with!  Her second single and easily the song of the year 2000 "All for You" hit #1 for 7 weeks straight on the billboard charts. One of my favorite tunes "Someone to call my lover" peaked at #3 on the billboard charts.  But I also like the songs " You ain't right" and "Come on Get up" You won't go wrong with "All For You"
