 Yeah, we all remember how big the Beatles were, and now here are their biggest and best hits "I want to hold your hand " to the power house rock ballad "Hey Jude"  The John Lennon song "Come Together" a personal favorite of mine and Paul McCartney's "Let it Be" and Paul's "Get Back"  Help! I need somebody! Not Just Anybody! Helppp!  from their song "Help"  This is the collection to have if your a big Beatle's fan and you just want their biggest hits.   Other classics also "Penny Lane" "Day Tripper" "A Hard Day's Night" and "Yesterday"   This 27 track disc will show you a span over the Beatles whole career, of course their not all the hits but that will take many more discs at a higher price.   This is the Beatle disc for most of their hits.  Overall: 5/5
