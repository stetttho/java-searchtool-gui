 As the review written above , yeah make sure they are in the right order.  But these books are classics enjoyable for both kids and adults.  Also seems like they bring it out just in time for personally one of the best books "The lion,witch and the wardrobe"    Personally my favorite of the series is the "Last Battle"  all of the books are instant classics in fantasy and literature.
