 Now I like Rob Thomas 1999 smash hit with Sanatana" SMooth" Rob Thomas showed me on this album that he has great vocal and song writing ability and also shows what kind of music he likes personally. The album kicks off with " THis is how a Heart Breaks" which is my favorite song off the album.  THen with his nice ballad hit "Lonely No More" other songs I enjoy are "Fallin to Peices","When The Heartache Ends" and "All That I am" He is taltented and I except way better albums from him years to come good job Rob WE LOVE YOU!
