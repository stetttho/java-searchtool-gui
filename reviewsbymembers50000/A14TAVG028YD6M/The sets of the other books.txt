 To me in my opinion from reading "Order of the Pheonix" the 5th book and reading the "Half-Blood Prince" the 6th book, this book "Goblet Of Fire" sets tragic and drama mixed perfectly and sets standards for the 5th and 6th book that were amazingly well written. To me as she progressed she has gotten better in every book but the 4th book is what sets off for the great 6th book in my opinion is the best book of the series.
