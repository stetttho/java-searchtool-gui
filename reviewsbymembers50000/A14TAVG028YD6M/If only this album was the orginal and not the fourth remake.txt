 I like Madonna and Mariah Carey, I loved the Emancipation of Mimi the orginal but I am just disapointed in the fact that she will rerelease 3 other editions of her already very succesful Emancipation of Mimi.  If this album was the orginal or hell with the 2nd release we wouldn't care, but that face is it is the fourth!  Mariah u always say u care about the fans well, before u release ur next album dont make no more rereleases and maybe we wouldnt be calling u a fat cash cow.
