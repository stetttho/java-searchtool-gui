 Mariah Carey gives us a dual disc of her already multi platuim christmas album back in the 90's which to me is a great effort.  This is one of the best christmas albums you are going to find out there and you are going to want some good Christmas music over the holidays or a nice stocking stuffer, this is the disc to spend your Christmas season on!
