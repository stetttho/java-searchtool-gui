 This album was a great follow up to her self titled debut album.  This album has two great dance hits "I wanna dance with somebody ( WHo Loves ME)" and "So Emotional" which both hit #1 on the billboard charts.. I love the nice slow melodic song "Where do Brocken Hearts Go" and "Didn't We Almost had it all" which both also hite #1 on the billboard charts.  There is no filler on this album its hard to find an album with no filler that is mostly full of ballads that isn't a greatest hits but Whitney does it with her strong vocals and talent she proves herself as person who is going to stay in music for a long time to come..
