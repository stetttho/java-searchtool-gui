 I am Madonna fan, and this album put it over the top with 12 non-stop dancable songs Madonna keeps her fans on the dance floor with this one. Her new single "Hung Up" is a great currently at #7 on billboards hot 100.  The album is currently at #1 on billboard.  But enough of that the album is what is really important.  Even if ur not a Madonna fan this album is for you, "Sorry", "Jump", "Push" "Future Lovers" and "How High" are great songs that stand out.  "I love New York" have lyrics that are against Bush and it is also great song to just listen too.  Buy this album you will not regret it.
