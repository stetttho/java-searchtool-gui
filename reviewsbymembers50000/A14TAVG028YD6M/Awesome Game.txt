 The game has a great campagin, and the fact you can be jedi when you are doing well in a battle.  Also I like how they take right from the movies and put the certain heros or villians in those certains battles it makes the game much more like the movie and much more enjoyable to play.    The online play is great except I think they should have more lobbies open before the game but that is my opionion.  But I gave the game a four stars because it is great game to play but at some points can be frustrating and even boring.  But this game is a grat 3rd person shooter for any gamer.
