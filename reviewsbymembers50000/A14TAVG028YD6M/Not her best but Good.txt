 Ok this album I bought over the single" It's Like That" a good single that wants you to get up and dance.  Then the overplayed single "WE Belond Together" is now at #1 for it's fifth week. It took me awhile to get use to this album I do like the song" Shake it off" and " Say Somehtin" but thats about it She can do better than this and I believe in her ability to do better than what this album is.
