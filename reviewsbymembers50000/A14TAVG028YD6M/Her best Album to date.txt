 THis is better than "THis is not a Test" which I don't what she was thinking but this album is the album to get up and dance to. "Gossip Folks" great song and one her hit singles. "Work it" is her biggest song to date it hit #2 for 10 weeks... in my opion it should hti #1 oh well... the begging for this great album"Go to the Floor" great song gets you started for what she is gonna bring you in the album. "Bring the Pain" another great dance tune same with "Funky Fresh Dressed" "Slide" is a slow dance tune kinda like "1,2 step" I like the song "Pussy Cat " her song one men nice and slow same with "Nothing Out there for me." This is money well spent on Missy's best album I hope her new album "CookBook" will be just as good!
