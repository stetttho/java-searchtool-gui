 Ok she won little girls heart with her singles but with her scratching irrating lip-synching voice... She won't stay in the music scene for long due the fans will probelly throw her out of every place she goes and sings at.. Yeah the song " Peices Of Me" I hated but "Shadow" and "LaLa" are decent everything else can be put in a garbage can and be burned
