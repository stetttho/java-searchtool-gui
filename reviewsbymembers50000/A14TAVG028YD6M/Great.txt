 This movie is dark , suspensful and funny all in one.  With the beginning of Harry and his family.  With the twist of Ron's rat being Peter, and was the real one who betrayed Harry's parents.  And that snape was wrong after all, that Siruis Black was innocent all along.  I feel that this movie is the best of the three, besides the fact the 1st set up the whole series.
