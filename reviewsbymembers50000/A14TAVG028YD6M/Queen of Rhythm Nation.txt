 This album is considered her biggest album and I will give her credit for it to. Rhythm Nation 1814 hit #1 on the billboard charts for 4 weeks straight and was certified 6 x Platuim which means Approx.. in that time it sold around 6 million in the USA... but to date it sold close to 24 million world wide. The album set a WORLD RECORD.. She realeased 8 singles form this album and 7 of the singles hit TOP FIVE which no other artist was able to have 7 singles off one album and all of them hit TOP FIVE on the billboard charts, and 4 of those singles (Black Cat, Miss you Much, Escapade, and Love will never do) hit #1 on the billboard charts. Very good album this is ablum is like a mini greatest hits album. I recommend hit wise on album to choose are Rhythm Nation 1814, Control, Janet, Velvet Rope and All For you.. Until she releases a better greatest hits.. This is money well spent.
