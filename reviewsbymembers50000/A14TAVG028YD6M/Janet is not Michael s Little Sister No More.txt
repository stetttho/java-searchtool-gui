 On her first albums which were flops she comes out with an outstanding album. Control itself hit #1 for 2 weeks and was 5x platuim means it sold approx 5 million copies at its time in the USA and approx sold 18 million world wide to date. Well she tells you she wants to be in "Control" with her single" Control" which peaked at #5 on billboard charts. Her other big singles "Nasty", "What Have you done for me lately" "Let's Wait a While" and Pleasure Princaple". Which there all like little funk-pop hits leave u wanting more. Her #1 hit single from the album was "When I think of you." This album is fun and fantastic. This album is nice and short to keep you wanting more from the great Miss Jackson! She is no longer Michael's Little Sister She is right their with him!
