 This album delivers the sense of getting up dancing to the beat The title track "Goodies" hit #1 on the billboard charts and "1,2 step" and "Oh" both hit #2 on the billboard charts but these are not the  only good songs on the album.  The song "Thug style" is a nice little toon same with "Hot line " and "Pick up the Phone." I recommend this album to any who like R&B and dance music.
