 Yeah The remasterd remixed wasn't a very smart move of ozzy but he tried something new... and if u don't listen so deep into the song You hear him repeating the chorous in the back round but to occaisonal fan this is a good cd to buy. STand out tracks "Flying High Again" "Over the Mountain" "SATO" and "Diary of a MADMAN" Enjoy fellow METAL HEADS!
