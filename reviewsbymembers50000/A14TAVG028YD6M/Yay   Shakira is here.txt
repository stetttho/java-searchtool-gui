 Shakira sings english on this album and her lastest single and music video is "Don't Bother" of course a latin tune.  This to me is not as good as vol. 1 but the soul purpose she sings in english on this album is gonna make people want to buy it even more.    The songs that appear on this album that were also on the previous album vol.1 are "Something" and "The Day and the Time" other great songs on the album include.  "Hey You", "Illegal" which features Carlos Santana, and "Animal City"
