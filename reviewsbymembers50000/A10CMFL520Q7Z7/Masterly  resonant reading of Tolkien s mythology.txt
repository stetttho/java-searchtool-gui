 Martin Shaw, in a rich and resonant reading brings Tolkien's history of  the Elder Days to life as if it were part of a long oral tradition. The  vast canvas of the Silmarillion is vividly brought to life from the  grandeur of the Music of the Ainur to the  horror of the treason and fall  of Numenor. Most of all, the sense of tragic beauty is fully brought out.  Highly recommended.
