 The West Wing is about the best thing on UK TV. It is great drama, with excellent characters, absorbing story lines and a sense of humour. If only real politics were the same. There are few other things that make me look forward to Sunday evenings (current airing time in England). The first half of series 1 is already available in the UK on region 2 DVD with the rest out later this month... My wife and I watched the lot in only 3 sittings: we had to ration ourselves so as not to watch it all at once, although it was tempting.
