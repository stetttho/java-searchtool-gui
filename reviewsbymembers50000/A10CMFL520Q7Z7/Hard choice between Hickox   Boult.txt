 As one of the earlier reviewers has said, this is not a standard operatic or choral work but a "morality" (as RVW described it) having a more ritualistic character than opera. Having seen one of the Royal Opera's semi-staged performances of this work which Hickox conducted prior to the recording, it seemed to me that RVW's confidence in the piece as having a theatrical element amply justified. This is a wonderful recording and, as much as I love the old Boult recording, and its great spiritual quality, I find myself returning frequently to Hickox's greater urgency and the marvellous central performance of Gerald Finley as the Pilgrim. He comes over on disk as vividly as he portrayed the role on stage. This is not a replacement for the Boult but complementary to it. Buy both. I am much looking forward to the Hickox recording of "Sir John in Love".
