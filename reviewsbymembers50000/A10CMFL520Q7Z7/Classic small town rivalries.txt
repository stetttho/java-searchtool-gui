 This TV dramatisation is a superb realisation of the intense and grand rivalries of the two would-be leaders of small town society in the 1920s world of Tilling, poking fun at pretension and social rivalry. It is  difficult to believe that the leading roles of Mapp, Lucia and Georgie  could be better cast and the supporting roles all bring joy. Au reservoir.
