 Amongst the wonderful "News from Lake Wobegon" collections, this  stands high as a personal favourite. Apart from the classic "Lving  Flag" and "Tomato Butt", "The Tollefson Boy goes to  College" and "Mrs Berge and the Schubert Carillon Piano"  [with brilliant impersonations of the carillon piano] are strong, mixing  acute observation of the humour, tedium and sadness of everyday life with  just enough exaggeration to provide comic relief.
