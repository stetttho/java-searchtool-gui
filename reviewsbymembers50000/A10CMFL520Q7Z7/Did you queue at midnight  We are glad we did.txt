 Order of the Phoenix was a brilliant read and an improvement on the Goblet of Fire, which needed better editing. Although the formula is still there (Start at the Dursleys, end of school year defeat of Voldemort) the elements have been well varied and a pleasing additional amount of back story included. The characters are more complex and Harry (who seems to be angry for a large part of the book) is growing, as he realises that his view of his father (and his hatred of Snape) needs to be reappraised. The story continues the darkening of tone begun in Azkaban and the wizarding world is now a more complex and political place than it may have seemed in the first few books. It is good to see the characters growing up and their perspectives adjusting. Although the writing style is still two-dimensional, the story and ideas made the book impossible to put down. JK Rowling has done amazingly well to come up with another book in this series which maintains such a hold on the reader. We are now reading it again. (PS contrary to the first reviews on BBC's Today programme, we thought the story got off to a gripping start, with a couple of surprises in the first 2 chapters.)
