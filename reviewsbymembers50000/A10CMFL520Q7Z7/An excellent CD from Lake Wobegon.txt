 This CD had me laughing out loud especially the story  "Homecoming" which involves the confrontation between the Lake  Wobegon homecoming parade (headed by a tank - of course) and a truck with a  different type of tank - a septic one. In terms of big comic set pieces, I  don't think GK has bettered this one (not even the classic "Living  Flag")
