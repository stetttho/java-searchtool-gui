 Colin Davis directs the definitive performance of the Midsummer Marriage. Based on Covent Garden's second production of the Opera (it give the premiere), it is a performance which throughout communicates with huge conviction, intensity and Tippett's strange but compelling modern myth. If you treat the story as a mixture of "the Magic Flute", "The Tempsest", English folk tales and a 1950s domestic drama, you won't be far off. Singers, chorus, orchestra and most of all, Sir Colin Davis, leave one with no doubts about the greatness and universality of this work. Having bought the LPs (on Phillips) many years ago, the release by Lyrita on CD was greatly welcome. Highlights are difficult to choose in such a wonderful recording, but try Sosostris' aria in the last Act, Mark's Act I aria and the climax of Act III in the final ritual dance where Mark & Jennifer are mystically transfigured to music of power, not to mention considerable vocal vigour. Outstanding.
