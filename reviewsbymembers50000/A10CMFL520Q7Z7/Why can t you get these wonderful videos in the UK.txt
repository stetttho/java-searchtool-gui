 A wondeful successor to the first series of Mapp & Lucia, dramatising the later Mapp & Lucia books. As with the first series, the cast could not be bettered and the various comic episodes of rivalry between Tilling's  two grande dames are brilliantly realised. The ceremony of the dedication  of the organ and the local election are particular favourites. I just don't  know why we can't get these in the UK and have to invest in NTSC video  players...
