 The programmes are a good guide to some relatively recent discoveries in Egypt, which tend not to get air time otherwise. The photography is excellent and the subject matter interesting and well chosen. The Tomb of the Sons of Ramesses II, the boat graves of Abydos, the "Golden Mummies" of the Ptolemaic period, the restoration of Hatshepsut's mortuary temple etc. I would easily have given the DVDs 5 stars, but the narrative by Peter Woodward is a too theatrical and exaggerated in places, and it becomes a little wearing after a while. It didn't need to be quite so hammed up in order to maintain interest - contrast it, for example, with the more "natural" account given by Dr Kent Weeks of his discovery and continuing excavation of the tomb of the sons of Ramessess II (KV5) which is fascinating without being exaggerated. However, this is a small criticism for an otherwise excellent production.
