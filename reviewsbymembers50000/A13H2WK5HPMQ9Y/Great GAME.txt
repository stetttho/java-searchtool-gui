 i'm not into RPG games but when i got Legend of Mana, i was instantly hooked!!  it's slow at first but then things get rolling along.  i eventually got the strategy guide which helped but you can do without it.  i recommend this game highly especially for those who aren't RPG fans. graphics are beautiful and the music gets really repetitive. i love the fact that i get to have pets who help in the adventures.  they're eggs at first which you will find along your adventures and you hatch them and raise them to fight with you.
