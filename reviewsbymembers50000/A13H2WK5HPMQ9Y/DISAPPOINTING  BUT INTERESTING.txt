 I read The Alchemist by the same author, which, i liked very much and so i was very excited to read more of his books.  I read the Pilgrimage next and found it disappointing and lacking the surrealism and mysticism that made me crave for more.  The story is interesting in that it's about the author's pilgrimage.  I found it long and almost tedious to read through his journey, feelings, and thoughts.  I was relieved to have finished it.  The good thing about having read this book is it made me want to take the pilgrimage as well - not for any soul seraching purpose but for travel and adventure.  I think it would an interesting guide - comparing sites, thoughts and feelings.
