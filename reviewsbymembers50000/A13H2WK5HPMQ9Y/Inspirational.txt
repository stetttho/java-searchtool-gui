 I highly recommend this book to all aspiring architects and those who have an interest in architecture, history, and Italy.  The book is well written - balancing techincal information (regarding construction and invention), historical background, and biography.  The author sets the reader back in the Renaissance with his description of Florence during the erection of the Santa Maria Del Fiore.  His words almost paints a vivid landscape that transports you back in time to Renaissance Florence. After having read it, I not only want to read it again but return to Italy and see the details and methods as described in the book. This would be a great book for any architecture enthusiast or young aspiring architect.
