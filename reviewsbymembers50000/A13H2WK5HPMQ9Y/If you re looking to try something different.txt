 i was in a music store and wanted to buy some CD.  i was already holding a copy of the soundtrack for Lock, Stock, and two Smoking Barrels (great sndtrk by the way).  i was browsing around the techno section.  i'm not a  big fan of the category  but i guess it depends on where it came from.   anyways, so i'm browsing and this CD caught my eye - it said it had 3D  sound quality.  i thought that was cool and decided to try it out.  well,  despite the lack of 3D sound quality (maybe my stereo isn't equipped), i  really liked the CD.  its a bit mellow for what i thought techno music was  about.  i would even go as far as saying it was dream-like.  if you like  the techno version of x-files, then you'll like this CD.
