 I'm planning a trip to Morocco and have done my own research and reading before I came upon this book.  This book just adds to the amount of information that i have alread accumilated and then some more.  The book is a great resource in the sense that it give potential visitors to Morocco an initial idea of travelling to such an incredible country, and/or giving pointers and passing along experiences of other travellers who are passionate about Morocco.   I found the voice of Barrie to be nurturing and encouraging, and her knowledge is not only based on self experience but experiences of accomplished writers who have travelled to Morocco. This book is by no means the only book one should rely on and even Barrie makes that clear in the beginning.  She encourages one (if they are serious about travelling to Morocco and this applies to travel to any country) to research the culture and history, become acquainted with the country.  I agree with her.  It makes a lot of sense and it is/will be beneficiary to your experiences to by enjoyable. The book also contains a bit of information of places to stay (majority of them being the higher end category), places to eat, shop, etc.  I have used these information as guidelines to do further inquiry on my own. I strongly recommend this book for potential travellers to Morocco, and even those who wish to go but can't (for whatever reasons).
