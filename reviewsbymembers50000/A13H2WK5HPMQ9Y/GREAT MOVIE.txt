 This movie is full of SUSPENCE, EXCITEMENT, AND BEAUTIFUL SCENES OF ITALY!!  This movie had me at the edge of my seat when i saw it in the theaters.  I loved it so much I bought it on DVD.  And for all you fans of Jude Law - you know it's something to add to your collection.  And even if you're not, this movie has a great story with lots of plots and twists that will definitely entertain to you for a long time.
