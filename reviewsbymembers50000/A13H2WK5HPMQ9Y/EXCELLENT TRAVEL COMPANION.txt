 The first time I went to Italy I only had this travel book with me.  In fact, I don't think you need any other book when you visit this beautiful city.  It's got pictures, maps, description, history, and guide for where to stay, eat, shop - depending on your budget.  I spent four days and three nights sightseeing by myself in Venice - and it was great and exciting!!  The guide was very helpful in helping navigate through the city's winding streets.  Then again, there are signs posted everywhere on how to get to the main sites.  The street names were also well posted.  In fact, I used Eyewitness' map in the back of this book to plan my trip and visits to sites.  It's a very durable book and will hold up in your normal wear 'n' tear during your travels.  I went back the second time and only relied on this book.  There's no need for any other guide.!!
