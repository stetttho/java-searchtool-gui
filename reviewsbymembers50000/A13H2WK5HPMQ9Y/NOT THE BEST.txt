 What can i say?  I've read better books.  Also, this book does not compare with Bram Stoker's Dracula.  One of the reviewers for that book said this book is one of the first books written in a similar gothis style such as Frankenstein and Dracula.  I didn't read Frankenstein but I did read Dracula and Murcheston can not compare. I found the narrative dull and predictable.  I didn't feel sorry for any of the characters.  There werewolf scenes are not noteworthy or refreshing.  I was very disappointed. I read The Passion by Donna Boyd and even though I didn't love the book, The Passion has a much better story to tell than this one.  The idea of the werewolf was at least a little more refreshing.  anyways, if you do insist on purchasing this book, get the paperback - it's cheaper.
