 This is a must have for all travellers.  It's small and it's got all the phrases you ever need when travelling abroad.  It was a handy little book when I travelled to Italy.  The sections are labelled and laid out for easy access and search.  It's not cumbersome or heavy.  You can stick this in the back of your pants pocket.  It also has a durable cover so you can chuck it anywhere in your luggage.  And it's cheap!!
