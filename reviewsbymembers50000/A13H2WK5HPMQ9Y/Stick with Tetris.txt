 I'm a fan of the arcade game "Rampage" so when i saw they had made a puzzle game for "Rampage", I was abit skeptical that it was anything like Tetris (and I love Tetris).  I got myself a copy and not to my surprise, i was very unimpressed.  The game itself is unchallenging and not as intense as Tetris.  The premise of the game is also silly if not lacking.  It's basically a puzzle game using characters from the popular "Rampage".  Although you get to choose your characters, it does not effect the gameplay at all.  And like the Playstation version, you are allowed to retreive saved games with passwords.  However, unlike the PS version, the password is very long. I didn't give it a one star because younger kids may like this game.  Like i had mentioned before, it's not all that challenging.  Although it might be for younger audiences.
