 Who doesn't love the Simpsons? I certainly do!! I watch all their episodes (new and old). And what's not to love about them? They're silly, funny, and witty!! I can't say i'm a big Simpsons fan but i am a fan none the less so when i saw they had a wrestling game for playstation, i said i had to get this game!! Well, like some of the Simpsons episodes, this game was disappointing. it wasn't all that interesting and the wrestling moves, i thought, were limited. and it's a very easy game to beat but then again, some of you might like that. In any case, it was still fun for an unchanllenging game. It was only fun for about 10 minutes. I wouldn't recommend this game at all unless you like simple fighting games. And if you are a Simpsons fan, you'll get it anyway regardless whether the game isn't all that.
