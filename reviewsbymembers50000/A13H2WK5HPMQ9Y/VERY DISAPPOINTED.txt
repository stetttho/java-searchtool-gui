 Unlike the other reviews, i was very disappointed with the game. I was very excited the the game game out.  Love the cartoon series.  I made the mistake of purchasing it before testing it on a rental.   I thought it moved too slowly and the battles with other digimon was unstimulating.  The only good thing i can say about the game are the graphics are excellent and the sound FX are okay.  Rent this game if you can before you purchase it - just in case you do'nt like it.
