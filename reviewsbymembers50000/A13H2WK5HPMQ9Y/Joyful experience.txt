 This is a great book!!  I've been doing origami since i was a kid.  i can't say that i'm a pro at it but i try my best to accomplish the folds.  I bought this book a while ago.  I looked through it and thought these were too complicated so i put it away.  It wasn't until recently that i looked thru the book again and tried a box.  Then next thing i knew i was making one box a day.  It was a lot of fun!!  It may look difficult but it really isn't.  I wouldn't recommend this book to beginners.
