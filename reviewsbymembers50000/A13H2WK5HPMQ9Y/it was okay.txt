 The book is good in it's content that it is a romantic, erotic, thriller about werewolves.  For those of you who are fans of the werewolf genre whether romantic or killers, this book serves it's basic purpose.  However, I did find it a bit long and drawn out in the descriptions of the scene/situation.  I found myself skimming through to the next interesting event.  Also, the dialog between characters were a bit too far and in between (hence, the skimming).  In any case, I think this book will suffice in satifying any who have a thirst for werewolf tales.  And now that this book is offered in paperback, it's worth it.  I bought the hardcover!!
