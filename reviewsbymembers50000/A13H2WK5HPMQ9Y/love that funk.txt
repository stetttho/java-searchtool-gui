 if you saw the movie and loved, then this CD is for you.  if you like funk street music, then this CD is for you.  if you just appreciate james brown and the mellow sounds of funk with a bit of techno, then this CD is for  you.    i saw the movie and loved it!!  it was a fun movie to watch - had  me sitting at the edge of my seat with anxiousness and anticipation.  the  soundtrack worked really well with the movie especially the first music in  the movie by E-Z Roller.
