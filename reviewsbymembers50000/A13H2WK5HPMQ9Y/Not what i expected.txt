 i was very excited to read the book.  it was recommended as another author that is similar to nick bantock.  also, it was about morocco and i am interested in travelling to morroco.  in fact, i'm currently planning a trip in the fall.   the story started out interestingly enough with the heroine, lydia, and her travelling companion, chris describing themselves and their journey to and within morroco.  the story was written in a journal entry fashion with collected material pasted along the side.  i don't want to say too much about the story content for those who are interested in purchasing the book but i can tell you that the book does begin interesting and then lures you bit by bit and slowly with exotic mystery and intrigue.  and then it snatches you with a sudden turn and you're left with excitement, thrill, and a bigger mystery.  at least that was how i felt.  the book almost had me at the edge of my seat.  in  fact, i didn't want to put the book down - i wanted to find out what happened, or what's going to happen. well, to say the least, i was disappointed when i finished the book.  the story began to lose interest for me after chris had taken over the journal - for reasons i won't give away for those who are still interested in purchasing the book. and the ending was just a horrible cliff hanger.  maybe that was the author's intention - if it was, i was very disappointed. also, this book is in no way comparative with nick bantock.  his stories are more sophisticated and the sense of mystery and fascination is very well captured in his words.  also, graphically, nick bantock is just amazing.  although the art work is in 2-D, it feels 3 dimensional.  i love his use of layers and materials in his graphic composition to create that extra depth in the story telling.
