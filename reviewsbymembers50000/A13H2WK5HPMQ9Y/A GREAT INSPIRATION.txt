 It's not a guide book per say as others by Cadogan or Lonely Planet.  However it is a beautiful book full of gorgeous colorful pictures of Morocco.  For those who are interested in travelling to Morocco, I'd recommend that you pick up this book or even look through it at your local bookstore.  The pictures are very selective in what they want to show you of Morocco but very alluring!!  I'm currently planning a trip to the mystical country and have used this book as a source - where to go and stay.  The descriptions are brief but the pictures says it all!! In fact, I think it's safe to say that the pictures is this book are so beautful that even if you never thought about going to Morocco, the pictures will surely inspire to take that trip someday. Happy reading and travelling!!
