 One of my first games for the GBA and i have to say this one is the best out of the other popular racing games that is out for GBA.  It's fun and cute.  I can't say that it's hours of continuous fun but i enjoy it when i do play the game.  what's great about this game is you don't have to stick to only one character while racing.  you can choose different racers.  you can also save your races and continue another time.  it's a relatively simple game with a simple objective - win all the races and be number one!!
