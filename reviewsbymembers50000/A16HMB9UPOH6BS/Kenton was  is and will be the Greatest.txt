 When I was a Senior in Oak Ridge Hi School, Stan Kenton came to Whittle Springs in Knoxville! All of the Hood, Dolan & Hamrick Crew wished to hear such an Awesome Band of 5 humongeous Saxes, 5 tremendous Trombones plus 5 Reknown Hi-floating Trumpets! They also included Eddie Safranski as Bassist & Shelly Mannes as the Drummer par-excellance! That was the original sound of the Late 1940's. The most awesome, ad-libbing, creative, outstanding to say the least, likely the most Melifilous, Tremendous Crew ever to be assembled.    Upon hearing Jazz played in the late 40's, unlike this sound of today's CD of KENTON HI-FI we missed that super digital stereo update of "Artistry in Rhythm, Colaboration, Painted Rhythm, and Peanut Vendor with the different Trombones: Carl Fontana, Milt Berhart, alongside Hi-floating Trumpets like Pete Candoli and Maynard Fergusion! The great arrangements of Stan Kenton & Pete Rugolo leave an indescribable taste for hearing all of the fine-tuned transitions between Saxophone Sections and the Brass Men, blowing the roof-off with their screaming Hi-tones above those Latin-American Percussion rhythms.    Needless to add more of this perspective from my 50yr history of being immersed in Church and Classical Music, into becoming once again...An old Jazz Student as today's Church Musician!
