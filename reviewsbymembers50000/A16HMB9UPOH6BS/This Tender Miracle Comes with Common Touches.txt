 My wife and I watch wide varieties of epic drama, humor, musical and far too many violent dramas like Braveheart! This simple but profound story based upon the 12 yr old Mexican lad is greatly contrasted with all the others yet soon reaches out to tug at  the heart! Peter Fonda is the cooler counter-part for his sister Jane. Yet so keenly fitted as the low-key Catholic Priest and care-giver for young Jose` who slowly encounters a Helper for his dog and himself! I thought Ruben Blades and Mare Winningham were great drama fill-ins for contrasting their fascinating  stories alongside the Latino flavor of Jose. What a wonderfully spinning out of this simple but beautiful ending surprisingly wrapped-up for Mystery. We were Awed with Salma Hayek as first-time Director! Another Big Plus for retiree Chaplain Fred W Hood
