 First, "Caldonia... CALDONIA! What makes yo Big Head So Hard?"  With some loudly added Shouts thrown in! As an aspiring trombone-man in Oak Ridge High School Stage Band, I came upon those first Big Bands: Benny Goodman, Glen Gray, Les Brown, then Stan Kenton!  We only went out so far to hear last 2 at Whittle Springs in  Knoxville. Then Vido Musso, Italiano, Pete Candoli, screaming 1st Trumpet, Bill Harris, laid-back, older-looked sophisticated creative-jamming in long phrases each good for 16 bars of loud, Wowed ad-libbing!    If there was a female vocalist, she tried her best to copy June Christy! The head-man himself, Woody Herman could out-croon yust like Frances Wayne & Mary Ann McCall. All-in-all, I believe that I can hear some of these standards, without touching the needle or clicking the CD: "Laura is a face in the misty night; BLOWIN' UP A STORM! APPLE HONEY; EVERYWHERE and NORTHWEST PASSAGE!"   All of these include Solo Riffs, by Woody Herman, Pete Candoli, Vido Musso, and the awesome Bill Harris! Often when I travel it becomes a joy to  take along those standards of DUKE, Satchmo Armstrong, Stan Kenton, or Woody Herman!    What a way to go anywhere and/or EVERYWHERE!
