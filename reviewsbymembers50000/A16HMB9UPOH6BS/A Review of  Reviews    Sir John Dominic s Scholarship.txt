 I was totally impressed, yet without any surprise at such varied reviews by Grimm, Loftus, Wallis! I must compare them with my own intro to Sir John Dominic's Lecture, at All-Saints few weeks ago.    The congregation in Downtown Atlanta was hushed, seemingly awed as I was by his thorough-going coverage of "Conflicts of a Roman Empire with Judaism; next into "What Jesus learned from John the Baptizer; finally arriving to testify about his, "Personal Faith in Jesus the Christ, as Redeemer, the Forgiver of sins, and as  the Divine Healer.  After his Personal Faith, JDC made a Personal conjecture of his belief as to Paul's most Authentic Episles...I was troubled to hear his 13 most oft' included to be written by St.Paul, he only believed 7 of the 13 were actually written by the Apostle Paul! It went against my belief in the manuscripts of Ephesians and Colossians, when he excluded both from his inspired list.(p.105-106)   No comfort from comparison with a few N.T. scholars in Southern Baptist Seminary released in 1957; One who ended-up teaching in University of Chicago, others in small Baptist Universities!    My great respect of JDC's Scholarship is boundlessly increased by his "Excavating Jesus," and "THE HISTORICAL JESUS!" In both he affirmed his personal Faith in one Lord, One Faith, and no Jew or Gentile, Slave or Free are Limited From his Christology in the Redeemer, Forgiver, Healer found in the HISTORICAL JESUS!
