 Two great books were first printed in 1978: Overhearing the Gospel, by Fred Craddock and The Prophetic Imagination, by Walter Brueggemann. Although it took me 13 years to become familiar with either one, they were both worth the waiting! I cannot remember when I heard Dr. Craddock tell the story of gathering the fallen stars in the backyard of his home and storing them in his Grandma's clothes basket; But this story is placed in poignant conclusion to his first chapter: "Concerning Method." Anyone familiar with reading Kierkegaard knows that it requires telling a good story for a parallel metaphor!  Unusual as it seems for Craddock, he focuses upon the quote by Kierkegaard: "There is a lack of understanding in the land...a something which the one cannot directly communicate to the other." This quote is stated at the beginng of each chapter: Concerning the Listener; Concerning the Teller; Concerning the Story. As only Dr. Craddock can do, the quote is used as a large part of the foundation for each chapter. This does not appear to be true for any other Craddock or Brueggemann book! In chapter 4 on Concerning the Story, Craddock touches the peak with, "Stories of Abraham, the Exodus, of Moses, of David..." Again quoting Kierkegaard, which is for me a reminder of Brueggemann. Two pages later he refers to S. K. having "recaptured beautifully this characteristic of the Bible to make one point at a time, with no anxiety about harmony, balance and symmetry!" (Bruegge again.)  When he describes the communicators of the Christian faith with words such as intensity, discipline, passion, pathos, he is also reminding me of the ways in which both he and Prof Bruegge communicate. After 40 years since Seminary, I have been searching for such a clearly understandable, thoughtful and inspiring book to motivate preaching. Eureka! I finally found it!   Retired Chaplain Fred W.
