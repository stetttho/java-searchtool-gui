 One recent Sunday afternoon Barbara and I were astounded to hear this gravelly, raspy-voiced old Author-Poet-Rabbi, speaking with John Hockenberry! On NPR's "Infinite Mind" he recited: "When I look behind /as I'm compelled to look /before I can gather my strength /to proceed on my journey /I see milestones dwindling toward the horizon...." Afterwards, he added such unforgettable words as: "How shall the heart be reconciled to its feast of losses?" Hearing those lines I arrived at an awesome Point-in-Time, where I still hear his opening lines of "The Layers."   "I have walked through many lives, /some of them my own, /and I am not who I was..."   From some deeply mystical, inward urging, I identified my recent personal milestone, of reaching seventy-five years! "One Prophet-Poet, who sounds like a Wisdom/Rabbi...reminds me to get writing my oft' postponed autobiographical Reflections!   Only after repeating these opening lines of "The Layers" to some dear friends, did I muster-up the courage to begin writing and  reflecting upon my autobiograpic repetion of challenging events from my third-grade school years into my Senior year of ORHS, to marriage and birth of two daughers, etc.     Hooray, for this challenging, Infinte mind-boggeling, divinely inspired Author-Prophet-Poet, Stanley Kunitz. Loving God, May his Tribe increase along with these other inspired reviewers! From an older, Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
