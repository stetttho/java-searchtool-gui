 Since I hope to soon have the privilege of hearing Prof Molly Marshall, I look forward to her CD of lectures on this fitting title! When I glanced thru her descriptive Chap. headings I was captivated by what she promised in her organized sequencial progress toward the goal as any good Professor/Writer.  She had me neatly hooked by "Recovering the Spirit; Vivifying All Creation; Gathering a People; Empowering the Christ; Chap 6, Transforming Unfinished Presence!" I caught onto her interesting style of writing with stories in first chapter of her classes in Systematic Theology! That itself is a huge challenge for any seminary professor. No doubt after a few years, she is surely prepared to become Presiding Professor of Central Baptist Seminary!      "The purpose of this book is to reconfigure the sphere and character of the Spirit's action in order to provide a more holistic pneumatology." What a play on words: "holistic and pneuma." (Greek for spirit!) I wonder how long she spent writing that sentence?   Professor Marshall brings us gently into an understanding of "perichoresis." With her keen insights and simple description: "That relationship of mutuality in which persons draw their identity from being related to others. It is an ecstatic dance in which the Trinitarian persons literally 'stand outside  themselves' as they evoke a life of their divine counterparts." Up steps her neatly worded footnote *30!     As most every chapter she begins chapter 1 with 55 footnotes! In my 2nd favorite chapter 6, she quotes Prof Walter Brueggemann as observing the recurring theme of God's face, present but hidden, shows Israel's ambivalence about knowing by "seeing." Not only has Prof Marshall adequately done her homework, it seems she has made habits of some prominent theologians: "Never having too much research!" She listed 17 pages of Bibliography, with much emphasis upon Profs John A.T. Robinson, Dale Moody, Wayne Oates, Frank Stagg, Sallie McFague, J. Moltmann, Pannenberg, Marcus Borg,adding Walter Brueggemann and Elizabeth Johnson! What an awesome listing of distinguished, notable, respectable sources!         I give my tributes to this lady's thoroughly documented and divinely inspired writing!  Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
