 Hardy Clemons is a seasoned pastor & leader of the Co-operative Baptist Fellowship. In his two pastorates of Austin, Texas and Greenville, S.C. he has endeared himself to hundreds of persons who have entered the portals of grieving. He relates his own journey with close friends through the process of grieving.  In reading this short, simple, yet profound little book, those who deal with grief are likely to discover new approaches from Hardy Clemons' stories. He does not write with complex terms, but uses illustrations from the lives of his friends and his own 'balcony people' like Wayne Oates, John Claypool, Fred Craddock and Grady Nutt. He describes his own personal grief in the losses of these intimate friends, all noteable ministers. He concludes his stories with the issue of 'growing through your grief.' He makes use of scripture, poetry and words from his 'balcony people' like Carlyle Marney and C. S. Lewis. His final chapter appropriately, lists pass!ages of scripture which fitly summarize his approach. Several close friends have found this little gem to be valuable in helping them face their grief.
