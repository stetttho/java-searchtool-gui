 When my wife and I look for unique movies we are quite often  disappointed! But on occasion we strike it rich. For our first night, I was a bit too tired to stay awake thru thirty minutes, but she stayed with it for over half. The next evening we both finished it with an absorbing interest... Yet we had questions about the length of timing from the beginning in Oxford all the way thru Ganeesh getting married to writing his first book, the dabbling with politics, becoming a famous healer, then his fame as author and political figure leading him back to Oxford.   We commented on the good acting, the scenery of Trinidad, their cultures and great contrasts with England and India. Yet we still had questions about the central personalities and the unique images of their change from "country-like common people" who suddenly matured into readers with a quickly developed background to give them remarkable powers of healing, judgment and wisdom. All in all, I have a temptation to pass the movie off to three friends who might have some interest in suggested  Theology of their Hindu thinking about the spiritual gifts of Pundit in his ability to heal both body and spirit!   It may well be that leaving the story open-ended was intentional with potential results of allowing more questions for discussion and word-of-mouth advertising of such an engrossing story!
