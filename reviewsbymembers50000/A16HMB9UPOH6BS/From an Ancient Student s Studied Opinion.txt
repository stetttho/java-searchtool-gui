 After been loaned this issue of June 2004, by a committed, really genuine Episcopalian, I was greatly impressed! These creative, unique articles captured my Imagination: "What is Power?" by Sam Keen; "Taking the First Step" by Anna Lappe`; "Accessing Sacred Energy," by Judith Orloff, MD; "The Making of a Chaplain" By Karen O'Brien (So like the pages of my earlier Verbatim in CPE).   "The Best Spiritual Books" are reviews of 50 out of 300 books by Fred and Mary Ann Brussat! We surely agreed on the first few named: "The Heart of Christianity" Marcus Borg; "Beyond Belief" Elaine Pagels; "The Wisdom Way of Knowing" Cynthia Bourgeault; ++ "The Lord is My Shepherd" Rabbi Kushner+ "The Power of Patience" by M J Ryan!    I am still in the whirlwind of those emotionally stimulating, artistically written articles on varied yet potent topics of food for Thought and Reflection. Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
