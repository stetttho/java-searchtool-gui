 We hoped to renew our faith in older versions of 1940's & 1950's grand old Musicales! You know like, "A Star is Born, "Porgy and Bess, "The Wizard of OZ, even "Yentl!" Then we were astonished to hear Kevin Spacey sing adding a little soft-shoe dancing! All of that was helpful entertainment, to help digest a delightful  Gourmet Dinner! Yet after they had introduced the main actors, in deciding that Kevin Spacey was not too old to be Bobby Darin--"It all went downhill for me!"     My patient mate, caught-up with such a gripping story, stayed with it, until after I finished the dishes, peeking-in on Bobby gulping down his Pills and Sandra Dee staying too long with the Bottle, I gave up for the computer, to hit the sack too early!    Now for the story time-line, it was obvious, like too many great musicians: Dinah Washington, Judy Garland, Ray Charles, Marilyn Monroe! I had gotten my fill of those all too often outcomes, before throwing in the towel... wasting a valued Life of Talent!Even awarding this monstrosity 2,3, or 4 stars! Well let's be generous...leave it at 3+ or 4! But, Hooray for Kevin Spacey in filling three roles as Actor, Singer ++ Director! from a Hood. Retired Prison Chaplain, Fred W Hood
