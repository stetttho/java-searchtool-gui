 Within all of these multiple offerings of diversity and scolding I choose the more recent one of July with 199 + Positive Devon-TT, All-Inclusive, Majoring upon Prof K's use of the Term Social Compact! I keenly looked for his quotes to see if he noted Sir- G.K. commenting on what he thought upon at the Latrine: "Niagra Falls!" Of course, we may all agree that Mr. K is one more of a growing number of humorous creative genuises, that may likely do an impression of Robin Williams, spinning out an on-the-spot One Act Comedy! My thots fly anywhere towards Jim Carey, Bill Cosby, George Carlin and Jonathan Winters! I jump at every opportunity to hear G.K. on the Writer's Almanac & Prairie Home Companion! He appears to be all of an awesomely honest, truthfully tuned-up Comedian, Artist, Singer, Writer, plus also he seems-to-be one really, Authentic Person!  Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
