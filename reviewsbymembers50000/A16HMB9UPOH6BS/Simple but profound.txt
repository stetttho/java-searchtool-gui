 Father Donahue writes as though his words sound like he speaks! If true, that re-emphasizes his interesting way of using words. His headings as Parable as Text; Parable in Context; Literary Context; Theological Contest, keep his commentary in focus. Most of his footnotes are brief and pointed, except for the longest, "Excursus on the Ministry of Women" from Elisabeth S. Fiorenza. He relies strongly upon C. H. Dodd, J. D. Crossan, J. Fitzmyer, and Jeremias. Following a long Bibliography there are helpful Indexes of Parables, Citations, and Authors.  All-in-all my current interest in "Preaching Parables" places this simple yet profound text alongside A. J. Hultgren, who is more recently published. Donahue is motivator to consult further with Crossan, Dodd, etc. May it become deservedly popular.
