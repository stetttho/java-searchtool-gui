 Second Edition with a new Intro! The one thing Sir Walter excels upon, when beginning any book, class and/or sermon! In my older copy from 1978, his Intro was written from Eden Seminary. Then he names his wife, Mary, "as one who ministers in prophetic ways." Not only then but surely does in their retirement. Again he comments on numerous Sisters who have been ordained to the Ministry.        Sir Walter recently spoke at the Wheat Street Church for annual Preaching Celebration. His reader & liturgist was Murphy Davis, wife of Emory Prof, Ed Loring. Bruegge knew enough about their Ministry out of their Home, the Open Door on Ponce deLeon, to speak of them as being prophetic ministers with indigents, prisoners, and homeless! All GA Chaplains know of Murphy and Ed as ones who put feet to their prayers.     Better not to miss that note in one of Bruegge's early Chapters on Prophetic Energizing! "Energizing is closely linked to hope." Another quote: "The newness from God is the only serious source of Energy... prophets are not to underestimate his or her urgent calling as no other source of newness." Like class, he launches into the next chapter, by mapping out texts, issues, resources, metaphors for a prophetic imagination!    Just as in my first reading 4 years ago, I agree with that first conclusion: "This book has far too much to digest, simply being  a reminder for getting into his best classic, alongside heavy  commentaries for teaching perennial students. Another Hooray!  ...Retired Chap Fred W Hood
