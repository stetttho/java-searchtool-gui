 Having read all of St. John's creative priestly, pastorale, even preachable Books, I place his late book of Parables, at the top with THE HOPEFUL HEART! Now that John is already at home in  his familiar "Great-Not-Yet," He may see his reviews at one Glance.   Compared to his admired CS Lewis, in use of adverbs: From a most-quoted, FOUR LOVES, Lewis used 36 active adverbs in his early 6 pages! Looking through John's later, THE STORIES JESUS TELLS, I counted 16 adverbs in the first 6 pages. Of course, gracefully, lovely, obviously, suddenly, surprisingly, are found in both books!   In my second reading, I grappled with "The Rich Young Fool; The Great Banquet; The Talents; The Treasure, The Pearl and the Net" all include themes: many-splendored universe, one of generosity, experiences of change, especially, "Life Is Gift."     His attention to these recurring themes were first evident to me when Barbara and I heard John at Montreat in mid-1980's. Every morning for Chapel Worship Services, John in his freshness was exercising his themes in Sermon materials, Scripture texts, and particularly in his narrative stories from Anthony DeMello. I kept those tape cassettes of sermons, often sharing the same themes & stories in sermons preached to Prison Inmates in the early 1990's!    It was a long, often tedious journey from our common training at Southern Baptist Seminary, into the Episcopal Priesthood for him and long struggles with Myeloma and healing through 2 stem cell transplants. When we looked back over our experiences of changes and discovering God's Generosity, we agreed that Life is Gift.   Reading these Sermons on the Parables I reminded McAfee Students about their comments during discussions of his classic values of contrast, parabolic, even metaphor! Never can we dismiss his underlying themes of discovery in John's growth all thru his writings! Semi-Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
