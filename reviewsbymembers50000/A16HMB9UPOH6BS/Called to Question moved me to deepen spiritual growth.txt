 Upon hearing about Sister Joan from Sir Walter Brueggemann and Patricia Hallum who are both avid readers, I tackled her two latest treasures. Bruegge's awesome evaluation after speaking in Mississippi Conference last year with Marcus Borg, Bishop Spong plus Sister Joan was simply "She is a fearless Lady!" All of her writing has great simplicity, profoundity, richly mined metaphor plus an awesome collection of Epiphanies. Some of her numerous quotations by Teresa of Avila, Julian of Norwich, May Sarton, Sue Monk Kidd, Donna Schaper and Marie Fortune: "In the midst of profound suffering, God is present and new life is possible." As personal response in her Journal: "Why is God in suffering? Maybe because, in those moments, there is little of anything else there! Only in God can we come to see the broader view of suffering....Suffering pares us to the core, strips us of our complacencies, and leaves us naked of ourselves. Suffering exposes us to ourselves!"    Other than Karen Armstrong, who provides her personal accolades on the book cover, Walter Brueggemann, and Barbara Brown Taylor, no one else inhabits my ballpark as equally inspiring, noteable writers! These and others often gift me with courage, Faith and spiritual endurance to guide me through those deeper waters of spiritual growth! Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
