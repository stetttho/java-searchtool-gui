 Examples from early years in Birmingham as Rector of St. Lukes Episcopal Church, as he was in-between his shorter more compact homilies and his earlier involved confessional sermons he began while still in Louisville at Crescent Hill Baptist Church. In 1970's and 1980's I was on the receiving end of reading sermons from my Pastor in Huntsville. A short time after the death of his daughter, he quoted those who made his grief bearable being enrichened with meaning.   In mid-1980's Barbara and I listened to him daily in a Montreat Music Conference. There we heard sermons about "Warmth, Warmth, More Warmth," the visit of "The Magi to Bethlehem," plus his oft' used metaphors from Kierkegaard, Frederick Buechner, Sam Keen, Madeleine L'Engle, and Fred Craddock. In the first sermon of this book, I borrowed his examples about changes from the old English words as Artistic, Awful, Awesome. The prison inmates on leaving those Chapel Worship Services after hearing his stories of miraculous healing, asked, "Chaplain, did that really happen?"   Since I have reviewed six of John's later books, I have become aware of his increasing stock of stories from the sources above have been amply supported by many others from Anthony DeMello. One difference is a continual effort to connect up his sermonic material to the concerns and issues of his listeners.  Gladly added by Retired Chalain Fred W Hood
