 If possible I can easily award 7 Stars since it's a Holy number!  Even Sir Robert would have agreed...Because I believe he spoke of this 1975 recording several times as one of his favorites!! When we recorded that 4th night of the Christmas With Robert Shaw Concerts, all of us choristers were tired. We quickly came to attention when our conductor said, "There is sizzling in some darn lights up there!" We were surprised that he did not use the other popular 4-letter word beginning with D___!   That was my last evening to rehearse or record with our creative genius of a Choral Maestro. Since early in his time of coming to Atlanta, I had wished for the privilege of singing under him for more than just a single week's workshop at Princeton...so here I came every Monday from Marietta to enjoy a choral feast!    Although Donald Neuen, along with Greg Jessup of newest Mormon Tabernacle Fame are two Examples of Choral finesse, I still hear Sir Robert's voice when his Vivaldi, "Gloria" his favorite Bach   "B-Minor Mass," or Berlioz's "Requiem" ended with..."Well-done, People!" Much like his Biography is titled Dear "People...Robert Shaw."   This reprinted CD from December, 1975 is a wonderfully lasting testimony to the fabulous choral excellence of Mr. Shaw Himself. Even after singing with him dozens of times he was always to me, MR. Shaw. So when Advent rolls around in Nov-Dec I break out "Break Forth, O Beauteous Heavenly Light; "Kyrie Eleison and Dona Nobis Pacem"; "Shepherds' Farewell to the Holy Family!"  What superb glorious memories they conjure up in the mind and heart of this eternally older Chorister... Sincerely, Retired Chaplain Fred W. Hood
