 Upon my zillion times of hearing Sir Robert's recording of such spell-binding "vison of beauty" in Poulence's Mass in G, I'm in Awe of Shaw's getting closer and closer to heavenly music! Now he is "Over-there with his beloved Caroline hearing his Angelic Choir zinging-in for Poulenc, Bach, Brahms, Mozart, Verdi, etc!  I remember his sight-reading session one summer at Westminister Choir College, we sang portions of this Mass in G! We never got to the Agnus Dei, but each Atlanta Symphony Concert or Spivey Hall evening with his Festival Singers he used Donna Carter as one of his favorite Sopranos.   From a long experience of hearing his recordings & rehearsals, I still hear his forceful voice directed with either wee scorn or praise to those "darned Sopranos!" Westminster one summer, when we had distinguished choral Visitors in the balcony it came out as "You Damned Sopranos!" With no apology! No Conductor of our devoted generation had as much fervor or passion in rehearsals!    If I could have heard his rehearsals of Mass in G, the gorgeous Motets of Poulenc, plus the Prayers of St Francis, I may have sustained the composer's words of "the Christian soul who is confident of a life after death!" Soon after the loss of his Caroline, I asked him how he was surviving? His smiling reply came, "She misses me..."   Retired Chap Fred W Hood
