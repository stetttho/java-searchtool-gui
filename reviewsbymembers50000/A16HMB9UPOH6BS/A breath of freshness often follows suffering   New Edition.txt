 For my usual visit to the local bookstore I searched for a new Brueggemann, Claypool, Craddock or B. B. Taylor. Lo and Behold! I find there the latest of John Claypool's THE HOPEFUL HEART! Barbara Brown calls this John's best "cumulative wisdom of years to all whose hearts hunger for hope." The accolade by Barbaba C. Crafton urges one to take any chance to hear him preach or to sit with him! I heartily agree.   My reading OPENING BLIND EYES & MENDING THE HEART enriched me to see John's continual search in chapters entitled, "The Avenues to Authenic Hope, "What Can We Expect of God? "Hope and the Life to Come!" What picturesque chapter headings!   Two good friends in later years have experienced Chemotherapy... Both read this book after C S Lewis' GRIEF OBSERVED. They each commented... "We received that Freshness of deep help from John Claypool's book!"  Reading his books while I audited class of "Preaching Genesis,"  permitted us valuable time of relating to former Professors were gifts! Enjoying person-centered stories of Frederick Buechner, Sam Keen, Tony DeMello, CS Lewis & Madeleine L'Engle were gifts.  "Whenever the word Hope, arises in any conversation, thoughts instinctively turn toward the future. Hope is surely a positive expectation in relation to the Great-Not-Yet."   None can understand interminable grief compared to "his beloved wife, Ann." Our best encounter came at his Book-signing in First Presbyterian Church, even as he was not up-to preaching. She commented to us: "John really does love you."   Thankfully from one who knows John's home in his Great-Not-Yet. Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
