 Sitting in the classroom of Prof Brueggemann, you would not expect him to seem as commanding or imposing in presence as he appears in the pulpit preaching or in his Princeton Lectures! He opens his first lecture with, "The question of what the church is doing and is to do when it stands before the biblical text is a complicated...endlessly important question." While describing at length his response to the opening question, he brings great inclusion of a daily--yet never routine struggle with us in his company, "who struggle together mit endlessly contested issues."   Much like his manner of teaching: "There is no doubt that this text intends connections to the Exodus narrative." Then off our favorite Professor goes into favorite themes of Power & Economic relations. While moving through those crucial themes he reverts to his use of humor: Using the Philistines as enemies of God's chosen people, "who know the Credo news from Israel, perhaps having read Gerhard von Rad!" Of course our present day reading of von Rad would not have been possible in their timeline!   In the Columbia classroom he is never as imposing or threatening with his boundless resources of knowledge, wisdom, mit humor! In every visit to Columbia Seminary, I am overwhelmingly impressed.
