 When we chose Prof Bruegge's books to give away as Christmas gifts, one of those was Struggling with Scripture. It brings out one of his personal beginnings in the confirmation service by his Father. At that point he is given the Psalm verse, 119:105: "Your word is a lamp unto my feet and a light to my path." In his recorded memory, our good Professor says: "He did in that act more than he knew. Providentially, I have no doubt he marked my life by this Book that would be lamp and light..."  One of our Prof's recurring themes comes often in his influence of the Holy Spirit: "The Spirit meets us always afresh in our faithful reading, in each new time, place, and circumstance. Anyone who imagines that reading is settled and eternally simple does not pay attention to the process in which we are all engaged, liberals or conservatives." In many lectures, classroom discussions he has often referred to the failure of any passage having only one single interpretation! (This struck me recently in his talk at First Presbyterian Church, Atlanta when he made a firm assertion he was neither liberal or conservative.)    He touches Biblical Authority through the avenures of Inherency, Interpretation, Imagination, Ideology and Inspiration. In one of his first classes at Columbia Seminary, I was present when he used these five words beginning with I's. That immediately hooked me into signing-up for his Survey of Old Testament, next his Theology of the Old Testament.   Brueggemann's first Chapter lives up to the Preface comments by William Sloan Coffin, where he introduces Prof Blount, then Prof Placher and finally in more detail Prof Bruegge. I cannot come close to adequately describe this gem of three chapters plus the delightful preface of William Coffin. When you have heard these two similarly dramatic speakers then you surely will want to digest their magically miraculous, wondrous descriptive words. Gratefully, Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
