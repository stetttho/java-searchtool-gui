 If there is anyone who is more qualified or more compassionate to write about forgiveness after two chapters on Grievance and Guilt, then I hope to find that person! John starts with his friend Frederick Buechner in the utter despair of living with his Father's suicide. In one of his more recent sermons in Athens, GA. he refers to despair as the ultimate sickness of the soul. This can only be spoken as truth by one who has been in despair! I have heard John tell of his personal despair in the passing of his beloved young daughter, Laura Lue in traumatic years of 1968-1970.  That is his final story in this little jewel of stories. Three  others stand out for me...the story of Sam Keen and his Father, his childhood puppy, Jiggs, his friend telling about Charlie's passing. When John repeats these stories in sermons or teaching classes it is like reliving the emotions of those experiences! As he often says it is not simply the experience... "it is the reflecting upon the experience!" This intimately personal collection of stories makes for an incredible gift to someone in grief or despair! Positively his best yet...from an old friend: Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
