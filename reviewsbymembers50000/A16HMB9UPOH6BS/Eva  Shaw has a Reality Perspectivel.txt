 After being enrolled in her recent Writeriffic Online Class, there is a new certainty of confidence appearing in my writing! Before being a student of Walter Brueggemann, most of 77 books on OT, (Reviewer) colleagues at Columbia Seminary at least, Sister Kathleen O'Connor, Chuck Campbell, Christine Yoder, Now Ms Eva Shaw, I feared writing essays, anecdotes, Reflections and/or experiences of Reality! Eva Shaw has eyes to see thru a Writer, even an 74 yr-old, writing my Thots of CPE, Prison Chaplaincy, LectionAid Sermons, Pastoral Interprets, etc.   Eva Shaw is New Friend, Humorist, Internist, Inspirer, Nudger and Teacher... anything else would include Anu, Brian, Joanne, Char, Misty, Misty, Sandi and Misty; Plus all other class members from dozens of US, Canada, Italy, Russia, All reply to me and repect Ms Eva! Hooray for Her!    Old Fred, Retired Chaplain & Fun-loving Writer
