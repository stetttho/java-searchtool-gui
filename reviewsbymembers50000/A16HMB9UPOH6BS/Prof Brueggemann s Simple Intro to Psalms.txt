 This short, poignant, simple introduction to Praying the Psalms gives rare insights into the scholarly yet practical intro to many Psalms. I am familiar with the larger books from his pen: The Message of the Psalms, Psalms and the Life of Faith, Israel's Praise, Finally Comes the Poet. They each have their place in his progressive study of the Psalms. None are quite so direcly pointed to the power of his orientation, disorientation, reorientation in the movement of life. None are quite so simply focused upon the strength of the Psalms to relate their inherent "abiding astonishment" to the nuturing of good Pastoral Care.  This latest poignant reflection of Brueggemann gives us the pocket-size version of his distilled insights into the Praying of the Psalms. I love to use it frequently and with results!
