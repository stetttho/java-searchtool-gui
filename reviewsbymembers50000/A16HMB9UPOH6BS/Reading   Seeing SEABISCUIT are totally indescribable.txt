 When my wife and I got into the DVD of what we had read, it was beyond our wildest dreams! As the young son of Charles wrecked his new Buick Roadster, our thots turned to our young grandson, who met his death at his battle with Chemo, Leukemia. As we spun into that story with beautiful, mystical horses, we wished for some magical way to have Sir Christopher,in the Spirit, watching with us!   Only if you could see Christopher with Horses and his big black Newfoundland, Hershey, many times curled up in a blanket with his pet, losing his own head of hair, cracking jokes about "when I become old enuf to be a real-life Vetenarian" could you then be able to understand. But Christopher would rejoice in those super victoriea of the "little lead pony" who fought his battles to become Winner of the Match Race with War Admiral.   When you behold the trio of inspired riders and owners acted by Toby Macguire, Chris Cooper and Jeff Bridges...you too will be brought to the edge of your recliner shouting and yelling like I did! There were races as in full-view, thrilling to compete with Saratoga Springs, being watched by violinists of Philadelphia Orchestra on a summer afternoon! They are always awesome!   As we recovered, our thots agreed "if only Christopher can see these gorgeous, thorough-bred animals in action..."   Retired Chaplain Fred W. Hood
