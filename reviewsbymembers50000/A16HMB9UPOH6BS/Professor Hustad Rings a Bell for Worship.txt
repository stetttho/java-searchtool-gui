 Having an advantage of being under Dr. Hustad's influence for over thirty years, we have witnessed his integrity of sacred choral and organ music used in worthy worship of eternal God. Regardless of one's chosen Church or Denomination there are no such strictly traditional requirements set forth in Hustad's True Worship as noted in the other reviews. Only one of the three reviews gives an accurate appraisal of Don's distinction between traditional and contemporary worship.  He clearly stated in his classes at Southern, accepted by most of his students, the definition of Contemporary Iconoclasm. I am suggesting that could be rather prickly wording to prompt such an emotional response to his definiton of Iconoclasm. During his written discussion of Contemporary Music in Chapter 8 he refers to Robert Webber's book, Worship Is a Verb:"Worship is something we do and not something that service leaders...do for us." This has been one obvious case of division among Southern Baptists with a newness of creative worship as used in some CBF Churches or Cooperative Baptist Fellowship!  I have heard Don do his Hymn Festival on the Vision of Isaiah in Appendix III a number of times. The first time was in the early 1980's for a cosmopolitan group of South Carolina Ministers. This was an awesome time of worship when all the 30-40 various ministers responded with prayers, testimonies or solos. Just as in two Sunday evening church service, he guided those several  contemporary hymns from the piano, including How Great Thou Art, Kum Bah Yah, Medema songs, Come Let Us Reason, and Lord, Listen to Your Children Praying. For each time focused on contemporary worship, Don seemed sincerely guided by integrity immersed in the Presence of the Holy Spirit's Leadership.  I am still in an such an inimate relationship of appreciative reverence, no matter where I am influenced by this Christian Gentleman. Retired Chaplain Fred W. Hood
