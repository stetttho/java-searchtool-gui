 When you rent a movie expecting it to be largely entertainment and a relaxed fun story, it becomes BitterSweet when the lovely mother, played by Jennifer Lopez dies in child-birth! Just as  the Lamaize-prepared mother and young father are deep-breathng in midst of her screams, she struggles thru her last efforts to lie silently dying of an aneurism! About then, after having just seen both, TWISTED and TAKING LIVES, we agreed we seem to be all of a-sudden getting movies too heavy, serious, and/or violent!   Ben finally becomes a Loving, Caring, Happy Father, "Missing the wife everyday" but still over-coming the querrelous Poppy played by George Carlin! After surviving "Cats" and "Sweeney Todd" the fast-moving, surprising, solidly played-out ending completes the BitterSweet modes/moods of an all-together satisfying Movie!
