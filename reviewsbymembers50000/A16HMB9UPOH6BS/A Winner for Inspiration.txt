 For well over 5 years I have been blessed by well-know and well-documented M. J. Ryan's collections of prayers and quotations of deep wisdom! Many of these have been left out of collections, such as, St. Ignatius' Prayer, ee cummings' "i thank you,God" Walter Rauschenbusch's deeper prayers, Daphne Rose Kingma's many faces, Thomas Merton, May Sarton, W B Yeats, etc. Only recently I searched and found 12 Native American Indian Prayers.              "So when Life Fades, as the fading sunset,         my spirit may come to you without shame."                     (Native American Prayer"  One of the most succintly worded themes of the book is by Simon Greenberg: "One does not need to fast for days, meditate for hours at a time to experience the sense of sublime mystery which constantly envelops us." Represented are the unique riches from Seven Biblical quotes, The Buddha, Einstein, and Schweitzer!     Where else could one find such variety of Faith, mood, and/or source of healing alogside life-changing examples of Prayer, and Wisdom? They seem to be profoundly combined and edited! From a collector of Jewels of Poetry, Prayers, and Wisdom! ...Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
