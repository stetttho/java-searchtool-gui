 When John Claypool retired from his Episcopal Churches' duties, it gave him more time for writing. This newly published version of his "Stages of Life" (1977) speaks volumes about his personal stages, as noted by Erik Erickson, Carl G. Jung and Gail Sheehy!   In lectures on Preaching at McAfee School of Theology, he shared his personal Theology with young ministerial students, resulting in their smoother moving stages. "Prepare your sermons carefully and seek to reflect your own stages, even placed alongside those unique stages seen in your parishoners." I heard this flavor by  auditing John's first class in "Preaching Genesis and Preaching the Gospels."     After John's sudden passing there were three Memorial Services in Birmingham, Atlanta and Louisville. From this same revered book, "The Saga of Life" noted by friends like Professor Truette Gannon, he recalled John's personal words of growth as quoted in teaching experiences: "It is a wise person who knows what time it is in his or her life." Due to classes at McAfee, having more young ladies than men, that only showed his good sense in it's Inclusiveness!    One of his better chapters, "Childhood: Anointed with Delight" John refers to Sam Keen in being closer to his Father prior to his death: speaking to him, "you took delight in us." I had the sense of John's style as drawing contrasting illustrations from Gordon Cosby, Washingtn Pastor as he instilled confidence and self-esteem!   In his last chapters he fittingly concludes, Adulthood with his themes of generativity, intimacy and self-realization. These two sections on Adulthood were often subjects for some of our best personal and relational exchanges. I wholeheartedly affirm my recommendation to young and experienced Pastors!
