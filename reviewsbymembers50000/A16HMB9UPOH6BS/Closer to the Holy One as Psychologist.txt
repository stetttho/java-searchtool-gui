 I seldom feel as close to Holiness reading Psychologists, such as Adler, Erickson, Fosdick, Freud, Fromm, as this latest gem of Carl G. Jung! My trip to England's Canterbury Book stores, took me into Carl Jung's "Answer to Job". More recently delving into Robert Johnson's "Balancing Earth and Heaven" I was exposed to Madame Jung thru Helen Luke and ideas of "synchronicity." Prof Jung referred often to this idea in his "Undiscovered Self!"   "Most people confuse 'self-knowledge' with knowledge of their conscious ego personalities. Anyone who has ego-consciousness, at all takes it for granted he knows himeslf." People measure their self-knowledge by what the so-called average person knows of himself...coming forth as a very limited knowledge. Chapter Four, "The Individual's Understanding of Himself" begins: "The contradiction, the paradoxical evaluation of humanity by man himself is in truth a matter for wonder...man is an enigma." That Jungian statement opened the door for Robert A. Johnson and Karen Armstrong to use his same adverbs as "enigmatically and implicitly" for efforts to describe their personal crises!  Chapter Six, "Self-Knowledge" Jung sums-up as "a positive answer only when the individual is willing to fulfill the demands of rigorous self-examination and self-knowledge. If he follows his intention, he will not only discover important truths about himself but...will have suceeded in deeming himself worthy of serious attention and sympathhetic interest."    Then he relates the unconscious as an "only accessible source of religious experience. It is the medium from which the religious experience seems to flow." Even a young college student can grasp such a simpliciity as synchronicity! I was overwhelmed by this Gem...Retired Chap. Fred W Hood
