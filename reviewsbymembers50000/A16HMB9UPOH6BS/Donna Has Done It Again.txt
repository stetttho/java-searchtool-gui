 Donna Schaper is a superb writer who makes life more interesting by her writing. She also writes with skill and depth! I have been reading her essays and illustrations for a long time in Lectionary Homiletics, LectionAid and Preaching Great Texts. Her writing is chock full of good humor, wit and personal stories of her unique family..."Years ago, my husband dropped me, our two-year-old twins, our four-year-old son, and a pile of luggage at the airport's departure terminal." That is the opening sentence from the beginning of her second reflection in All Is Calm. Not many of her sentences are that long! But she intersperses colorful adjectives and adverbs along the way. Traveling Light in the Grand Canyon is one of her best stories.  Although I have not gotten to know her personally I am looking forward to her writing Conference at Kirkridge this summer.  I hope more Chaplains, Ministers and Pastors take advantage of her stimulating writing...Chaplain Fred W. Hood
