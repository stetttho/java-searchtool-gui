 After Years since our first Encounter, I was keenly surprised at the Graphic Descriptions of that Time-frame of Newly Rich among the HAVES and Inner Longings of those who were the Have-Nots!   Barbara and I were Amazed at the Sweep of Acting Ability of Mia Farrow and Bruce Dern! Not nearly as much difference in Redford! If you compare their High-riding parties with the entertainment of today, here were grand displays of emotions and kicking-up of their heels, almost like the Cotton Club or the Blue Note in Chicago!   We were more interested in the music & costumes than Acting or Story plot. There was contrast of the leading characters in their super display of emotions compared to that restraint of Nick Carraway, Tom Buchanan, or the mechanic named Wilson! What an awesome diplay of Personality Contrasts as well as, the short conversational exchanges that were both snide and more cynical than chit-chat between Gatsby and Tom Buchanan!!  All-in-all we were not entirely in the dark with the depression of the ending yet the Narrator, SAM WATERSON, as Nick C. had all the necessary qualities of being Worthy of an Oscar! Never   was it an appetizing, inspiring of high hopes, or sentimental movie as was our recent viewing of The Thomas Crown Affair!  Retired Chaplain Fred W  Hood
