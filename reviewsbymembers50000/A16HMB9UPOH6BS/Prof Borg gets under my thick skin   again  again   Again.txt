 While preaching & teaching with prison inmates I found clearly shocking descriptions by Marcus Borg written within, "Meeting Jesus Again For The First Time" being in-tune with the needs of skeptical, unbelieving inmates. Last Sunday morning as I gave up listening another boring sermon from my pastor of 13 yrs in the same-old worn-out words at the end of long sentences, I perused this latest book of Prof Borg! I was Totally Hooked!    The back cover had great affirmations by Karen Armstrong, Thomas Moore, Fred Buechner, Peter Gomes, Barbara Brown Taylor, and Walter Brueggemann; Each one moved to the territory of the next from one essential aspect of Borg's text to one more profound!   Each one touched on, "challenging & illuminating," (KA) "writing with simplicity but not simplicistic, (FB) ending with Sir Walter, "Being a key force in the emerging new paradigm of Christian Faith beyond pop caricatures of faith inviting them to the Real Stuff!" These opened-up now insights from Borg!   In reading I saw quotes from Bellah & Crossan, Hammarskjold & Heschel, Merton & others! I knew this one will "prepare me for the next time I speak to those inmates on the "Mystery of the Epiphany!" Once I Walk Again thru these deeper waters of Faith  with Marcus Borg and his bevy of resources I will be Ready!  Eagerly, Chaplain Fred W Hood
