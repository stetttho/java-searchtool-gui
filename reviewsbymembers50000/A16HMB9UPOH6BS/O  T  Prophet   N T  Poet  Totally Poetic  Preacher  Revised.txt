 "Finally Comes the Poet" is surely one descriptive title of my most read of Bruegge's theological mines. For those who need to read theological mines, it takes away despair as few poets do!   Sir Walter stirs up one's creative juices simply in describing, the "generative power of biblical texts to summon and evoke new life." He considers "preaching to be a poetic construal of an alternative world... whose purpose is to cherish and open the truth." This theme appears in nearly every class of Brueggemann!  My review is unnecessary after comments of Fred Craddock from the book jacket. "Here we have what we have come to expect from Walter Brueggemann; a fired imagination, harnessed & disciplined-offering what the gospel offers, that is an alternative world."  Brueggemann names powerful titles of healing from Biblical texts in his chapter: "Numbness & Ache or The Strangeness of Healing: 1) We likely cannot work alone for own healing. It may require a priest. 2) Healing requires the submission of some thing of value. 3) Healing is the enactment of atonement. 4) The act of putting away the poison of guilt is done not by ourselves but on our behalf by the priest.             I place this up to, "Awed to Heaven, Rooted in Earth; The Psalms of Life and  Faith; Spirituality of the Psalms; Introduction to the Old Testament, Struggling with Scriptures, and Commentary On Jeremiah!" It is difficult to place a listing at one perspective of necessity, life-style or precious moments of grief, joy, or pain or peace...Today this is my current list!       My continuing prayer for all who read his poetic thots, "May we be challenged by Sir Walter, one neat OT prophet-poet-preacher." Although his words were created for Yale Lyman Beecher Lectures of 1989, they are proof he is totally at home in both Old & New Testament! Amazing to be sandwiched into those elite lectures after Dr. Craddock in 1978, John Claypool, 1979 and earlier than Barbara Brown Taylor in 1997!   Hooray for Creative Poets who preach the scriptures! Retired Chaplain, Fred W. Hood
