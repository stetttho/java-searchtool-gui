 Over 7-8 years as Pastor-Preacher-Chaplain to Prison Inmates, I depended upon Anthony deMello's stories to make connections for the inmates who needed to see the word pictures telling them the meaning of their dreams, visions or Images of healing, growth or the answer to some indescribable problem they faced!    Trying to  get them in-tune with inner growth or a need for self-esteem, I used chose these stories. My favorites: "The Talkative Lover, We Are Three, You Are Three, Why Do Good People Die? and most profound of all, "The Diamond!"    Anytime I write a speech or tell stories on "Teaching Inmates," I use these Anthony deMello stories to illustrate tunnels to get into the hopeless, depressed, empty heads of those inmates!   His stories totally use qualities of Inspiration, Imagination, and Surprise Endings, necessary to grab Inmates' attention! Along with other books of Anthony deMello: "Awareness, "Taking Flight, and "Sadhana: A Way to God," I know of no better source for mining these mysterious, economic length of words, and catch-22 stories to fit into many different topics,themes and biblical refrerences!
