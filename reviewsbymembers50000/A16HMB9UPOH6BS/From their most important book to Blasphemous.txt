 In the early 1980's following marriages of both my daugthers, it seemed as-if their husbands went thru that crisis of Faith when they wondered about the Virgin Birth, the Resurrection, and the Holy Trinity...Whatever was on their list of Doubts! About that  time, Barbara was leading her continuing Book Club Searches! She happened upon this awesome Psychologic/Philosophic/Theological+ Sermonic Book of Leslie Weatherhead! A great contrast to some of the other Reviews.  After passing it off to Randy, who taught a Sunday School Class of Young Adults and to Steven, a Junior Deacon in the University of Georgia College Church, within a few weeks both commented on their pleasure and help received from the esteemed ENLISHMAN! Since they knew his relationship to C. S. Lewis, they expected what they learned from Professor/Teacher/Pastor Weatherhead!   Later in early 1990 as Prison Chaplain, It came upon my Top 10 book-list passed-off to Inmates who asked me for suggestions in RE-Building their Christian Faith! I will be forever indebted to Sir Leslie Weatherhead!  Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
