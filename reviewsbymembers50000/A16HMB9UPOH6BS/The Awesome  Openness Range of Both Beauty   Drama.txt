 We were watching after a long tiring day of teaching, a weekend of being with too many wonderful people! Then we got to behold the Awesome, openness Western range in beauty drama of powerful acting! Duvall was Perfect as The Boss! Kevin Costner, Potent and Powerful Actor of subdued rage in his relived early life as reminding us of his submerged feelings of killing real people not so much as killing the scum-of-the-earth people!  As one who has seen and dealt with long-term prison inmates, I have never been so close to such pictures of an eye-for-an-eye and a tooth-for-a-tooth! The sudden revealing of the accepting, loving, sister Annette Benning in role of Doc's assistant made the connection that some people seem to be worth only killing since they have acted-out their rage on Innocent Persons!   We did not realize what a jewel of a picture until her loving acceptance of Costner as an OK killing agent of judgement! No matter how many reviews written, nothing I saw in most that I disagreed, other than: "Too Long! It Needed to Be..." An Older Retired, Chaplain, Fred W Hood
