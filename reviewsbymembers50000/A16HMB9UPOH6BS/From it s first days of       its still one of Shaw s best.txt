 While in seminary, in the 1950's Shaw Chorale was in midst of tours and recording of those great Deep River Spirituals! Then suddenly in 1963 they introduced, "The Many Moods of Christmas." All 'good church musicians' placed them in their FBC, First Meth Church, First Pres, etc. Two GA churchmen got his "permission" to use copies of instrumental groups of Brass and Woodwinds. We kept them in our church libraries for all these years.  My favorite groups of Sir Robert and Robert Russell Bennett whom Shaw greatly admired has to be, No III and No IV: "What Child is This?" "Bring A Torch; Angels We Have Heard On High; Break Forth, O Beauteous Light; I Saw Three Ships!" Those in his ASO Chorus had the fun of doing bits of those, and some parts of all four! No other chorus likely had the luxury of Sir Robert's clearly perfected choral approach.  Not ever again can we hear his husky-voiced words giving us his deeply placed whispering but clearly inspired magical direction ..."This is the way we want to sound." Like his early Robert Shaw Chorale! It's super-clear to read in this CD's 1998 interview with the choral genius & Lucy Cross: the facts of his  original, "Many Moods, and (uh-mm-uh) maybe our very BEST!
