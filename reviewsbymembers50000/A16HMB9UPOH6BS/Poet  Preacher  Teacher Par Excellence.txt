 What would it be like...to hear Barbara Brown Taylor preaching her first sermons at All Saints Episcopal Church in downtown Atlanta? To be able to hear and see these simple yet profound illuminations of Gospel stories and parables? How often in reading her sermons, do I see and hear in my imagination the first time I heard her in the Lectionary Homiletics Preaching conference of 1995? More than a few times! Here are a few of them in "Mixed Blessings." She is the epitome of one who can spin a new parable out of her rich creative imagination. She proves one of the demands of a good sermon coming from the overflow of days of prepararion. One of Thomas Long prescriptions of a good sermon - "the exegesis of the Text determines everything about the sermon!"  We approach our choice of Text, Parable, Translation, Outline, Flow, Income, Outcome to draw the listener into the Sermon. Professor Taylor does all of this from her shortest sermon, "The Familiar Stranger" to the longest, "After Words" taking us from Romans 8 to the roof-top of an ancient mansion, "at the end of my rope I prayed and sang to God 'point me to what You would have me do.'"  It was her Calling! - All of them are WOW!
