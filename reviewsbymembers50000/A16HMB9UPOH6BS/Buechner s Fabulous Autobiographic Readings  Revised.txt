 I only thought that I had read Frederick's nearly best words!  While visiting Montreat one summer, I accidentally met the young lady named Stacey_____ who has the unending task of editing and selecting manuscripts to remain in Wheaton's Archives for his legacy. I wish I knew how to reach her...there or at The Chicago Tribune!   This fabulous collection of his readings comes from the hands of his friend George Connor. He was outstanding Prof of Literature at the Univ of Chattanooga when we were students there in the 1950's! His selections from "A Room Called Remember, Wishful Thinking & Whistling in the Dark," are right on target for me!  When he writes, "autobiography becomes a way of praying," I am totally in agreement. Also with his descriptive beauty in using adverbs like..."enigmatically, inexplicably, and realistically, (sprinkled around)... Freudians and Jungians, prophets and poets, philosophers, fortune tellers and phonies all have their own claims about what dreams mean." Not only have I related, but resonated, even reverberated to his words!    Ad lib Note: I have recently found copies of THE FACES OF JESUS-A Life Story -by Fredrick Buechner! The awesome hard-back Cover  shows four superb prints of Ancient Faces of JESUS: 1) Galleria  Saluda in  Turin; 2) Sta Maria di Castillo L'dine; 3) Coptic Museum of Cairo; 4) Art Archiive of Dagli Orti.   All are awesome-fascinating-inspired, unique features as FACES!   First Published by Riverwood Press in Croton-on-Hudson, NY 1974, First Printing, 2005, By Paraclete Press in Brewster Mass.
