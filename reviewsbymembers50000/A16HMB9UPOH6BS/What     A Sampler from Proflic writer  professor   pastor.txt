 Watching prison inmates process into Sunday eve Chapel Worship services, I noted number of Peterson's "THE MESSAGE!" I became curious to read A Sampler Collection of his early writings and interviews. From his perspective as prof of "Spiritual Theology" at Regent College in Vancouver, to founder and pastor of 18 yrs in Baltimore, I enjoyed reading personal interviews from 1981 to 1995. My first reading of Pastoral work had been his "Five Smooth Stones of Pastoral Care" somewhere in the late 1980's. As CPE student, I was impressed with his deeply rooted theological approach to the pastorate.  For a retired Chaplain who continues to fill-in Sunday evening worship services, his interviews are revealing of another one who tries to stay abreast of contemporary novels and poetry. I identified in reading, Unexpected Allies from "Christianity Today" that, "I don't read novels to get sermon illustrations or poetry for quotable lines." I honor anyone who continues to grow alongside staying in-touch with the creative process! He sounds as if he obviously avoided taking an easy haphazardly approach to the pastorate!    In Peterson's evaluation of not finding materials for growth of Spiritual Foundation from Seminary, I believe this is addressed today by numerous pastoral groups who are advertising "Spiritual Growth in Foundational Experiences." I am aware of several in Georgia designated for both pastors and chaplains.  Although I learned much about his deeper theological roots as professor, writer and pastor, I also enjoyed prodding around in his discussion upon his 'word-world' studies of both Hebrew and Greek texts! Look-up or into his resources from a "mystical- center" of his Evangelical World! From one still..."Surprised by Joy" from the Logos!  Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
