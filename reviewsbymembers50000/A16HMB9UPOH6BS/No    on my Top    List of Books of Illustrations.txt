 After ending the year of 2004 re-reading deMello stories from the Song of the Bird I picked up WELLSPRINGS to compare them! My eyes were first caught by "The Fountain, "The Education and "The Current. "The Education focused upon Peter's Betrayal when he saw that 'Look' from Jesus! "I shrink, at  first from his loving gaze, for it is too forgiving... I must sustain that look if I am to learn to look at other people the way he looks at me."  Then I moved back into the deMello section on his Topic of LIFE. First I centered upon "The Awakening, "The Deliverance, and "The Symphony" all really interested me for their under-lining! Since Tony deMello often did in his short life, he meditated upon his own Death! In "Deliverance" an underlined phrase: "And so it must be: Life must go on." On closing of this longer meditation, I added the quotation from my old friend, Bob Farrall: "Until my Brother died - I did not face my mortality!"   Many stars & pluses for Contemplation & Meditation in-telling stories. Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
