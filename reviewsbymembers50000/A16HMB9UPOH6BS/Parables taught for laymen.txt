 John Drury is Dean of Kings College in Cambridge. In the compact approach to Parables in the Gospels, his chief aim is to focus upon the meaning and use of parables... "inherited from Jewish tradition, to understand them in the contexts of the books in which they occur."  From references to Old Testament prophets who used figurative means to make their historical points, such as, Samuel to David, Ezekiel and Hosea to their generations, he moves into the New Testament. From the Synoptic Gospel Parables of Jesus, he slips into John's Parables of Light, Shepherd, Fig tree and the Vine. Next he wanders into the Apocrypha Books of I and II Esdras, Tobit and Ecclesiaticus. Most of his comments from these unique sources come in the chapter on Luke. He uses 50 pages for his discussion of Lucan parables over against fewer pages for those of Matthew and Mark. Thomas Long's approach in his "Preaching the Parables" at Emory-Candler School of Theology is to combine Drury's text alongside those of Father John Donahue and A. J. Hultgren. I discovered that Donahue initiates my interest in the Parable at hand - then Professor Drury continues to develop it without footnotes and fewer references. Following them, I am directed to Hultgren who combines both of their resources, focusing upon Jeremias, Dodd, Julicher, Bultmann and Crossan.  Overall, I am deeply indebted to John Drury for developing my late interest in becoming a student of Jesus' Parables!  Chaplain Fred W. Hood
