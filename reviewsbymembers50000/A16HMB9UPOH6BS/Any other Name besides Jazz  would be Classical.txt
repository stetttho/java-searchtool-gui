 Bobby Mcferrin, if anything, must be a Creative Genius! When we attended 2 concerts with the Atlanta Symphony, he conducted 5-6 of heavy Beethoven Symphony No 8, Ravel, Tchaikovsky... plus Impressionistic pieces that stayed in my memory for months! He is equally at home with classical, romantic, even Impressionism or flat-out Jazz!    Here in this 1995 CD I hear his creative genius in using 3,5,7,9 tone themes as contrapuntal themes either in contrary motion or mirror inversion or as patterns in cross-bar, cross-beat rhythm even as Robert Shaw described in conducting Beethoven's MISSA SOLEMNIS. Also I'm thrilled each time I hear these first three examples of Combined Vocalices + Instrumental tunes in contrast with each other!   Probably his Title Song, filling-up the first 5:32 minutes is one of interesting musical nuances, regardless whether one calls it bonefide Classical Jazz or anything else! Alongside FRIENDS and MERE WORDS, I love what he does with REMEBRANCE and the awesome SELIM of Miles Davis and his lush-sounding horn!    I really relate to this creative, freshly expressive performer, even when he just sits in a chair onstage, creating Musical Body Sounds for over 30 minutes! He is totally Amazing to this Elder, Retired Musician, Chaplain Fred W Hood
