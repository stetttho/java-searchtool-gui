 I changed Dr. O'Connor's title to include what I strongly felt and believed as I peruse the first few chapters and her closing  "Theological Betweeness" Summary. The Foreward by Prof Bruegge gives his seal of approval and names her as "my distingished and treasured colleague." He describes her growth in her own daring presentation in which "she carries readers to new depths of human anguish and human hope..." I agree totally with his way of including "her rich and shamelessly theological exposition."   Just as Prof O'Connor states in her Preface on the personal note of beginning the work while her husband was receiving infusions in the oncology room of Columbia Presbyterial Medical Center in NYC, one is quickly plunged into her personal search for Hope!  Early reading her inspiring exposition...I was taken-up with her explicit combining of the depths of literary and psychological and theological themes discovered in Lamentations!   When she described Lamentations as a short book of five poems, "that expresses with searing clarity their fear, grief, and despair," I quickly remembered three families of professional friends who were all facing those same personal sufferings. She clearly articulates those issues which most of us faced in CPE!  Her calling the book "an artistic jewel, a theological enigma, and a courageous act of survival"...leads to the rich metaphoric poetry which is able to embrace the sorrows of the world!  Her summary begins: "Lamentations is a theological watershed, an in-between place where the old theology of a punishing God no longer holds..." Yet God's voice is largely missing from these poems and is not heard. I am eagerly looking forward to hearing Professor O'Connor as she teaches Cross Cultural Readings in the Old Testament at Columbia Seminary!  Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
