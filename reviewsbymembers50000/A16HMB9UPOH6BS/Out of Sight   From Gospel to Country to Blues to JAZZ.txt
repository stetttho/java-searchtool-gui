 If you hope to-be taken-back to those "Good old days" at either 17, 35 or even 75, this CD Does that for 22 Times of listening! Each time I've heard it, I added new thots! It seems that it was such a great treat for him to choose these performers, he lifted their sights and ability to perform close to his earlier days! As an inquisitive younger Lover of great Jazz, even a Bit of Country, Blues, Gospel- I was totally floored!  Not much agreement with: L. Quido, Howe/Darien, Shas/Trip or other reviews I was awesomely surprised in hearing his great Joy so near-to death/The Ray Charles singing with Variety of Genius! No doubt, He was All-time Favorite in areas of Gospel, Country, Yes, Blues + Jazz! Looking back into my deep Love of Music from Churches, Schools, Seminaries, the Movie, "Ray"... Then hearing this Awesome CD of Ray beside my favorite singers, I'm moved to  Joy & Tears!   My best evaluation as noted in one Review: "What a way to die" then go out-into the Other-World: Than greet those Families-on-the Other-Side: the KING Family (BB or MLK,Jr); the COLE Family; Nelsons; Raitt's; Kralls; Knights...Especially My own Family of Hood's of "You are my Sunshine" From County Church, Traditional, Great Jazz! I believe he made each performer try to be great: B.B. Kimg, Bonnie Raitt, Natalie Cole, And even Johnny Mathis!    My Order: 1st Willie Nelson, 2, Natalie Cole, 3, Johnny Mathis, 4, Bonnie Raitt, 5, Gladys Knight--Counry on to Blues, to Pop, finally Great Jazz!
