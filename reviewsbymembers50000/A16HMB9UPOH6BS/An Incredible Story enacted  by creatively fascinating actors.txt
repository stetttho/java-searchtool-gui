 We just finished watching A Movie that gradually seems to become the awesome, fascinating, most incredible story yet to-be told. The 4-5 actors/actresses from Ben Kinsley, then next, Jennifer Connelly, to Masoud Behrani's Iranian Wife, Nadia, to her young, proudly brilliant Son, all melt quiet eventually into one large Community Family. They become gradually banded together into one Family by the House of Sand and Fog! One of my first notable features, was that descriptive and inspiring background music!    Just as our older, perceptive daughter promised, it likely will become one "depressing" film story! As one great review by Mark Cunningham depicts carefully in his "beautifully creative, Actor Ben Kingsley becomes the stunning conerstone for an Incredible, even unbelievable Tragedy! He describes the marvelous acting of Nadia, Wife of Behrani, who paints a portrait of "grace under pressure!" She alongside the starring role of Kathi, played by Jennifer Connelly team to provide the most Dynamic work of any film we have seen since the innovative films: "Iris" with Judith Dench or "Shadowlands" plus Anthony Hopkins as CS Lewis' even more 'specially "The Beautiful Mind!" with Russell Crowe!     I reach a total loss in what else to point-out that may create more continuity of thought that other reviewers appear bound to experience in-light of this awesome, fascinating, Intensely Incredible Story! For me this will require continual editing over and over... From Retired Chaplain, Fred w Hood
