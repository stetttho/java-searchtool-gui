 Beloved Steinway Pianist, Edith Rieber gave us these CD's of The Best Voices singing the Best German Songs & Lieder! From an older retired Baritone + coloratura Soprano Wife, both loved to tackle Brahms, Schubert, Beethoven, Mozart, Schumann. Where else can you find such singing by Dame Janet Baker, Schwarzkopf, Frederica von Stade, Jessye Norman & Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau plus superb Accompanists as Gerald Moore, Irwin Gage and Geoffrey Parsons?  I lean heavily towards the familiar favorites, "None but the lonely heart, Du bist die Ruh, Der Erlkoning, Clair de Lune by Frederica von Stade, Brahms' Sapphische Ode, Wie Melodien zeight es mir, Grieg's Ich liebe dich, finally his mystical & magical 7 of Franz Schubert's "An die Musik, An Sylvia and Der Tod und das Madchen!!! All are beautifully digital remastered by EMI records Ltd. ranging from early prints of 1957, many of 60's up-to 1990!   Each Time I listen to these, I'm transported back into an early, simply awesome world of rich voices singing the Best of German Songs & Lieder! Joyful Shalom...Retired Chap Fred W Hood
