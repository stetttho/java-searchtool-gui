 To one of his more recent students in classes and lectures at Columbia Seminary, Prof Bruegge is already a Living Legend! In the beginning of every class there is his personal, inspired prayer to the "One Who Listens; Yahweh; Holy God; Giver of all our years; You, the God of Truth; You, You, You..."  Lately, in his OT Survey, I wrote a few snatches of his opening addresses to: "You, You, You giver of Life; You who are the One Sovereign Judge, King, Lawyer, Counselor...O God as we watch powers rise and fall, We watch ourselves, we watch and see the World. You who comes late and sometimes soon... Come quickly Lord Jesus!"  My thoughts often return to his opening prayers in every class. My wish for all of last year: "Why does not someone publish them?" So now we have many of them. From 1976: "You are the voice we can scarely hear..." From 1992, "Healing sovereign God, overmatch our resistant ears..." How many sparkling ways that he creatively addresses the Living Personal God! In these few weeks I have used this Jewel of Prayers, I have been particularly struck by the first group: "And then you; You...and therefore us; For how you hope; The other side of the street; Our true home." The second section that I have re-read is "A people with many secrets," and the 11th one, "The God we would rather have." Dedicated to "a long stream of treasured colleagues of 25 years at Eden Theological Seminary and 17 years at Columbia...with thanks and appreciation." When I purchased this treasure in the School's Book Store, I first saw it in the hands of one of his friends from the Seminary Offices. Now the one who prays to the "Liberator, Redeemer, Emancipator..." will continue to be the one I know who includes his students in his caring compassion!  Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
