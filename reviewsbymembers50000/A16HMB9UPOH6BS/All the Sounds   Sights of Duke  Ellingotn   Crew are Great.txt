 From the ancient, awesome 1968 sounds of The Duke and Crew of Ellingtonians, I was immersed in deep-seated dreamy reveries. Right off, Satin Doll, Creole Love Call, Happy-Go-Lucky Local, The Mooche, Mexican Suite, starring "The Piano Man," Duke Ellington, It Don't Mean A Thing if it Ain't Got that Swing! And Next, I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good And Black and Tan Fantasy.  Near the ending of the Duke's Mexican Tour comes, Mood Indigo, and Sophisticated Lady... finally starred His Top Alto Sax man, Johnny Hodges! I really was blown away hearing Cootie Williams, Lawrence Brown, Jeff Castleman, only long-hair, white Bassist, followed by Paul Gonsalves, Tenor Sax, their Pertly Swinging Singer, Trish Turner! Again it means Hoorahs from my all/time favorite, "The Piano Player." The Keyes fellow, who sandwiched  these excerpts together from Mexican ++ other Tours deserves double Hoorah for pertinent Interviews with three side-men!    Inspite-of review canning their poor quality of sounds, being A Devil's Advocate, today's stereo sounds of 1968 Music Video even in 1980...Their Quality of Photography was well worth 90 Minutes to be repeated & repeated & repeated!
