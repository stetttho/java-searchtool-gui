 Since we were leaving for summer vacation to Connecticut I began reading this Mystery on the Plane to Hartford. After a slow and tedious beginning, I started relaxing from walking, jogging and napping on the beach. I used this amazingly written complexity of "stream of consciousnes" story to sandwich in-between lighter reading. It became my intensely profound plot to fill into those empty places for concentration. I already began "The Wisdom of Big Bird" & James Patterson's "Sam's Letters to Jennifer. Soon I really became hooked on this gripping mixture of Father Anselm's attempt to unravel the story of Lucy's Grandmother, Agnes with her shadowed memories of the Nazi German personalities from her horrows of children being protected but then taken away from their families. This writer has such an uncanny gift of mixing a connected history with his imagination...even ornamenting the dreams and delusions of an Agnes from within her lengthy comma. After our first few days, this historic, mystery of suspence occupied my fullest attention. Then came my easier goal of which books to write short first reviews after getting home.   Do not miss getting into this awesome, gripping, intensely written story of love, compassion, and sacrificially realized Hopefulness!  Chaplain Fred W. Hood
