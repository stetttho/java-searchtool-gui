 Since only 16, I was greatly influenced by ole Blue Eyes! Regard-less whether his Movies, his Records on 78 rpm or on the Radio! (Long before TV!) Then our Senior Yr comes along, we got old enuf to be "Dancing in the Dark with Mary Costa, Harriet____ or Dorris! We thrilled & chilled-out to "The Lady Is A Tramp; When You're Young at Heart; It's Witch-craft!" We stayed long, Past our Curfew" to have another Frostie to Smootch a bit-more! Along about 40, Frank's still going strong. Sir Robert Shaw said: "If you really hope to learn the art of phrasing, Listen to Frank!"    Only reminded today on hearing Garrison Keillor, my 75th yr, hearing a Poem of Donald Justice: "Men over 40 learn to close the door very softly when leaving the room if not coming back!" But we leave it open, just enuf to hear Frank!  So here is Frank moving us once more to Nostalgia, Bittersweet Memories, hearing, "You Make Me Feel So Young! ; Night and Day ; Put Your Dreams Away til Another Day; Come Fly With Me!"  Only 7 out of the 20++ Classic Songs of Sinatra from Ole Blue Eyes, who never stopped looking, feeling, singing YOUNG! Every trip includes Frank, Duke, Louis, Sir Robert!
