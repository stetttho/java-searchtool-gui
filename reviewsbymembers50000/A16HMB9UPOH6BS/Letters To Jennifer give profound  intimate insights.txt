 Upon getting away for a relaxed summer vacation to Connecticut I used this fasinating story for lighter reading to balance the heavier stories. I was deeply moved and greatly surprised at the profoundly unique, intimate insights of James Patterson, as he played upon all the strings within this story. Since my wife teaches Violin, Viola and Cello students, I could identify with  Patterson's creatively harmonized overtones of these varied string sensations. I only thought his forte was in the thrilling mystery of nursery rhythm titles!      "For a long time it seemed to me that Life was surely about to begin...real life. But there was always some obstacle in the way, something to be got through first, un-finished business, time to be served, a debt to be paid!...Always my priorities are getting my health better!" Danny Kaye used to say, "Life is a big canvass; throw all the paint you can at it." Jennifer writes her weekly column for the Chicago Tribune! Some of her 'oft read response was advice, "Loosen-up Friend! You always seem in too big a hurry to be funny." Someone had read that act of laughter releases nice chemicals in the brain. "You feel Good and it's Free!"   In Jennifer's slow-dancing romance with Brendan, she hears him repeating, "Live everyday from the crack of dawn until I can't keep my eyes open a second longer." That was his reasoning for taking an ice-cold swim early every morning in the nearby lake! Author Patterson employs his creative gift of recording intimate conversations between Jenny and Brendan which reveal their most privately profound, uniquely shaped character traits. My take on Patterson's writing skills is that of one neatly diverse, well-controlled, composed, cohesive personality! Even looking at his portrait on the back cover, I see a man who appears to be comfortable with, "Who He Is!"  Chaplain Fred W Hood
