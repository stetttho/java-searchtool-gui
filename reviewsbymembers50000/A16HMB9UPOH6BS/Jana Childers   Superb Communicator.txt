 After hearing Jana Childers present her Sermon-Lecture on the same title, Birthing the SERMON, I enjoyed a slow reading. Her sermon on the process of Creativity was received gladly by the Preaching Conference of over 600 preachers in National Christian Church of Washington, D.C.   During my second month of digesting comments and sermons by Jana and 11 other distinguished women, I am convinced that other male preachers would also profit greatly from a slow reading. Those sermons which have jumped out as strongest and most creative, alongside of Jana's "A Shameless Path" - based on Luke 11:1-13, are by Teresa L. Fry Brown of Emory-Candler, Barbara Lundblad of Union Seminary, Barbara Brown Taylor and Rabbi Margaret Wenig.  Prof. Fry in "A Love Letter Written in Blood" reeks with poetry, music and intimacy of personal imagination. Dr. Lundblad supplies inspiration from her style of sermon birthing to the context of her sermon delivered in the Riverside Church of New York, "After Emmaus." Never to be under-estimated, Barbara Brown Taylor gives her short sermon, "Bothering God" from Luke 18. Finally, the surprise is from Rabbi Margaret Moers Wenig, the People's Temple in NYC and professor of Homiletics at Hebrew Union College. She moves from "Preaching as Dialogue," to "Generating Ideas vs. Shaping and Editing the Sermon." Her sermon is a midrash, or a  commentary on the Torah as story. The unique and lengthy sermon is spiced with phrases and sentences in Hebrew - often 5-6 on each page. The title is more than picturesque - "Their Lives a Page Plucked from a Holy Book."  I surely recommend this book, whole heartedly, with all stars!  Chaplain Fred W. Hood
