 Since he gives Kathleen O'Connor the credit helping him choose discrete entries that all have interpretative coherence, Prof Bruegge has chosen topics "which reflect a focused theological center to his listing." In order to better connect our favorite Professor's preface comments to my personal point of seeing this new Theological Handbook of Old Testament Themes alongside some eight other copies of Bruegge's creations, I will relate two other Gems: The Commentary on GENESIS and his definitive later  THEOLOGY Of The OLD TESTAMENT!   On becoming familiar with GENESIS, Interpretation Commentary, I was transported back to his numerous books focused on Psalms. When I stopped over in his classes at Columbia Seminary, I soon  became entranced with his Survey of the Hebrew Bible and his session with THEOLOGY Of the OLD TESTAMENT, his signature work!   Reverberations of Faith has become a specific number of Seven topics which are the more longer from ninety ++ : Deuteronomic Theology, Exodus, Image of God, The Persian Empire, Priestly Tradition, Suffering and Theodicy. In the Image of God he moves from being "astonished in the priestly creation narrative of GENESIS" to New Testament texts of John 14, Corinthians and Colossians. He lists ten pages of Scripture references with far more from Exodus, Deuteronomy and Psalms!   Not only is Bruegge a first class writer and research artist, he displays his fantastic memory in every class. He continually is moving from one scripture to another with his endless naming of resources for future study of Memorable Themes. From years of multiplied classes, I have discovered the unforgettable example of the consumate teacher! This ranks in the top of his long list of all-inclusive books for layman and scholar.
