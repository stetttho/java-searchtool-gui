 When I recently chose to go into the life of one who greatly influenced me in the 1980's I chose "The Heart is a Little Left of Center" because it's filled by Coffin's big & best themes!  In his years while at Riverside he stayed busy with Conferences like Montreat Music & Worship Week! Not only did he admire my wife's soprano voice but I could sit next to him in the bass section of Elaine Brown's fabulous choir. He was at home with  great choral traditions...Always intensely in-tune with both the text & music. I quickly saw first-hand how his preaching each day in Worship was an exact replay of his momenteous living!   Those themes woven into this later book are "Authority of the Bible, Homophobia, Fundamentalism, Meaning of Life & Death, and Civility!" As he goes thru his severe heart problems in Calif. with his Family, I can bet he's still an inspiring, giving, and caring Person! Still quoting Bishop Tutu, ML King, Rabbi Abraham Heschel: "some are guilty but all are responsible." Thoreau as well as, Abba Eban: "God is not mocked!" Likely unknowingly that he was also quoting Robert Shaw, in Atlanta, who called him Bill Coffin! I will always be able to hear his resonant, deeply rich bass voice both preaching and singing in the Choir. This should be required reading in all seminaries! Retired Chap Fred W Hood
