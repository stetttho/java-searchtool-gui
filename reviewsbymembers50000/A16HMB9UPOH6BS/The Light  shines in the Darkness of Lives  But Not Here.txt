 Never can I match Shalom Freedman of 1500+ Reviews and 60 in two weeks of July! Completing most of THE WILD BRAID, I browsed thru other Collections of Sir Stanley...He hooked me early in the midst of his neatly arranged Reflections! Since my getting stung by hearing him read, "The Layers" on NPR's Infinite Mind, I felt urged to get to writing my Oft' Postponed Autobio Reflections!  Whenever I meditate early each Morn on his infinitely inspiring poems I start with THE LAYERS from 6th Group of Reflections by  the same Name! Goodies under that title: The KNOT; Words For The Unknown Makers: "To A Slave Named Job; "Girl With Sampler; "A Soft Answer Turns Away Wrath; "A Blessing of Women." THese 16pp proceed quite neatly into his Awesome, Consuming, though much Longer: "The Lincoln Relics" and "The Meditations on Death!"   Unless it be too hasty to add: I have named these as Best of his Poems to be found in The LAYERS! This 6th Group of Reflections fall into the dates of 1928-1978  In Summary: Three sections of Longer + Numerous Poems lie within THIS GARLAND, DANGER in SELECTED POEMS of 1928-1958 (4th Group) and THE TESTING-TREE of 1971 (5th Group) When I choose my great Favorites of his shorter Poems: VITA NUOVA; SOTTO VOCE; SUMMER  SOLSTICE.. They combine varied length of lines, 2-3 verses, are both rhymed and free-style; SUMMER SOLSTICE is like Prose with a bit of punctuation. SOTTO VOCE has no punctuation, yet simpler and more personally focused!        Regardless from each perspective, anyone looking into Stanley's  Poetry, may find he becomes less & less an Enigma! Exactly as stated in THE LAYERS of 1978: "and I am not who I WAS! My caps & my ending conclusion. Mit great Adoration--Retired 75yr old, Chap Fred W Hood
