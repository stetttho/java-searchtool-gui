 When I received this profound statement of Sallie's Metaphors, I first concluded, "It's too deep for me!"  Since I had finished my schedule of preaching to Prison Inmates, I'd lost my motive of reading heavy things on the Art of Preaching much less of reading heavy Theology. Now after 3 years I am involved with the heavy Theology of Columbia Professors Brueggemann and O'Connor!  When I looked back at some markings I had made in Dr. Sallie's heavy stuff I saw, "all or almost all, of the language used by the Bible to refer to God is metaphor..." She credited George Caird, one of my favorite biblical scholars. Her next paragraph stated, "A Hebrew sucked the juice out of each metaphor as he used it, and threw the skin away at once... Within the plethora of Hebrew images there is one category that stands--out-personal relational images."  I had been looking for such simple profound statements for months of hearing Professor Bruegge! Even Doubley when she quoted Paul Ricoeur, C.H. Dodd, John Dominic Crossan, John Donahue, C.S. Lewis, Leander Keck, relating to Parables.    She uses the phrase, "artistically creative imagination," in her chapter in on Models of Science. There she quotes Ian Barbour, C.S. Lewis and Niels Bohr which takes me back to Barbara Brown Taylor's "Luminous Web!" I love Sallie's conclusion on the last page from the medieval Mystic: "Thou art an immense ocean of all sweetness...(Let me)lose myself in the flood of Thy living love as a drop of sea water..." Finally adding comments from Gerard Manley Hopkins and Paul Tillich.    What a feast for Mystic Theologs!  Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
