 What better excuse for a review other than for Barbara's eminent Book Club of unique ladies: None are Natives of Mississippi! My first impression, paying respect to BLINK, written by Malcolm Gladwell, certifies this as not being simply one more humorous book. It is chock-full with gourmet recipes of our deep South tradition! Naming, describing, even listing of Ingredients for their favorite dishes, the Ladies of St. James' and Ladies of Greenville Methodist Churches, compete with fat-baked meals of Asparagus Casserole, and similiar, Thrifty Squash Casserole!    On first reading I noted many more words written about all their sweet-smelling, steamy hot dishes of Southern casseroles brought in early that morning for the bereaved family, than about their choice of hymns selected! Only five pages were devoted to their Delta Funeral Hit Parade. It follows immediately after selected recipes for Artichoke Spread, close above Deviled Ham and Cheese Spread! I noted the first named, Bourbon Boiled Custard was left off the Top Ten Parade, possibly because of her name as, Josie Pattison Winn of Greenville and New Orleans. She also was known as the "boiled custard queen of the Mississippi Delta."        Chapter 3 is entitled: "Who Died? Stuffed Eggs, Etiquette and Delta Pate`." After the logo: "People in the Delta look better dead whether in their coffins or obituaries!" Those of Delta's great fame are sited: Mrs. Robert Shaw, Augusta Jones, grad. of Agnes Scott as Art History Major, Olivia Morgan, Bubba Boone,  Taylor Tuthill, Miss Edith Wharton. It was Augusta, who fled to the New Orleans, French Quarter as Night-Club Singer, hanging-in her own private "Hippie" Colony!  My favorite Chap 5 "Comfort Foods: There is a Balm in Campbell's Soups" as sung to the tune of "There is a Balm in Gilead." One guaranteed not listed anywhere near the Delta Hit Parade! There you will find "Amazing Grace, How Great Thou Art & Sweet Beulah Land." Scouts honor...All of those are totally banned at the St. James' Episcopal Church, and canned for the local Funeral Home Services. Filling-out at the bottom of the list..."Being Dead Doesn't Mean You Will Have Good Taste, follows, "On Eagle's Wings, In The Garden, and Beautiful Isle of Somewhere!"   As expected by more careful readers: It's all one big Enigma, to set the stage for bringing Comfort; Peace from sadness ++ One of the funniest: Chap 5's far-out: Crocheted-Bed-Pan-Award Chicken! It makes me sad to say I cannot accompany this review with some deluxe sound-track of sly side-remarks in discovering clever parallels between those gourmet foods and their few hymns of Comfort!
