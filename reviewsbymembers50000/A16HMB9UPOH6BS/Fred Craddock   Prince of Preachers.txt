 From the Introduction where Dr. Craddock promises to walk the reader through the process of selecting a text to the delivery of the sermon... to the chapters of enriching the form and delivering the sermon - he delivers the goods!  I doubt that anyone other than Fred Craddock could claim to have been mentor and role model to as many other preacher-teachers, like, Barbara Brown Taylor, Joanna Adams, John Claypool, Gail O'Day, and Thomas Long.  From his emphasis on theological content to creative imagination  ...Dr. Craddock spices up his serious language with such pithy phrases as, "A quiet voice through a cabin door, President Lincoln says we're free," is no less a shout than 76 trombones coming down Main Street on the Fourth of July! He allows to creep into his sermon, the humor of a nearby seated passenger on their flight from St. Louis to Seattle who became ill and went outside for a breath of fresh air. The response comes back, "But that didn't really happen. Did It?" Allegorically, the words from Genesis, "and Abram went out from Ur of the Chaldees," could be interpreted, "and the soul left the confines of the body."   The first time I heard Craddock, he gave his version of the earliest Black tradition of The Creation Story. He stirred my creative imagination! Just like I get to every Seminar on Style and Form, when he is on at Cherrylog Christian Church, I love to hear his latest presentation... Nowhere else can you read this but in his Preaching!
