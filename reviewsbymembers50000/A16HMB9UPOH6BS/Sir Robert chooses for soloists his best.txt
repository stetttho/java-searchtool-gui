 After two conversations with outstanding singers in Shaw's early Chorale, Tommy Pyle and Don Neuen, I knew positively they were among Shaw's closest friends! They spoke of his wondrous section of Men's Voices. It's a great delight to hear "Blow the Man Down" Paul Ukena, baritone + "Tom's Gone to Hilo" with Tommy Pyle at peak voice, "Stormalong John" with Baritone, probably came from Minnesota. All three Soloists were featured in more than one song each! Probably "Shenandoah is the most familiar, filled with Nostalia. Sir Robert knew instinctively--intuitively how to capture the mood of a Sea Shantie or any song with the right voice and inate presence of Vocal Color!
