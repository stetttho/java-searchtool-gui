 This amazing Teacher, Prophet, Writer, Friend of Students, Searcher of classic faculty personalities as Kathleen O'Connor, Anna Carter Florence, Christina Roy Yoder, has collected in one volume his best sermons, prayers, & poems! After my first time of hearing Sir Walter in St. Luke's Pentecost Sunday of 1993; again at Montreat teaching large classes of Psalms & Jeremiah; that fall teaching Psalms, Survey of OT, finally in 2003, O.T. Theology...I understood clearly his canonical, Deuteronomist, dramatically inspired adventures into the Hebrew Bible, prayers beginning every class and good-natured jousts with bright, young students + one older curmudgeon... all came from his amazing graciousness!  What more can I say of the Man but his "Inscribing the Text" has included amazing sermons from his home-town of Tilden Neb. ; Lectures to 3 Homiletics' Festivals, Sermons at Columbia, in his retiring, Psalm 73 at 2003 Colloquium, Sermons from Jeremiah, Lamentations, plus awesome, energizing Prayers! From one older, perenial student who is proud to know & love Bruegge, AMEN! Retired Chap Fred W Hood
