 Prof. Brueggemann has an big emblem of Shalom in Hebrew letters pictured in plain view on the largest wall in his double-sized office. In his "Author's Preface to the Second Edition" from 1982, he points to being convinced that "the argument made here is still pertinent to the relentlessly contemporary agenda of peace." Then he identifies three things which have changed: "The shape of the peace agenda in our society has become more urgent and more pervasive." Secondly, "The way we interpret scripture has changed a great deal in the past several years. Third, this interpreter as author of the essays has changed in various ways!" While our professor readily admits to change, within one of his longest paragraphs in my memory of recent writings he admits to becoming more cynical about the prospects of peace, and more buoyantly confessional about what what is promised by God. Adding his usual four adverbs: "We are profoundly enmeshed in a war system... enmeshed economically, psychologically, hermeneutically, and in every other way." What looks like unique simplicity at first glance becomes abundant Old & New Testament passages to enhance his Reflections from Biblical authority. He is writing as One who has become more mellow in his inclusive piling-up on top of scholarly, pastorally, psychologically passion about his insistence for Shalom... But always contained in his alternative world of social justice. This he thoughtfully expressed in a recent sermon on "Children of the Power-Bestowing God" in the Ebenezer Baptist Church next to the Martin Luther King Memorial Center!  This has been my easiest of 14 reviews for Sir Walter's Poems! Well-worth anyone's time or thought for reading. I recommend this to Prison Inmates next Sunday Eve. Chaplain Fred W Hood
