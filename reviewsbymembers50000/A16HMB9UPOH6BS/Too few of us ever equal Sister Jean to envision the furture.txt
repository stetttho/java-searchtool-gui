 From a knowledge of Archimedes the Evolutionary Lever to Satchel and Shining Morning Face, to Here's Looking at You Kid... Sister Jean runs with philosophers, body morphing, into movies, even to Wok and Roll!  Her introduction to contemporary dilemma is a quotation from Aldous Huxley: "Science is not enough, religion is not enough, art is not enuf, politics and economics are not enuf...nor is love, duty, action, however disinterested, nor sublime is contemplation." She lands upon her friend Francine, who is into body morphing for altered nose, lips, hips, hair, etc. arrives at Grand Central Station to get Jean's help with altering her inner spiritual life! Her full answer includes Gandhi, Francis of Assisi, Deganawidah, Iroquois and Irene the Greek archetype of peace.   Just like she focuses upon metaphors as sunset and sunrise, Jean contrasts sunset as retreat into bad habits; sunrise as the more unpredictabe intense light illumining dark shadows. Then to true Peacemakers as willing to encounter the  worst within  us! "From time immemorial the We Are realm contains the energies, of arche-typal stories and myths. She names doors of entry into JUMP TIME metaphors drawn from science and spiritual technologies of diff cultures. Sister Jean has boundless energy for "relationship to the We Are realm in an ever changing discovery that previously were thought to be beyond our scope."   Suffice for me is her culmination of Chap Four..."Here's Looking At You Kid." She uses movie texts from Casablanca, ++ songs of the Gershwins, to draw out her self-evolving, deeper eidetic images that few other psychologists dare not touch...Earlier she experienced in her encounter with Fritz Perls!
