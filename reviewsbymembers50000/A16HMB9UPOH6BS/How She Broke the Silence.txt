 Barbara Brown Taylor is one more uniquely creative lady! When she begins Yale's Lyman Beecher Lectures her first words are, "How shall I break the silence?" After two attention grasping questions she paraphrases words from Genesis One, hints of creative silence: "The empty air is formless void waiting to be addressed...and the earth could be all ocean, a blue waterworld in space." Bringing in the first man Adam with several other metaphors, she has already captured every poet's attention! This is the same way she preaches...from Clarksville, to Atlanta, to Boston or to Washington.  ...The last Chapter on Restraint is my favorite. There she quotes or refers to, Pascal, Rumi, Auden, Frost, Max Picard and then later tells a Jerry Garcia Story, of the "Grateful Dead" edited by Ken Kesey. Not only is she a Poet but an incredible story teller and knows the best from Robert Schumann to Samuel Barber. These last musical references are based upon "Jesus came among us as word. I believe God remains among us as music." How can you top that variety for sustaining interest of content? How can anyone ever top her way of breaking silence? Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
