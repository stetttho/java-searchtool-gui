 In reading Soul Mates and Care of the Soul I was distinctly taken back to my time of 'Doing CPE.' In realizing the deeper values of taking care of the Soul, I have made it a practise of staying close to former Monks who teach me about contemplation and meditation. I point out 2 quotes.   "A Pilgrim was walking along a road, when he passed a monk sitting in a field...seeing men working on a stone building...he said to the monk, "Who is that working on the abbey?" Answered,  "My monks. I'm the abbot."  "It's good to see a monastery going up." said the Pilgrim. "They're tearing it down," said the abbot." "Whatever for!" asked the Pilgrim.  "So we can see the sun rise at dawn," said the abbot.  As another pointed reading appears twice I will also abbreviate: "Sometimes in their chanting, monks will land upon a note and sing it in florid fashion; a syllable of text for 50 notes of chant. Melisma, they call it. Living a melismatic life in imitation of plain-chant, we stop on an experience, a place, a person, or a memory and rhapsodize in imagination! I believe these two examples say volumes about Thomas Moore as Teacher. Retired Chap Fred W Hood
