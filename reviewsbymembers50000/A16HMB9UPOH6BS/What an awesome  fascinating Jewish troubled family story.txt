 While we watched this awesome, flowing story of such a paralyzed Jewish family, we commented, it could easily have been a setting in NYC, or Chicago or even God-Forbid, Atlanta GA! There were so many scenes from broken buildings, torn-out swimming pools and Gymnasium, that a setting may have been almost from any large city of many countries. Also what wonderful metaphors that each of those were pictures of the family members!   There were also beautiful symbols and metaphors within many of the scenes of family members: When little Iho was shown bugging his young sister about her wetting-the-bed; later as she became sort-of a party to his nearly tragic death! Superb acting by those two young children!   The first clues that we caught, were the characteristic Jewish faces: the Mother acted by Orly Silbersatz Banai and Maya Maron who was the lovely, talented but troubled daughter! I can only wonder how long I shall be haunted by those awesome characters and gripping scenes? Retired Chap Fred W Hood
