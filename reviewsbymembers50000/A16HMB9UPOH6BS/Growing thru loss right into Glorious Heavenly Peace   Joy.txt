 Nearly 30 yrs ago since John first put these memorable words in print, they resonated in both his character and his teaching. In drama-filled preaching of sermons, teaching classes, conversing with his friends, he was perennially full of Hope: Shown in such titles as, "The Basis of Hope, Strength not to Faint, leading-up to, "Life is Gift." Most often his springboard was "Learning How to Handle Grief."    In 1986 we heard John for one week at Montreat during the Music Conference. In hearing his stories from these and other related sermons, I commited to write reviews for his books and getting into one of his classes. As I look backwards upon his preaching classes in McAfee School, he frequently returned to these same themes or stories for his discussions. He expressed his love for Prophets, Isaiah and Jeremiah, especially in those Commentaries of Walter Brueggemann. Most class sessions were continued thru conversations afterward also in reflection sermons to Prison Inmates.     During John's struggles thru years in Chemotherapy he maintained continual Hope, even in his final days of Rehab during Oncology!    Whenever our paths crossed, he most often concluded by "Fred, I really want to live." His early chapter, "My Basis of Hope," repeats a quote from the Jewish Rabbi in Louisville: "Despair is Presumptious!" This reprint may be continued in my other book reviews: "The Saga of Life and The Hopeful Heart." Gratefully into Eternity for his grace, peace & love, from one old friend, Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
