 The contents of Tom Long's Literary Forms of the Bible are inclusive and interesting. Although I have not heard him preach - I have heard him teach and critique other preacher's sermons. He always zeros in on the preacher's use of literary forms: Psalms, Proverbs, Narratives, Parable, Epistles.  Long quotes varied literary critics as Stanley Fish, Laurence Perrine and Robert Scholes. He makes use of Robert Alter, Walter Brueggemann, Fred Craddock, C. H. Dodd and Paul Ricoeur. I have experienced with delight his teaching of Parables focused upon the symbols of Code, Vesels, and Objects of Art!  I am tempted to chime-in to his class discussions, when he asks: "What if we switch over into another related period of American art?" Naturally, my first parallel comes from the classical or jazz fields of music that I have lived with for fifty years. Not a surprise when I am seeking-out fresh gripping illustrations to fit into the same Biblical text. He has mastered the art of Literary Approach to Preaching!   Chaplain Fred W Hood
