 When we left the Atlanta scene of ASO and Robert Shaw's profound influence on that whole city, even the state of GA. It was as if Choral Culture flew out the window of our Church Lives! When his Minneapolis Homily on "Worship and Fine Arts" appeared on NPR in 1984, I made an effort to write Sir Robert's ASO Secretary, Nola Frink, please send me a copy of "Dear People?" Within one month the Postal Service shipped an Autographed copy of Dear People... Robert Shaw! Even using my favorite spacing of three holy dots!   In  addition to several personal family pictures of the Shaws in different time frames and settings, there are noteable shots of Robert with his Glee Club in San Francisco and Fred Waring Workshop! Next an early rehearsal picture of Collegiate Chorale, calling-it "...the melting pot that sings." An early Tour Poster from the 1950-51 season, introducing that yet famous Robert Shaw Chorale wearing dress-black outfits, until they began wearing Choir Robes or Tuxedoes.   His most collectable pictures included, Norman Dello Joio, Fred Waring, Robert Merrill, Paul Hindemith, Serge Koussevitsky, and Pablo Casals. Many singers & Soloists became known and 'oft used in Major Symphony concerts. When Florence Kopleff had retired from teaching at GA State University, in the audience sat Alice Parker, Adele Addison, Saramae Endich, Clayton Krehbiel of FSU, John Wustman, Pianist++ other names from Robert Shaw Chorales.   My most fun Amazon reviews included, Brahms' German Requiem, The Bach B-Minor Mass, Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, Mozart's Requiem, Schubert Masses, Choral Masterpieces ++ other CD's. All of these musical giants became known to us and admired through rehearsals with an artistic creative, immanent touch of the only one whose choral genius will be missed, yet always an invisible Spirit in choral rehearsals, especially in Georgia! With grandioso thanks, Retired Singer and Chaplain, Fred W Hood
