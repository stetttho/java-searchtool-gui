 Fred B. Craddock is one consumate preacher of the Gospel and one committed student of the Gospels. Whenever one of his students in the quarterly Monday Morning class at the Cherrylog Christian Church asks about his style, Dr. Craddock says, "I am known as a narrative preacher, but that's not the whole story..." He often follows that with his own definition of "narrative preacher." For every Monday there are invitations sent to regulars and there will be 30-40 present for the 3 hour session and lunch.  His chosen topic usually comes around to his humorous approach into using "inductive methods" and results of opening-up the text into the context of everyday life experiences. When he has come to the point of his lecture for questions, they are asked from every table in the room--often from the mouths of the feminine half of students. His comments and stories are like the gems and jewels from an unopened treasure chest. His creatively authentic and textually authoritative suggestions are received gladly and gratefully.  This reprinted treasure becomes a continuing example and stable ingredient for all students of preaching. It is the composite we needed and hoped for, out of his lengthy practice of preaching the Gospel. His footnotes are more numerous than any of his commentaries, such as Luke. He has maintained original footnotes of sources that go back to Thomas de Quincey of 1882. They also include Barth, Bonhoeffer, Bultmann, Ebeling, Max Picard, Alfred North Whitehead, even Igor Stravinsky. What a Scholar! No wonder his teaching has changed the face of preaching!  Nobody worth their salt as preacher/teacher should be without! Fred W Hood, Retired Chaplain, Fayetteville, GA (USA)
