 After my years of professional activities were completed, I had never expected to lose memory of these unforgetable unimaginably pure images of "Changing Diapers, (Gary Snyder) or "Sailing to Byzantium" (WB Yeats) or "The United Fruit Co" (Pablo Neruda.)  After contributing my early copy to the Prison Library, I never  thought I would need see that familar print again: But...I Did!   Editors, Robert Bly, James Hillman, and Michael Meade combined a short Introduction, preceeded by these poignant thoughts from William Butler Yeats: "Those masterful images because complete/ Grew in pure mind, but out of what began? ...Old kettles, old bottles... Old iron, old bones, old rags...I must lie down where all the ladders start, In the foul rag-and-bone shop of the heart."    If being reminded in twelve selections of William Butler Yeats, added to dozens of Robert Bly, Robert Frost, Emily Dickinson, E. E.Cummings, Langston Hughes, John Keats, Stanley Kunitz, Dylan Thomas, William Blake, Walt Whitman, 500 pages of familiar and  new poems, surely is sufficient then check out groupings under a few orderly headings: "Father's Prayers for Sons and Daughters; WAR; I Know the Earth and I Am Sad; The House of Fathers and Titans; Making A Hole In Denial; Zaniness!" Completely fitting these six most unque titles are combined with ten more, equally imaginative and descriptive!  From the perspective of a Poetry Addict, into being a creator of my own poems, not yet note-worthy, I am back in "Poetry Heaven," with this second memorable discovery of rich word treasures!
