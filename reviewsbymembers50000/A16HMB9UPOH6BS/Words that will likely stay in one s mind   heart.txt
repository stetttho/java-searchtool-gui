 I noted that no reviews gave credit to the origin of these words as collected by Editor Stephanie Egnotovich and Publisher Davis Perkins of John Knox Press. When I began to meditate upon this neat outline, quotations, and thots, I was convinced it is a book I cannot be without! Emphasis upon Dr. Coffin's outline of Faith, Hope/Love; Social Justice; Patriotism, War/Peace; Plus Nature, All take me back to hear him one week of Montreat Music & Worship Conference. His preaching was complimented by his day by day-living. Mostly because I sat beside him in Bass Section of Prof Elaine Brown's fabulous Choir.   Not only did he sing with great richness of tone but also in his profound statements. My memory will hold his deeply rich voice alongside his quotations of Walter Brueggemann: "Justice is to sort out what belongs to whom and return it to them!"    Another quotation of Parker Palmer: "Relationships-not facts and reason-are the key to reality." Huston Smith: "The larger the island of knowledge--The greater the shoreline of wonder!" More than sufficient to see & hear him as the master of metaphor in writing, preaching, and conversation! Amen for this wondrously inspired collection from Bill Coffin's Wisdom treaure-chest!
