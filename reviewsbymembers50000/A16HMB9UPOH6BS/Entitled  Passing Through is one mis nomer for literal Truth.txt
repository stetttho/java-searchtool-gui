 After trying for weeks to digeste The Wild Braid as tops, then  his Collected Poems of several key periods of writing, I can only agree with the shortest ever review, telling of his unique creative insight to look inside my Personhood! (Pun-Intended)   Stanley Kunitz has more than any writer of these past few months including, Karen Armstrong, Fred Buechner, Joan Chittister, Anne Lamott, and Ferrol Sams, Jr.  SK has made one totally affective, profoundly life-change upon my writing endeavors! His poems have been handed-off to several friends, who are older, wiser, more gifted writers than I may become! My mistake not give a Perfect--10 Stars! Shalom...Chaplain Fred W. Hood
