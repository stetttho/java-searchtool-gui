 Even the hudreds of reviews have not done justice to this little Gem! Of those perused, only Stephen Haines of Canada did mostly  Justice! Of course he has super experience in reading one dozen books in August...writing more reviews than anyone else I know! Now if I can paraphrase his "Apostrophe Aberrations and Comma Confusions," this runaway #I British Best Seller even overshoots it's goal of setting us all straight on Punctuation!    "Veriy I say unto Thee this day, thou shalt be with me in Paradise." (Promise of Purgatory?) "Comfort ye, or cheer-up you lot!"..."Now I must go and get on my Lover!"...The Convict said the Judge is MAD!"     Thus and so, "The use of commas cannot be learned by rule!" The fun of commas is of course, the semantic havoc they can create when wrongly inserted... "What is this thing called, Love?" Or carelessly omitted, "He shot himself as a child." Or the role of Duncan in MacBeth, who listened with pity & concern to accounts of wounded soldier in battle of Act I: "Go get him, surgeons."  Rather than: "Go, get him surgeons."   My Profit and Fun as a Writer was from varied timing of commas, semi-colons, colons, and full-stops. Of course, I was unfamiliar with the term, Upside-down comma as an apostrophe! I remembered the patient professors who so leniently graded my papers, tests, dissertations, reflections and verbatim.  May God bless us all!
