 When I first picked this up, being conversant with "Meeting Jesus Again, For the First Time" I thot, "Don't I already know how to read the Bible after Seminars++ Seminary Profs?" Then I saw those Chapter titles: Reading Lenses: Seeing the Bible Again,(Key Word is Again. Fred) Reading the Bible and God, (I hear Sir Brueggemann say Yahweh!) Reading Lenses: History and Metaphor, (I hear Sallie McFague++ Karen Armstrong.) Also hearing my wife, Barbara who loves to read more than I do: Thoroughly! We sat at different times to read these last 2 books by Borg for Table-Talk! She gets me into places of the meatiest middle parts from each chapter into the next sermon for prison inmates!    P.130 Borg quotes my favorite Prof Bruegge, "prophetic activity of critizing and prophetic energizing!" Here is Poetry from one really Poetic Prophet! (Finally Comes the Poet!) When I see Sir Bruegge's name I know "Here is a good place for MJB to come from in writing on 'God-conscious Prophets'...Not God-crazed Prophes!"  Then he brings in orientaton/disorientation/new orientation from his example of Psa 137; "The Specter of Death" found in depths of Wisdom Writings; "It is not what you believe it is 'How Will you Live?" That was where the chills up &  down the spine began singing & humming like Pooh Bear does in his stories!  Borg makes a good bit of "hearing and seeing," in Book of Job.  He agrees with Bruegge that Job found no answers from God on Suffering! He does it all but say that Job's "I repent in dust and ashes" (42:6)is translated by Rabbis 19 different ways!(WB) My Estimation of Borg has risen like the Phoenix! Retired Chap. Fred W Hood
