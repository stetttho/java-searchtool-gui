 From the beginning scenes of flash-back within the final viewing of obviously later perspective of the narrator and an older Cole Porter; My wife and I were quickly made aware of his pitfalls of an illustrious Life.  Progressing into impressive scenes of their first meeting, I was convinced of an old adage that says "Yes! There is Love at first sight!" Within only few minutes we commented on those obviously loud notes of warning for rough sledding with his homosexuality! However I admit that seeing Kevin Cline on "Inside the Actor's Studio" prepared me for his ability to flirt with vulnerability and risk-taking with accidents which he enjoyed as an actor!   Together with Ashley Judd and Irwin Winkler he clearly pulled-off his sly escapades and sneaky ways of relating to both sexes with great diplomacy! We needed to stick with their anguishing battles between two greatly talented actors until we came to the poinancy of their mutual battles of facing death!    Over-all it has great quality to become widely accepted...but I give it only 4 stars to wait for its acceptance! Rather spine-chilling and overwhelmed at being familiar with much of his music, yet we both were unfamiliar with all his struggles thru physical weakness and sexuality overtones.
