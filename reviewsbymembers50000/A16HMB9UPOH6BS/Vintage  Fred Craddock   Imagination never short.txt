 Those who read these stories and sermons by Dr. Craddock may recognize his personality traits found in styles of his preaching. None-the-less, they are all - 'Vintage' Fred Craddock. As Barbara Brown Taylor writes in her introduction, no one can possibly emulate Fred Craddock's preaching. When he has finished telling a story in his sermons, he lowers his head, looks out over the top of his glasses with a stoney, puzzled look on his face, waiting for people's reaction. With an innocent look of interest he seems to be the model, introverted, intuitive, thinker! He gives an impression of one who just thought-it-up at the moment. Two of his best vintage sermons are both shortest and longest. When he speaks about "How long does Easter last?" he seems able to walk around in our thoughts to see if there is any Hope. His quote about Hope, as "built on the nature of God, Who calls into being what does not yet exist," fits with any good sermon based on Hope!  From the shortest one to the longest, "Living on the Edge," I could not stop reading and laughting! From the earlier shortest to future longest, they are Imaginative, 'Vintage' Craddock. Hooray!
