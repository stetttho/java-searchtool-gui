 Having read more deeply in her later two books: "Scarred by Struggle, Transformed by Hope" then "Called to Question" I can see Sister Joan thru different & totally unique eyes! She is True to Prof. Bruegge's description as that "One Fearsome Lady!   I am also struggling with "Genuine Faith" that can rest firmly upon the Apostles Creed and the Nicene Creed. Growing-up serving on Baptist Church Staffs for 50 yrs I took neither Creed very seriously. From my perspective as new Episcopalian I've arrived at deeper understanding of ways Sister Joan defines her personal Faith, Hope, and her Belief.   I dare not miss being continually "Surprised by Joy" with her metaphors of the Suffering of Jesus! She refers to "this vale of tears" in her longer and stronger chapter!   A careful thoughtful reading of her quotations by Francis Bacon, John Donne, especially Kierkegaard could possibly convince her reviewers to avoid being critical of her Catholic Value as One Super Valid Scholar! Amen for our brightly Fearsome Lady!  ...Retired Chap. Fred W Hood
