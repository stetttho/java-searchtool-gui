 If one did not believe in Santa Claus, after watching this movie and realness of Acting and beauty of Scenery then he needs to have his or her head examined! We watched a few nites earlier the Cole Porter extravaganza "De'Lovely"! Then another effort to get into the "GARDEN STATE" of New Jersey with its drugs and Sex but not sexuality, for 8-9 minutes! Then we switched to the true Christas Spirit with Santa played by Ed Asner, the big ELF by Will Ferrell, his troubled Father by James Caan and human-lovely Mother by Mary Steenburgen.   After easing out of Santa's Bag back-home in ToyLand, the little guy not much bigger than our new Great-grandson, Roger Sidney IV was on the way to becoming a new Son of Good-Old Bob Newhart! Our 2003 ELF blossomed into Leader/Fixer of Santa's Snow Mobile and Chief Cheerleader with all of Santa's Elves!     Altho Christmas was already over, we swiftly moved to the Joyous Peace, Fun Excitement of Christmas, watching Will in an Elf/Suit nearly single handedly, save the Christmas Journey for Santa and his Raindeer into the City of the Big Apple. Great Fun for James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Ed Asner, the Real-life Santa!     We soon slipped into that natural wonderment in remembering all The Historic Christmas antics of our mischievous grandchildren! From a Believer in Santa Claus ++ Retired Chaplain, Fred W Hood
