 After perusing several books on Kabbalah mysticism, not letting them 'sink-in', I went from Rabbi Kushner's Book of Letters and his Book of Words to this little jewel of Hoffman's mysical use of the 22 Hebrew letters. In his ten-age Part I he moves through developing Hebrew alphabet from the North Semitic tribes more than 3500 years ago, to Ezra the Scribe of the 5th Century, to the Midrash, to the Talmudic commentary on Exodus, to the 13th Century, Zohar (Book of Splendor)! When Hoffman arrives at the Zohar he reflects on the statement that, "God looked into [the letters] of the Torah and created the universe." From one of the early Jewish mystics, Abraham ben Samuel Abulafia he quotes the Hebrew letters as a means to arouse tremendous intuitive capabilities: "Look at these holy letters with truth and belief...[it] will awaken the heart to thoughts of godly and prophetic images." In Abulafia's approach he suggests that one "begin to combine letters, a few or many, reversing and rolling them around rapidly, until [one's] heart feels warm." In teaching dysfunctional children in their teens, I am making good use of Hebrew letters such as: Yud, Reish and Shin...Yud 	for the words 'yom' or day; names as Yoel [Joel] Yoneh [Jonah] and impulse for good and evil: yetzer hatov and yetzer hara. Also, Reish as Holy Spirit [Ruach Ha-Kadosh]; healing [rafooah] and healer [rofeh]; Shin for words as Shabbat, Shalom and simcha [joy]and shanah [year]. These last ones fit beautifully with the name of one of the girls - Kashanah! Not only is Mr Hoffman's little Jewel great for metaphorical teaching it is an avenue to reach those inquiring, inquisitive, uniquely thoughtful minds. For them to see the beautiful pictures of Karen Silver is a Plus. I strongly recommend this to teachers of Special Education! Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
