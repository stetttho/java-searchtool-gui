 After hearing the esteemed, distinguished artist, poet, preacher personality as narrator and inter-locature for Deepak Chopra and James Hillman, I've read or listened to her everyday for months! Their tour of "Mythical Journey" came to Glen Memorial the EMORY Campus Church with packed house. There was a stage full of video cameras++ beautiful backdrops for a future TV show on NPR!   Listening to her dialogue with Deepak from "The Evolving Human," becomes obvious how Houston is continually evolving in her naive talents: "for writing limericks, cooking gourmet meals or being able to talk to dogs." In fact, one of her many books is The Use of Spiritual Theraphy with Animals! Her epic-autobiog, A MYTHIC Journey has exceeded any possible evaluations in hearing her at Glen Memorial.   The high-light Chapter of Altered States lifted me thru her own experience under LSD in Greenwich Village with a guide, Michael Corner, empowering her to use a dramatic exchange as part of her practise of pschotherapy! Those pages carried me smack into the request of help from eminent Gestalt psychologist, Fritz Perls to visit him in his Central Park Apartment. All these incidents were encouraged by Margaret Mead.    Her Mentors from age 12 included awesome, Tielhard de Chardin, she knew only as, "Mr. Tayer," Joseph Campbell, Paul Tillich, Reinhold Niehbuhr, Margaret Mead, Martin Buber. Then I read that she conversed with Helen Keller, Annie  Sullivan, Mother Teresa, the Aldous Huxley Family.  It strikes me, she just as well included: The OT Prophets, Major Poets of England, even Jesus' disciples in the NT!     What an awesome, brilliant, encouraging, inspiring, genius of one single-minded personality! Semi-retired Chap. Fred W. Hood
