 After hearing Sister Jean at Emory University this Summer... and then reading and reviewing some of her recent books and Tapes, I was immediately caught-up with her story at nearly 10 yr of age reading, "The Hero With A 1000 Faces" by Joseph Campbell.   Using her creative imagination in bold efforts, trying to jump  start her goal of building-up a personal dream to be a Hero... She formed her own gang of Bike-Riders, "the other boys and me," to an unexpected healing of big 300 lb Leroy, who stuttered and  was slow to ever get out the words of his first sentence! She  loosened his  tongue, in the manner of New Testament healing like Jesus, Peter or St Paul! In one hilarious story of divine effort to raise-up the Big boy into a Leader she began an early  crusade to Change Lives!      When you combine this Jungian Psychologist, Buber's Philosopher into becoming such an early Crusader of Changing lives as well, teaching her bright students to emulate her ability to tell the stories as motivators into being another Jean Houston--type of the futuristic Shamanism. That's one huge miracle in my  book!  Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
