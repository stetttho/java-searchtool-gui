 Arland J. Hultgren has creatively produced a definitive scholarly encyclopedia focused upon Jesus' parables. In Chapter One he moves smoothly from the description of parables as a "figure of speech," either types of narrative or similtudes: "comparisons made without stories but analogies between God's Kingdom and something in this world, real or imagined." Under this inclusive description Hultgren thoroughly references thirty-eight units within the Synoptic Gospels. Two Scholar- Professors of EMORY UNIVERSITY'S Candler School of Theology consider this text as "undoubtedly the best book available on the parables... a treasure for both scholars and preachers."  The Author singles out five story-units as being the Revelation of God, six as the Wisdom of God, five more being Parables of the Kingdom. He places the others under titles - Parables of Exemplary Behavior, Life Before God, (the longest) the Final Judgement, and Allegorical Parables. Within each unit our versatile scholar includes an exegetical commentary, a shorter exposition, numerous footnotes, plus a greatly varied, selected bibliography. (The total general Bibliography totals over 200!)  Since my early days as layman and seminary student, followed by church ministry and chaplaincy, to present status of hospital chaplain and student of Candler classes in Jesus' Parables and Devotional Classics, I have searched for such a treasure chest of insightful scholarship on the Synoptic Gospels. EUREKA!
