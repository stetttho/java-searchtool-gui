 Although I totally disagree with his descriptive adjectives over earlier, Michael Caine...that Jude Law's version of Alfie is all three: "watered-down, scrubbed and sanitized" gigolo/playboy in relating to healthy Lassies, Sienna, Marisa & Susan, it appears to me that each one used him in widely divergent ways!   I cannot agree with any reviewer that Jude Law remotely fulfills his "sanitized, scrubbed, watered-down" idea of this obsessive, compulsive character; Even with an over-healthy, wealthy, Susan Sarandon! In fact, his escapades left me unimpressed, under-sea, at-odds with Director Shyer's Movie! Enough...an older retired, Chaplain Fred W Hood
