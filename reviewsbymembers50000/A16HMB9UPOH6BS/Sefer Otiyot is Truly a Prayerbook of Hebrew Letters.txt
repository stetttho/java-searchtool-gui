 The opening words from the Book Cover, speak literal truth: When you open the old prayerbook-like pages of "The Book of Letters"  you enter a special world of sacred tradition and religious feeling. More than just symbols, all 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet overflow with meanings and personalities all their own.   "The SEFER OTiYOT exist independently of ink and paper or even words..." The good Rabbi once again spins out his volumes of meaning, much the same as he does in his Introduction to BOOK of WORDS! "The SEFER OTiYIOT (written in Hebrew letters) have been sources of wisdom, meditation, and fantasy for the Jewish peole all through their history... One mystical alphabet after another. I hope with this book to keep that tradition alive for so many who have forgotten even some of the letters."  Each beautifully ornamented Hebrew letter from ALEF...To SHIN... to TAV, is carefully introduced almost in Rabbinical language! I only quote from SHIN: "Shin is the letter just before the end. It is the fitting together of all the parts. The restoration of all the scattered shards. This is  Shin: Peace (Hebrew) SHALOM. Completion. Wholeness.   Rabbi Kushner likely spent many hours, in many days, maybe even in many years, beautifully, creatively putting together these  mystical letters and words of the Hebrew Aleph-Bait. What a real treasure of spiritual depth, learning, and wisdom in few pages. Sing-cerely, Retired Chaplain Fred W. Hood
