 "In the beginning" I didn't cotton to this drinking, bitter/sour bitchy, being-in-control, Mother of 4 neat daughters! As we got into the story, behind the story, I came alive to Terry as being one fluent Actress fulfilling to the hilt, her assigned Rolex  personality! From being a calculating witchy/bitchy, she began shining thru as the role model for daughters, unconsciously even unaware of adopting her calculating processes!   Kevin Costner played his role again to the hilt, as cantankerous old, retired baseball-star, set in his ways to bounch-off her predictable drinking, getting caught sitting in her Bathroom as she was getting out of the Shower!   From the multitudinous scenes playing out both funny vs serious conversations between Mother and her four sharply thinking young Daughters, my Favorite was Popeye the youngest!   All-in-all, quite a satisfying Movie, with even Surprise ending plus growth experiences from perspectives of Mother Terry over all four daughters and Vice/versa! It will be interesting if it makes it to the Oscars! From Hard-to-please DVD Viewer,  Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
