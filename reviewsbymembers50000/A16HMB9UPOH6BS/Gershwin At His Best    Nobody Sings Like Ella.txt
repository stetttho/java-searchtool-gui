 When Ira Gershwin first heard these, his comment was, "Now I know how really good our songs were..." When you hear these songs next to any other CD, You can be certain, that "Nobody sings them like Ella & Louie!"  After listening a dozen times in the car, I realized my depression was being lifted! When I got to "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off, and A Foggy Day in London Town", I was singing along! Those are the 2 Highlights for me, alongside the early ones, "I Got Plenty of Nuttin, Summertime, There's A Boat That's Leaving Soon for New York and I Was Doin All Right!"  The real winners are those in which Louie plays the tune on his horn first before or after singing...1,4,11,13,15...On 15, he sings, "I was doin all right, but Now I'm doin a little Better!"  Chalk this CD up for a Great One in History for Gershwin!  Retired Chap Fred W Hood
