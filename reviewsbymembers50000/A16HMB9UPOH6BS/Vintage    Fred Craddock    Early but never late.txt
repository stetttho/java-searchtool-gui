 Ones who read these stories and sermons by Dr Craddock may recognize some of his traits of personality in his styles of preaching. None-the-less, they are all, 'Vintage Fred Craddock.'  As Barbara Brown Taylor writes, no one can possibly copy the style or practices of Fred Craddock's preaching. When he has finished telling the story, he drops his head, looks over his glasses with a stony look on his face waiting for the people's reaction...almost like he has just thought it up at the moment! Two of his best vintage from earlier years that I remember are both the shortes and the longest. When he speaks about "How long does Easter last?" he prods around in our thoughts to see if there is still Hope? From that one to the longest "Living on the Edge," I could not stop reading and laughting!   Lasting from past to future, they are vintage Craddock. Hooray!  Chaplain Fred W Hood
