 Whether one agrees about his underlying motives for writing two top-notch best-sellers or Not--You reviewers, please give this fellow, Malcolm GLADwell his due rewards. I am an Intuitive and  equally a Feeling and Thinking person. It seems he uses for his examples the works of a wide divergence of scientific study! For me his unique style soars with his Five Point Inventory and longest Chapter: "Paul Van Riper's Big Victory!"    This is especially true in "Perils of Introspection" followed by two Insight Puzzles. Becoming the assumed professor in, "Primed For Action" he describes a simple test to affect one's behavior! As Prison Chaplain, we sought ways to discover how we may affect Inmates' behavior while in prison. Later the author draws upon the Power of Imagination to picture the faces of Marilyn Monroe and Albert Einstein! Closely related is an appropriate story of Silvan Tompkins and Paul Ekman who became effective in reading the faces of Bill Clinton. They perceived him as Peck's Bad Boy, who wanted to be caught with his hand in the cookie-jar.   Ironically they were right! This is one "layered story" as Fred  Craddock, tops in his field of Preaching, teaches his Theology  students about Parables. Chapter 5 "Kenna's Dilemma" gets unique stories on taking "A Second Look at First Impressions." Added to President Clinton, we see the inside of Coca-Cola's contest with Pepsi, the testing of new products from Christian Brothers  in, "The Chair of Death," in foods, Automobiles as Ford's Edsel and Columia records signing of Kenna to produce his recording of the "New Sacred Cow."           Finally I came to his Conclusion: "Listening with your Eyes" and his involved story of the professional Trombonist, named Abbie Conant, I was really Hooked. Having scored with Bill Clinton and Dick Morris as the ideal political pollster, I looked at all of Gladwell's stories of reading person's faces and emotions in their responses-- Now I am convinced!     A "first impressionist" has enough going for my five stars and more. My accolades to my other reader friends! Hooray for this BLINK and his First THINK!
