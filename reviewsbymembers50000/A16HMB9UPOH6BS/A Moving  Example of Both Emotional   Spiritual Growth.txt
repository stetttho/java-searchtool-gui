 Following the top-inclusive Tom Reynolds review is a tall order! Yet I looked for deeply rooted emotional++ spiritual traits for both characters! Writer & director accomplished fabulous colors of insight into the personhood of Catch and Sharon.   When one review likened him to Jesus, I forgot he acted the role of Jesus in Passion. As he first showed his personal interest in Sharon, she commented on his smile; He really became lit-up! The director makes Catch into the person, you can readily embrace. He illustrates this even more, as they walk, along the street, holding hands. He easily greets all the passer-byes, encouraging her to do the same.    Sharon, true to Actress J. Lopez, plays-out gutsy, toughness, as her spiritual intensity changes to Godly patience, just when her partner recognizes it in a new-found treatment of those street tough boys, are being arrested and placed into squad car!     From my perspective, viewing Lopez's best DVD's then seeing her twice on "Inside the Actors' Studio," this became my first time  watching her become a three-dimensional complexity of emotional, physical,and spiritual personhood! She was capable to portray an Enigma as Abused Lover, yet Police-woman holding in-reserve her personal tragedy. All-in-all both characters portrayed emotional growth spiritual confidence! Without doubt this shines as her best effort toward becoming an example of the real thing. Sing-cerely from the Retired, Chap. Fred W Hood
