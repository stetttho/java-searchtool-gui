 In the late 1970's when Jessye Norman first appeared as the Diva of Sopranos, Robert Shaw, himself called her the "greatest Voice of the 20th Century!" Since we are now into the 21st Century, it is time we come to know her better thru her natural genre from the Southern Style of Black Spirituals. After playing her early CD for several years on the way to and fro to GA Diagnostic Prison, I still get overwhelmed by her awesome sounds singing, "And I Could'nt Hear Nobody Pray" ; "There's A Man Going Round, Taking Names" ; "There Is A Balm In Gilead" ; "Walk With Me , Children" ; "Hush, Somebody's Calling My Name" and of course...  "Were You There..."  If you wish to find an Ideal Christmas Gift or Birthday Gift for a Southern Girl... This is IT!  She seems to get better and better in every Christmas Video from First Baptist Church of Augusta, GA.     Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
