 Whenever I chance to listening to the "Kyrie Eleison, Dona Nobis Pacem, Sanctus...SAHnctus...SAHNCTOOS!" I must admit they are so deeply entrenched into my bloody emotions...They move from deep in the Pit of my Stomach, to my heart, back to my Spinal-column, finally into my wee bits of Cerebreal Memory! Since 1970's, I first began to listen to Shaw's glorious 33 1/3 RCA Recording: It either sent cold chills or warm thoughts start me to singing or meditating!    Finally in mid-1970's in Westminister Choir College, we began to rehearse in the Cavernous Temple University Cathedral with its' reverb of 35-40 seconds! Alongside those awesome soloists from NYC, adding to the Orchestra from NY Philarmonic, we thoroughly enjoyed heading: Tommy Pyle, Ara Bebarian, Florence Kopplev, and tenor Seth McCoy! Whenever we took a break I had chances to chat with Tom Pyle or Seth McCoy. They gave great Respect, Love and Admiration  for Sir Robert. I finally began to understand him as both a kind person and tremendously gifted-human Being...The Only one of his kind!    When we first recorded, "The Christmas Nativity" in the Atlanta  Symphony Chorus, I often caught a glimpse of tears trickling  down his expressive face, near the ending of Dona Nobis Pacem! He both gave all of himself and asked his singers to do as much from themselves! With fond memories, retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
