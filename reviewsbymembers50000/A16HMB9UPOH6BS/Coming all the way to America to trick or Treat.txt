 That one-liner came from the Screaming Afro-American who played the key role of Mateo. He was one character who held the plot of the awesome healing acceptance, curious creativity shown by two Angelic Daughters, and wrenching grief or both Irish, Mother and Father! We sat straight thru the lengthy, emotionally draining story to comment..."This was heavy and emotional but definitely serves as excellent example of our other English, German/French, Italiano and African Families who settled IN America!"   It called to mind: ROOTS; A TREE Grows In Brooklyn; CARUSO; and many others from the history of Music, Drama, Literature, even our Western culture of California. I would dearly love to give it more than 5 Stars! ...From an experienced reviewer, musician, and Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
