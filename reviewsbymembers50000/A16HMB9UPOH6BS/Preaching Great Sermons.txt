 Where else might you find sermons by Karl Barth, Barbara Brown Taylor, Buechner, John Claypool, William S. Coffin, Fred Craddock, Both Buttricks, Gardner Taylor, plus two by Harry Emerson Fosdick? Sermons on, A Sprig Of HOPE, Blindness, Fundamentalists, Laughter, Life As A Gift, Death of Two Sons, Holy Angels. I have only 10-12 collections of sermons on my bookshelf. This neat one, full of examples, surpasses all of them!  From challenging to persuasive, to stem-winding! From Doug Nelson's "Raging Faith" to Steimle's exciting, "Eye of The Storm" to Dr. Fosdick's lengthy, "Shall Fundamentalists Win?" Tom Long and Cornelius Plantinga have edited a Superb collection of diamonds, emeralds, rubies and Jewels! Chaplain Fred W. Hood
