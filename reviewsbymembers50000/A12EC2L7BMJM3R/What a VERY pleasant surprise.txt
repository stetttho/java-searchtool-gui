 I'll admit that when my husband brought home "To Whom it May Concern", I was very skeptical to say the least. I expected either  techno-pop, a Madonna-clone, pure country, or a fifties throw-back album.  Also... well look at Lisa Marie, she looks so dainty and quiet... I expected a cute, little-girl voice... I was very wrong!  The music is very good, solid pop-rock, and as others have mentioned, is vaguely reminiscent of Sheryl Crow, as much for the sound as for the depth of the lyrics. And that VOICE!!! Once you've heard Lisa Marie sing, you will always recognize that voice.  There are lots of great singers out there, but to strike a chord in the hearts of listeners, a singer has to have that "something" special in their voice. Lisa Marie has "it", and she sings with such emotion, about songs that are obviously emotionally charged for her.   Although "Lights Out" is the most media-hyped track from the album, I have found myself humming other tunes, after only hearing them once or twice. The songs have haunting melodies, brilliant arrangement, and the lyrics will blow you away.  Hats off to Lisa Marie! I hope the critics will be fair to her and judge this album for what it is: An album by Lisa Marie - NOT Elvis Presley. There is no reason to compare the two performers, other than for their genetic link. Lisa Marie has a style all her own, with more than enough talent to step out of the shadow of her father.  Buy it! You won't be sorry!
