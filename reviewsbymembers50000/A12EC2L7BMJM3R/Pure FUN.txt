 Joe Dirt is NOT intellectual, it's not necessarily witty either. It's just plain fun!  David Spade plays his character with such casual credibility that you find yourself feeling sorry for his "redneck DNA."  Dennis Miller is perfect in his role as the wise-cracking radio show host who first insults Joe Dirt ruthlessly, and ultimately finds himself charmed by Joe's naivete.  Kid Rock does a nice job in his small role, and the cameos by Christopher Walker and Patricia Arquette are pure pleasure!  This movie is just for laughs, and why not?
