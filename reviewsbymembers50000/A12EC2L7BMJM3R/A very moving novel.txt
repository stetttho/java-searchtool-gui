 Written by Renate Dorrestein, one of Holland's best-loved and decorated novelists, this English translation of "A Heart of Stone" is a poignant, shocking, yet unflinching look at the effects of mental illness, it's devastating potential and it's aftermath.  In this novel, Ellen, the central character toggles from the present back into the past 25 years ago to tell the story of how tragedy struck her family. In the present, Ellen struggles to come to grips on the reality of what happened to her family, while just a strongly struggling NOT to remember it. In the past narration, Ellen describes her mother's descent into severe mental illness, and how everyone around the family seems to uncomfortable or unable to do realize what is happening to her children.  I can't say too much about the story without giving away the plot, but I have to tell you that I read it in just a few hours. Once I had been given a "teaser" about the family's past, I had to keep reading. This novel IS disturbing, and does not pull any punches in detailing the helplessness children feel when their parents fail them so hideously.  I can't imagine anyone who reads this novel not being moved enought to post a review about it. It's simply that powerful.
