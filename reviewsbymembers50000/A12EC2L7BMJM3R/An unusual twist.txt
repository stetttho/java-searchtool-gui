 I had never heard of Jilliane Hoffman, but bought "Retribution" based on a book store review. I wasn't disappointed. The novel tells the story of a high-powered prosecutor who has pulled her life together after a decades-old brutal rape and slashing, only to find herself face to face with her rapist again when he is accused of a string of serial murders.  Having changed her name and her looks, "Chloe", now CJ, wonders if he recognizes her.  She must decide whether to remove herself from the case to avoid a conflict of interest, or stay in and fight to put him away forever.  Ms. Hoffman gives an inside look at the struggles of a victim of violence and how it affects every aspect of their life.  There is nice "love interest" in the story also, which helps to break the unrelenting tension of this novel.  The twist at the end is somewhat expected, but still keeps the reader riveted until the very end.  I wondered if any other readers noticed that the sewing up of the details left a little room for suspicion that there could be a sequel to this novel?  ****WARNING SLIGHT PLOT GIVEAWAY INT THIS PARAGRAPH*** I wondered about the anonymous caller, who is revealed near the end.  Of course we know HOW he knew was Bill Bantling was doing, but wasn't he supposed to report what he knew?  Also, if he didn't because he was insane and had other plans for the future, how could he so completely copycat Bantling's crimes? How do we know for sure that it was Bantling he was copycatting?***** Overall, a GREAT read, I couldn't put this book down, the courtroom drama was great, the characters were solid and human, and I look forward to Ms. Hoffmans's next offering.
