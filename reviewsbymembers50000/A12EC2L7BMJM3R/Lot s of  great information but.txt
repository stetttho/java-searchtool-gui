 This film is a wonderful tribute to a man who has never received the credit he deserved for inventions that we still use and take for granted today.  He was not primarily interested in money or the business side of his inventions and therefore, others whose names you will readily recognize, received credit and a place in history which should have been shared.   My biggest problem with the movie was the irritating heavily-accented voice-overs of Mr. Tesla's diary entries, and quotes by Stacy Keach.  I found it very distracting to have to try to interpret the accent, and would have found it much more entertaining if Mr. Keach would have simply used his normal speaking voice.   Otherwise this film is worth watching and you will be amazed at the genius of Nikola Tesla.
