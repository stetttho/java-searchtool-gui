 Just when you think you have this novel figured out, Michael Connelly throws another curve ball so efficiently that you'll feel as if the wind has been knocked out of you! Add to that the wonderful central character who is delightfully unsure of his decisions, supporting characters who act and react so unlike one would expect, and you have the perfect mix for a suspenseful "who-dunnit and why?" Mr. Connelly has a way of pulling the reader into the story and making them want to know what happened to the little boy who ended up in a shallow grave so many years ago.  What a great read, and the ending will surprise you... Kudos to Michael  Connelly!
