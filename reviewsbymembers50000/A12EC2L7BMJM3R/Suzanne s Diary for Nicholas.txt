 Wow! What a change of pace for James Patterson! I've always been a fan of Mr. Patterson's and I'll admit that after reading the jacket of this book, I had my doubts about whether or not I'd find this novel believable... 10 pages into the novel, I had no doubts!  I read the novel in one afternoon because it lived up to the "can't put it down" description that so many novels claim.  The characters were wonderfully developed, and watching the change in Katie's feelings as she gets to "know" Suzanne through the diary was a masterful study in human behavior and emotion. Matt's tormented character could pluck the heartstrings of the most jaded reader, and Suzanne....well, you just have to read the book to understand her part in this novel. I laughed, I cried, but most of all I thoroughly enjoyed this novel!  I was so impressed with Mr. Patterson's ability to write in the person of a female with such completely convincing authenticity!  To sum it up: BUY THIS BOOK!!! Or borrow it....whatever you need to do to read it....You won't regret it!
