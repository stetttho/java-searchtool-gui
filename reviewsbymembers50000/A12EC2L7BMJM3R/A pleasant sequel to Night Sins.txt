 This is a good novel, and after reading "Night Sins", I felt compelled to read the sequel as soon as possible. I didn't feel quite that the main character was quite as well-developed as Megan in "Night Sins," but I still enjoyed the novel and had I read the books in reverse order, I doubt I would have been so critical. Any follow up to "Night Sins", which was a wonderfully suspenseful novel, would be difficult. I still recommend this book, it's a good read!
