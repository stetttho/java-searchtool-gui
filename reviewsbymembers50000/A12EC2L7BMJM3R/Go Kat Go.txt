 Nothing less yet so much more than I had expected from Kat Bjelland and her new crew! I was an avid Babes in Toyland fan, but [sorry Lori] always skipped Lori Barbero's odd tracks to get back to Kat's songs. On her own creatively, Kat Bjelland shines in what she does best, bending sounds and words to create a feeling and an in-your-face attitude. The songs are so diverse as well, opening with a ...song called "Gone Away" which proves that Kat HASN'T, complete with her signature shriek as a chorus, then moving on to slower compositions such as "Rosacea", and the absolutely brilliant "Haunted."  Each track has it's own identity but that's what makes the album so fresh sounding, there is no underlying theme... Top that off with a "hidden" track at the end of the CD and you've got a really great effort by Katastrophy Wife!  If you liked Babes in Toyland at all, you will LOVE "Amusia."  It's the voice of a more mature Kat, who's not exactly ready to be June Cleaver either!  Go Kat!!!
