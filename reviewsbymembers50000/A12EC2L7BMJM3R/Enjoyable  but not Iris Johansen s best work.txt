 This novel is a decent read, but too long for the plot and its resolution. Kate Denby, the central character, as a previous  reviewer mentioned, really is too young to realistically have made it where she is in her career and her life.  Also her wishy-washy fastasizing between Noah and Seth goes against the grain of the rest of her personality, which is portrayed as very determined and clear-headed.  Finally, the character of the man who is stalking her is simply ridiculous and doesn't "fit" within the framework of the story. Perhaps that was the author's intention: in a novel of modern science and conspiracies, to have a very spiritually "evil" villain, but it just doesn't work.  I am a big fan of Iris Johansen, but this novel, while mildly entertaining, was not up to her typical cutting-edge, mysteries with crisp well-defined and realistic characters.
