 This is a very unusual novel by Dean Koontz, and that's saying something.  This novel is not written at all in Dean Koontz' typical voice, but for that reason, perhaps, it is even more compelling! I had just completed "False Memory" also by Mr. Koontz, and began reading this novel, and the differences in writing style only serve to highlight the author's uncanny abilities!  The central character who is named Odd Thomas, is such a heart-warming, quirky character, that you will fall in love with him immediately. Of course, no Dean Koontz novel would be complete without some darkness, and this novel delivers this on more than one level.  Odd, must try to save the town he lives in from a horrible massacre-to-be that only he is aware of.  It is obvious that the novel was written with the current state of humanity [or inhumanity] of the world in mind, but it this theme is so well couched within the character, Odd, that is doesn't come off sounding "preachy".    Odd is just that,a very odd young man, and seems to be, although very intelligent, somewhat naive and untouched by the harsher elements of the world, even though he comes in close contact with them. He possesses a sixth sense which allows him to communicate with the dead who often appear to him, so that he can bring to light the circumstances of their death, thus freeing them to "move on."  His dream of graduating from his current position as a short order cook to a tire salesman makes the reader feel pity for him, but by the end of the novel, after the secrets of his childhood are revealed, there is only awe for this character who is so pure of heart.   I read this novel in one day! I found its style a bit unusual at first.....then simply magnetic! Warning: It doesn't have a perfectly happy ending that we often see from Dean Koontz, but for some reason, that simply makes the novel that much more compelling.
