 Having read Traci Lords' autobiography, and being very disappointed by it,  I was a little wary when I heard that Jenna Jameson was writing one too. But after seeing her on The E! I couldn't wait for the book!  Jenna Jameson gives the most honest, humorous, tragic, erotic, and yes sometimes repulsive insight into the life of porn star.  She has a "no-holds barred", "no-excuses" attitude which makes the novel the success that it is.  Who hasn't wondered why a girls gets into the porn industry? And who hasn't wondered how they deal with that life, how it affects them, and how they can ultimately find their way out of it in one piece?  Jenna answers all of these questions and MORE.   She doesn't "blame" anyone for her choice to go into the porn industry, although she doesn't simply recommend it for everyone either.  She tells about the good times and the bad times in equal measure, and is very open and her relationships, and how her line of work affected them. She also discusses her bisexual relationships with the same "no excuses, no regrets" attitude.  Although I can understand how some people might find parts of the book shocking, my hat is off to Jenna for giving an honest look at her life.  She knows when to laugh at herself also, and although she does take herself very seriously, she does this is in a very honest way, not like a primadonna.   The sections of the novel in which Jenna, her father and brother share memories are very interesting, as they give the reader insight into the lack of stability,cohesion and communication which left Jenna so vulnerable at a very early age.  I highly recommend this book. Whether you approve of pornography or not, I think you will close the book feeling more respect for Jenna Jameson that you would ever have imagined possible.
