 An excrutiatingly realistic look at grief from the eyes of the main character Sophie Stanton, a young woman who has recently lost her husband to cancer.  For the reader, this novel is so well writtten that in the early stages of the book, her downward spiral is heart-wrenching. But readers, please stick with this book. Sophie does eventually pick herself up, find talents and strengths she never dreamed of, and most importantly, she finds that there are others who need help more than she. To fill her time, and stave off her loneliness, she volunteers to be a "Big Sister", and meets a rebellious, jaded teenager named Christine, not the soft, cuddly toddler she had envisioned. But Christine proves to be the perfect match for Sophie, showing her that there is more than one type of loss and that some grief comes from living rather than dying. Other characters, such as Sophie's long-time friend and former college roommate, Ruth, as well as Sophie's mother-in-law, Marion, both women that Sophie had perceived as "perfect", in time show their foibles.  And then there is Drew, a handsome actor in the local theatre who could either mend or break Sophie's heart.    This is an incredible first novel, with wonderful imagery, thought provoking insights and a satisfying ending, which is filled with realistic optimism, rather than fairytale perfection.  I can't wait to read Lolly Winston's sophomore novel!
