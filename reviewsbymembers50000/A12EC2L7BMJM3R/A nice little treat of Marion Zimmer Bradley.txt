 Being a huge MZB fan and a lover of her "Mists of Avalon" series, I bought this lovely little book simply because it was Marion Zimmer Bradley. If you are looking for a complex, substantial novel, this book may not be for you. It is after all, a short story, revisiting Lythande the sorcerer/magician, and not a huge novel in and of itself. This novel is a really fun read, because it gives the reader a glimpse of Marion Zimmer Bradley's world, but does so with a bit of humor.  "Gratitude of Kings" is full of symbolism, and I feel that the book's message is very clear.  This is simply a delightful, "not too deep" novel, and for those unaccustomed to MZB's work, a quick look at her ability to make fantasy completely believable, and another of her fine offerings which focus around the power of women, whatever form that power may take!
