 In "Indelible", Karin Slaughter gives us a wealth of colorful, believable characters, as well as a great storyline, tension, and carefully crafted "flashbacks" which make up the bulk of the novel.  We get a very perceptive glimpse into small-town prejudices and how strongly they affect the story's male lead character, Jeffrey Tolliver, as well as other characters in the story.   Sara Linton, as Jeffrey's ex-wife, has her own past horrors and baggage, and these issues are also described in flashbacks into the past.    The present-time hostage situation throws Jeffrey and Sara together again, in a struggle to survive, and the past and it's secrets are the major catalyst in the standoff.   This novel is a real nail-biter and I can't stress enough how well the characters are fleshed-out and how well the past and present stories relate to each other.   The dialogue is crisp and believable, the story is resolved in a satisfying manner. I read this book in two nights. It was that hard to put down!
