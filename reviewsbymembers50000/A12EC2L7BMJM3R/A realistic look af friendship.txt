 I liked this book, for the exact same reasons that others who reviewed it did not.  Although there are many women who have the type of best friend with whom they share every detail of their lives, there are just as many who love each other so much that they honor the idea of keeping secrets from each other. In contrast to an earlier reviewer's experience, my very best friend and I were inseparable from the age of 5, but we could not have been more different, and there were things I never knew about her until she was terminally ill. Only then  did she feel that she could/should share certain "secrets" with me.  This book is a testament to the fact that not all women "tell all" even to their best friends.  The two main characters, Clare and Sally, although very different in temperament and social upbringing, are very similar in their inability to develop deep emotional ties. Sally seeks to fill her emptiness by having children and avoiding unpleasantness, while Clare seeks to fill hers by surrounding herself with the cold reality of death in her work with AIDS patients, and in relationships with men she cannot have. Both are deeply scarred and  shaped by their childhood experiences, and this book explores the effects of poor parenting in an unflinching manner. I enjoyed the book, although I would have preferred a more concrete ending. For a first novel, it is quite good, and I would certainly recommend it. It would make a great book for a women's book club, for I would imagine the debating about the depth of the character's devotion to each other and what they "should" have shared would be a hot topic!
