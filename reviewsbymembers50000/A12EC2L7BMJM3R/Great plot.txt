 Michel Connelly writes an thriller with an interesting plot twist and unlikely characters.  Henry Pierce works in a lab which is involved in a technological race to develop the first molecular computer. [There is real research on-going in this field interestingly.] If his company is the first to create such devices, he will become wealthy beyond his wildest dreams.   All of the hours in the lab have taken a toll on his relationship, and he and his girlfriend and fellow co-worker have split up. Henry gives her his home and moves into a condo where he is assigned a new telephone nubmer.   As soon as he plugs in his telephone, he begins to get calls for "Lilly" and from the nature of the calls, it becomes obvious that not only is Lilly involved in the sex trade, but that she has vanished.   Henry is intrigued and begins a quest to find Lilly which leads him through a series of more and more dangerous encounters which keep the reader on the edge of his or her seat.   A great read, with nice plot twists!
