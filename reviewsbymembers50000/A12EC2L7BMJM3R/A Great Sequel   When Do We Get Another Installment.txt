 What a sequel! I stumbled onto "The Plague Tales" by accident and was immediately hooked by all of the characters, especially Alejandro, who is one of the most genuinely human characters I've encountered in a fictional novel. Throughout "The Plague Tales" he struggles with the conflict between his passion for learning, devotion to medicine and his moral values. I also enjoyed the "future" characters, Dr. Janie Crowe and her assistant/friend Caroline. The only complaint I had was wanting to know more about the future characters, and I got my wish in "Burning Road." In this sequel, we learn about the cause of "The Outbreaks" in the future and follow Janie as she trys to track the cause of a mysterious illness affecting a certain group of young boys, while dealing with her true feelings for her lover Bruce and her attorney/friend Tom. Alejandro is back, with yet more dilemas to work through, and the character Kate, his "adopted" daughter takes on  rich, deep dimensions. In both the past and future storylines, we meet new and exciting characters, revisit old characters in greater detail, and of course, encounter new enemies and dangerous situations.  In "Burning Road" the novel seems to spend more equal amounts of time between the past and the future. As with "The Plague Tales", Ms. Benson weaves past and present together in an incredibly artful and satisfying manner. This is simply a great novel, but I definitely suggest that for maximum enjoyment, one should read "The Plague Tales" first.  Also, be sure to have a copy of "Burning Road" ready, because you won't want to wait to spend more time with these characters! I'd love to read another installment to this story!
