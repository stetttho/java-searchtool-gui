 Alison Smith's unflinching memoir about the violent, accidental death of her brother is almost like looking into her soul.  She writes with such candor about her experience, the reader actually feels her pain and confusion.  She handles her parents' inability to help her deal with  her brother's death with great compassion by detailing how each of them is so profoundly affected by a loss that they cannot understand, accept or find spiritual comfort for.  Alison's growth through adolescence is masterfully represented, as is her very tastefully written realization of her sexual orientation.   Alison's confusion at the loss of her brother, brush with an eating disorder, and guilt at being the one left behind are written without the least bit of self-pity, which makes her story even more moving.  As other readers have remarked, I would really like to know more about how Alison fared after her graduation from high school [the informational portion of the novel ends at this stage in her life].   Very clearly, she has found some sort of peace with her brother's death and for our benefit, has been able to write a very powerful memoir of the struggles she encountered dealing with grief, loss, her spirituality, and "coming of age". This is a  great "book club book", as there are many topics open for discussion.   A wonderful novel which you will read and most importantly, remember, long after you have turned the last page!
