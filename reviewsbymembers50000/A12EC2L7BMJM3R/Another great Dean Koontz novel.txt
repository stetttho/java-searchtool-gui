 This is Dean Koontz' most chilling book yet. False Memory makes the reader wonder just how far anyone is from insanity! This book was so creepy at first, I had to read a few pages, then put it down, then read a few, etc. But after the plot developed further, I wasn't able to put it down.   Don't start this book alone! You'll want someone to hug after the first few pages!  My only critique, is that after the first third of the novel, "the hunt" takes a slower pace than I would have liked. I would have preferred that the suspense of the actual plot had been held out longer, although this may have made the novel too scary to read!
