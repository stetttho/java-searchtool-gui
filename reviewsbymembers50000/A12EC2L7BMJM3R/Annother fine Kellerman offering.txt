 This novel delivers in every way! It starts with a hook that makes you simply HAVE to turn the pages. The character development is as always with Mr. Kellerman, superb!  As in any series, it is always great to revisit "old friends" in terms of the main characters, and learn new things about them. This book has a great beginning, middle and end...what more can you ask for? I don't give out plot information in my reviews, I only say that this book is definitely a must-have for any Kellerman fan or any suspense novel fan as well. Kudos to Kellerman!
