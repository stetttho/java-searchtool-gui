 This, the first installment in Nora Robert's Three Sisters Island Trilogy will satisfy any fan of romance fiction. Also, she will gain a new following because of the subject matter which is central to the story, namely witchcraft. We're not talking about old hags with warts on their noses here either! These are modern day women who live very modern lives, but also are practitioners of "The Craft."  This novel is a very positive one for fans of Wicca, as there is often reference to the adage "Do no harm", as well as the women having to restrain from using their power for personal gain or when they simply know that they should let nature take it's course. Nell is a captivating character, seeking to find her own power, both as a woman and to her surprise as a witch.  She finds her way from a loveless, abusive marriage to Three Sisters Island and makes new life for herself, but not without a visit from the past.  The two other strong central characters, Ripley and Mia are well developed and in some ways more interesting than Nell, and I look forward to the next two installments to find out more about them.  The novel is a bit heavy-handed when it comes to the characters swooning into the arms of handsome men, and that does seem out of character for their strength, but you'll find yourself rooting for Nell to find romance anyway!
