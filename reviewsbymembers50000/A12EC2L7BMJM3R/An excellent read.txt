 This novel is wonderful for anyone, but especially appealing for those of us who are in book discussion clubs. The novel is open for personal interpretation on many levels. Ms. Chevalier's presentation of life in a very difficult time is tempered with one girl's strong sense of identity even as she responds to duty imposed by family hardship. There are many levels to this story, and while Griet is the main focus, the fear of Vermeer's wife and her insecurities about her place in her husband's priorities are very interesting, as is the character Vermeer himself. A wonderful novel!
