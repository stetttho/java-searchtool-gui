 This movie explores the complex bonds of siblings and how they relate to each other and their parents. On the surface, it seems like a comedy, but it has more than enough moments to make one pull out the box of tissues. Underneath the comic relief we see the frustrations, jealousy, misunderstandings and fierce that love that make up the relationships we have with our siblings. It explores love, guilt, fear, anger, happiness and loss with equal scrutiny. After watching this movie, I immediately wanted to watch it WITH my two sisters! It's a really good way to take a close look at our own families and how we relate to each other. Great acting buy the female leads and a wonderfully touching performance by the late Walter Matthau.
