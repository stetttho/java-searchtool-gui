 Heaven and Earth, the second installment in the Three Sisters Island Trilogy by Nora Roberst is even better than the first book.  Again, Wicca is a large part of this novel and will give witches a good name!  The supernatural scenes are well written and as believable as you can get. Ripley Todd is forced to face her gift of witchcraft and to face her destiny as well. Her struggle with both makes for interesting reading indeed.  Mia and Nell return and we find out much more about the reasons for Mia and Ripley's feud. Mac, Ripley's love interest in this novel, is a wonderfully quirkly character, and one you'll want to push her toward as you read this novel.  As with the first installment, the romantic scenes are a little heavy-handed and do put the women in a somewhat subservient role, which is hard to believe of Ripley by the very nature of her character. Still, it's fun to watch her let herself be weak and trusting. Overall, a great read that will leave you waiting for the final installment.
