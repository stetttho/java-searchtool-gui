 As an avid reader, I seem to often find myself reading the same worn-out formulas, but just reading the overview of this novel told me I was in for a treat. I was not disappointed! The surreal becomes real and believable in this novel of love, hope and second chances. The more serious, underlying message in this novel could not be ignored. I read the last few lines with a smile and a renewed appreciation for life!! This is a book you will pass on to all your friends!
