 This novel in the Maggie O'Dell series deals with a religious cult and how they are tied to a series of serial killings, or are they? I'll admit that I was a little disappointed in the story line of this novel as this not the best Kava book I've read; I figured out what was really going on halfway through, but it's still an entertaining book, and the character Maggie is always well polished and interesting, regardless of the plot. Maggie's relationship with her mother is explored in this novel, and some very interesting truths about her past come to light.  Even with the plot being a bit "loose", and easy to figure out, the book was still enjoyable, as all Alex Kava novels are.
