 I hate to throw "cold water" on other happier reviewers, but I read 5-10 books per month and I hate to waste my reading time. I felt that I wasted time on this book.  Although David Guterson's insight into the life and doubts of a priest was very well written, the choppy, unpunctuated dialogue was hard to follow.  The main character Anne, was so sketchy that it was hard to determine what she was really all about.  The storyline is intriguing...an appearance of the Virgin Mary to a non-Catholic teenaged runaway with no religious training, but the novel failed to deliver the goods. Ultimately, we are left to our own assumptions about whether or not Ann was the real thing, and perhaps that is the point, that all faith is just that. But the lack of fleshing out of characters, coupled with the odd writing style, especially in terms of the dialogue made me long for the end of the novel, and not in a good way.  I kept hoping that SOMETHING would happen, but the "something" that did was just so abrupt that it didn't pack the punch it could have. I wouldn't recommend this book, unless you have time to kill and don't mind a lot of "loose ends" in your fictional reading.
