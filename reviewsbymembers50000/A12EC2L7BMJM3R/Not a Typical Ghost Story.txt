 The thing I liked the best about this book is that it was not the typical "haunted house" story. It really is more of a detective story, with the main character in the present pursuing the truth surrounding a 100 year old multiple murder and suicide. The narration by Eleanor, the ghost who is trapped in Five Mile House was a nice twist from the normal "ghost story." Leslie Stone, the main character of this novel, has an unexplained connection with Eleanor Bly, who committed murder and  suicide 100 years before.  That connection was never fully explained.  I found the storyline of an entire town filled with practicing wiccans a bit far-fetched, as was the premise that Leslie's husband would bring her to this place after she has been through an experience which has made her doubt her sanity. The reason [I won't give the plot away] for Leslie's temporary insanity leaves one to believe that her husband is either an idiot or completely insensitive to bring her to Wellington, the fictional town where Five Mile House is located.   As Leslie learns that her children are in danger, she is called to make a decision that on the surface proves her unconditional love for her children. Then the last page of the book leaves the reader feeling that certainly Leslie cannot truly love her children based on the choice she makes.  Her relationships with her husband and her lover are both bizarre and devoid of communication, and that is a bit disappointing.   Eleanor's account of how her children really died and the horrific events that led up to their deaths was truly heartwrenching, even if the reason for all of the diabolical scheming to drive her to her course of action was "over the top." Overall, this was an interesting book, and it was entertaining, but when I finished the novel, I had a completely different feeling about Leslie Stone than I had through the entire novel.   I suppose it is afterall, not a fairytale, therefore one should not expect a fairytale ending.
