 It is true as both professional reviewers and book readers alike have said, that "Tathea" is not a fantasy novel. The novel has been incorrectly marketed. Perhaps that is because the publishers weren't sure exactly how to market it.   The novel begins with Ta-Thea an empress barely escaping her home land after her husband, the emperor of Shinabar and her son are murdered in an uprising.  The first few pages do indeed seem like a fantasy novel, but as one continues to read on, the novel is simply a broad mix of characters and situations which symbolize a woman's search for spiritual enlightment.  Tathea is trusted with a mysterious "Book" which is said to completely explain God's plan for mankind.  To be perfectly honest, the book was a bit too long, and the characters, with their unusual "fantasy" names, were simply players to point out good and evil, accepting the law of God or not, and how they related to Tathea's quest to share her new-found knowledge of God with others. The book is not the best I've ever read, and I have to admit that I struggled through it.  Using unusual names and exotic locations, Ann Perry's publishers have attempted to pass this book off as a fantasy work. This novel would be much better accepted by the public if it were simply marketed more truthfully.  I was disappointed, and am now sorry that I bought the sequel, "Come Armageddon" before I had finished reading "Tathea."   If you do plan to buy this book, expect an introspective novel which looks very closely at the frailties of human beings and how they react to spirituality.  If you are expecting traditional fantasy fiction, you will be disappointed.
