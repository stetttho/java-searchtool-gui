 The Distllers are breathing new life into an otherwise dying, cookie-cutter music industry. Power ballad boy bands and Brittney pop princesses are boring and have little to say abou the realities of life, and they should move over and bow down to Brody and the band! This CD kicks on every song! Buy it! You won't be sorry...
