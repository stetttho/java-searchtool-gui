 In this second Shadows novel, "Faith" wakes up from a coma with no idea of who she is. Nothing in her former life seems familiar to her and this is of course explained away by her lengthy coma. The plot thickens as she is asked to explain a friendship with a missing woman she has no memory of.  She finds herself flooded with memories that belong to the missing woman and is reluctantly recruited by the woman's lover to help use those memories to find her. Noah from "Stealing Shadows" makes an appearance, which was shorter than I would have liked (hope to read more about HIS story in the future)... but the suspense of this novel, the agonizing search for the missing woman, and the very unusual ending made for a wonderful read!! Hats off to Kay Hooper!
