 I was a little disappointed in the ending of this novel. Of course I knew it had to end, but I expected something much  more climactic since Mia Devlin had been cast as the stronger of the three sisters in the first two novels. I expected her story to be the most powerful, yet ultimately I found it to be the weakest. In the beginning, her anger at Sam was interesting, and the romantic scenes in this novel were much more believable to the character than in books one and two. However, with one simple conversation, it's as if Mia says, "Oh well...that's ok...the past decade is forgiven."   Just a little hard to swallow.... The joining of her power with Sam's was very believable in the early scenes, but when it comes to the ending, I guess I expected much more. Everything seemed to be over-simplified.  Still, it's worth the read, and you won't feel satisfied until you finish the trilogy if you have already read the first two books.
