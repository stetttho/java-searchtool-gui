 Prior to now, I've had mixed feelings about Oprah's book club.  I guess it is a good thing to use her influence to get people to read books that they may have otherwise not been exposed to.  And to her credit, she has chosen  fantastic books.  But I was disappointed when she chose a second Wally Lamb  book as she missed an opportunity to endorse another writer.  And it is  disappointing that we have come to a place where we need to turn to talk  shows to tell us what to read when there are hundreds, even thousands, of  worthy books which go unsung every year.  But Oprah has more than redeemed  herself with this choice. I read Jewel a few years back when it first  came out.  In fact, I was fortunate enough to have been in one of the  author's classes when I was a student at the College of Charleston.  Anyone  who has read Bret Lott's work before will not be disappointed.  Those who  like Jewel should look at some of his other works (like Reed's Beach and  The Man Who Owned Vermont).  In Jewel we see the sensitivity and beauty of  Lott's writing, the rich pageant of characters that pour forth across the  page, the power of memory and family history, and all against the backdrop  of the South. If this is your first exposure to Bret Lott, I can't think  of a better place to start.
