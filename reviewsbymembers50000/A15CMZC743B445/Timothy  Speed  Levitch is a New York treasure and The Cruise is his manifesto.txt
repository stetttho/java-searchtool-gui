 It is an absolute mitzvah that this has now been released on DVD!  I had an old copy on VHS that I grabbed off the Independent Film Channel as the previous VHS release was out of print and very tough to find.  This is a cult classic.  Timothy Speed Levitch is interesting, intelligent, hilarious, and heartbreaking.  The Cruise is at once a criticism of tourist culture and a love poem for New York.  It is an adroit demonstration of how there can be tremendous dignity in any job, even that of a severly underpaid bus tour guide/gentleman philosopher, if one has passion in his heart.  To praphrase Mr. Levitch, do not conspire with fear of your own power!  Purchase this DVD immediately and then try to find a copy of Levitch's book "Speedology."  It is equally hilarious and brilliant.
