 I loved this film from the first time I saw it and had to own a copy as soon as it came out.  It is a story about growing (and growing apart) populated by five young women in South Korea.  What is easy for non-Korean viewers to miss is the significance of the fact that this is a film written and directed by a young woman, and with five lead characters who are young women, despite the level to which men are the dominant force in Korean culture.  But men exist only at the edges of this story.  It is an effective feminist message without having us beat over the head in an obvious way.  How refreshing also to see young women who are dealing with issues in their lives that do not revolve around their worth as it relates to men or sex.  I  also love the irony of how these women exist in a high-tech culture of cell phones and text messages and yet seem to be drifting ever further apart, despite the promise of connectness these mediums falsely promise.  It is great how the graphics of the film's titles, text messages, etc. are cleverly presented on the screen.  Despite the fact that the end is only just a bit uneven, this is a very important and accomplished film that I cannot help but be drawn into completely everytime I watch it.
