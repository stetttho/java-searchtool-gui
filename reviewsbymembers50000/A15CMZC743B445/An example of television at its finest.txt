 Don't be swayed by the fact that, late in its run, this show jumped the shark every week (their parents dying turned out to be the least of their worries).  The first season of this show was probably the most remarkable.  With incredible writing, top-notch production values, and fine performances from a cast of relative unknowns (who would come back in season two already looking more scrubbed and polished by agents and publicists) this television series was a rare bright star in a firmament of schlock.  It is a prime example of what television can be when everything is working as it should.  For a long time it was the "best show nobody was watching".  But anyone who knew anything about good television, including a lot of critics and fans, were quick to note how important and well-done this show really was.  It certainly did not go unnoticed that the Thanksgiving episode (in which the Salinger children confronted the drunk driver who killed their parents) won the Humanitas prize (and actually just sent a shiver down my spine recalling the emotion of that episode. The show was just THAT good).  I have no doubt that Party of Five (among a precious few others from around the mid-nineties like MSCL) will stand the test of time.  This season stands out as among the very best.  This DVD set will be a must-buy for me.
