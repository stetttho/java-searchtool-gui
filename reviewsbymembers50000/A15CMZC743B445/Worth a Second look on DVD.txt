 I was a fan of Egoyan's film Exotica, but confess that I was a bit confused when I first watched this film on video.  However, after purchasing the Platinum series DVD, I found the director's commentary to be  very helpful in understanding what is going on in the film.  I now realize  that I was not paying enough attention to the film the first time through.   And though before I may have agreed with some of the other viewer reviews  which characterized this film as "dull", I now think it is more  accurate to say it is sublimely subtle.  In an age of big budget, loud,  flashy, dumbed-down Hollywood films, even intelligent viewers may not have  the patience to get into a film that relies on storytelling through nuance.   However, upon a second (more illuminated) viewing I now realize how the  true beauty of this film glides across the screen like a rich pageant,  slowly unfolding.  I urge you to take another look at the DVD version.  The  commentary track with Atom Egoyan and Russell Banks is full of insight.
