 First let me say that I generally like Marilu Henner.  TAXI was just a bit ahead of my time. But I did enjoy her short-lived talk show and I sat in the third row of the Schubert Theater on Broadway while I watched Chicago and thought: "I can't believe they are singing and dancing through the whole show and she is never out of breath."   I read Ms. Henner's book with interest and much of what she says does sound plausible.  However, it is not clear where Ms. Henner acquired all of this information.  It doesn't take much for any Hollywood star to write a diet book. In fact, diet books always sell well even when they are not written by a famous person.  I am just wondering what qualifications Ms. Henner and her ghostwriter have.  What knowledge of nutrition do they have that is not based on new age California rumor and superstition?  It seems to me that to make it in Hollywood at the young age she did, one would have to skip out on education at some point.  And not to be mean about this (because she seems to be a nice person) but why are we so apt to listen to a woman who happens to be talented, beautiful and rich as opposed to listening to doctors and nutritionists who are more qualified?  My grandparents all grew up drinking whole milk and have lived to a healthy old age (and still going!).  But now I put a dash of skim milk in my coffee (GASP...not coffee) and I'm ravaging my immune system?  You might buy this book because it is interesting and well done.  But let me warn you......rice milk and soy milk are not as yummy as Ms. Henner would like you to think.  I would rather practice a diet of moderation and exercise than strip away all of the culinary pleasure in life.
