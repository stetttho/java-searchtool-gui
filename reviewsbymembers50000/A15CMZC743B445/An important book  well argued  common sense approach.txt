 This is an excellent, well-argued book.  A fast, compelling read. I actually did read it, as opposed to a number of reviewers who just seem out to stifle free speech and free thought.  And I think it does this book a disservice to think it criticizes the left exclusively.  I think Mr. Stossel makes clear his criticism of the pitfalls of extremism in either direction.  Neither the far right or the far left should have any claim to moral superiority.  Though many would characterize his stance as "conservative", some of his arguments are complimentary to points made by the very left-wing Michael Moore who articulately rails against the alarmist media and the culture of fear they promulgate to no end.  Everyone engaged in what passes for the American political discourse has an angle, whether it is a cushy pork barrel deal for some corporation or politician, or some "activist" using hyped up bad science to push an politically correct agenda to raise money to line their own pockets.  Some of the author's strongest arguments:  Over-regulation stifles innovation.  We rely on a media that does not take the time to understand what they are reporting and how to report it accurately. Our system of government is largely corrupt and wasteful. Poverty presents a much greater threat to public health than many of the other minimally risky things that are presented to us.  That tort reform is badly needed in this country.  That our culture of victimization is devastating our country.  That the right and the left discourage truly free-thought and free-speech.  He makes many effective arguments.  There are a few points in which he sketches some broad strokes and I would like to see some more fine print.  But in all, this is a very balanced book.  My only caveat is that the reader will most likely be demoralized by some of the truths it contains.
