 It is astonishing how many viewers of this film dismiss it as crap because it is spare, subtle, it requires them to think, to pay attention to something not comprised of 4 second edits cut to the tempo of rock music, to endure the hardship of not being "entertained" every second of screen time.  This film may not be everything for everyone.  But I see it as an interesting experiment.  It is a poem.  It works on so many different levels.  The best part is that it takes a big risk in not hiding behind T&A and explosions.  Just two men, lost in a bleak desert environment with failing energy, no water and only themselves and a couple of obscure pop culture references to keep them company.  The contents of this film are an antithesis to our technology driven, noise-filled, minivan-driving, supersized eating world.  Van Sant, Affleck and Damon manage to produce a compelling film despite the fact they are working with so little.  This is a brave gesture in a "sure thing" industry.  This film is worth a look and this DVD will be added to my library.
