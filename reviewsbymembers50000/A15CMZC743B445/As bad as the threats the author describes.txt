 I bought this book on a whim before getting on a plane.  Who could resist something that purports to give you the inside scoop on the puppetmasters who control everything?  I've always loved a good conspiracy theory if for nothing more than a dissenting/alternate view.  I've always loved the notion that everything I know might be wrong. But this book is little more than a poorly organized, anti-corporate, anti-establishment, anti-Bush rant.  The author really squanders an opportunity to make a measured case.  Instead, she employs endless half-truths that are at best sloppy and at worst insulting to readers.  This kind of propaganda is just as dangerous as the motives and methods of the people and institutions she rails against.  This book is unbalanced and manipulative. You should perhaps only purchase it and read it if you are disinterested in thinking for yourself.  However, if you hate "W" with a passion and feel more comfortable having your anger affirmed by like minds (without caring too much about the facts that get you to your proof) then this book may provide you with the validity you desperately need.  I was tempted to abandon this book on the plane at the end of my flight, judging it not worthy of lugging.  But I decided that was irresponsible.  This puppy is headed for my recycling bin.  There are many other authors more qualified than Ms. Rossi in tackling some of the subjects included in her book.  Don't make the same mistake I did. Look elsewhere. (My review is clearly part of the conspiracy).
