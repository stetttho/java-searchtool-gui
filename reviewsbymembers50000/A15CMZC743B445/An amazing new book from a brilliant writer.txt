 I was so excited to see this title available.  It arrived yesterday and I have not been able to put it down.  I was fortunate enough to have been a student in one of the classes the author taught at Harvard a few years ago.  And her writing is just as wonderful as her teaching skills.  I read somewhere that Jessica really prefers the short story format.  But she handles this novel with ease. I'm already half-way through this book and just could not put it down last night.  The story unfolds in what I like to call a "Citizen Kane" fashion: After a short introduction to the characters, something dramatic and shocking happens and we follow the characters through the aftermath as they try to put the pieces together in a way that the events make sense.  What is special about this book is that the author doesn't spoon-feed the reader....major things happen without portent in a way that the shock hits you and puts you in a position that is sympathetic to the characters.  I often find myself reading over something that is mentioned so matter of factly (as the narrator herself, the eldest of three daughters relates it to the reader in a way that almost underplays it because she is still coping with it herself) that you have to go back and read the same paragraph again to make sure you read it right.  After ingratiating the reader so effortlessly in this small family, we are suddenly in the middle of a great, mysterious tragedy.  And we see the survivors dealing with things in their own ways: The mother is in denial, the middle sister fills herself with food to cope with an emptiness, and the narrator finds comfort in a sexual fling.  But my favorite thing about this book is that it is not predictable.  I'm already finding the assumptions I made about the causes of the tragic centerpiece of this story to be wrong.  This is a wonderful, and intriguing story.  It is heartbreaking but beautiful at the same time.  I highly recommend it.
