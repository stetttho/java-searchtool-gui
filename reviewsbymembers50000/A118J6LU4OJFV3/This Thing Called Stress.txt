 Stress is unavoidable if we are alive.  Some stress is harmful, and some stress is beneficial. The most important aspect of stress is the way we deal with it.  Currently most of us Americans are finding ourselves dealing with all the stress we think we can handle.  THE STRESS OWNER'S MANUAL, MEANING, BALANCE & HEALTH IN YOUR LIFE, is a book I worked through a year ago.  Lately, I have been giving it a prominent place at my bedside, and I find many of the wise words in the book helpful.  For example,here are some ways listed to deal with stress.  "Do unto others....  Smile.  Develop hobbies or interests.  Rebuild after.... Allow yourself to grieve.  Cut back television.  Be assertive.  Make chores more fun. Enjoy meals.  Hold family councils.  Nurture a friendship."  The list goes on. The book presents a well-organized method through instructions and tools for analyzing and repairing stress.  It is a practical action book which allows the reader to become involved.                                  As the author of a novel, Solomon's Porch, which tells about one family's methods of coping with stress, I found THE STRESS OWNER'S MANUAL to be a therapeutic, comprehensive guide to solving many of the stressful aspects of existence I have addressed in fiction.
