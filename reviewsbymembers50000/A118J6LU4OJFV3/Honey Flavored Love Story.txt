 Such passion,unrelenting devotion,and sweetness in the face of cold hard tragedy--life is always tragic eventually.  I see people in the rehab hospital like that--spouses carrying little sacks of special things to their darlings.  No wonder THE NOTEBOOK is popular.  And I have loved like that.  How comforting, how inspiring to listen to the story of another's complete love for a spouse who for one reason or another is losing time.Jane Riley, author of SOLOMON'S PORCH, THE STORY OF BEN AND ROSE
