 NURSE'S POCKET COMPANION contains a great amount of important stuff that nurses often need to access quickly on the job.  The material is presented in an interesting manner.  The book is written well enough that a person interested in nursing or a medical field could pick it up and enjoy reading it during coffee breaks. The topics are logically arranged, the illustrations are clear, and the tables are useful.  I like this reference book.
