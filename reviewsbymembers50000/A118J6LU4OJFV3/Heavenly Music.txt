 The hymns of SING, YE HEAVENS represent 1500 years of music in the Christian church.  Pure and rich are these hymns by the Cambridge Singers with their perfect diction that leaves nothing for improvement and their tone quality that envelops the listener. The beauty of the harp, the organ, and the brass adds to the pleasure this CD brings to the listener's ear and heart.
