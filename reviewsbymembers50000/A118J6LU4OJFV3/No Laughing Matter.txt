 NO LAUGHING MATTER has some great moments.  In places Joseph Heller demonstrated his ability to be funny and touching at the same time.  The book was a great inspiration to me at a time when I needed the help it gave me.             As the author of SOLOMON'S PORCH, a novel about a man with CIDP, the slow version of Guillain Barre', I was fascinated with this book about Joe Heller and his caretakers.  Most of the material that I have read about GBS and CIDP focuses almost exclusively on the patient, but Mr. Heller wrote every other chapter of this book and had his friend, who became one of his caretakers, write the alternate chapters.       At the time I read NO LAUGHING MATTER, I was beginning to formulate SOLOMON'S PORCH in my mind.  NLM gave me some good ideas about structure.
