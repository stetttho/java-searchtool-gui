 The Baptism of Howie Cobb is an enjoyable story about a boy who left Georgia and rode a bus to South Dakota to work in a CCC camp. Howie left Georgia without understanding life, love, romance, or God.  Through his adventures, sometimes frightening and sometimes comical but always enjoyable to read, Howie Cobb becomes a man.     Dr. Robbins selects details carefully.  He has a superior skill with dialogue.  It has been said that he is indebted to Steinbeck in his style. He pays careful attention in The Baptism of Howie Cobb to the overall structure of the novel.  Particularly noteworthy is his use of the geographical properties of various parts of the United States to develop the plot of the novel.  At the same time, he ties the plot and the setting to the rich use of symbolism in the novel.       I recommend it for entertaining reading.
