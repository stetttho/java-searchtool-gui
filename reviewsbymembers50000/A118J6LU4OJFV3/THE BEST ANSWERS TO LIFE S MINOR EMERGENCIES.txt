 "If there is a live insect in the patient's ear, simply fill the canalwithmineral oil." This comment is a typical example of the practical advice given to emergency physicians who are expected to handle all sorts of emergencies, including the ones that are not life-threatening but very important to the patients who are suffering through the difficulties. The information in MINOR EMERGENCIES is concise but thorough enough to make the caregiver competent, technical but easily understood by those with medical knowledge, scientific but interesting enough to be read for entertainment, and analytical but sensitive to the needs of those who take their emergencies to the emergency room. If and when I go to an emergency room, I hope that the doctor I see has this book handy.
