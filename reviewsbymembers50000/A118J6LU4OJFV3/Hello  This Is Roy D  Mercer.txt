 Ridiculous, absurd, silly, hilarious, stupid--just plain side-splitting funny, Roy D. Mercer's second volume of HOW BIG A BOY ARE YA? made me laugh until I cried.  These phone conversations helped me not to live life too seriously because life is too serious not to take time to laugh.  Jane Riley, author of SOLOMON'S PORCH, THE STORY OF BEN AND ROSE
