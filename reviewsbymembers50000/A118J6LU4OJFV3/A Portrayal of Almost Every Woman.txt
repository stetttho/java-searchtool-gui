 The greatness of THE AWAKENING comes not from the pitiful solutions that Edna Pontellier, the protagonist, chooses but from Kate Chopin's portrayal of a woman facing the challenge of awakening to what life often becomes:  a sad dilemma with few acceptable options. Chopin shows how lonely a woman's life can be as the woman stops suppressing her feelings and instead allows them to swim to the surface.  Most women have varying degrees of Edna's  psyche; some of us simply cover it better than the naked Edna does. Most women need to read this haunting poetic novel Jane Riley, author of SOLOMON'S PORCH, THE STORY OF BEN AND ROSE.
