 The Brethren started a little slow, but after a few chapters, it took charge of my mind until I finished it.  I don't know how John Grisham holds my attention time after time. My thoughts center around whatever book of his I'm devouring until I finish.  Now that I have just finished The Brethren, I'm already missing old Joe Roy.
