 When the film makers arrived in the colorful little town of Canton, Mississippi, black people and white people were proud of the attention their town was receiving.  They eagerly rushed forward to find roles in the movie. These people were big enough to expose their own smallness of their souls.  The irony of Southern character is difficult for people, including Southerners themselves, to comprehand.      A TIME TO KILL fascinates me, as I have lived in Madison County and gone to Wardell's Restaurant on the square behind the courthouse on many Saturday nights to eat fried oysters, because the setting, although not entirely authentic, captures the essence of Canton, Mississippi, a town usually peaceful except when the undercurrents overflow.      To others it may seem a myth that there really are and have been good Southern men and women, white and black, who cared for and about each other.  John Grisham is not trying to make a statement about all the facets of the history of Southern racism in this first yarn he has spun.  Instead, I believe his primary goal is to entertain us.      The only hard fast theme that we can pin on him is that there is a time for vigilante action.  I agree with other reviewers that the arguments of the lawyers are senseless, but if they had been sensible, they would have been neither legalistic nor Southern.    The fact that the movie has stirred so many strong emotions for and against it speaks of its greatness.  Even though the actors exaggerated their speech, they made me laugh at them and at myself.  Maybe we Southerners do still sound that way.  Mr. Brigance reminds me of the smooth Greeks I knew back in college.  The subtle slattern moves of the mature secretary say volumes about Southern women.
