 CHRISTMAS MEMORIES is a CD to be purchased now and enjoyed from this year forward as a Christmas tradition. As always, Barbra Streisand is the greatest.  I like the lyrics. My favorite is "Grown-Up Christmas List."The arrangements are great, and the blend of her voice with the orchestra is intriguing. The smooth velvet performance is flawless. I must confess it makes me more sad than happy as I think of other Christmases.  (Review by Jane Riley, author of SOLOMON'S PORCH)
