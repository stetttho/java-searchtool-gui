 Our Lexmark Z32 has the personality of a tempermental brat. It has a voice that was fun to hear for two days, but it insists on saying the same thing all the time. We hushed it.  The printer can do professional looking work if everything is lined up right, but somehow it doesn't stay aligned and the characters--the letters--are often a mess.  If the Lexmark has a paper jam or thinks it has a paper jam when it really doesn't, it automatically cancels the print job even after the problem is corrected.  Tempermental.  Maybe I have a computer problem that keeps the computer from making contact with the printer at times or maybe the printer is pouting.  I'm not sure.  At any rate, any time saved by this super efficiently fast printer is lost because of having to stop and restart the job. I abuse it with enormous assignments, and it appears that it balks after several minutes and pretends to be sick. I have one more complaint.  When it spits out all that beautiful clear work quickly or when it is a little messed up--it doesn't matter--it sends the papers flying all over the room.  I have to stand by it and catch them. I'll keep using it throughout its wretched life, but I am not sure that it is the best choice of printers.  I don't really know how I could change though, because I am now familiar with all of the Lexmark's bizarre moods.Jane Riley, author of SOLOMON'S PORCH, THE STORY OF BEN AND ROSE
