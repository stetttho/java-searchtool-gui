 I was impressed by Christopher Reeve's account of the difficulties through which he has passed along the path of enduring his disability.  With no time to prepare for the catastrophe, he moved from the famous Superman actor to one who could not enjoy the luxury of a private shower or bowel movement--one who could not breathe without the assistance of a respirator.       I was impressed by the ways he grew as a human being.  He learned how much he loved his wife.  Also he realized how much more difficult his life could have been if he had not been wealthy to afford needed equipment and assistance.  Thirdly, he realized that he could help other mobility impaired individuals.      As the author of SOLOMON'S PORCH, a new novel about a man with CIDP, which is a rare and serious neurological disorder similar to  Guillain-Barre' syndrome, I have noticed that people with unusual neurological problems such as GBS and CIDP are almost never mentioned in the pleas for money.  Not once did I hear a word about Guillain-Barre in the pleas for funding for stem-cell research. Spinal cord injuries, such as the one described eloquently by Christopher Reeve in STILL ME, receive much more attention.  Mr. Reeve seems to have a "trickle-down" plan.  If something is done for the spinal cord injury victims, perhaps someday scientists will find the time and money to do research on the rare problems and all mobility impaired people may someday benefit.                         I hope that Mr. Reeve will write about two more subjects.  First I would like to hear more about his spiritual development. He merely hints at the changes in  this aspect of his life.  Secondly since he is physically a giant, I would love to know where he buys his adaptive equipment.     Truly the book is inspiring. My husband and I benefitted from listening to it and sharing his pain.
