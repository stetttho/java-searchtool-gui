 GEURRILLA MARKETING FOR WRITERS is a helpful manual for someone who is planning a strategy for marketing nonfiction. Most of the suggestions in the book can be applied to marketing fiction also.The feature I liked most about GM for Writers was the motivational impact it had on me.  As the author of a new novel (SOLOMON'S PORCH) without a big amount of money to spend on obtaining publicity, I found many useful suggestions.  I especially liked the idea of being sure that I do five things every day to promote my book.  There are 100 suggestions--weapons they are called--to help a writer promote a book.  About 65 of these I found helpful.  At the moment I'm turned off with the title of the book though and with the idea of weapons.          The least attractive feature of the book was its redundancy.  It seemed that I read some of the same ideas over and over and over.  Actually the book is meant to be a reference work, and I feel sure I'll refer to it often.  I do recommend it for any writer who wishes to promote his book.
