 The George Forman grill we received as a gift a few months ago is great, and we haven't scratched it yet. We find it easy to cook delicious chicken breasts, hamburgers, and small steaks. When I follow the manufacturer's instructions, cleaning is easy and efficient. I find that I grill much more often now that we have our lean mean fat-dripping cooker. We really do like our grill.
