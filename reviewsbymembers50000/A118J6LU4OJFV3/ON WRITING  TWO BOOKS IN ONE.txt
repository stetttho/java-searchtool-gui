 ON WRITING is a literary sandwich.  The two slices of bread. one at the beginning and one at the end form an autobiography.  I loved to hear Mr. King tell about how he grew up and how he worked as a school teacher.  I loved to hear about how he loved his wife and how she loved him.  I knew she would love im no matter whether he was able to walk again after his horrible wreck, and I knew he would love being loved by her.  My husband and I listened to this part of the tapes, and we had to shed a few tears because we love each other that way.      Then there's the meat of the sandwich.  In a short time with no wasted words, he shared his pearls  about becoming a great writer.  Some day I too will be a great writer in my own style. One of the people I will thank will be Stephen King.
