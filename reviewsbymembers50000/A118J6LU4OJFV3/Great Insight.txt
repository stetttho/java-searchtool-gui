 In addition to the review I have posted, I want to make one more comment.  Lynn Barry in her entertaining novel PUDDLES shares great insight into human behavior. What she shows in her characters, especially Susan, is a real inspiration about the way to move along life's complex path. Jane Riley,  author of SOLOMON'S PORCH
