 Living in the South, I thought I knew how white people treated blacks, but BLACK LIKE ME showed moe how little I understand the way whites treat blacks routinely.    I even thought I knew as a white person how I treat blacks, but I didn't.  This book opened my eyes to the subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle cruelties to my fellow human beings.  This book needs to be read.
