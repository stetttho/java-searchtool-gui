 The Easter Parade is almost as good as Revolutionary Road. It is almost as grim as RR, but there is a ray of hope at the end. I highly recommend this book and I would urge everyone to read everything by Yates that they can get they can get their hands on. I would also recomend that the reader go to Stewart O'Nan.com and read his essay "The Lost World of Richard Yates."
