 The other reviewers on this site have done a good job of delineating the contents of this cd, so I will just add my comments. I will begin by saying that I am not particularly fond of country music, but I greatly admire this disc. It has a cross-genre appeal that is primal in power.Moreover, it is just plain cool. Buy it today.
