 Angela Carter (1940-1992) has written a feminist reading of the Marquis De Sade. Carter has also used the work of the Marquis as a springboard for her own insights on the relation of sexuality to power. She is able to demonstrate that sexuality is constructed not from gender but rather form a relationship between power and politics. A must-read feminist classic.
