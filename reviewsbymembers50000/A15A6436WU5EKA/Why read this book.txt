 This is probably the second most overrated book in American Literature. I do not understand why people think this book is so great. I quickly tired of the protagonist's well-heeled puerile whining . I kept thinking, "Grow up, for God's sake." In short, I would argue that Salinger's insights and themes are stunted and trivial at best. To teh people who love this book I would say Grow up and find out what real life is like and maybe read some real books
