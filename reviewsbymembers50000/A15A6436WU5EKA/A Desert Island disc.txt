 Elvis Costello has always been one of my heroes. He has his own musical vision and he has stuck by it for 30 years. My Aim is True was his first album and in many ways his best. This is not to say that he did not go on to record many other fine discs, but they did not have the impact that this one did. In short, buy it and buy it today. You will not be sorry.
