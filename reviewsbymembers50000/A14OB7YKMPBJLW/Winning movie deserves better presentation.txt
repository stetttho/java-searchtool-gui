 Despite the anomalies of this DVD version, "Life with Father" is still a winning, wonderful movie suitable for viewing by all ages.  William Powell stars as the combustible, but essentially kind and loving patriach of a late 1800's family in New York City.  A wife and three adolescent boys round out this colorful family. Powell lends irascible charm to his role while Irene Dunne plays the slightly ditsy, well meaning wife marvelously. The supporting cast includes a young and very beautiful Elizabeth Taylor as a flirtatious visitor as well as the future star of the television series "Adam 12", Martin Milner, as the middle son. "Life with Father" has plenty of warmth and humor to make it well worth seeing.  It just needs a better presentation than in its current DVD format.  Catch it when it airs on television for an optimal viewing experience.
