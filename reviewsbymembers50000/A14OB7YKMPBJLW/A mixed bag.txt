 "Man with the Movie Camera" is a technically audacious film which chronicles daily life in Russia in the 1920's.  Vertov's innovative use of rapid camera movement and split-second editing are often startling, at times dizzying to behold. The images which Vertov juxtaposes are incongruous and entertaining.  In one frame you see a dog sitting on a sidewalk. In another, you view people huddled together going to work and then a close-up of someone brushing their teeth.  Many scenes feature machines, factories and buildings representing Russia's industrialization.  There is a sense of detachment and dehumanization conveyed in the starkness of the concrete and steel structures you see emerging over cities as Russia modernizes.   Vertov introduced new and exciting techniques to the craft of filmmaking.  Yet I found his use of these techniques excessive, self-indulgent, and distracting as if he were "showing off" his technical prowess instead of enhancing the story.  Also, his repetition of the same or similar images dulls their impact.   Still "Man with the Movie Camera" is worth seeing.  But it's a mixed bag.
