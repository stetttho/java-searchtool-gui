 The incomparable artistry of Bette Davis, William Wyler's vibrant direction, and Gregg Toland's crisp black and white photography make this movie a must-see.  Add a searing and brilliant screenplay by Lillian Hellman (who adapted her own play to film) and you have a true classic. This movie's subject matter is quite contemporary.  People similar to the materialistic and corrupt Regina and her brothers are sometimes found in today's society although maybe not to the extreme of this family. There are many virtues in this film, but it is Davis who makes this movie unforgettable. I agree with the earlier reviewer that Davis is intoxicating.  She is that and more. Bette manages to give the scheming and ruthless Regina sympathetic qualities such as strength, intelligence, and an imperious will to survive.  Her Regina will never be a perpetual victim such as her sister-in-law Birdie is. A woman with Regina's ambition and smarts had few options back in 1900 when this story took place.  She could not channel her overpowering survival instincts into running a business or becoming a politician for instance.  In those days, women were basically seen but not heard. And Bette's Regina never pretends to be something she is not. She is blatant about her greedy motives.  In the end, Regina is a somewhat tragic figure who doesn't know how to control her own ambition and she ends up....  Sounds like a scenario that does happen in today's society where the acquisition of material wealth seems paramount to decency.
