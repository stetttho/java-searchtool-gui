 Shades of Hitchcock's "Rear Window" permeate this fascinating mystery which explores loneliness and betrayal. There is a surprise ending which I will not reveal but seems logical considering the motives of each  character.  The acting especially of Michel Blanc is exceptionally good.  The story moves at a brisk pace, and you will not be bored. I hope this  movie becomes available on DVD soon!
