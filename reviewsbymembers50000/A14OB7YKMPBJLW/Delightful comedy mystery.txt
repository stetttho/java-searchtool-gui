 Leave it to the reliable folks at Disney to give us an unpretentious little gem of a movie such as this.  "Murder She Purred" is PURRfect entertainment for the entire family. I am a 44 year old married lady, and I had as much fun watching this movie as my 8 and 10 year old nieces. Ricki Lake plays the postmaster turned amateur sleuth in a small southern town.  She is assisted in investigating a murder by her two adorable, loyal pets Mrs. Murphy, a wide-eyed and wise tabby cat, and by Tucker, her brave, insecure, and lovable corgi canine.  Ricki's real life intelligence and warmth come through in the role she plays.  She makes her character a spunky and appealing heroine. The voice of Mrs. Murphy is charmingly performed by the gifted actress Blythe Danner (Gwyneth Paltrow's mom).  And the other animals' voices supplied by humans are humorously well-suited to the variety of species used in each scene. The only shortcoming of this movie is that the villain's character could have been more fully developed.  But that is a minor complaint. Overall, "Murder She Purred" gave me 90 minutes of delightful entertainment.  It's a movie that is good clean fun, something which is quite rare in most Hollywood movies today.
