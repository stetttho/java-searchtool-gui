 The venerable, durable rock/pop icon, Rod Stewart delivers a suprisingly sumptuous and elegant rendering of some of America's finest popular songs.  Mr. Stewart negotiates the ingenious melodies and fervent lyrics featured in the "Great American Songbook" with unexpected deftness and delicacy.  His vocal range is much broader than I had expected.  He can hit those soaring high notes with pinpoint accuracy. I have always liked Rod Stewart as a rock/pop performer, but with this new release, he has earned my utmost admiration in daring to tackle such timeless compositions as "The Way You Look Tonight", "I'll Be Seeing You", "That's All", and several other incomparable songs. Mr. Stewart's vocals are greatly enhanced by the marvelous orchestra and the lush arrangements. I only wish that songs of this musical and emotional depth were regularly written today.  Unfortunately, they are not.  But at least Mr. Rod Stewart is still around.  With his latest CD, this classy, risk-taking artist has shown us how startling and transforming a beautiful, intricate melody or a poetic, heartfelt lyric can be.  For that, many thanks, Mr. Stewart.
