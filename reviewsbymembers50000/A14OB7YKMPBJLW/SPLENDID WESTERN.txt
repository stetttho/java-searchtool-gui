 This is a rousing story starring that handsome but in this movie, unshaven and grizzled Robert Taylor leading a group of resilient pioneer women heading west to meet their future husbands for the first time.  The plot moves along briskly. The great director William Wellman shows real flair for staging exciting action sequences.  He handles a large cast of actors, horses, cattle, wagon trains, and even a cute little dog with great ease and skill. "Westward the Women" contains some wonderful comic moments along with occasional tragedies and much hardship along the westward trail.  The movie makes you appreciate how brave and industrious these pioneers had to be to endure the harsh weather and terrain along with occasional Indian attacks and frequent lack of provisions.   Watching "Westward the Women" will give you the audience a very pleasant two hours of entertainment and enlightenment about  America's westward expansion.
