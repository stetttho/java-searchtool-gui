 "The Hucksters" is a refreshingly adult drama with themes that resonate even today.  Clark Gable plays an advertising agent (a "huckster") who is basically a decent man, but who finds himself increasingly compromising his principles in order to satisfy a despotic soap magnate played by Sydney Greenstreet, who obviously relishes in playing such a despicable, larger than life character. As part of a promotion for his client's product, Gable convinces a lovely society war widow (sensitively played by Deborah Kerr) to endorse Greenstreet's beauty soap.  Gable is immediately attracted to Kerr and vice versa.   But Gable and Kerr's characters are polar opposites.  He is a driven sometimes ruthlessly ambitious businessman.  She is a very proper, rather sheltered, but highly moral mother of two small children and a widow of a war hero. In 1947, the year of this film's release, there was still a strong sense of morality in movies (something absent in most of today's films).  The idea of having sex outside of marriage was not considered lightly.  And in "The Hucksters", this issue is tastefully dealt with minus the vulgarity and gratuitous sexuality that permeate most of today's films. (Call me old fashioned, but I think we could do without so many explicit sex scenes in movies today.) There are other contemporary topics in this film such as the power of big business to control the media and the dilemma of "getting ahead" in your profession by any means, ethical or not.  Even though this movie is over 50 years old, it holds up extremely well.  It makes for an absorbing two hours of entertainment.
