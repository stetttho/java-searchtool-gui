 "Legend of the Lost" is a morality tale of sorts which follows the journey of three disparate souls searching for lost treasure in the vast Sahara Desert.  The trio is comprised of Joe January, played by John Wayne, who is a hard living, hard drinking guide; Paul Bonnard, a would-be missionary played by Rossano Brazzi; and Dita, portrayed by Sophia Loren, who is a prostitute and petty thief transformed by Paul's piety.  The sought-after treasure was originally discovered by Paul's father.  But when it is revealed that his father is not the saint Paul thought him to be, Paul is corrupted. Greed and lust overtake him eventually leading to tragedy. Paul's instantaneous and wicked conversion seems somewhat preposterous as he had purportedly lived a virtuous life up until the discovery of the treasure and the remains of his father.  The entire plot strains credibility. But it is the motley and gifted cast that fascinates. Wayne's Joe January is a crude, hard-bitten soul.  But underneath that rough exterior, you know that he is a decent man especially since he is portrayed by Duke Wayne.  Wayne has a reassuringly quiet strength and an unselfconscious vulnerability that always make his characterizations believable.  Wayne's characters are strong men, but not super men (ala Schwarzenegger or Stallone). His characters are realistic.  They can be brought down, hurt, and compromised.  Rossano Brazzi gives an almost giddy, operatic interpretation of a good man gone bad.  It's amusing to watch his character degenerate.  And Sophia Loren has an untamed beauty and wild impetuousness which is electrifying. So perhaps one can forgive the hokey plot of "Legend of the Lost", the occasional poor sound quality, and the rather cheesy musical score.  It is the charismatic, talented cast and the magnificently sun-drenched, barren landscape of the Sahara Desert that make this movie rather thrilling and worth your time.
