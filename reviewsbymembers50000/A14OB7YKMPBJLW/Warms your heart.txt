 Here are 7 good reasons (in random order) to see "Breakfast at Tiffany's": 1.  This memorable movie convincingly transports viewers into the jazzy, tacky, and hilarious beatnik era of the early 1960's. 2.  George Peppard and Audrey Hepburn have a tender, believable romantic chemistry, and they are both gorgeous to look at. 3.  Holly Golightly is one of Hepburn's finest roles.  In her performance, Audrey captures all of playgirl Holly Golightly's contradictions:  Holly is worldly, yet naive.  She projects the insouciance of a swinger, but underneath she longs for a home and family.  Holly appears indifferent to love, yet love is what redeems her.  Hepburn's performance is perceptive, sensitive, and captivating. She IS Holly Golightly. 4.  The achingly beautiful, melancholy Mancini/Mercer song "Moon River" and Mancini's lively score. 5.  Blake Edward's stylish direction. 6.  Audrey's elegant clothes. 7.  Last but not least, cat. These reasons alone will warm your heart and make you forever glad that you saw "Breakfast at Tiffany's".
