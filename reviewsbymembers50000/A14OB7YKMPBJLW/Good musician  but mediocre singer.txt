 I do think that Diana Krall is a talented musician.  She has good taste in her musical selections.  However, she is NOT a very good singer.  Her voice is weak.  Her diction is poor, and her phrasing is often sloppy and unimaginative. I would consider the following women great singers: Lena Horne, Aretha Franklin, Ella Fitzgerald, Doris Day, Judy Garland, Rosemary Clooney, Julie Andrews, and Barbra Streisand. These are artists whose voices are multi-octave.  These gifted performers have the ability to exhibit power or subtlety consistently and appropriately. Their technical skills are immaculate (with the exception of Judy Garland in her later years when her substance abuse caused her to slur her words). These magnificent singers bring exceptional clarity, sophistication and originality to their interpretations of classic American pop songs.  They can infuse the music with profound emotion. Diana Krall's vocals are superficial and pedestrian in comparison.  The quality of her voice is tenuous and inconsistent.
