 This dramatized biography of Rodgers and Hart is given the glossy MGM treatment, but is none the worse for it.  Rodgers and Hart's music is timeless.  There are many great performers in this movie such as Mickey  Rooney, Judy Garland, Lena Horne, Gene Kelly, etc. This movie is not a  masterpiece, but the music is superb and that elevates the entire movie.   Pleasant viewing.
