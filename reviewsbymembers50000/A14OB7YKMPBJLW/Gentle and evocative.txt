 "I Remember Mama" presents a gentle and compassionate portrait of a family of Norwegian immigrants who settle in San Francisco in the early 1900's.  The movie is narrated by the family's eldest daughter, now an adult, who has written a memoir about her childhood and her colorful family.  Her family includes Mama, Papa, siblings, and some overbearing but well-intentioned aunts and uncle.  Nothing sensational or terribly exciting happens in the lives of these ordinary, working class immigrants.  Yet, there is extraordinary poignance in the way in which the family deals with everyday crises such as the fate of an injured pet cat or the dilemma of a mother who is not allowed to see her child in the hospital.   Acclaimed director George Stevens reconstructs such events with an honesty and delicacy that resonates long after the movie ends.  And Stevens elicits superb performances from his cast led by Irene Dunne as the title character "Mama".  Dunne's performance is beautifully restrained as the humble, selfless matriach who possesses an indomitable spirit and generous heart.  The rest of the talented ensemble includes familiar and beloved actors such as Oscar Homolka, Barbara Bel Geddes aka Miss Ellie on the television series "Dallas", and Ellen Corby of "The Waltons" fame.  "I Remember Mama" is the kind of movie that will evoke childhood memories and remind you to appreciate where you came from and how far you've arrived.
