 The Sony RDR-GX7 DVD Recorder is a high-tech marvel brought to us by the ever visionary and ingenious folks at Sony.  Although the RDR-GX7 is somewhat expensive, it is well worth the price.  The recording clarity is top notch. And this machine is very user friendly. It automatically labels and dates your recorded programs.  And it creates "chapters" in your recordings.  You can instantly play back your entire recorded program (no re-winding necessary!).  Or you can select to play a specific chapter only.   If you record using DVD + RW discs, you can easily and quickly erase an existing recording and replace it with a new recording. It would require several minutes to erase the contents on a full VHS tape.  It takes about 1 second (no kidding!) to erase the contents on a full DVD + RW disc.  The RDR-GX7's advanced technology also prevents you from accidentally recording over a program that you intended to save.  And the machine will automatically adjust the recording speed if you are running out of room on your disc.  There are a few disadvantages in using the RDR-GX7.  My husband and I found it very complicated to set up this DVD recorder so that we could transfer existing programs from our VHS tapes onto DVD discs. We actually had to hire someone to do this.  Also, the recorder sometimes takes a long time to eject a recorded disc because it slowly "info writes" the disc prior to ejecting it. (I think that "info writes" has to do with identifying and storing information on the disc.) But these are minor complaints. Overall, the Sony RDR-GX7 is yet another miracle of technology which people will find hard to resist.
