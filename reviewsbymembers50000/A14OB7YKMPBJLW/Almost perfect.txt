 The Delonghi ST100P Steam It Clean Steamer is a powerful, versatile machine that includes a variety of convenient attachments to help you clean floors, windows, countertops, grout, you name it.  It also comes with extra-long hose extensions so that you can reach farther while you clean. And the extremely hot, high-pressured steam emitted by this Delonghi Steamer will surely kill most, if not all bacteria and germs so that you can reduce or eliminate the use of toxic disinfectants such as bleach or lye. It's a wise investment. The Delonghi ST100P Steamer is an almost perfect cleaning machine.  However, there is always room for improvement.  It would be an even better machine if it were more light weight and easier to manuever.  Also, some of the accessory cleaning tools and hose extensions are hard to attach and detach.  It would also be helpful if the main hose was detachable so that you could move or empty the steamer tank without having to drag the hose along.  Another nice improvement would be a self-retracting electrical cord so that you could move the machine without it running over its own cord. Overall, the Delonghi ST100P Steamer is a highly useful cleaning machine with impressive power and performance.
