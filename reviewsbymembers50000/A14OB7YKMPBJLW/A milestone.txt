 D.W. Griffith was undoubtedly an artist, a master storyteller, and a visionary in the development of motion pictures.  His "Birth of a Nation" is spellbinding as both epic history and intimate love story.  The movie's scenes are brilliantly staged and photographed.  The use of tints gives this movie a kind of aura. Griffith elicited realistic, natural performances from his talented cast.  And the gifted and ethereally beautiful Lillian Gish illuminates the screen whenever she appears.  Miss Gish exudes feistiness and strength while looking as delicate as porcelain.  She has an angelic face which is quite unforgettable. She makes today's movie stars look ordinary and boring in comparison. The downside of this movie is that it portrays the Ku Klux Klan as noble heroes when in fact they were just a bunch of bigoted murderers.  And the film uses racist and very negative stereotypes of black people.  It's also disconcerting to see that many of the "black" actors in this movie were actually white people in black face.  It looks ludicrous. But Griffith was the wizard who turned popcorn entertainment into artistic triumph and thus changed movies forever.
