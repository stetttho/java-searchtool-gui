 Acker Bilk (what a distinctive name he has!) composed and performs the title song "Stranger on the Shore" on this CD filled with familiar pop songs performed by Bilk's soothing clarinet in the foreground and the lovely strings orchestra in the background. The melody of "Stranger on the Shore" is one of the most wistfully beautiful and haunting ever composed. Once you hear this tune, you cannot forget it. The melody is constructed with such grace and ingenuity, that it stirs your imagination and soul like few other songs can.   I agree with the other reviewers that "Stranger on the Shore" is a masterpiece in popular music.  Its musical depth and emotional appeal are timeless and universal.
