 There are a handful of composers of American popular music whose body of work is revered generation after generation.  Kern, Arlen, Gershwin, and Loewe come to mind.   But at the top of the list is Richard Rodgers. In my opinion, Rodgers is the greatest songwriter in the history of Broadway and popular music.  His range was simply astonishing.  He could write jubilant, folksy music as in "Oklahoma" or jazzy sophisticated tunes as found in "Pal Joey".  He could create soaringly romantic melodies such as those in "The King and I" or inspirational and spiritual ballads as presented in "Carousel".  Many of his songs have become popular standards as well. Rodgers adapted brilliantly to a variety of subject matter.  And the longevity of his illustrious career is enviable. "Musical Stages" not only chronicles Rodgers' life and work, but it is also an overview of the development and maturation of American musical theater to which Rodgers contributed mightily. In this autobiography, you will get to know some of the true giants of American popular music in particular Rodgers' two lyricists: the impish, undisciplined, yet lovable genius Lorenz Hart and the wise and idealistic Oscar Hammerstein II.  Both of these men wrote many of the best lyrics ever composed for Broadway or popular music. You'll also meet acting luminaries such as Yul Brynner, Gertrude Lawrence, and Mary Martin among others.  "Musical Stages" is a rich addition to any theater and popular music buff's library.  Read it with delight!
