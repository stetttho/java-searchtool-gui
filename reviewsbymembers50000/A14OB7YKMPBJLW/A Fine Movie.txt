 This is an absorbing drama with excellent performances by the cast including Stanwyck, Douglas, and Heflin.  Barbara has the difficult task of  making her flawed character tough, yet sympathetic. She pulls this off  beautifully.  Yes, her past does come back to haunt her, but I was routing  for her because what happened in the past was an accident which came about  because of the cruel actions of someone else.  A fine and intense drama.  Recommended!
