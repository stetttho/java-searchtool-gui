 As most audiences know, "West Side Story" is a modern-day musical based on Shakespeare's tragedy ROMEO AND JULIET.  In this updated version of the story, two rival New York City street gangs known as the "Sharks" and the "Jets" replace the feuding Montague and Capulet families of the original play. "West Side Story" was originally released in 1961.  Yet its brilliance remains undiminished.  From the dazzling, street-smart direction by Robert Wise to Jerome Robbins' innovative choreography which melds raucous athleticism with balletic grace and precision, "West Side Story" is an unqualified triumph. Leonard Bernstein's vibrant, inventive, and uncommonly beautiful melodies challenge and engulf the audiences' senses.  Bernstein's score is still one of the finest ever written for theater or film.  Stephen Sondheim's verse is poetic and socially relevant.  Sondheim expresses himself with economy and clarity which are highly effective. There are few musicals on stage or on screen as riveting as "West Side Story". Don't miss this one!
