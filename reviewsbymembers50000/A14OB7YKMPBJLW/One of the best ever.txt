 ....In an era where flashy, split second MTV style images permeate the media, some audiences have no patience to allow a story to GRADUALLY unfold.  This is a visually rich, evocative love story  which takes place during and after war. The direction, acting, writing,  cinematography and every element of this movie is strikingly realized.   This is one of the best movies ever made. I kid you not. There are no cheap  thrills or sensationalism in this movie.  It is realistically told with  intelligent dialogue.  All this movie requires is that you are patient  enough to allow a complex story to be told gradually and poetically by a  formidable filmmaker, Anthony Minghella.
