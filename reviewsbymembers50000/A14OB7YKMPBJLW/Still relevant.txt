 "Black Legion" is a startlingly relevant and compelling drama about a factory worker (played by Humphrey Bogart) who is pursuaded into joining a bigoted, violent secret society when he loses a job promotion to an immigrant's son. This secret society is called the Black Legion.  They operate much like the Ku Klux Klan did in the 1930's.  The Black Legion members wear hooded costumes (similar to the KKK's).  Its members also claim to be "patriots" who want to rid America of "foreigners" who are successful in their community and who they perceive as a threat to their livelihood. (Again similar to the KKK.) "Black Legion" unflinchingly examines the brutality, ignorance, and prejudice of these self-appointed "patriots" who use hardworking immigrants as scapegoats for their own lack of ambition and success. This movie also exposes the greed which was a motivating factor in recruiting new members into the Black Legion.  With more members, the Black Legion could prosper financially since all who joined were required to pay dues and to provide other services for this violent group.  It is truly disturbing that the same kind of hatred which infected groups such as the Black Legion still exists today in the form of a revived Ku Klux Klan and the emergence of various white supremacist groups.  Although such fringe elements are small in number, their message of hate and intolerance can still hurt people. The "Black Legion", made in 1937, is a brave movie which pre-dates the civil rights movement.  It vividly illustrates the  cowardice and hypocrisy which drives groups such as the Black Legion. And its story gives us hope that hatred and violence can be conquered when decent people summon the courage to confront and punish evil-doers.
