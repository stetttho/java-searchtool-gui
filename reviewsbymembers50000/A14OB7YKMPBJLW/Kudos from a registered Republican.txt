 At long last!  Thank you Warner Home Video for your long-awaited release of the classic television series "Murphy Brown" on DVD.  I hope that Warner will see fit to release the entire series on DVD.  "Murphy Brown" is one of the finest television series ever made.  I am so grateful to Nickelodeon for rebroadcasting this classy, still relevant comedy series which courageously and consistently displayed a SOCIAL CONSCIENCE within witty, sophisticated repartee impeccably delivered by a gifted and very appealing ensemble cast.   And what can one say about the beautiful Candice Bergen who embodied the intelligent, gutsy, rough-on-the-outside/soft-on-the-inside (except when it came to exposing crooks and phonies) title character of Murphy Brown?  She is unequivocally brilliant in the role.  Bergen invests this unforgettable character with the complexity and depth she so richly deserves.   Whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, a conservative or a liberal, "Murphy Brown" tackled issues which should concern all of us.  Government corruption and waste; the damaging effects of pollution to our environment, wildlife, and ultimately to ourselves; the difficulties and challenges of single parenthood (And no, I do NOT advocate single parenthood.  However, it is a reality that needs to be dealt with); gender discrimination; TV network politics and ratings games:  these are timeless issues that still deserve our serious attention.  To everyone involved in the creation and production of "Murphy Brown", thank you for your brave and thought-provoking series which tackled difficult issues with humor, grace, and humanity.  This is one registered Republican viewer who is forever indebted to you!
