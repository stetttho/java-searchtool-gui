 "Amelie" is a wondrous and whimsical movie about a shy, beautiful young woman named Amelie who emerges from her sheltered, dream-like existence into the real world.   One fateful night, Amelie discovers a little keepsake box in her apartment.  This inspires her to find the owner of the box. She does find the owner.  She is so overjoyed by the owner's gratitude that she ventures out to do more good deeds for more people.  In the process, she changes peoples' lives for the better.  She also learns to trust people.  Amelie becomes a participant in life instead of only an observer as she had been.   And she eventually overcomes her fear of relationships and finds a soulmate. Visually, "Amelie" is a marvel in filmmaking with stunning cinematography and surprising, even startling special effects that are seemlessly blended into the comedy, romance, and fantasy of the story. The quirky narration and dialogue are filled with witty and worldy observations about life in Paris and about life in general.  "Amelie" is imaginatively brought to life by the director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and by its radiant star, Audrey Tautou.  Hers is a starmaking performance.  Tautou endearingly and precisely captures the hesitant charm, fragility, ingenuity, and ultimate determination of our heroine Amelie with exceptional subtlety and grace that should have earned her at least an Academy award nomination. The movie itself deserved to win Best Foreign Picture but didn't.  Go figure. By all means, buy this DVD.  You'll be enchanted and grateful for the experience of "Amelie".
