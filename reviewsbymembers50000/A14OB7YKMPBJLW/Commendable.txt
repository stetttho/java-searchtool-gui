 One does not need to be a "religious" person to commend and endorse Rabbi Lerner's message of love, tolerance, and respect for one another regardless of our religious, ethnic, and/or political affiliations. And Rabbi Lerner is right when he suggests that we need to be less selfish and more concerned about taking care of our planet and all those who inhabit it.  Too often we have become a self-indulgent, wasteful, or even destructive society.  We drain our limited natural resources for our own pleasure instead of preserving and replenishing those resources.  We should protect the quality of life and the health of our planet so that future generations will benefit as well as ourselves.  As a society it is deeply troubling that one segment of our population, namely the extreme religious right, attempts to control our politics, culture, and behavior.  These extremists condemn ANYONE who does not conform to their mold.  Isn't that contrary to tolerance and forgiveness as the Bible teaches?    I admire Rabbi Lerner's stand against the extreme religious right's bigotry towards non-Christians, intellectuals, homosexuals, or anyone else whom they consider "objectionable".  Rabbi Lerner seeks to comfort and bring people together based on our shared humanity.  The extreme religious right choses to ostracize and demonize those who are different from them.  They are not true Christians.  They are bullies.
