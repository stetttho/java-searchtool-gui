 "The Big Clock" is a taut, suspenseful drama about a magazine editor, George Stroud played by Ray Milland, who is framed for murder.  The murder was committed by his ruthless, maniacal boss, Earl Janoth portrayed with relish by Charles Laughton.  Janoth is a powerful media mogul who has a strange fascination with clocks.  He is obsessed with the measurement of time. (In one amusing scene occurring in a board room, Janoth, while staring at his watch, gives his editors the luxury of one minute each to explain how they will dramatically increase sales of his magazine. Then Janoth succinctly shoots down their ideas in a matter of seconds.) The screenplay of "The Big Clock" is cleverly constructed. It's not until the final five minutes of the movie that you learn whether or not Stroud can finally prove his innocence. The atmosphere of "The Big Clock" is very much in the tradition of film noir. There are plenty of scenes photographed in shadows or semi-darkness.  Shady, eccentric characters (who may or may not prove vital in clearing Stroud's name) creep in and out of the story.  The plot keeps you guessing. My only criticism is of the character played by Maureen O'Sullivan, Georgette, who is Stroud's wife. The scenarist could have given her more depth and made her more realistic. Instead, she is a one-dimensional doormat for her insensitive, self-centered husband. When Stroud is fired by Janoth, he is so inconsiderate and selfish that he decides to get drunk with a blonde instead of meeting his wife at the train station to leave on a long overdue honeymoon. Repeatedly, Stroud puts his career ambitions ahead of the emotional needs of his wife and child.  The wife gets dragged into a potential murder case because of her husband's faithlessness. Yet by the end of the movie, Georgette continues to passively and unquestioningly support her husband. That's quite a stretch. Overall though, "The Big Clock" is an engrossing and entertaining movie which is worth seeing.
