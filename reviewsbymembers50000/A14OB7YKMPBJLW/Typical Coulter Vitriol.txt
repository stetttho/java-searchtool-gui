 Miss Coulter's mediocre literary skills are once again evident in her latest whiney, often vitriolic attack on liberals, Democrats, and basically anyone who does not agree with her intolerant, narrow view of what the world should be.  The only reason her books sell is because she appeals to a blindly loyal, ultra-conservative segment of our population who can't get enough of mean-spirited liberal bashing the kind of which Miss Coulter consistently spews. Also, Coulter is very good at self-promotion on any media outlet that will have her.  Do not waste your time or hard-earned money on this hate-mongering rubbish!
