 The regal Pekingese is represented in 12 handsome color portraits accompanying each month in the "Pekingese 2004 Calendar". The intelligence and charm of these determined little canines are captured in the vivid color photography and delightful poses of some of the most adorable pooches you'll ever see. I was introduced to this marvelous breed when a small, starving and soiled looking stray Pekingese happened to cross a highway while I was driving.  I stopped, picked him up, and never let him go.  He was the first dog that I ever owned.  My husband and I named him Mu Shu.  He was pure joy. The "Pekingese 2004 Calendar" is a must-have for anyone who has ever had the privilege of sharing their lives with this elegant, sweet-natured beauty.
