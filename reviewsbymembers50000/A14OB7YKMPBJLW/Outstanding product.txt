 As with all Circulon pans, the Classic 2-1/2 Quart Covered Straining Windsor Pan with Pouring Lips, is an outstanding product. The non-stick surface is a breeze to clean.  The pot,lid, and handle are all solidly constructed, very durable, and easy to maneuver.  And those wonderful pouring lips make transferring food easy and spotless.  You cannot find a better product than this on the market.  My family's thanks to Circulon for their superior cookware.  And our appreciation to Amazon for making Circulon cookware readily available to consumers at such affordable prices!
