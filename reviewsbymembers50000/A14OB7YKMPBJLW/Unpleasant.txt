 While there are admirable elements in "Y Tu Mama Tambien" such as three attractive-looking, capable lead actors and nice cinematography, overall I found this movie to be unpleasant and distasteful.  Its plot focuses on the promiscous, immoral behavior of two young men and an older woman who are brought together on a road trip.  Their sexual exploits are rather graphically depicted.  This movie could have made its point without as many gratuitous, explicit sex scenes.  "Y Tu Mama Tambien" resembles porn more than it does classy filmmaking.
