 Lorenz Hart is one of the finest lyricists in the history of American musical theater.  He is largely responsible for elevating the process of writing lyrics into an art form.  Before Hart, lyrics were usually trite and predictable with simplistic rhymes such as "I am blue, and so are you." Hart wrote lyrics that are cerebral and sophisticated.  His compositions are infused with wit and wisdom.  He used complex rhymes.  An example from "My Funny Valentine": "Your looks are laughable, unphotographable.  Yet you're my favorite work of art. Is your figure less than Greek?  Is your mouth a little weak? When you open it to speak, are you smart?" Another example from "Bewitched": "I'm wild again, beguiled again, a whimpering simpering child again...." And yet another example from "Lady is a Tramp": "She gets too hungry for dinner at eight. She likes the theater but never comes late. She never bothers with people she hates.  That's why the lady is a tramp." Hart could be wistful and romantic as in "My Romance": "My romance doesn't need to have a moon in the sky.  My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by. No month of May. No twinkling star. No hideaway. No soft guitar." Hart's lyrics are consistently observant and very often ingenious.  They are the perfect match for the variety and intricacy of Richard Rodgers' superb music. When you read through this collection of Hart's compositions, you will realize why this diminutive, gifted and endearing artist is a true giant of the musical theater.
