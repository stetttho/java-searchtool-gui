 The only reason I purchased this video was because I'm a fan of Annie Potts.  But even her talent is not enough to redeem "Pass the Amo".   This movie is supposedly a "comedy" that parodies television evangelism.  Instead, it is an ultra-violent mess of a movie where the "heroes" brandish guns and threaten to kill innocent people if the crooked ministry does not return $50,000 of money which was wrongly donated to the church. The "heroes" succeed in retrieving their money as well as exposing the corrupt ministry.  But is the end supposed to justify the means?  I believe that this movie sends a horrible message that violence pays off.  Our real world is threatened daily by Al Qaida and other terrorists groups.  Gun-related murders and other crimes committed with guns are still rampant in our society.  Yet this movie seems to glorify violence rather than condemn it.   I am NOT an anti-NRA person.  Most gunowners are responsible, law-abiding people.  But the message that "Pass the Amo" so disturbingly conveys is that violence does have its own rewards.  That message is not only in poor taste, it's downright unconsionable. Audiences should pass on "Pass the Amo".
