 "When Harry Met Sally" is one of the brightest and best romantic comedies ever made.  The story of the friendship between Harry and Sally crackles with wit and insight into the differences between men and women and the way those differences affect relationships, sex, and commitment. It is a tribute to the quality and realism of Nora Ephron's fine, funny script that we come to identify with and care so much about Harry (played by Billy Crystal), Sally (played by Meg Ryan), Marie (Sally's best friend played by Carrie Fisher), and Jess (Harry's best pal portrayed by Bruno Kirby).  These are four urban upwardly mobile young people who excel in their professions but who are tentative in their relationships with the opposite sex.  We follow these four characters over a decade as they grow as people and mature in their relationships. Rob Reiner's assured direction keeps the story moving along at a lively pace.  There are no dull moments in this movie.  And the gifted, urbane cast of Crystal, Ryan, Kirby, and Fisher are exceptionally good.  These intriguing, facile actors bring exquisite charm, humor, pathos, and intelligence to their roles.  It's an ideal cast. So as surely as Harry realizes that he's in love with Sally, you'll fall head over heels for "When Harry Met Sally". It's a perfect, perceptive marvel of romantic comedy.
