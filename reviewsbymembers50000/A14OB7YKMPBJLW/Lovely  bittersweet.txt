 I happened to stumble upon "Take Care of My Cat" while searching for movies about cats.  This title sounded intriguing so I decided to buy the DVD.  I am very happy that I did!  An adorable stray kitten named Tee-Tee is the cat referred to in the title.  Tee-Tee serves as a common thread that weaves through the lives of five spirited, attractive young Korean women, former classmates, who remain friends through young adulthood.  Tae-Hee is the sensitive, understanding anchor of this group of friends.  She still lives with her parents even though she can barely tolerate her chauvinistic father.  Ji-Young is a budding textile artist who resides with her elderly, impoverished grandparents since her own parents died.  Hae-Joo is an endearingly self-centered, ambitious office worker who wants to climb the corporate ladder.  Unfortunately, she lacks the college degree that will enable her to do so.  As such, she is relinquished to the position of a glorified runner.  Bi-Ryu and Ohn-Jo are good-natured twin sisters who look so much alike that even their closest friends mistake one for the other.  "Take Care of My Cat" is the kind of movie that Hollywood is no longer willing or able to produce.  It is an unhurried, delicately observed slice of life about ordinary people living each day as best they can.  It's about the momentary joys and sudden catastrophes life can deliver and the way in which our friendships fortify us.  "Take Care of My Cat" tells its story with grace, honesty, and good doses of humor and wisdom.  It's a lovely, bittersweet movie that deserves a large audience.
