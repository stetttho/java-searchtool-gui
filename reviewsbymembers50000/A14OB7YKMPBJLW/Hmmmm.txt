 This was a very strange story about a privileged youth who rejects his wealthy lifestyle and willingly self-destructs with the help of a shell-shocked, miserable refugee from Bosnia.  I felt badly that this young man's Bosnian half-sister had suffered so much brutality in the war.  However, she did not have to inflict her pain upon her half brother.  Her misery and numbness and the brother's willingess to wallow in this misery and numbness destroys both of them in the end.   They both would have been better off having several sessions with a good shrink.  The half-brother could probably afford to hire the most expensive shrinks available.  That kid was rolling in dough! I am not a prude or I wouldn't have rented this movie in the first place.  However, the totally explicit sexual scenes were not exactly necessary and not really even sexy, just rather cold and clinical. (And to be honest, closeups of aroused genitals are not always the prettiest sights around.) It was impossible to empathize with anyone in this film because everyone in this movie was completely self-absorbed, leadenly serious, and joylessly masochistic.  About an hour into this movie, I longed to watch a Looney Tunes cartoon so that I could be reminded that there is such a thing as humor and fun. The only good thing about this movie was the acting and the photography which were both outstanding.  And the DVD clarity was excellent as well.
