 "8 Women" is a sly, tongue-in-cheek homage to old movie murder mysteries and classic Hollywood musicals.  It's a unique mystery/musical combo.  There are many delicious aspects to this movie not the least of which is the sparkling screenplay, which is alternately satirical and poignant, and eight skillful performances by the appealing lead actresses. Among the standouts:  Fanny Ardant as Pierrette, the sultry former exotic dancer who is the deceased's estranged sister.  (Ardant bears an uncanny resemblance to a sexy Rita Hayworth in her prime.)  And Isabelle Huppert as the brittle spinsterish sister of Gaby, the deceased man's wife, played by Catherine Deneuve.  Huppert seems to enjoy chewing the scenary as much as we enjoy seeing her chew it. Other delights are the brightly colored, coordinated sets and costumes and the inventive musical score which ranges from goofy to gloomy.  The direction by Francois Ozon is lively and just plain fun. "8 Women" is a gem of a movie.  Treat yourself and see it.
