 Under the sensitive direction of the great director, George Cukor, Garbo shines in perhaps her finest performance. She captures the beauty and tragedy of Camille's life perfectly.  The sets and costumes are exquisite.   Robert Taylor makes an extraordinarily handsome and appropriately naive yet  tender Armand.  One of Cukor's best movies which still looks fresh decades  after it was initially released.
