 Yes, "Moulin Rouge" is a technically daring movie.  But it is also one of the most irritating movies of all time.  The director Baz Luhrmann rarely keeps his camera focused for more than a split second on any actor in this movie.  Everytime you want to get a good look at the actor's face and expressions, Luhrmann purposely swings the camera away from the actor.   It makes for a very cold and distant presentation of the story. And the songs are often screamed (rather than sung) in an annoying high pitch.  This becomes grating, even repulsive to hear. I think Baz Luhrmann has appeared on every entertainment news show on television praising the "artistry" of his own movie.  That kind of vanity just adds to the general distastefulness of this movie.   Getting a root canal is a less painful experience than seeing and listening to this in-your-face, over-the-top, and reveling-in-its-own-excess shipwreck of a movie. And when I say "shipwreck", I'm talking the Titanic.
