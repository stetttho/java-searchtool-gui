 "My Fair Lady" is the legendary director George Cukor's crowning achievement.   Every element of this movie works, from its sumptuous photography by veteran cameraman Harry Stradling, to the glorious costumes and sets created by Cecil Beaton.  The music is incomparable.  Frederick Loewe's melodies are lovely and infectious and Alan Jay Lerner's lyrics are every bit as witty and touching as the dialogue originally written by playwright George Bernard Shaw for "Pygmalion".  "My Fair Lady" is the musical version of "Pygmalion". The transformation of the illiterate, unwashed Eliza Doolittle into the breathtaking "Fair Lady" of the film's title is inspiring to see.  This is one of Audrey Hepburn's best roles, and she is perfection as Eliza Doolittle.  She is thoroughly convincing as the Cockney flower girl who transcends her humble roots to end up dancing with a prince at an embassy ball. Hepburn expertly translates Eliza's tenacity, vulnerbility, intelligence, and grace into a beautiful and timeless performance. Yes, it's true that Julie Andrews (who created the original Eliza on Broadway) was bypassed for this role.  However, this was purely a business decision made by studio head Jack Warner.  He did not want to risk such a lavish, expensive production on a relative newcomer such as Andrews was at the time.  So he went with the safe bet, Hepburn, as Eliza Doolittle.  Audrey was an established star with a great track record. But Andrews soon recovered from this disappointment to make two blockbusters of her own, "Mary Poppins" and "Sound of Music".  Not a bad trade-off I'd say. Anyway, I enthusiastically recommend that you buy "My Fair Lady" on DVD or VHS.  It is one of the best musicals ever written for stage or screen.  You'll see what I mean.
