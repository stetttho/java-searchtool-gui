 Yes, the title "D-Day the Sixth of June" is irritatingly  misleading.  This movie spends most of its time chronicling the tawdry tale of a married U.S. military officer who has an affair with a British USO-type woman who is engaged to be married to a courageous British officer.  The battle scenes are sporadic, and the story creaks along slowly.  The handsome Robert Taylor and the beautiful Dana Wynter are basically wasted because their roles are so unsympathetic.  The characters that they portray have few qualms about cheating on their loved ones. The movie also is not helped by a repetitious, sappy musical score that includes the sentimental song "You'll Never Know (How Much I Love You)" which accompanies the illicit lovers as they unapologetically indulge in their affair. "D-Day the Sixth of June" is strictly for diehard fans of Taylor or Wynter. And perhaps not even those fans will be able to swallow this drivel.
