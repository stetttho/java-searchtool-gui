 "All Fall Down" is a drama laced with occasional comedy and whimsy that examines the effect that a spoiled, irresponsible drifter named Barry Barry has upon his well-meaning family and upon the innocent young woman who unfortunately falls in love with him.  Barry Barry is a young man in his twenties who has never had a steady job.  But because of his killer good looks women (especially those who are lonely) throw themselves at him.  Barry Barry uses these women as meal tickets.  He regards them as pathetic, and he treats them indifferently or cruelly.  Barry Barry is self-loathing.  His well-intentioned parents have over-indulged him.  They tolerate and enable his reckless and sometimes violent behavior.  He returns home at Christmas time after his parents bail him out of jail for assaulting a woman.  There he meets Echo whose parents are friends of his parents.  She is there for a brief visit.   Echo is a vivacious, single woman about 10 years older than Barry Barry.  She is self-sufficient and has a career.  She is also recovering from the tragic suicide of an alcoholic man whom she befriended.   Barry Barry is immediatly attracted to the beautiful and warm-hearted Echo.  But when he finds out that she is pregnant with his child, he runs away from her leading to events that change the attitudes and lives of those who love him.    "All Fall Down" has fine performances from an extremely talented cast which includes Warren Beatty as Barry Barry, Karl Malden and Angela Lansbury as his adoring parents, and a teenage Brandon De Wilde as Barry Barry's idealistic younger brother who has himself fallen in love with Echo.  The highly respected John Frankenheimer directs this movie crisply and effectively.   "All Fall Down" is an excellent production worthy of a large audience.
