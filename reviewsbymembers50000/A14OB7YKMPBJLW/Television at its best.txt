 "The Larry Sanders Show" is perhaps the most realistic and funniest television series ever written about show business.  In this case, the "business" is producing a late night talk show hosted by the amiable, humorous Larry Sanders, a Johnny Carson-like character deftly portrayed by Garry Shandling. (Shandling is also the creator and frequent writer of this series.) This classy television series shrewdly examines the behind-the-scenes and in front of the camera workings of a nightly television show. "The Larry Sanders Show" is a compendium of network executives, producers, actors, and agents whose enlarged yet fragile egos often clash with each other.  The results are caustic and hilarious. The gifted ensemble cast which includes Shandling, Rip Torn, Janeane Garofalo, and Jeffrey Tambor deliver the incisive, witty dialogue with ease.  The concept and structure of this series is so realistic that you often feel as though you are watching a documentary on "How to" or "How NOT to" grind out a nightly talk show. "The Larry Sanders Show" is television at its best.  Please don't miss it!
