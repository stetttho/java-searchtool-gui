 My mom introduced me to this movie in the 1970's. It is one of her favorites and is still one of mine.  Vivien Leigh's ethereal beauty and her  delicate portrayal of the crestfallen ballerina are unforgettable.  And  Robert Taylor gives a buoyant performance as the officer who loves this  tragic heroine.  For those who have never seen Robert Taylor, he was one of  the most handsome leading men of his generation. And the scene where they  waltz to "Auld Lang Syne" certainly must be one of the most  romantic and tender scenes in movie history. This is a 5 star tear jerker.   Just lovely.
