 In "Chinatown", Jack Nicholson plays a hard-boiled, yet decent private eye, Jake Gittes, who is drawn into a labyrinth of corruption and evil involving the misappropriation of water during a drought in 1930's Los Angeles County. Faye Dunaway plays the beautiful and enigmatic Evelyn Mulwray whose husband uncovers the misdeeds. He is murdered as a result. "Chinatown" is a tour de force in every aspect from the slyly engrossing direction of Roman Polanski to the brisk and ingenious screenplay by Robert Towne.   The performances are uniformly superb.  Nicholson is 100% believable as the sardonic, weary, and compassionate detective.  And Faye Dunaway proves yet again that she is more than simply a classic beauty.  (And her beauty is quite extraordinary indeed!) Dunaway subtly conveys the intelligence, anguish, and tragedy of her femme fatale character.  Hers is a heartbreaking, richly layered performance.  From the onset, Dunaway is able to suggest that Evelyn Mulwray's icy composure is merely a defense mechanism which hides unspeakable trauma.  You come to realize just how vulnerable and fragile her seemingly impenetrable persona is.   "Chinatown" is an intellectual, gut-wrenching masterpiece. It represents the work of artists at the peak of their skills.  "Chinatown" has and will endure as one of the finest movies ever made.
