 I thought this movie was taut and suspenseful. It had me guessing about who was really the good guy up until the very end.  Barbara Stanwyck gives  another solid performance as the rather mysterious heroine.  She also looks  terrific in clothes that were designed for her by the late, great Edith  Head.  Errol Flynn makes a convincing, seemingly sinister scientist. Yes,  the ending is a bit over the top but in a highly entertaining way. And the  photography, sets, and musical score are excellent.  This is old Hollywood  style movie making in top form.   Recommended!
