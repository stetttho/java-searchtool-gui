 This is a "must have" DVD.  Michael Flatley's mathmatically precise, symmetrical choreography seems to move at the speed of lighting.  The viewer is swept away by the beauty and pulsating rhythm of the dances  and dancers. Flatley himself is a graceful, charismatic, catlike performer.   His difficult movements seem to come effortlessly.  The music, sets,  costumes, and lighting are also magnificent. You must see "Lord of the  Dance"!
