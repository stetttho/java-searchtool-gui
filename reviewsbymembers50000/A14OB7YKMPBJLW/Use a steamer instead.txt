 After reading the mixed reviews for the Hoover Floor Mate, I decided to take a positive approach and purchased this machine. Why not give it a try? So after carefully reading the instruction manual, I tried to clean the spots off of my WHITE ceramic tile floor using the Floor Mate.  I thought that those whirling brushes would easily remove stains from my tile floor.  I was wrong.  The spots remained even though I went over them numerous times with the Floor Mate.   And the type of stains I tried to clean were NOT the stubborn kind such as dried-on egg or scuff marks.  The stains I attempted to clean were soup stains and soda pop stains.  The Floor Mate simply bypassed these stains. Its brushes are either positioned too high and/or the bristles are not sturdy enough to scrape off stains. Needless to say, I am returning the Hoover Floor Mate for a refund.  Thank goodness I kept my Delonghi pressurized steam cleaner which I purchased from Amazon.  Although this steam cleaner is not quite as easy to manuever as the Hoover Floor Mate, it does what it's supposed to do.  It easily and thoroughly cleans every imaginable kind of stain and gets my tile floor squeaky clean.  Hoover's concept of a machine that scrubs floors is a good one, but the product they developed for this purpose needs to be revamped.  The Hoover Floor Mate is a noble idea, poorly executed.
