 Like champagne, the musical comedy "Love Me Tonight", is light, bubbly, and improves with age.  It's hard to fathom that this delightful movie was made over 70 years ago because it looks and feels fresh and contemporary.   Rouben Mamoulian directs with verve complemented by the vibrant black and white photography of Victor Milner. Master composer Richard Rodgers creates lovely, wistful melodies that stay with you.  And the erudite lyricist Lorenz Hart infuses his sophisticated lyrics with wit, charm, and innuendo. The two leads, Maurice Chevalier as the smitten tailor, and Jeanette MacDonald, as the royal object of Chevalier's affection, have seldom been more appealing. Here's a toast to the delectable artists who cultivated the sparkling, effervescent classic "Love Me Tonight".
