 The correct opening line of "My Romance" should be "My romance doesn't HAVE to have a moon in the sky" instead of "NEED to have a moon in the sky" as I incorrectly stated in my review here. Also, in "Lady is a Tramp" I used the third person instead of the original first person usage to demonstrate the lyrics.  The original "Lady is a Tramp" is written as "I get too hungry for dinner at eight. I like the theater but never come late....etc."  I used the third person because it is the more familiar version.  AND AS A TESTAMENT to the timelessness of Rodgers and Hart's songs, listen to the current Ralph Lauren "Romance" perfume commercial.   It features James Taylor and Carly Simon singing the opening and closing lines of "My Romance". It's a beautiful, heartfelt song nicely rendered by Taylor and Simon.
