 This is one of those undiscovered gems which more people should know about.  It perfectly showcases the genius of the music and words of Rodgers and Hart. It also proves that Al Jolson could act as well as sing his heart  out.  I enthusiastically recommend this video to anyone young or old who  wants to see something totally refreshing and original.
