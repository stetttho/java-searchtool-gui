 The two child leads Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber are as fresh, unaffected,  and appealing as they were in "Mary Poppins."  I saw  this movie as a child and never forgot it.  I've seen it several times  since and still adore this movie about a girl's love for her cat Thomasina.  (By the way, the cat is a good actor also!) Patrick McGoohan and Susan  Hampshire are the appealing adult leads.  Charming and disarming. Disney  hits another home run with this bittersweet tale of love and loss.
