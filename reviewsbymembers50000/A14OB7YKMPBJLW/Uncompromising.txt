 "The Lost Weekend" delivers a glimpse into the world of an alcoholic.  The alcoholic is Don Birman, a failed writer who seems unable to recapture the early creative success of his youth.  He is magnificently portrayed by handsome leading man, Ray Milland, who doesn't mind looking really scruffy throughout the movie.  Birman is someone who abandons a writing project almost as soon as he begins one.  He's so afraid to "fail" that he doesn't even try to succeed at anything.  Birman claims a lack of inspiration and focus.  He should have remembered that wise old adage "creativity is 99% perspiration and only 1% inspiration".  But he is undisciplined and not confident.  Birman's impatience and non-commitment to his work build frustration and reinforce insecurities within himself.  To numb these painful feelings, he increasingly turns to alcohol.  Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, Wilder's frequent collaborator have written a courageous often harrowing screenplay.  It is searingly honest in its depiction of the downward spiral caused by substance abuse.  And Wilder's forceful direction shows that he is in complete command of this sensitive subject matter.  My only complaint about this movie is the music score by Miklos Rozsa.  Whenever Milland's character is lured by an alcoholic drink, Rozsa's score sounds as if it is emitting radio waves.   Was this the composer's way of suggesting that alcohol was an invisible force over Don Birman?  Only the usually reliable Rozsa knows for sure.     At any rate, "The Lost Weekend" is a powerful and uncompromising chronicle of alcoholism.  Please see it!
