 I have had this book since it was originally published in 1972.  I keep it because it is an insightful commentary on some of America's greatest composers, Rodgers, Kern, Gershwin, etc.  I would have to agree with Mr.  Wilder that Richard Rodgers' music represents "the highest degree of  consistent excellence, inventiveness, and sophistication."  And since  Mr. Wilder is himself a fine composer, he should know.  He supports his  opinions with intelligent, knowledgeable analysis. People seem to have a  knee jerk reaction whenever the name "Gershwin" is mentioned, but  I agree with Mr. Wilder's assessment that RICHARD RODGERS' music was the  most CONSISTENTLY masterful in the history of musical theater.  Rodgers'  range was incredible from the playful jazziness of "Manhattan"  and "Lady is a Tramp" to the sophistication of "If I Loved  You" and the lesser known, "Do I Hear A Waltz". Rodgers was  an astonishing talent.  Rodgers even wrote the lyrics and music to the  lovely musical "No Strings".  I get so tired of only hearing  about Gershwin's greatness.  Rodgers was every bit as good, if not better  than Gershwin.  I think Rodgers gets penalized at times because not only  was his music great, but it was very accessible and popular with everyday  audiences.  A part of Gershwin's music strikes me as somewhat pretentions  as are some of the tunes in "Porgy and Bess" and "An  American In Paris".  Rodgers seems to touch a familiar cord with  audiences young and old, from generation to generation.  As I video store  owner, I know that people were willing to pay $50 or more for an out of  print edition of the video "Sound of Music".  None of my other  videos could fetch such a good price.
