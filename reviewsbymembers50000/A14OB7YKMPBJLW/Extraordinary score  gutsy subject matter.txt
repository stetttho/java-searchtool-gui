 Someone in another review mentioned that this movie contains sexist and spousal abuse issues.  I think that "Carousel" was supposed to have taken place in the early 1900's when women were often treated as  property and less than human.  I don't think the movie glorifies that.  In  fact, it is critical of Billy Bigelow's abuse of his wife.   Other than  the controversial themes examined in this movie, I think few would argue  that the score contains some of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein's  best work, particularly "If I Loved You" and "You'll Never  Walk Alone" which are heartachingly beautiful pieces. And the  "Carousel Waltz" perfectly captures the feeling and wonder of the  carnival atmosphere where some of the musical is staged. This is one of the  earliest Broadway musicals that dared to explore serious subjects, i.e.  spousal abuse, violence within the context of a musical. That took guts!
