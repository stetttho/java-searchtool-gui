 Loved this atypical John Wayne movie. Howard Hawks deserves praise for showing an appreciation for these beautiful African animals.  I'm glad there is no hunting or slaughter of these magnificent creatures in this  lighthearted, endearing movie.  Henry Mancini's score is excellent and  funny too.  The whole family will enjoy seeing this delightful gem of a  movie!  By the way, as a video retailer myself, I can also tell you that  this is one of our most popular titles sold. You should check it out!
