 After a spate of television shows in the 1980's that portrayed women as bimbos, ..., or perpetual second bananas, along came the groundbreaking comedy, "Designing Women".  This memorable series featured four intelligent, successful women who happened to be attractive and independent as well. The cast was lead by Dixie Carter who portrayed Julia Sugarbaker, the articulate, formidable owner of a thriving interior design business.  Her partner and sister, Suzanne Sugarbaker, delectably played by Delta Burke, was a saucy, endearingly self-centered former beauty queen with a knack for speaking exactly as she thought.  Annie Potts was the witty, wisecracking designer Mary Jo.  Rounding out the cast was Jean Smart who portrayed the kind-hearted and slightly naive office manager, Charlene. Unlike so many cardboard female characters on television at the time, the women of "Designing Women" were full-blooded and three dimensional.  They were risk-takers and role models.  How refreshing and commendable it was for Linda Bloodworth-Thomason to bring women like these to life in a weekly television series.  And what a superlative cast she assembled in Carter, Burke, Potts, and Smart. "Designing Women" paved the way for a more realistic representation of women on television.  It dealt with issues that are important to women in their day-to-day lives.  And it was elegant comedy rarely seen on television.
