 One of the best romantic comedies ever, "Four Weddings and a Funeral" follows a close-knit group of unattached British thirtysomethings whose major diversion is attending other people's weddings (while hoping to find their own true love during the course of four weddings).  Romantic connections are made, lost, and rediscovered amongst the guests at the weddings plus a tragic funeral.  These entanglements are buoyed by a funny, observant screenplay which includes references to David Cassidy and the Partridge Family as well as an hilarious stretch in which a nervous novice minister adds a new twist to the nuptials by referring to the bride-to-be as an "AWFUL wedded wife" or by concluding the rituals "in the name of the father, son, and holy GOAT". Rowan Atkinson aka Mr. Bean plays the bumbling minister to side-splitting perfection.  This is the movie that elevated Hugh Grant to major stardom and familiarized American audiences with a strikingly beautiful,  gifted young actress named Kristin Scott Thomas.  Miss Thomas, elegant, witty, and world weary steals most of the scenes she's in.  The entire cast is superb.  They negotiate the movie's comic and melancholy turns masterfully.  "Four Weddings and a Funeral" is a serious delight.  See for yourself!
