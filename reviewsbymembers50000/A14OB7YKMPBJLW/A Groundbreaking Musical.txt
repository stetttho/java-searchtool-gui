 This is the Rodgers and Hammerstein classic that changed musicals forever with songs blending seamlessly into the plot.  The songs also helped advance the story.  Prior to "Oklahoma", musicals were more like  revues.  "Oklahoma" changed all that. This film is a beautiful  realization of the stage version.  It gives you the feeling of the wide  open spaces.  And isn't "Out of My Dreams" one of the loveliest  waltzes ever composed for musical theater?  I just adore that waltz and the  feeling of floating and gliding that it conveys.  This is a good movie for  the entire family to see.
