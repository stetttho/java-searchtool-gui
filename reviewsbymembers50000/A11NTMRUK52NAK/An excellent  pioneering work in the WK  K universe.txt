 I am not a RPG Gamer, but a long-time Watson fan.  This is an excellent read!  In fact, it made me a WH40K fan.  This is a gripping, epic tale of mankind's far-future struggles against weird and dangerous evil beings.  Written in a tightly-plotted,  delightfully detailed, deliriously baroque and wonderfully atmospheric prose that is Watson's  inimitable housestyle, this is a SURE FIRE GOOD READ!!  In case anyone is not familiar to the WH40K universe theme, the future of mankind in the forty-first millenium is a galactic human empire beset on all fronts by demon infestation (''Chaos''). The Emperor is some sort of psychic god on earth - half-dead, conscious only by din of sheer force of willpower sustained by technology - presiding over a huge Theocratic empire spanning lightyears, the ecclesiastical structure employing deadly force and ruthless subterfuge to protect human race against being overwhelmed by demonic contamination. Imagine the Spanish Inquisition ruling a galactic empire. The imaginative vista is panoramic, sweeping and jaw-dropping. The opportunities for good yarn-spinning is enormous:-  this is a cross between the Spanish Inquisition and Isaac Asimov's galactic empire, only this time the Inquisitors are the good guys trying to keep humanity, well, human. Ian's plotting is fantastic, and his command of dramatic tension absolutely masterful. This is a classic and an amazing work. Anyone knows Watson's email?  Been  trying to compliment him personally for the longest time now ...B-)
