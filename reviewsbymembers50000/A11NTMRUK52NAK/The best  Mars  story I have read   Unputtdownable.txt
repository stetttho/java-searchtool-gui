 There are many Mars sci-fi books out there starting from HG Wells' 'War of the Worlds' down to recent ones like 'Moving Mars', 'Green Mars', 'Blue Mars' etc.  No one quite does it like Mick, though.  I have read them all  but Mick's 'Mars' is the most entertaining version:-  a tightly plotted  tale skillfully interweaving the myriad themes of first contact,  post-collapse off-world communism, frontier 'cowboy' tale, cyberpunk,  travelogue etc, an absolutely delicious and EXOTIC mixture, set on Mars no  less, served up by the Master story-teller Mick.  Any lesser mortal  attempting such a mix would likely encounter utter disaster, whereas Mick  achieved an utterly delight of a tight tight TIGHT read!  Any tighter the  book spine would burst apart!  Whereas 'Moving Mars' was a lecture on  quantum physics, 'Green/Blue/Red Mars' treatises on sociology and ecology,  Mick weaves an unputtdownable thriller of unparallelled variety.  WE WANT  MORE MICK!! WE WANT MORE MICK!! WE WANT MORE MICK!!  Anyone out there knows  Mick's email? Tell me at  cthulhufatagn@hotmail.com.  I have been wanting  to compliment him personally for a loooong time now. B-) Visit Mick's webpage http://www.thanatosoft.freeserve.co.uk/
