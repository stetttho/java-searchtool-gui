 The nostalgia of many for Hitler and his Third Reich, the allure of his ideology, the sympathy of old and young in Germany and many other parts of the world for Hitler's lost cause, the strange attractions to many (including ironically Jews!) of Nazi memorabilia - all these are important sociological issues which merits a careful and forensic analysis.  The demise of the extreme right spectrum of the world political stage since WWII also deserved scholarly treatment.  What accounts for the  strange, surprisingly international appeal of Hitler in this day and age!?  This book offers none of that.  Yes, as the author admitted, it is a deeply personal enquiry into the question of why Hitler as the ideologue and model has refused to die - notwithstanding that Nazism was literally bombed into the sub-basement at the end of WWII.  It is personal to the extent of being badly organized, poorly conceptualized, and not held together by any coherent or well-thought out system or order.  This is a very shoddy treatment of a historically and sociologically significant topic, nearly an insult.  It reads like the author simply wrote out into full essay length his personal scrapbook.  Only mildly entertaining in odd places.  A grave disappointment.  Adolf deserves a better class of analyst.
