 The best, this is the best, my fave for all time!  Wanna see the most astonishing car-crash special effects sequence in movie history?  Wanna see better car-chase scenes than Bullit?  THIS IS IT!  Old Nick on a Sunday  drive - whatta smashing (pardon the pun!) premise!  The "Car" of  the title does everything the average motorist can only fantasize about  doing to other road-users, pedestrians etc.  No doubt an exlpoitation  movie, but WHATTA RIDE (no pun, this)!   Goferrit!
