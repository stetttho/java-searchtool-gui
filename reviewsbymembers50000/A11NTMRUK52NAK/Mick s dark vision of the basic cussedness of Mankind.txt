 Set in the far far future, this is more of Mick's dim vision of the inherent cussedness of Mankind as a species. Told from the (semi-biographical?)perspective of a professional gambler, this is a highly entertaining 2-part tale of misadventures in the far future Earth of isolated cities and decadent magnificence. Basically a travelogue wrapped around a convincing and entertaining plot-line, Mick offers the reader a peerless trip down a parallel, possible future. Mick seldom disappoints, and I buy his books on strength that HE wrote it, and I have always been richly entertained, and this is no exception. We want more MICK! We want more MICK!
