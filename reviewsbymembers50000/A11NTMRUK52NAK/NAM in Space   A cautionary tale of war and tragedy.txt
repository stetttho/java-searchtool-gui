 The sequel to 'PROTECTORATE', though one would not realise this till the very end, this is an excellently told tale of the entire human race reduced to cannon fodder by a race of conquering aliens.  A frightening,  entertaining, cynical, but above all ENTERTAINING tale told thru the  perspective of hapless infantry foot soldiers press-ganged into fighting a  vast, meaningless war waged by superior alien races.  One of my all-time  favourites 'war is hell' or 'space war' stories.  I am surprised and  saddened that this book has not been made into a movie (or at least a  computer RPG) yet.  Too dark, perhaps??  Remember the 60's TV series  'Combat'?  This is the space-going version of that.  IMHO, one of the best  'Mankind as Conquered Species' stories ever written, ranks right up there  with 'Men like Rats', 'The Tripod Trilogy' etc.  Mick's alien conquerors  are so sinister and effectively portrayed, makes the lizards of 'V' seem  like escapees from a children's pett'in zoo!  Anyone out there knows the  email address of Mick? Tell me at cthulhufatagn@hotmail.com, have been  wanting to compliment him personally for many years now.
