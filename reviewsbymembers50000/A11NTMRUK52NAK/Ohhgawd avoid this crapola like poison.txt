 Ohhgawd avoid this crapola like poison.  This is neither a scholastically researched, nor an academically-sound nor a first-person-adventure account of this important topic.  This is a VERY serious topic deserving of far better treatment than this book has given it.  OK, its better than the other book on this topic ''The Occult Roots of Nazism'' (Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke) but not much.  Save yourself the dough.  The fact that there is a dearth of good books on this topic does not mean you should squander your hard-earned money this way.  This is on the same level as most other books on Nazi Flying Saucers.  Strictly supermarket check-out counter level gutter hacko-journo-workmanship.  The publication equivalent of plumbing works.
