 This is a 5-star MUST READ, one of the first biographies written of Hitler, compiled out of the painful 6-yr-in-the-making interrogations of his closest and most-dear adjutant and valet, Schaub and Linge, by a two-man committee of the NKVD (KGB), specially commissioned by Stalin himself.  This is a no expense spared, no effort too dear uber-secret project created for Stalin's personal consumption, quite literally written with the blood and tears of Hitler's luckless SS-servants, who endured 6 yrs of almost unceasing questioning at the hands of Soviet officials whilst housed in a bug-filled nightmarish NKVD prison-cell.  Stalin was most obsessed with his worthy nemesis, and this was what his uderlings reported to him about this very subject.  This is the Hitler Dossier compiled FOR STALIN'S EYES ONLY!! How can you afford to miss it?  Even if this book were to be priced at USD500.00 I'd buy it without blinking.  Its priceless!  For all the faults, distortions, flaws, omssions, curious slants, this WAS written on Stalin's commission!!  Gawd it was good.  You can't afford to miss this!  I'd give it 500 stars but they only allow up to 5.
