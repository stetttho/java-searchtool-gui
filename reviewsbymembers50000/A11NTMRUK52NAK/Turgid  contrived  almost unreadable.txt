 Lost opportunities, that's what I say about this work by Greg, who used to  be my favourite author.  I used to buy his works on strength that HE wrote  it - but I was disappointed this time. Greg has come down a long way since  his own nadir of accomplishment in Eon/Eternity days.  A sad waste of money  and time.  The premise is OK, but the story poorly developed, the  characterization cardboard and unbelieveable, the plotting almost  non-existent.
