 This is a brilliantly produced, visually stunning animation production which is at the same time an unapologetic eco-fascist tree-hugging paen to the evils of technology and the supposed  purity and/or nobility of "Nature".  The fact that so much technical virtuosity has gone into something like this reflects how completely we've, in our guilt about the supposed despoiling of nature, caved into the ideological agenda of the PC-police, eco-nazi division.  Disgusting message, a ranting diatribe against progress and a hymn to a neo-fascism of anti-technological neo-paganistic recidivism.  This stunning and no doubt important work is to eco-fascism what The Triumph of the Will is to Nazism.
