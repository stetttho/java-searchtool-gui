 Jesus Christ as a character/protagonist in a novel???  Not every author would attempt such an audacious feat!  If botched, the result is messy and embarrassing, yet Patrick Tilley carries this off with the brilliance and  panache we have come to expect of this story-tell'in Grand Maestro.  This  is one tale which deals with a truly cosmic contest of good and evil, and  how a jewish New York lawyer is caught right in the middle.  A gripping  tale of adventures across vast, eldritch spans of time and space, delivered  with a peerless management of dramatic tension and the masterful grasp of  DETAILS Patrick has come to be famous for.  Will drive you to re-read the  Bible!!
