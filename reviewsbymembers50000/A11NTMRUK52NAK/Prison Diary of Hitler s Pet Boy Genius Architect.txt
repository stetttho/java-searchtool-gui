 This is the prison diary of Hitler's pet boy-genius architect Albert Speer - the one person whom Der Fuehrer looked up to and regarded as the closest friend he ever had. A supremely talented controversial figure (the world is still undecided whether he was a sole Good Nazi or whether he survived because he was a consumate actor who managed to swindle the International Tribunal in Nuremberg!) who served an even more controversial figure (Hitler), secretly wrote these diaries when he was serving out his 20 yrs jail term. Many curious and personal observations about the life of Third Reich's Best in prison routine, including Fuehrer No. Two, Adm Doenitz, Deputy Fuehrer Rudolf Hess, Reichbank chief Funk, Hitler Youth Supreme Leader Baldur von Schirach etc. Many many unique 'first person view' accounts of life at the pinnacle of the infamous Third Reich, as Hitler's favourite courtier. An invaluable historical document and a Must Read for the serious historian. At a personal level, this counts as one of history's foremost prison diary. Speer shines with his deeply insightful observation and analysis of the characters imprisoned in Spandau with him, and touches the reader with his effort at maintaining his dignity and sanity confronted with the dehumanising reality of a 20-year imprisonment. Speer was in turn analytical, psychological, poetical and soulful.  One finishes reading this book greatly puzzled how such a magnificently talented man with such a beautiful soul could have collaborated with Hitler.  This adds to the paradoxical mystery of Hitler as - in turn - maniacal dictator and art patron.  You draw your own conclusions whether Albert outsmarted everyone of the Nuremberg judges (save the Soviet one). I myself found it superbly entertaining, highly illuminating and deeply moving from one who not only was THERE, but there at the very TOP.  A unique historical First person account.
