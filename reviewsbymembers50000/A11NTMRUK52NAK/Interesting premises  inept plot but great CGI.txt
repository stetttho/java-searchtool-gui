 Harris' work is deeply intriguing in the way a body totally infested with carcinoma FASCInates (no pun, this!) and fixates the human attention. What if Uncle Adolf won WWII? Harris obviously did his research, and offers the transfixed reader a rare vision of the Hitlerian society had Nazi Germany existed till 1964. But b-a-a-a-a-d plotting flawed this novel-based HBO TV-movie. No character acted with conviction in the story. Much better if Harris had expanded this rather thin novel into a Dune-size novel with proper character-development. Harris could not explain plausibly the motives of Nebe, the Head of the nazi police, in aiding Sturmbannfuhrer Marsh, the leading SS black-clad flatfoot in this futuro-nazi-whodunnit. Perhaps he could have stirred in a plot by top nazis to exploit the scandal of the Holocaust to stage a supremely cynical putsch against Hitler and install a more "acceptable" liberal/progressive band of leaders acceptable to the civilized world. Lotsa lost opportunity here. Pity. Read it once to discover the promise that was not. The only visually interesting bit was the CGI recreation of what Berlin might have looked like if Albert Speer's (Hitler's pet architect) freudian designs had managed to get built.  Wait for the inevitable DVD to come out.  All in all, one of the better (and all too rare) Alternate Future works that made it to moviedom (albeit TV moviedom).  Might have benefited from a bigger budget and boxoffice release.
