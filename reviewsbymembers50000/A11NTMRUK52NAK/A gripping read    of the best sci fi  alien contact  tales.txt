 Just re-read the book yesterday, makes surprisingly good read even after 20 yrs and the unexpected collapse of USSR!  One of the best 'alien contact' sci-fi tales ever written, IMHO.  Surprised X-Files never used his  ideas!  Ranks right way up there with 'Rendevous with Rama', 'Solaris' and  'Stranger in Strange Land'.  Patrick delivers the goodies:- his grasp of  details and dramatic-tension is masterful.  Anyone who knows Patrick  Tilley's email address pls contact me at cthulhufatagn@hotmail.com!   Patrick is one of the very best, and this book a sadly 'lost' classic of  hard sci-fi:-  they don't come harder than this.
