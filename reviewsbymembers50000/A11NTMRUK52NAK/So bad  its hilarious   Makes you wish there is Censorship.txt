 I actually enjoyed this book immensely!  It's so bad, it's hilarious!  I laughed and laughed until my sides ached.  You could put together a book like this with ring binding, B&W photocopied photos, some MS-Paint-edited pictures, some public-domain photos of the 3rd Reich, and VOILA!  However, the author did - in his extremely clumsy and inept fashion - painted a gruesome picture of a world under Nazi dominion:-  the vast network of death factories, race after race exterminated like so much varmin and consigned to the crematorium, a world-spanning network of vast autobahns, the Germans emerging as virtually the sole remaining race on earth, even glimpses of medicine and TV under a true Thousand Year World-Spanning Reich.  His ideas deserved a better author (not to mention better computer graphics).  Very good starting point for anor TNT made-for-TV mini-series, titled, perhaps, the Thousand Year Nightmare. Fun, very messy, clumsy, low-grade fun.  Not worth the ...., though.
