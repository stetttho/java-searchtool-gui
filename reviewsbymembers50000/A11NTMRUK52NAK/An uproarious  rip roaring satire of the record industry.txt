 An uproarious, rip-roaring satire of the record industry, a veritable gem!  This movie is to the recording industry what 'Life of Brian' is to the Bible, 'The Producer' is to Nazi Germany, 'Spitting Image' is to parliamentary politics in London, 'Dark Star' is to '2001 A Space Odyssey', 'Galaxy Quest' to Star Trek .... you get the message!  A ruthless, absolutely tongue-in-absolute-cheek savagely funny dig of the musical industry set to great (satirical) music, with everyone acting in it hamming it up violently and with great relish.  Borrowing from the Faustian myth but remade in the mode of Phantom of the Opera, this is a deeply dark rollicking fun fun FUN!!!!  And how mod mod MOD it is!  Oooh it just oooozes style and raw panache.  Gawd this is GOOOOD!  I'd pay twenty bucks just to see 'Beef' perform as the Frankenstein monster in this movie. GERRIT NOW NOW NOW!!!!  I would give it seven stars but this webpage only let me go up to 5.... Priceless!
