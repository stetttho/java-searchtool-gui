 This is the best by Mick yet, and I thought he is very good already!  He treats the subject of vampirism with unusual and unexpectedly deep sympathy, and delivers the whole package in a thrill-packed page-a-turn'in unputdownable roller-coaster thrill-ride.  Vampirism is one of the oldest and stalest subjectmatter, almost a cliche.  For Mick to bring it to life and instil in it a modern relevancy & immediacy is no mean feat - and he does it in barrels!  Go for Mick as a brandname - he will never disappoint you!  WE WANT MORE MICK! WE WANT MORE MICK! WE WANT MORE MICK! Visit Mick's webpage http://www.thanatosoft.freeserve.co.uk/
