 Lost opportunities, that's what I say about this work by Greg, who used to  be my favourite author.  I used to buy his works on strength that HE wrote  it - but I was disappointed this time. Greg has come down a long way since  his own nadir of accomplishment in Eon/Eternity days.  Here he wants to do  a Arthur C Clarke style 'END OF MANKIND as we know it' gambit a la The End  of Childhood meets Andromeda Strain, but fails from mishandling of dramatic  tension and plot development.  His premises are technically brilliant -  human evolution encoded into our genes and suddenly progressing  explosively.  But the reader will be let down by the last 50 pages.  The  climatic scene is simply not there.  No buzz, no high, no intellectual  orgasm.  Just a bewilderment that "Hey is this IT?"
