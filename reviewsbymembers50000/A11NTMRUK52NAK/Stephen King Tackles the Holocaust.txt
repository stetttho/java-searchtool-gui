 This is the story in which Stephen King Tackles the Holocaust, a dangerous and difficult topic at best of times, an explosive one if it is not handled well.  But the King of Horror pulls it off with great skill, sensitivity and panache.  A uniquely insightful psychology thriller about an aged SS officer living under an assumed identity in idyllic American suburbia, whose true identity was discovered by a teenager and who was subsequently 'blackmailed' into telling the youth his true-life experience as a death camp commandant in Poland. Stephen King handled this potentially difficult subject with his usual consumate skill at managing the dramatic, and the director skilfully translated this on-screen with a relentlessly masterful control of the build-up of plot tension.  This is the best, and like the very best of DARK chocolate it is also very dark and bitter. One of the better on-screen treatment of the Master of Horror, Stephen King.  A remarkably keen-eye and un-preachy treatment of the issue of ex-Nazis and their subsequent lives living incognito amidst their arch-enemy, America.  If one is interested in this topic one should also watch MOTHER NIGHT (1996, starring Nick Nolte) for a dramatic adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's 1961 novel of the same title.
