 If you are keen on exploring the tyrannical potential of high technology, you can't do worst than to start here.  This is '1984' updated into the info-tech age, makes Winston Smith's life in Airstrip One seem like a  totally relaxed seaside holiday in Blackpool!  The definitive word in  hi-tech dystopia novel, it ranks way up there with 'Brave New World', 'THX  1138', 'The Glass Tower', etc.  It is also 1 of the all-time best  post-Apocalyptic sci-fi thrillers ever written, IMHO. Cross Adolf Hitler  with Bill Gates and Dale Carnegie, stir in Ph.D's for social-psychology and  electronic engineering , and you get the 'First Family' of the book's  title.  A must-read!!! Anyone who knows Patrick's email address pls pls pls  contact me - I've been wanting to compliment him personally for a  long-while now!
