 This book suffers from dated (read wrong/inadequate) science, lousy plot-management, lack of proper tension-management.  The Master author of the famous Dune series tries his hand at Greg Bear / Michael Crichton's genre (the scientific thriller) and fails miserably.  For a work which aspires to world-spanning edge of seat teeth-gnashing plague-thriller this one comes no where near even Twelve Monkeys.  Avoid it like the plague (pardon der pun).  Ohhh, come to think about it, the protagonist could be a closet homosexual woman-hater (the genetically engineered kills off all women).  Is Frank Herbert making an unintentional public confession about his misogyny and latent homosexuality?  Tee hee hee....
