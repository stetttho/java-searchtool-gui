 Leni is a genius, no doubt at all about that.  The way she captured the endless ranks of uniformed marching Nazi party faithfuls is little short of, well, fascinating (pardon der pun!).  She pioneered many cinematic techniques in this film about the Nazi Party Day in Nuremberg, and the movie is brilliant from a technical point of view.  The fact that it was about the Nazis was purely an incident of history - she could have easily made the movie as a commission by the Republican Convention in the US had she been in the States at that time!  It is a case of towering talent harnessed by a political force which then turned out very very badly and then failed. Watch this movie, no doubt about it, you will feel viscerally the elemental force of Leni's genius on screen.  This documentary's near-myth-like greatness is only matched by the notoriety of the cause it mistakenly championed (but that's only with the benefit of 20/20 eyesight retrospect - at the time this film was made, could anyone say for sure Hitler was going to turn out so monstrously disasterous for the German people and the world at large?  Can anyone honestly?)  The most eerie and poignant part of the film was when it introduced the Nazi party luminati on stage one by one with sub-titled names:-  to reflect on their eventual fate with the knowledge which we now do of course, and to see a filmatic record of them at the zenith of their highly charismatic careers and the height of the seductive powers of Nazism, truly brings home the Taoist truism that everything is ultimately futile, not to mention the the proverb that the road to hell is paved with the best of intentions. A must watch!  A unique historical record, which captured the sound and fury, fervour & fanaticism of mankind's more innocent days.
