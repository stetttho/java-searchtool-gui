 Old Beeb never disappoints, and this is no exception.  BBC brings its world-famous house-style of fairness, objectivity and depth to analyse and comment on Britain's most dire nemesis in the twentieth century - Hitler and his Nazis, and you can expect a top-rate job.  I must have watched the entire documentary series  4 times, and each time I gain fresh and deeper insight.  BBC gave a fasinating and horrific subject an excellent treatment, shorn of emotive propaganda. Explores even-handedly the difficulties Germany was in during the 20's, and explores the psychological attractions of the Nazi party to a down-trodden but proud German people.  The chilling pronogsis which came across is that had Hitler been more sensible in his relations with the USSR and marketed Nazism to the world not as a racial-based ideology but as an international ideology, the Nazis might still be around TODAY. Then, the world will truly see a sort of tyranny as it has never before seen, made infinitely  more terrifying by the twisted lights of science & technology.  A must see.  Every public library and school library must buy this.  Fifty years after they have been bombed into the ground, Nazism remains still an attractive ideology for a lot of people, and has returned to its roots as a protest against the status quo.  This documentary answers why that can be so.  My only grouse is that there is no segment presenting the many interviews BBC and other companies has done of Albert Speer - Hitler's Minister of Munitions.  Now that would have made this series even more cool.
