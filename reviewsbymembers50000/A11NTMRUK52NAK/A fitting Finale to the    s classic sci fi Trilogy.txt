 The Quest of the DNA Cowboys, a trilogy by Mick published inthe fabulous 70's, has been heralded as the 'lost' classic ofadventure/pulp sci-fi novels.  A long, entertaining tale of the picaresque misadventures of the 'DNA cowboys' (is the Minstrel not Mick's semi-biographical persona?), the original trilogy, of which this book is the purported finale, is a literary LSD head-trip thru Mick's unique, hallucinatory fantasy-scape of kung-fu movies, sphaghetti westerns, high-tech magnificence and dazed drugged decadence.  In short, a deliciously addictive mixture of 70's Americana pop culture. The original trilogy is now very very rare and fanatically sought after by fans.  This new book is a delightful surprise when it first came out, for no one had expected Mick to retread the DNA Cowboy gambit.  A few continuity problems asides (poor Mick did not seem to have re-read his earlier work before writing this 'sequel'!), this latest installment is no less entertaining than the earlier ones, and has clearly benefitted from Mick's experience as a writer since.  A rewarding and highly amusing read, a must-BUY! Visit Mick's webpage http://www.thanatosoft.freeserve.co.uk/
