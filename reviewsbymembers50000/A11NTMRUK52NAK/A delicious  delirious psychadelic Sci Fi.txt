 This is the original trilogy by Mick published in the fabulous 70's of which "The Last Stand of the DNA Cowboys" is the fourth and most modern addition (pub. 1989), This trilogy has been heralded as the 'lost' classic of adventure/pulp sci-fi novels. A long, rambling entertaining tale of the picaresque misadventures of the 'DNA cowboys' (is the Minstrel not Mick's semi-biographical persona?), this is a literary LSD head-trip thru Mick's unique, hallucinatory fantasy-scape of kung-fu movies, sphaghetti westerns, high-tech magnificence and dazed drugged decadence. In short, a deliciously addictive mixture of 70's Americana pop culture. The original trilogy in paperback is now very very rare and fanatically sought after by Farren fans as a collectible. A rewarding and highly amusing read, and for those Farren fans who never saw the original paperbacks, a must-BUY! Mick's the King, man, and you better BELIEVE IT!! Or find out for yourself and buy this book.  MICK!! MICK!! MICK!! You der man, maaaan!!  B-)  Visit his webpage http://www.thanatosoft.freeserve.co.uk/
