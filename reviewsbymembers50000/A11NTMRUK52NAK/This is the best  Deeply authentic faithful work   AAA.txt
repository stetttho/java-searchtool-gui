 This is the very best yet of the many Lovecraft adaptations I have watched.  A very faithful, very high production value, very attentivelyh-produced adaption of 'The Case of Charles Dexter Ward'.  The details, the pathos, the neurotic suspicions, the build-up of tension, of horrors hinting upon ever greater horrors, the 'mistake' cases in the mad alchemist's bio-magical temperings, the underground lab (looks like a Victorian original version of the archetypical  Dr Evil volcanic lab!) the possession of one by a more powerful ancestor, IT'S ALL HERE! This is not so much a movie as a labour of love by a director and a producer who are clearly Lovecraft fans.  Ohhh the horror!  The Horror!  THE HORROR!!  Gawd, ... This is GOOOOODDD!!!  I'd give it 5-zillion stars but this website only allow me up to five. Finally, it is released  on DVD!!!!  I NEED MORE BLOOD!!!!
