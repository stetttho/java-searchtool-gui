 An intelligent blackhole having consumed tens of thousands of other civilizations now approaches Earth and Its Now Our Turn! One of the best end of the world premise by a suitablably weird monster. Greg Benford has truly excelled himself.  This book deserves to be expanded into five times its size.  The Eater's cool intellectual discourse with earth scientists are delicious to read, but THERE IS TOO LITTLE OF IT!! The writer missed a golden opportunity to wax lyrical about the alien wonders and horrors the Eater has seen (or consumed as dinner), or regaled the reader with even more of its ascerbic cosmic comments on human's insignificant place in the cosmos.  Not since I read Contact (Carl Sagan), Eternity (Greg Bear) and Childhood's End (Arthur C Clarke) have I achieved as powerful an intellectual frisson and viscereal thrill from a sci-fi book. BUY IT NOW!!! There is now a worthy successor to Greg Bear and Arthur C Clarke! And its Greg Benford!  Boy how I hope he writes longer works ....
