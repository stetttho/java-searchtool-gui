 Akira meets Metropolis meets James Bond, opulently filmed with lotsa of very fine art deco Hugh Ferris / Schuiten-Peeters inspired urban skyscraper landscape rendering. A visual treat, very impressive homage to the original Metropolis by Fritz Lang, but otherwise incoherently and implausibly plotted story-line. Does not deserve to bear the honoured name 'Metropolis', & any comparison with the elemental force and originality of the 1927 Fritz Lang version is disappointing. Ends with an Akira-esque apocalyptic "intended-climax" (I use the term 'climax' advisedly, for it is anything but) in which everything blows up. Lotsa of inexplicable and incomprehensible undertones and relationships between the main protagonists. The closing sequence (when everything blows up set to a strange Japanified jazz song) is a failed homage to "Dr Strangelove - Or How I Stopped Worrying and Learnt to Love the Bomb".  However, though the director here tried to replicate the acute sense of irony achieved by Stanley Kubrick in Dr Strangelove by using incongruous music set to scene of mass destruction, he failed miserably and the ending - intended to be grand, sad and ironic at the same time, was instead unbearably funny to Western sensibilities.  No doubt the oriental audience in Tokyo found it incredibly (and incomprehensibly?) stylish (perhaps precisely because it was incomprehensible?).   Nevertheless, a must-watch meriting precisely ONE watch. Buy it, watch it, then pass it to a friend.
