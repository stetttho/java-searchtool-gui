 It has been said that this book is the Cyberpunk precursor, the great granddaddy that started off this school of sci-fi writing. It is certainly a good, crisp read, highly-entertaining to boot and chok-a-blok with high-tech gizmos (the gadget-freak would be delighted!). Story is told from the perspective of a paranoic but highly-skilled corporate assasin which the author somehow endears the reader to, notwithstanding the repugnant nature of the character's vocation. Mick's vision of future corporatist America dystopia has the eerie feel of plausible authenticity, and his grasp of action and dramatic-tension is unfailing. Every chapter reveals a new grand vista of adventure and action. Not his best, but certainly one of his better, works. Perfect for that long train or greyhound trip.
