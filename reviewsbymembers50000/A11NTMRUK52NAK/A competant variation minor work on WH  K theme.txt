 I'd actually have liked to give it 3.5 stars, as this is better than 3 stars yet not quite four stars. IMHO this is the next best novel in the WH40K universe, second only to Ian Watson's excellent standard-setting INQUISITOR and SPACE MARINE.  In case anyone is not familiar to the WH40K universe theme, the future of mankind in the forty-first millenium is a galactic human empire beset on all fronts by demon infestation (''Chaos''). The Emperor is some sort of psychic god on earth - half-dead, conscious only by din of sheer force of willpower sustained by technology - presiding over a huge Theocratic empire spanning lightyears, the ecclesiastical structure employing deadly force and ruthless subterfuge to protect human race against being overwhelmed by demonic contamination. Imagine the Spanish Inquisition ruling a galactic empire. The imaginative vista is panoramic, sweeping and jaw-dropping. The opportunities for good yarn-spinning is enormous:- this is a cross between the Spanish Inquisition and Isaac Asimov's galactic empire, only this time the Inquisitors are the good guys trying to keep humanity, well, human. The opportunities for good yarn-spinning is enormous, and Ian Watson and Barrington J Bayley carries off the story-telling challenge with great polish and panache.  I generally enjoy WH40K stories immensely, and Ian Watson and Barrington J Bayley are IMHO two of the best WH40K authors to see the light thus far.  Go for it!  You'll be hugely entertained.
