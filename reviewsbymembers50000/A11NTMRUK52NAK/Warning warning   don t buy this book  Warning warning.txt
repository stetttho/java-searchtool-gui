 Warning warning - don't buy this book. Warning warning. Donate your money to a worthy charity. On no account buy this book. Ostensibly written by Ian Watson who did such a astonishingly marvellous job with ''INQUISITOR'' (the 1st in this trilogy), ''Chaos Child'' (the 3rd book in this trilogy) does not have any meaningful plot, no action to speak of, no logical sequencing, just utter, utter inexplicable confusion.  Its as if Ian Watson commissioned a ghost-writer who is unfamiliar with the rich and baroquely complex WH40K universe, then did nothing but proof-read spelling errors and lent his name to the titlepage.  An utter utter waste of time and money for the reader.  This is the first book EVER that I have reviewed that I use the term execrable.  Its not even so bad that - sometimes - it became good.  Its just bad.  Avoid it like the plague.  Ian, what happened???  I wished to give it ZERO star but was not allowed to do so by this website. B-(
