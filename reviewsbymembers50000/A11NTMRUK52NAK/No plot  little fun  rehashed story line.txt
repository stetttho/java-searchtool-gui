 The usual Mick-style "Tour of the Universe" adventure story plus a little Cthulhu mythos cross-over. Not done well, however, No or little plausible plot, unconvincing paranoia, stop-start scripting, unconvincing characters acting out unconvincing story-line, in general poor handling of dramatic tension. No climax. Stereotypical hackwork.  A long long way down from, Phaid the Gambler, Mars The Red Planet or the DNA Cowboys.  I only tolerated this because I am a die-hard far-right fanatical fundamentalist Mick Farren Fan.  Sorry, Mick, not one of your better days, I am afraid.
