 This is the pilot episodes of the great nostalgic 70's era made-for-TV series.  Though some say this is a cheapo knock-off of Star Wars, I personally rewatched this show with great fondness and recommend everyone to buy a copy now.  And be amazed at the extremely high production value achieved on TV for that era. I mean, the money is way up front in your face (...)The sets, models, effects still stand exceedingly well up to the test of time, and this version is masterfully remastered (pardon the pun) for DVD. Goferrit and hit turbo-boost!!!!  By Your Command!!!
