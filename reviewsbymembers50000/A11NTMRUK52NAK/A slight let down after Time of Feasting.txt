 My fave is Mick Farren - he delivers the goodies, as he had done in Time of Feasting.  But this, being a sequel, suffers from the "Jaws II" effect - the sequel somehow never lives up to the original one.  Still readable, and frankly, if you have read Time of Feasting you'd probably want to buy and read this one too, and it's a MUST if you are such a die-hard fundamental right-wing raving Farren-Phreak like me.  If you are not, well, buy Time of Feasting first, to see if you wish to follow the story into a sequel.  An otherwise - sadly - indifferent read.  Sometimes it read as if Mick got a ghost writer to pad out some sequences for him. Visit Mick's webpage http://www.thanatosoft.freeserve.co.uk/
