 Harris' work is deeply intriguing in the way a body totally infested with carcinoma FASCInates (no pun, this!) and fixates the human attention. What if Uncle Adolf won WWII? Harris obviously did his research, and offers the transfixed reader a rare vision of the Hitlerian society had Nazi Germany existed till 1964. But b-a-a-a-a-d plotting flawed this novel. No character acted with conviction in the story. Much better if Harris had expanded this rather thin novel into a Dune-size novel with proper character-development. Harris could not explain plausibly the motives of Nebe, the Head of the nazi police, in aiding Sturmbannfuhrer Marsh, the leading flatfoot in this futuro-nazi whodunnit. Perhaps he could have stirred in a plot by top Nazis to exploit the scandal of the Holocaust to stage a supremely cynical putsch against Hitler and install a more "acceptable" liberal/progressive band of leaders acceptable to the civilized world (eg USA) with which alliance Germany is trying to enlist against the much-reduced USSR. Lotsa lost opportunity here. Pity. Read it once to discover the promise that was not.
