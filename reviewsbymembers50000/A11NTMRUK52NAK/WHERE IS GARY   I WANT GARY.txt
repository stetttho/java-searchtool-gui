 WHERE IS GARY?  I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!!  Gary the Snail is the best character in the cartoon.  He meows, grooooowls, meows-&-growls at the same time, and can say ''No''.  He plays the violin, wears a two-tone pair of Italian brogues, and reads the paper.  He is a towering intellect and is granted ZEROOO role in this so-called movie!  This omission has angered Gary fanatics all over the world!  Any SBSP movie without Gary is sacrilege!  WHERE IS GARY?  I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!!  WHERE IS GARY?  I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!!  WHERE IS GARY?  I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!!
