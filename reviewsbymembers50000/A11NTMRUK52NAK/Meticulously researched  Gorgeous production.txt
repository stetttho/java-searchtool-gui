 This is a meticulously researched, gorgeously produced work of love.  Anyone having an interest in German National Socialist political paraphanalia, memorabilia and militaria MUST simply buy this book.  The world of collectors and aficionados is indeed blessed to have in this world such a person as dedicated and resourceful as Ulrich of England. You simply cannot visualize how wonderful this book is:  every single page is choked full of rare illustrations and the result of painstaking scholarship and personal travel/research.  Its amazing, jaw-droppingly amazing.  I would give this book 50,000 stars but the web site only allow me up to 5.  After reading this book you'd rush out and try to make a replica Feldzeichen yourself, its that intoxicating.
