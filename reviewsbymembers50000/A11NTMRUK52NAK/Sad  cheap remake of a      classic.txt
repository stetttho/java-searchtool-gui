 This is one doomed, sad production:-  wooden acting, uninspired handling of dramatic tension, cheap effects.  I am puzzled they bothered.  This is like a grade school remake of the 1986 'B' classic Maximum Overdrive, but with a million dollars LESS in terms of budget. The trucks had more expression than the actors. After awhile you were looking forward to see it end so you can start to do something else in your life. Give it a miss. Big time sucks.
