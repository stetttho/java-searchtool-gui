 Lousy, really dissappointing.  There is lot of promise in a story which pits man against all-conquering machines, but this team did not develop the potentialities in such a theme.  Very bad science, very inadequate imagination of the full developmental potential of a machine-based culture and its powers/potentials.  Reads like a word-processor wrote this novel.  A machine could do better.  Clearly a franchise product, a cookie-cutter product mass-manufactured for an established market (i.e. anything with the trademark DUNE in its title).
