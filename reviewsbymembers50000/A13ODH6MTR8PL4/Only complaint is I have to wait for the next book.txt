 I agree with the other reviewers who say that Parker gets better and better with every book.  He writes great crime novels but, like P.D. James, never lets us forget the churning mix of loss,  grief and vengeance that the survivors and the crimefighters are left with.  This is the third Merci Rayborn novel and her character is uniquely complicated - both insensitive and touchy at the same time.  It's a delight to see her develop as a tender mother even while she concentrates on solving grisly crimes.  In Black Water, a deputy and his wife are the victims - she's dead, he barely survives.  Did he do it?  Or is there more to the picture?  You know with Merci on the case, it's not going to be easy.  Especially with the reverberations of her actions from the previous novel in the series, Red Light, splitting department loyalties.  Merci, her partner Zamora, Mike McNally and all of the familiar characters are back (along with the omnipresent memory of Hess).   If you've read the other books in the series, don't miss this one.  If you haven't, read The Blue Hour, then Red Light, then get this one.  Afterwards you'll be like me, wondering if you should write Mr. Parker to congratulate him on another great story or just urge him to write faster, darn it!  A very satisfying series.
