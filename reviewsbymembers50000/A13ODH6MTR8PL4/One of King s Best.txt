 I've come to love Laurie King's literate, thoughtful and humanistic takes on mystery and suspense.  KEEPING WATCH didn't let me down one bit.  Fully realized characters, a suspenseful plot and remarkable writing all add up to a one great book. It's a wonderful read with a great payoff for the patient  reader.  I'm a believer - King can't write a bad book.
