 When Michigan joined in on the Great Blackout of 2003 we pulled out our camping equipment.  Luckily an earlier version of this lantern was in the gear.  It lights up an entire room on only 8 D Batteries.  This is an essential emergency item in anyone's household and great for camping or anywhere you'd like light without electricity.
