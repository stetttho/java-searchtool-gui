 From the mood-setting opening chapter with Cork O'Connor searching the frozen landscape of Aurora, Minnesota for a missing teenager you know you're in for another great read from William Kent Krueger.  In this, the 4th in a solid mystery series, Cork works as his wife Jo's private eye while she defends the accused murderer of the missing teenager.  Small town secrets, the demands of religious faith and miraculous happenings are themes throughout the story.  It's a well-plotted mystery with great characters, and I can't wait for the next installment.
