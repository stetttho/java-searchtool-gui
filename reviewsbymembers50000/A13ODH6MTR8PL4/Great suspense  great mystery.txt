 Harlan Coben writes suspense stories about nice guys who are at heart, honorable romantics.  Who wouldn't love his protagonists?  Then, these characters that you've come to love  get caught up in horrible circumstances and have to solve intricate mysteries to save themselves &/or the women they love.   In Gone For Good, the suspense and mystery never lets up.  Neither does the humor or romance.  Highly recommended for readers who seek a well-written, entertaining read with plenty of memorable characters.
