 If you were fogging a mirror and alert at any time during the Bill Clinton presidency, you already know everything in this book that's worth knowing.  If confirming that Hillary likes decaf and didn't shave her legs in college is worth plowing through over 300 pages of rehashed 1990's-era trivia, this is the book for you.  Be forewarned though - it's not even well-written.  There's a certain type of person who will buy anything derogatory about one side or the other of the political spectrum.  They have more time and money than brains  apparently, and there's no hope for them.  For those of us who have some literary and factual standards regardless of our political leanings, this book doesn't make the cut.  There are much better books for red staters ("Hell to Pay" and "Rewriting History") and blue staters ("Living History") to read about the former first lady and current Senator than this clip job.
