 Choppy, uneven writing.  A bunch of unlikeable characters.  A weird plot with multiple loose ends.  Don't bother with this book unless you like all of the above.  I'm usually a fan of Baldacci, but this book reads like some first-time author's old effort that he picked up and tacked on an ending to before he sent it off to his publisher.
