 I was astonished to pick this up off my nephew's desk and, a few hours later, realize that I'd just read the best history textbook of Post-war 20th century America ever written.  No wonder my nephew's favorite class is history.  The author writes accurately and always takes care to allow the readers to view history from the proper perspective.  That is, she includes quotes and excerpts that allow readers in 2002 to understand some of the seemingly inexplicable times and situations that this great country of ours has confronted.   The best example (and mind you, it is only one example) of this I can point to is how the author covered the war in Vietnam.   The Vietnam War means so many things to so many people now as well as when it was actually happening.  I think the author has done a great job of putting the whole conflict into perspective, and explaining to students of history how it is that the American people could ever come to a point where they would not support their own fighting forces in such large numbers.  How could Walter Cronkite, the most respected man in America at the time, come out and say the war is wrong? Why would Vietnam vets, still in uniform, march in Washington, D.C. against the war?  Why is the word "Vietnam" so loaded with meaning today for so many Americans?  The answers are here, in terms that any high school student can understand and appreciate.  This book should be required reading for Americans of all ages, Vietnam vets and their families included.
