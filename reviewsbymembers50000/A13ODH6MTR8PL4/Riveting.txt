 After staying up through the night to finish this riveting page-turner, I wanted to call everyone I know to tell them about it.  Luckily I came to my senses and wrote this review instead.  The plot has already been summarized in previous reviews.  The book starts innocently enough (for a murder mystery) with three sets of distinct characters.  Soon however, the separate threads of the plot become entertwined and, like a classic Hitchcock film,  the tension ratchets up as the threads twist tighter and tighter to the climax.  Added to all this tension is a full set of compelling and memorable charcters.  A great start to a well-written series.  I'm looking forward to reading the next installment, LIVE BAIT.
