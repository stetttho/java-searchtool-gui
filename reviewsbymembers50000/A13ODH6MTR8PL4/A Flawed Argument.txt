 Once over lunch with a Polish-American friend of mine, we discussed affirmative action.  I support it; she doesn't.  "Carolyn," she said, "you're so smart.  Aren't you resentful that people will think that you got so far in school, employment, and life in general because of the color of your skin?" "Kim," I answered, "what makes you think that black people don't think that everytime we see unqualified white people who've "made it"?  Do you really think George W. Bush would have been admitted to Yale if he'd been black?"  That gave her some food for thought so I was able to finish my share of the sushi before we moved on to dissect "Memento".  I loved it; she hated it. The point is, the argument that affirmative action is somehow unfair to blacks because it lumps the "unqualified" in with the "qualified" is bull.  Life lumps the "unqualified" in with the "qualified" all the time.  Which is why both a D student cheerleader like George W. Bush and and an A+ student bi-lingual Academy Award winner like Jodie Foster hold degrees from Yale. Why is it that all of the black intellectuals who come out against affirmative action owe their educations and careers to its existence?  It's amazing how these men and women want to turn around and lock the doors that openly admitted them so that no more minorities can pass through. Stephen L. Carter's argument is flawed.  But I'm sure it helped sell his book, so more power to ya, brotha!  Count your cash and forget the cost to minorities in America.
