 I picked this one up expecting something totally different and got a lot more than I bargained for.  Let's see - an action-packed plot, a sexy, flawed alpha-male hero and a heroine who finds reserves of strength she didn't know she had.  This is a great read and as noted by the other reviewers, the action is exciting in bed and out.  Come to think of it, not all of the sex was in bed but you know what I mean.  I recommend this one to anyone who likes their romantic suspense well-written and uncensored - the language and action in this book is for adults only.
