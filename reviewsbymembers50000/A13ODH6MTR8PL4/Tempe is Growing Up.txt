 In this latest installment of the Tempe Brennan series, Kathy Reichs begins a new transition for Tempe that will probably  continue into the next installment.  In this one, Tempe goes to Guatemala to donate her services as a forensic scientist when the country tries to recover from the acts of a brutal regime.  There are enough gruesome scenes to get the idea of the work that Tempe does, but no overkill (pun alert!).  Kathy Reichs does not want to be the Tom Clancy of forensics medicine, so there is no textbook-level detail on foresic science droning on and on, thank goodness.  There was a large cast of characters that was hard to keep track of sometimes, but by the end of the book when the mystery is solved, you'll know the characters you need to know.  Are the others just red herrings?  Yes and no.  There is a bit of a "Scooby Doo" ending where there is an explanation of all the details of the crime, but it is authentic.  There's no reason to suspect that a forensic scientist would have every single detail of the solution to a murder without some explanation from the police or criminals. The real strength of this book is observing Tempe's dogged determination to move on in her life and find happiness, and Reichs' continuing development as a writer.  The series is told in the first person and Tempe's usual sardonic humor is very much in evidence here, as is her fascination with Andrew Ryan, her co-worker and almost-love-interest. If you're new to this series, you could start with this book and not feel like you got invited to a party where you're the odd one out or start at the beginning with Deja Dead.
