 In this, the third book of the Clare Fergusson / Russ Van Alstyne mystery series, Clare and Russ are treading the fine line of friendship and sexual attraction when they become involved in two missing persons cases, spaced over 70 years apart.  Skillfully written and action-packed, the story is ultimately about the price of self-delusion in the face of temptation.  The kind of self-delusion that can make a person believe that they can commit a crime without hurting anyone.  The kind of self-delusion that takes no prisoners.  The kind of self-delusion, whose latest victims are Clare and Russ themselves.  The end will break your heart three times over.  I just love this series. If you're new to the series, you'll want to read the first two installments so that you can follow the evolution of Clare and Russ' relationship.  The titles are taken from religious hymns: IN THE BLEAK MIDWINTER and A FOUNTAIN FILLED WITH BLOOD.
