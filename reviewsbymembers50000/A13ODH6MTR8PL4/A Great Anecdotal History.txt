 As someone who was born after Ms. Hope entered law school at Harvard, this personal history of the struggles against the overt and covert discrimination women faced in the '60's is an eye opener.  I can't imagine dealing with the unabashed sexism that Ms. Hope and her contemporaries encountered, yet here it is, detailed in anecdote after anecdote. The book is a series of personal histories that enlighten all of us about the struggles women and men alike went through to get to the precarious balance of sexual politics that we live in today.  In the telling, Ms. Hope illuminates the conflicts that women experience to this day while trying to balance work and family.  One of the most painful passages of the book reveals Ms. Hope's own children's ambivalence about her accomplishments as a lawyer, mother and woman. This book is not just an opportunity for 60-something lawyers to reminisce about their salad days.  It's important for my contemporaries of both genders to understand the stories of the 1960's were much more than "flower power" hippies protesting Vietnam or sitting around taking drugs and listening to the Beatles.  We can do no worse than starting with this book that tells the stories of a small group of women's experiences at Harvard Law School in the early '60's and their struggles to balance careers and family in the turbulent years that followed.  Also, if you can read this book and not regret the lost potential of Pat Schroeder's aborted presidential campaign, you're a stronger person than I.
