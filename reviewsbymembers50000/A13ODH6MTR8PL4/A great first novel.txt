 This is one of the novels that I recommend to people who say they haven't read a book in years.  It's a great story, about events that not many people in the U.S. are even aware occurred.  It does just what a good novel should do:  it introduces you to a new and different world, but points out the universal behaviors which we can all identify with.  I saw the author reading from her novel in Philadelphia years ago and some jerk in the audience asked why any American should read this book since it doesn't have anything to do with their lives.  The author was a bit flummoxed by the apparent hostility of the questioner and the rest of the audience was discomfited to say the least.  Finally, Ms. Bridal just said, "well, some people like to read about things they haven't experienced....and just because you in America haven't experienced the events I write about doesn't mean that you never will..."  I loved it.
