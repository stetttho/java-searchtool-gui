 I found it hard to believe that this was King's first mystery novel.  He has created a couple of great characters in Max Freeman and his friend, Billy.  Then he tops it off with a neatly plotted mystery, written with great assurance.   Max is a former Philadelphia cop who, after shooting a juvenile criminal, retires to the Flordia Everglades where he lives the life of a semi-hermit.  Trouble soon finds him however, and he's forced to track down a killer when he becomes implicated in the kidnapping and serial murder of young local children.  It's a tough crime to read about that's for sure, but it's handled deftly by the author.  The characters and the action ring true, and the Everglades is a unique setting that lends a lot to the story.  I can't wait for the next installment.
