 This is the first book by Tim Winton that I've read and, based on his beautiful writing alone, I'll probably seek out another book by him.  However I can't recommend that anyone read this one because despite the writing, the plot is pretty boring and the characterizations are incomplete.  This novel tells the story of a love triangle between Jim - a successful fisherman, Georgie - his live-in lover, and the town outcast named Luther Fox who makes his living as a poacher.  The character of Georgie is most complete and even she is a bit of an enigma to the reader all the way to the end.  The most complex character of the three is Jim and we know very little about his interior feelings until the last quarter of the book when he hints at all sorts of rage and need for redemption.  We never quite find out where all this is coming from, however.   As a love story, the book strikes out because Luther and Georgie spend most of the story apart from each other, making for a lot less tension than the author thinks is there.  The book starts out promising and judging by the really beautiful writing, you'll think "there's gotta be a payoff here somewhere."  By the time I got to the last quarter of the book though, I realized there is no payoff, just some great descriptive writing, unrealized characters and a plot with nowhere to go.
