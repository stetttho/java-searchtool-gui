 This book is less of a how-to manual than it is a guide to establishing and maintaining general principles of housekeeping. I don't know about you other readers, but the housekeeping techniques that were handed down to me by my mother (when I bothered to pay attention) were spotty and based more on worn out traditions than science. This book injects the science into the art of keeping house. Sure, sometimes the author can go overboard. I, for one, don't plan to be on my hands and knees each time I clean my kitchen floor. But the reasons that she recommends this technique were sound and they did make me consider cleaning the floor at eye-level more frequently. I just bought 8 copies of this book - one for each of my home-making brothers and sisters for Kwanzaa. What could be a better gift for the new millennium than the comforts of home?
