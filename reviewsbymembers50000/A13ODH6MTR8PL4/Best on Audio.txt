 PRINCE OF THIEVES is a great story, but listening to it on audio is like watching a great action movie populated with fully realized characters.  Donnie Wahlberg is pitch-perfect reading this narrative in a perfect Southie accent. I would imagine that in book form, the many interior monologues in this story may slow it down.  In audiobook form, it's like this flawed anti-hero is telling you his twisted love story over a beer in an Irish pub.  If you're already a fan of audiobooks, get this one - you'll enjoy the ride.  If you've never tried audiobooks, you can't go wrong starting here.
