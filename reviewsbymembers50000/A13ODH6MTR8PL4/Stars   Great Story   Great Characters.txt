 This was one book I've been waiting months to get hold of and I wasn't disappointed.  It stumps me why Judith Ivory isn't the most popular romance author writing today.  Her characters are by far the most developed I've  read.  Her stories are original, even when they're based on old themes  (Pygmalion, Beauty and the Beast, Sleeping Beauty, etc.).  I've been  reading her books since Black Silk and have always been impressed with her  talent.  She just keeps getting better and better. I'd deduct 1/2 a star  only because the ending was a little too convenient.  Maybe it's not fair,  but I've come to expect more from Ms. Ivory than the usual run-of-the-mill  romance happy endings.
