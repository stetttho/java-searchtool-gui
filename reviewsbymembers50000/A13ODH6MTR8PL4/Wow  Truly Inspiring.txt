 Who knew that an American Idol could have such a truly inspiring story?  Fantasia writes about her life story, warts and all.  The things she's lived through - dropping out of school early, sexual abuse, unmarried teenaged motherhood - it's all here.  But more importantly, the life lessons that she's learned are here, in frank and powerful language that can benefit every young woman in America.  It's the story of so many young women nowadays, but it also includes true inspiration.  Highly recommended!
