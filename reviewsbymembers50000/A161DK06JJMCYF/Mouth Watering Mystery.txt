 This was my first Joanne Fluke novel, but will definitely not be my last. It was entertaining and informative. There were seven recipes contained within.  Just when you think you've figured it out- more evidence leads you in a different direction.  Warning!!! Read the recipes first and have the ingredients on hand. Reading this book may cause the urge to bake!!!
