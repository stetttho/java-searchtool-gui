 I might be book deprived because I just read this on a recent vacation but it wasn't as bad a some of the reviews I read! If you are die hard fan of Jude's give it a try. I didn't like the character "cousins." However the plot actually gave me something to think about. What if you were on vacation and a dead body showed up in your bathroom? OK...I admit not her best but not that bad..
