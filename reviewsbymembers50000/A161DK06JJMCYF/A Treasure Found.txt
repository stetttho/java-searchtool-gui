 I can't believe that I bought this book and stuck in in the back of a dresser drawer one day while cleaning house. When searching for something to read and being "homesick" for the mountains at the same time, I remembered the picture on this book I'd squirreled away. What a treasure.  This book had everything I was looking for. I'd also met my favorite author in the first book I'd read written by Sharyn McCrumb. If you haven't read it, it is the best. All of her ballad series are awesome this is my favorite.
