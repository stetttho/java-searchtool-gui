 This was my first Barbara Delinsky novel. I thought it was intertaining. It explored the heartbreak of infertility that seems to be affecting many couples.  Ms. Delinsky also gave me food for thought about how appearances can be decieving, and how many of us rush to judgement before taking the time to get to know someone.
