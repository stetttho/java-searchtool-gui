 I had read almost all of Cornwell's early books.  I thought she was gifted.  Somewhere in the middle books I got bogged down with them and stopped reading her.  This is the first one of her books that I have read in a long time. It was wonderful.  By far her best. I actually long for the next one... good job, Patricia!
