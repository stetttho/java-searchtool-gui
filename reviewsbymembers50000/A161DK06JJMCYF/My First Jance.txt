 This was my first Jance novel.  I enjoyed it immensely.  I was surprised until the last page about "who done it" I learned some things about why people keep such large packs of pets. Jance's descriptions made me want to visit the desert. In conversation one evening to a person from the same area, I learned that her descriptions were indeed accurate. This won't be my last Jance novel.  Hope the others are this good.
