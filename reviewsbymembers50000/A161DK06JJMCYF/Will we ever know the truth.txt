 This is a well researched look at environmental issues. This book has a series of debates on proof or lack thereof of global warming. It was in interesting twist to think of where your money could go when you donate to some of these non profit organizations. I enjoyed reading this book and I wondered if the main character,Peter Evans was autobiographical. I recommend this book if you like to read stories that are so believable they seem true.
