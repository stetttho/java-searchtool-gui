 This book was ok.  It wasn't as good as Forever but I loved reading about Darci again.  Darci was in a funk in this book.  Maybe that's why I didn't like it as well as Forever. Why was the book written as it was written with every other chapter first person alternating Link and Darci? Link didn't appeal to me. I missed Adam as much as Darci. I am buying the last book of the triligy because I am curious.  I love Jude Deveraux's books.  She has quite an imagination and isn't afraid to use it.
