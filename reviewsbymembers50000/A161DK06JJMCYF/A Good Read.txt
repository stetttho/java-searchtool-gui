 This book held my interest. It is just as good as all of Higgins-Clark's other books.  She gave so many clues early on that I figured out less than half way through who the bad guy was. I also figured out who his accomplice was and why. I kept reading to see if I was right and sure enough- I was!  The book was a nice afternoon diversion.
