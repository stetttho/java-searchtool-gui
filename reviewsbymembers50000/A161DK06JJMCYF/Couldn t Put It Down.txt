 I had never heard of the Bell Witch before I read Melissa Sanders-Self's novel. I could not put the book down.  I loved her descriptions the time.  I think the dialogue was accurate to the period. She kept me on the edge of my seat. I started the book and finished it in one sitting. After reading the novel, I did a little research on the real story. I was that interested. Thanks Melissa Sanders-Self for an intertaining read.
