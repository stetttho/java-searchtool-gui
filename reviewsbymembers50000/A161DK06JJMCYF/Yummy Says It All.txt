 This book was even better than the last. When I write reviews I like to give away as little as possible about the plot. It kept me guessing. I am from Florida, so I am learning about the cold northern weather. I liked seeing the eight recipes too! I reccommend this to all who like to read and bake! An excellent way to spend an afternoon. Read it and see if the first person who is murdered reminds you of someone famous...
