 The history of the battle of Stalingrad is extremely complex. It was probably the turning point in World War II and as such has been subject to numerous analyses. Having seen a few of these about (including a novel  written in French in 1946), and having seen Anthony Beevor's 'Stalingrad'  on the bestsellers list in Hodges & Figgis for the previous year, only  moving from hardback to paperback, I decided that for my upcoming train  journey, I would read it.  I had made a major mistake. Travelling from  Paris to Geneva to Rome by train within 24 hours is difficult enough with  enough sleep, but Mr. Beevor forced me to stay riveted to his text,  disregarding my wonderful scheme to teach myself Italian before arriving in  Rome.  Despite the pain suffered that day, I am thouroughly satisfied  that I did the right thing on the train and that, compared to my experience  reading the book, sleep would have been a major  disappointment. Incedentally, in Rome I read a book called "The  Punic Wars" by Nigel Bagnall, which I also recommend strongly
