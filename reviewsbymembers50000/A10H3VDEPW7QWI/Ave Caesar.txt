 Matthias Gelzer covers the life of Caesar, who I must admit I believe to be the greatest of all historical figures, very well. His insights and his speculations are all well founded as one would expect of a great scholar  such as Gelzer. I read this book as part of a degree course and, although  I don't necessarily agree with everything he has to say, all of it is  interesting and worthy of, at least, discussion. I would rate this book  far higher than the book on Caesar by Christian Meier, but Meier's book has  some interesting points that Gelzer does not. Overall though, for a book on  the life of Caesar, Gelzer is the best to be found at the moment.
