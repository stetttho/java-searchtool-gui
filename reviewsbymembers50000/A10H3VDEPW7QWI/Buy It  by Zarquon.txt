 BUY IT! Two words which give you all the information you need. Don't  hesitate, buy it now. Immediately. This wonderful series is an essential  part of any book collection, and if you don't own it, you will be rewarded  beyond your wildest dreams by purchasing this.  I feel like I'm ranting  now, and the amount of "No"s I get will probably reflect that,  but those of you that buy this book will be grateful to me and the many  others here and elsewhere who urge you to try it.  My enthusiasm is  probably fuelled by the fact that earlier today, I finished the series for  the third time. I'm sure that many will think "Is that all?" and  others, "He must be mad!" You are both correct. But don't let it  dissuade you from buying this book.  Now I'm going to lie down for a bit  and recover. Treat yourself. Let Douglas Adams into your life. He'll only  make it better.
