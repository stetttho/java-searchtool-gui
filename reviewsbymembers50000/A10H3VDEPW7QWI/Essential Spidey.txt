 My recent return to Spider-man has been rewarded by a lot of money spent, but with a great return, but none more so than The Death of Gwen Stacy. Not only are this stories vital events in the life of Peter Parker, a.k.a. the  Amazing Spider-Man, but the quality of writing and artwork is as high as  you will find anywhere.  I admit that I am probably more easy to please  than many others (a glance at my other reviews will confirm this) but a  classic is a classic. And this is a classic. Any Spidey fan who doesn't  have this in their collection, withe the included postscript, "The  Kiss", should do themselves a big favour and remedy the situation  immediately.
