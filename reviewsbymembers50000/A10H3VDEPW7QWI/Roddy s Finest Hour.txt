 A Star Called Henry is probably far more accurate in its portrayal of Ireland in the last years of British rule than many would realise. The activities of the members of Michael Collins' "Squad" were much  like those performed by Henry Smart, who was, in the novel, on the  periphery of possibly the most effective counter-intellegence agency in the  world.  Roddy Doyle's excellent novel captures the period as well as  anything I have hitherto read on the subject. He captures the feeling of  Dubliners towards the Easter Rising, before and after the executions, and  the attitude of those beyond the Pale (English-controlled region around  Dublin, where the phrase comes from) to the "jackeens". Henry's  delay in leaving Ireland was, I believe, not as surprising as some seem to  think. Henry had great loyalty towards Michael Collins, similar to his  feelings towards James Connolly, a debt of honour, if you will, that kept  him from abandoning him while that was unresolved. After his betrayal and  the death of Collins, he was free to leave the country. These attributes  are visible in the character of Henry Smart, and are a major influence on  his actions. His various loyalties are strong and are probably the driving  force of his life. Before A Star Called Henry, I wasn't much a fan of  Roddy Doyle the author, preferring the film versions of the Barrytown  Trilogy, but I await with anticipation the remaining books in his latest  Trilogy.
