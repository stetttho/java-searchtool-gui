 I was introduced to this book two weeks before my finals for my degree. Needless to say I ignored it completely. For all of two minutes. A brief synopsis of the plot was all I needed to be intrigued and, without thought  to the consequences, I plunged into the sordid, hilarious tale. I am  pleased to have read it, although I would reccommend reading it at a less  fraught time than I did, but do read it.  Incidentally, if anyone cares,  I actually passed the exams. Stormy Weather possibly prepared me better for  tackling the philosophies of Jean-Paul Sartre than an evening of Nausea (La  Nause) and Words (Les Mots) would have done.
