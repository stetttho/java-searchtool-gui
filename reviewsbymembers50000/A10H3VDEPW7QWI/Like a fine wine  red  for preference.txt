 I have had the enormous pleasure of reading every one of the Discworld novels (I even have a signed copy of 'The Last Continent') and I can honestly say that every one has improved when re-read. I have read them all  at least twice, and most on three occasions. The first time around, Carpe  Jugulum is reasonably amusing, not a patch on the earlier books, but on  re-reading, many of the more subtle aspects of the story came to the fore.  I tend to read fairly quickly, so I don't gleam the full myriad of wealth  from the book after one reading. However, this allows for multiple re-reads  as there is always something new to discover in the vast tapestry of the  novel. I highly recommend this book, but don't settle for just reading it  once. PS 'The Fifth Elephant', the new one, is even  better.
