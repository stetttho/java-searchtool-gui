 I had this book pressed upon me. My friend gave it to me far to early one morning. Every time I met him he asked me if I was reading it yet. Eventually I started it. And was thoroughly confused. The opening is utterly preplexing, but intriguing. It draws you in. Then you get to the premise, and that's it. Forget about stopping, it's not really an option. Sure, many of the ideas may not be original, but frankly, there's not much originality out there. The genius is in the mix, and Michael Marshall Smith get it just right. He does something that doesn't seem to be widely expected in the days of 5-second attention spans, he makes you think. And wait. The anticipation of an explanation for the various events that shaped Hap's life are what drives the book along. When I finally got to the bank, I was remarkably excited about it (actually, to such an extent that the more detached part of my mind was really worried about me), but it was quite an unusual experience.  Lastly, I have to comment on the humour in the book. I think that's why my friend was so insistent on my reading it. The humour of the book is brilliant. I haven't laughed reading a book so much in quite a while. Jingo, by Terry Pratchett, perhaps. That was 1997. Incedentally, if anybody has read both, and reflecting on the use of other material, did you notice the similarity between Hap's alarm clock and the Disorganiser Lady Sibyl got Vimes?
