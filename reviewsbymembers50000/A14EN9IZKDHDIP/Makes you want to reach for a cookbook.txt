 This book describes 45 tropical herbs and spices. It gives the botanical name of each herb or spice and, usually, four local names. 	 Typically, there's a page for each herb or spice, featuring a thumbnail close-up and a still life, both in rich, glossy color. And there are three or four paragraphs describing each entry. The result is very engaging.
