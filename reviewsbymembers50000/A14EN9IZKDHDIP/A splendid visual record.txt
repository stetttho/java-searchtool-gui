 This book presents 500 illustrations which show the most important works of 130 Italian artists. It begins the art of Duccio da Buoninsegna, Giotto, Cimabue, Pietro Cavallini and Simone Martini, five artists who were born in the Thirteenth Century. And it ranges forward through time, ending with Renato Guttuso, who was born in 1912 and died in 1987. 	There is a separate section for each artist, with greater artists getting more space than the lesser. For instance, there are sixteen illustrations of the art of Giambattista Tiepolo, but two for his less talented son, Giandomenico Tiepolo. There are concise captions for each illustration. 	The result is a splendid record of Italian art and artists, spanning seven centuries. It's the most complete collection of its kind.
