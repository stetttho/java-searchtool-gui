 Doctor Boortz was still running an annual marathon at age 65, when this book was published. If your health habits are average or somewhat better than average, Doctor Boortz's book is for you. He gives 99 steps for reaching age 100. Almost all of them are very good steps. Chances are that if you follow these steps, you will live to a great old age, unless you have an accident or unfortunate heredity. If you buy this book, be sure to supplement it with "Smart Fats: How Dietary Fats and Oils Affect Mental, Physical and Emotional Intelligence" by Michael A. Schmidt. He knows more about essential fatty acids than Dr. Boortz does. And eating the right fats and fatty acids is critical to living a long life in good health. Managing your insulin, carbohydrates and proteins is very important too, so make sure that you read one or two books by Barry Sears. He knows a great deal about essential fatty acids. Plus, he knows more about insulin, carbohydrates and proteins than Dr. Boortz. Start with Sears's "Anti-Aging Zone."
