 This guide has 28 pages about building wooden bridges and wharves. Otherwise, it's about wooden buildings. It starts with reading construction blueprints and making bills of materials and describes the entire carpentry process, literally from the ground up. Its prose is very dry and it's divided into numbered sections that make abrupt transitions from topic to topic. There are many useful line drawings that explain the construction process, but no photographs.
