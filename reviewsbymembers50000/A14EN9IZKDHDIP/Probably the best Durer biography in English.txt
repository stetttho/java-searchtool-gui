 The large size of this book gives ample space to show many, many illustrations of Durer's art. These begin with his Portrait of Bernhard von Reesen, on the book's glossy dust jacket, in a size big enough to capture quite a lot of the impact of the original.  There are high quality reproductions of his engravings, iron etchings, woodcuts, drawings in silverpoint, charcoal, pen and wash and paintings in watercolor, gouache and oil.  Fedja Anzelewsky supplies concise captions, packed with detail. He also comments throughout the text on the circumstances surrounding Durer's artistic work. He gives solid information about Durer's life, from birth to death.  The result is a fine balance between a story of Durer's life and a story of his art.
