 The Book of Hot & Spicy Foods is nicely illustrated with color photos, usually four per recipe. I picked out fourteen recipes to try: Mussel & Saffron Soup, Oriental Gingered Shrimp, Creole Gumbo Pot, Mulligatawny Soup, Chili Bean Tacos, Clam & Shrimp Chowder, Nasi Goreng, Lamb & Mushroom Korma, Ceylonese Chicken Curry, Indonesian Coconut Sauce (for my Indonesian coconuts, of course) Mango Chutney (great with pork roast) Pickled Red Cabbage (serve it with the pork roast) Pickled Cabbage, Berries with Pepper Sauce (an unexpected flavor combination) and Ginger Beer. These are pretty representative of the book and they're delicious. I wish the book had been longer.
