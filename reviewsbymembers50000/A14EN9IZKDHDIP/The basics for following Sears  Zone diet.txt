 According to Barry Sears, the foundation of good health is to eat foods that keep the amount of insulin in one's bloodstream within a wholesome, healthful zone -- not too much insulin and not too little. He says that the way to stay in this zone is to keep protein and carbohydrate in the right ratio to each other in one's diet, every meal or snack, every day. The key to this is to calculate one's lean body mass, and then eat just enough protein to maintain that amount of lean body mass. Then, one adjusts the amount of carbohydrate in one's diet so that there is roughly a 4 to 3 ratio of carbohydrate to protein. Finally, one adds enough fat to make up about 30 percent of all food calories. That's all there is to it. This book explains the medical reasons for the Zone diet. It also tells you how to calculate your lean body mass, whether you're a man or a woman. And it gives more than 200 pages of recipes for meals which follow the Zone diet. There's good advice about food shopping and eating out, too. Also there are six pages of medical references in support of the Zone diet, as well as a useful index.
