 At the end of this set of lessons, you'll have about 1400 German words in your vocabulary, plus a useful knowledge of German grammar and some semblance of correct pronunciation, stress and intonation.  It is a bit difficult, at first, to relate the audio tapes to the book text because the book has content that is not in the tapes. I recommend that you use How to Pronounce German Correctly, the book and audio tape, while you use Mastering German Level 1.
