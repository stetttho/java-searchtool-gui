 This is a great collection of information about maps and charts for almost every purpose, on land or sea or in the air. Many, many kinds of maps are represented here, together with information about places to get them. The book has a so-called "perfect binding" (signatures are glued together, not sewn). And, since the pages are very heavy because they are coated with clay in order to be glossy, sections of the book tend to pull loose from the spine. A long-lived reference work such as this one ought to be sewn together, not glued.
