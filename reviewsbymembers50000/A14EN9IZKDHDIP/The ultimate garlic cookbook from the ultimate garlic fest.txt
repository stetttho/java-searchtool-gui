 Every summer, the Gilroy Garlic Festival, in Gilroy, California, draws more than 150,000 visitors who watch chefs do their cooking magic over outdoor firepits. Clubs and civic groups cook an immense array of garlic dishes from Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Mexico, China, Japan, Korea, India, Greece and the Philippine Islands. The best of these recipes were gathered together and published. The result was this book. Mmmmm, garlic. Excuse me.  I have to go and make scampi in butter sauce, now (one tablespoon of finely minced garlic in the butter sauce, plus a lot of other stuff that isn't garlic.) It's a Festival favorite.
