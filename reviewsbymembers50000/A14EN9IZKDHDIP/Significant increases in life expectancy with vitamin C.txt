 Cameron and Pauling treated a large series of terminally ill cancer patients with massive doses of vitamin C. They saw significant increases in the life expectancy of these patients, including some complete remissions. They gave a later group of terminally ill patients a broad spectrum of other vitamins and minerals with their vitamin C. These patients had even larger increases in life expectancy. Results were best with cancers of the reproductive system.  A Japanese study agrees with Cameron and Pauling but a Mayo Clinic study does not.
