 Minnesota has an immense variety of places to hike. It's the size of the British Isles. And it has a more complicated river drainage system than any other state -- rivers to the Gulf of Mexico, to the Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic Ocean. It has far more lakes than any other state, too. Plus it has more different kinds of habitat than any other state -- hardwood forest, northern evergreen forest, tall grass prairie, savannah and bog. The 87 Minnesota hikes described here will introduce you to the best of this, if you're just passing through there, or keep you busy for years if you live there.
