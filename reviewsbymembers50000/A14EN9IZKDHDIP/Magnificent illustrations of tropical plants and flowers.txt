 Margaret Mee fell in love with the flowers and plants of the Amazon River basin. Following her first visit to the Amazon in 1952,  she returned to the river another fourteen times and painted illustrations of many tropical plants and their flowers in the field, directly from nature. This book is the catalog for a three year traveling exhibition of some of her pencil and gouache illustrations of Amazon flowers and plants. The color reproductions gathered together here bear a very satisfying, close resemblance to the originals in form, contour, hue and saturation.
