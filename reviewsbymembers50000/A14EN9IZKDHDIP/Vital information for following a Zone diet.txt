 Barry Sears's food block system is a simple way to keep protein, fat and carbohydrate in the right ratio to each other in your diet, every meal, every day.  For an average man, four Zone blocks of protein, four of fat and four of carbohydrate add up to a wholesome dinner. Suppose that your problem is, how much roasted goat meat adds up to four blocks of protein? If so, this is just the right book for you to own.  Simply go to the section on proteins. There are hundreds of different protein sources listed there, alphabetically, from `abalone' to `yogurt,' but you want to know about goat meat. The entry for `goat' says that one block of roasted goat meat weighs 0.9 ounces. To get the weight of four Zone blocks of goat meat, in case you're cooking for a hearty man's appetite, just multiply 0.9 ounces times 4. That's 3.6. What happens next depends on how sunny your disposition is and how well your kitchen is equipped with measuring equipment. You can round things to the nearest ounce, 4.0 ounces, and make do with not much of a scale or you can get a sensitive chemist's balance and weigh thing to the nearest 10th of an ounce. Simple, yes? That's all there is to it, for thousands of sources of proteins, fats and carbohydrates listed in this book. It's a godsend if you're following a Zone diet, whether you're trying to decide on a haunch of roasted goat meat or a Whopper Junior.
