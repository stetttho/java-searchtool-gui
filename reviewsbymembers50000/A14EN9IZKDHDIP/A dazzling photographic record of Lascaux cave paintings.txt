 Thousands of visitors viewing the prehistoric paintings in the cave of Lascaux damaged them with moisture from their breath. Fungi began to grow on the paintings, threatening their destruction. So French authorities decided to seal the cave of Lascaux forever. 	First, they allowed a final color photography expedition into the cave. This beautiful book displays 100 plates of the resulting color photographs. Also, it has more than 50 other illustrations. These include drawings of paintings and other symbols found in the cave, archeological plans and a map of other prehistoric cave sanctuaries found elsewhere in Spain and France. And, of course, there is an abundance of explanatory text. 	This book is a visual delight.
