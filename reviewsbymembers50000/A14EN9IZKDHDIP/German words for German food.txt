 It's a pleasure to browse through this guide. It's just the thing to use to translate Deutsche Spezialitaten, the German-language version of Culinaria Germany, the lush, big food book that describes the delicious cuisine of Germany, region by region, or you can use it in a German supermarket to decipher labels.

So carry it in a purse, fanny pack, jacket- or cargo pocket.
