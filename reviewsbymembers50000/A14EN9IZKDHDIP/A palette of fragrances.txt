 Rayford Clayton Reddell and Robert Galyean had a fine idea when they thought of this book: Growing Fragrant Plants. Reddell (owner of Garden Valley Ranch, a commercial flower ranch in the San Francisco area) and Galyean (head gardener of its fragrance garden) have devised a rich palette of fragrant plants.  They've assembled a marvelous list of fragrant trees and shrubs, vines and trailers, strongly scented roses, herbs, annuals, biennials and perennials, as well as bulbs, corms, rhizomes, tubers, ground covers, water plants, fragrant grasses and scented roots. They tell how to distinguish between fragrances, predict the strength of a fragrance and separate scented flowers and leaves into fragrance groups based on the predominating chemical substance of their essential oils. And of course they tell how to select fragrant plants, where to buy them, how to grow them, landscape with them and preserve them.
