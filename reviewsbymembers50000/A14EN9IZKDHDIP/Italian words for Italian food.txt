 Italy has a lot of variety in its regional cuisines and language dialects. And that affects the design of this guide. There's an 85-page menu primer of food terms used in Italian restaurants, pretty much all over Italy. There's also a short section on comfort foods and another on beverages. And there's a special 96-page section of words describing regional and seasonal food specialties. Take this guide with you and eat well!
