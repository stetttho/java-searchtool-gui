 This book comes about as close as you can get to a world tour of plant life within the covers of one book.  It divides Earth into 22 geographic regions: Canada and the Arctic, The United States, Central America and the Carribean, South America, the Nordic Countries (and eight other European regions, including Russia) and nine other regions covering the rest of Earth. It examines the origins, distinguishing characteristics, migration and evolution of plants. It uses high quality color photographs and watercolors to show key flora of each region. And it has good maps. It also uses tables to summarize such key facts as the names of countries included in each region, total number of plant species, total number of plant species in danger and useful and dangerous plants. Each region has a list of its most important botanic gardens. By reading this book, you can circumnavigate Earth in about three hours, considerably longer if you carefully read every word. You'll want to come back to the book often if you love plants.
