 The Zone tells how you can make pounds melt away, increase your physical and mental energy and lengthen your life. Just reduce the simple sugar and other carbohydrates in your diet until the ratio of carbohydrate to protein is 4 to 3. Stop eating cake, cookies, pie, ice cream, candy and other foods which are packed with simple sugar. The Zone tells you how much protein you need to eat to maintain the existing stock of protein in your body. Once you know how much protein you need, eat complex carbohydrates until you reach a 4 to 3 ratio of carbohydrate to protein. Then add enough high-quality fat to your diet until fat makes up 25 percent of your calories. If you follow the Zone diet, you will eat a much smaller amount of food than you're used to eating, but you really won't want to eat more.
