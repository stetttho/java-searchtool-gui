 I cooked Osso Buco alla Milanese, Fagiolini al Pomodoro and Patate al Forno from recipes in this book. Together with Italian bread, a nice little wine, a simple green salad and dessert, it was a superb meal. Ask Dorling Kindersley to rush this wonderful cookbook back into print so your dinner guests will say you're a culinary genius.
