 This book is just the thing for homebuyers, homeowners, real estate agents, builders and architects. With this as a guide, you'll look at doors, windows and moulding with a new eye. The book gives basic information about window frames, sashes, hardware, glazing material, weather stripping and important window measurements. It also discusses such window selection factors as light, ventilation, view, security and safety, architectural appearance, energy efficiency and ease of maintenance. You'll learn about available window units, glazing, measuring energy efficiency, window buying, installation, certification and maintenance. The book has analogous information for doorways and moulding. It's illustrated by line drawings and all too few photographs.
