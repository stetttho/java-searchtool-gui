 English Grammar for Students is a fascinating book. It compares and contrasts English and German grammar, point by point, making it easier to understand the grammar of each language.  Reading this book, you'll end with a deeper knowledge of such things as nouns, gender, number, articles, case, verbs, subjects and objects. You'll also learn more about predicate nouns, promouns, personal pronouns, parts of verbs, infinitives, verb conjugation, tenses and much, much more.  The structure of both languages will pop out at you.
