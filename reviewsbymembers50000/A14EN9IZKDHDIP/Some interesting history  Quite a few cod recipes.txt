 Cod is the fish that fueled European exploration of the north Atlantic and this is part of its story.  Mark Kurlansky's book begins with material suggesting the collapse of today's cod fishery, then flashes backward. He calls today the end of "a thousand year fishing spree," but really picks up the story of cod in the Fifteenth Century, after just six pages about earlier times.   He seems to have no knowledge of the early northern Europeans who fished for cod in the north Atlantic. So his story starts several thousand years too late. He spent some time as a commercial fisherman and he shows an adequate grasp of this part of his subject.  There are cod recipes at the ends of his chapters, a special chapter of cod recipes at the end, an interesting bibliography and an index.
