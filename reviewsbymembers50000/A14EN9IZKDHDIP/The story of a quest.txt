 Ralph Turner tells an interesting and useful story of his quest for a piece of land in rural Iowa, and an antique tractor and a tiny house to go with it. He feels that the key to his success was to eliminate middle men. So he gives eighteen different ways to find sellers on your own.  This is a great book to read for entertainment and useful tips, but if you're seriously interested in rural land, you probably also should have Finding and Buying Your Place in the Country by Les Scher.
