 This wise and loving book begins with the funeral of Frederick Manfred, the novelist. Written in lean, spare prose by his daughter, the poet Freya Manfred, it moves by a series of flashbacks through almost five decades of her keen observations of her father. 	It is interesting to see that her writing style is quite different than her father's more ornamented style, although he was her mentor and writer friend.   	You'll enjoy reading one of Frederick Manfred's books at the same time that you read Frederich Manfred: A Daughter Remembers. I chose to read Lord Grizzly, which some people say is the best of his many books.
