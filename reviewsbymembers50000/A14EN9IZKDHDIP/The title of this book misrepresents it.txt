 One naturally expects that "Galileo's Daughter" is a book about Galileo's daughter, much the way "Ada, the Enchantress of Numbers : A Selection from the Letters of Lord Byron's Daughter and Her Description of the First Computer" is a book about Lord Byron's daughter. But no. This is not the story of Galileo's daughter, nor is it the story of a father-daughter relationship. Instead, it's an abridged biography of  Galileo, padded with letters from his illegitimate daughter, Sister Maria Celeste. All of the letters from Galileo to his daughter have been lost or destroyed. So the conversation is one sided. And her letters contribute nothing to an understanding of Galileo. They are endlessly repetitive, consisting of  pleas for money and hum drum details of daily life. Worse, the letters interrupt the story at awkard moments, with details about table cloths or Galileo's laundry halting the story of Galileo's scientific achievments. Galileo's daughter's letters are nothing new. Stillman Drake (Galileo at Work) mentions them. And there are several other books that deal with Sister Maria Celeste. Instead of reading this book, read any book about Galileo by Stillman Drake.
