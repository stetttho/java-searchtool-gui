 The Inner Dummy needed a good editor to cut it in half. This sprawling, wordy book actually is two entirely different books, one of which nobody needs to read.  The part that nobody needs to read is the story of Sigmund Freud's supposed return to earth, after being dead 60 years, to participate in an advertising agency's project to market products based on the author's -- David L. Weiner's -- concept of an Inner Dummy.  The chapters which tell this story -- and they do make up half of the book -- are an especially tedious way for Weiner to explain his concept of an Inner Dummy, which he loosely bases on Freud's concept of the Id. Weiner's Inner Dummy is just the unreasonable, irrational part of us that hungers for one thing or another and gets some of us in more or less trouble as we try to appease our hungers.
