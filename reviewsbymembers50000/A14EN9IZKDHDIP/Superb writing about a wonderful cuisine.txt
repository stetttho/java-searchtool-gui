 Imagine eating delicious meals in every region of Italy, at someone else's expense, for years on end. That's pretty much what Waverly Root did in his long career as a journalist. And the result is a classic work about Italian food. There are maps showing the food specialties of every Italian region and the best cities to visit for great eating. Each city is rated on a map, so you can easily create your own travel itinerary. And there's a long chapter for each region, describing it special food and wine. Just the thing to feed daydreams.
