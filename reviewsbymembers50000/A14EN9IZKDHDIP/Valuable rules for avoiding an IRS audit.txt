 Amir Aczel is a professor of statistics whom the IRS treated badly during an unnecessary and unjustified audit. For example, the IRS auditor repeatedly telephoned Aczel at his home before dawn, depriving Aczel, his wife and small baby of sleep. Wanting to avoid such a nasty experience in the future, Aczel used his statistical skills to detect the rules that the IRS uses to choose taxpayers to audit.  He used a super computer to compare thousands of audited income tax returns with thousands of other returns which were not audited. The result is this fascinating book. It explains 14 rules for avoiding an IRS audit.
