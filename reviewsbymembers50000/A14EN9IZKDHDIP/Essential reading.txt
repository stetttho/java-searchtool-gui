 If you're an ambitious entrepreneur, hoping to become a prince or, more plausibly nowadays, set yourself up in the despotism business, "The Prince" is essential reading. Many despots have used "The Prince" to help them learn their trade since Machiavelli wrote it in the early 16th Century. For example, Joseph Stalin studied "The Prince." And he rose from humble beginnings to become sole owner of the Soviet Union and many lesser satellite states. He seems to have felt that chapter 7, "Of Those Who Have Attained the Position of Prince by Villainy," did not apply to him, for he disregarded its most important advice. Speaking of cruelties, Machiavelli had said, "Cruelties ill committed are those which, although at first few, increase rather than diminish with time." Machiavelli also said that despots who increase their cruelties with time find it impossible to maintain themselves. And this proved true of Stalin. After a long life full of cruelties and murder, he finally convinced everyone that no one was safe from him. Finally, as an old man in increasing need of medical attention, he prepared to murder a large number of doctors, in the so-called Doctors' Plot. And it seems that his own doctors killed him first. Some commentators have said that "The Prince" is a satire, not meant to be taken literally. But Machiavelli had been tortured, ruined and exiled from Florence by the time he wrote "The Prince." He probably was not in a mood for jokes.
