 If Aaron Burr had not killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel, Burr might later have become the first sociopath to be elected president of the United States. But, because of this single fatal pistol shot, he had to content himself with conspiring to become Emperor of the American West.  He worked with the Commander of the United States Army, General James Wilkinson, a traitor and spy who worked for the Spanish, and with Zebulon Pike (the Pike's Peak or Bust Pike) to amputate the West from the United States. But Burr's timing was awful. During his conspiracy Lewis & Clark led The Corps of Discovery to Astoria, Oregon and back to St Louis, setting in motion a doubling of the size of the United States. Read this fascinating, engrossing story of those times, when it seemed as if the United States might double in size -- or be cut in half.
