 Most of the recipes in this book are for delicious, easy-to-make, one-dish meals. Some of these will be a challenge to the sort of cook who serves Froot Loops or Pop-Tarts for breakfast and boiled weiners for dinner. Others won't. The recipes in this book are sized accurately. They are measured both in terms of the number of servings and the number of blocks of protein, fat and carbohydrate. Each recipe is designed to have an equal number of blocks of fat, carbohydrate and protein, and the number of blocks of each of these is listed.

Probably, if you had a big crowd of people, some of them thin and some of them extra fat, you could easily sort them into two groups: the thin ones, who follow the sort of diet outlined in this cookbook, and the fat ones who don't. Most of the recipes here are for dinner. About 50 are for lunch and a couple dozen are for breakfast. Pick your favorites. There are several useful appendices. One lists the number of blocks  of protein, fat or carbohydrate in various common foods. Another lists scientific references about various aspects of the Zone diet.
