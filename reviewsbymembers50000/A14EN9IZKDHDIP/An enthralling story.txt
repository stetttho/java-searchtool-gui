 One of the most wonderful things in the story of Srinavasa Ramanujan, the Indian mathematician, is the noble character of G.H. Hardy, the English mathematician. Hardy's character was as remarkable for things that he didn't do as it was for things that he did. When Ramanujan sent his first letter to Hardy, enclosing valuable mathematical results, Hardy could have laid it aside, unread or undervalued. Other mathematicians did. Instead, Hardy sent an emissary half way around the earth to bring Ramanujan to England. Once Ramanujan arrived in Cambridge, Hardy could have taken credit for Ramanujan's work and seen him off, back to India. Other men have done worse. Also, one of the worst things that can happen to a brilliant man such as Ramanujan is to have a powerful but duller teacher who can not take second place to a brighter student. Hardy recognized Ramanujan as a far better mathematician and nurtured him without envy. That is one of the most remarkable things about this story. It is easy to be anachronistic about Hardy and Ramanujan. It's easy to put sneer quotes around Hardy's "discovery" of Ramanujan, now that there are Indian names in most large American telephone books. And it's easy to fault Hardy for failing to enrich Ramanujan's food with vitamin D, years before its discovery. All it takes is to know little or nothing of Ramanujan's times. To a small extent, the author of this book does the equivalent. Still, this is a deeply interesting story, very well told. Reading it, you'll learn why Ramanujan died so early, tightly constrained by the limitations of his own era. And you'll learn why his early death was such a great loss. It's a pity that Ramanujan wasn't born later, say in 1927. Read this book and imagine what Ramanujan could have done with a pocket calculator, during a long life.
