 In complete defiance of the wisdom of the ages, one of my friends stopped being a lawyer and started being a farmer. Other people had been leaving the farm for generations, to become lawyers. Not he. After a lot of thought, he decided to use horses on his farm, not tractors. Old horses make new horses, but old tractors just wear out, he said. Then he decided to become a sheep farmer, because raising sheep takes less labor than almost any other kind of farming. Plus, old sheep make new sheep. This is the book that taught him how to be a sheep farmer. Ten years later his old sheep are still making new sheep. Plus, he has a lot more stimulating companionship in his new job, he said. Who could ask anything more from a book? Watch for the new edition, due out in June, 2001. Yours can be a success story too.
