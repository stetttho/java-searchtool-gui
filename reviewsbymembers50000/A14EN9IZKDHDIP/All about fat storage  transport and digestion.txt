 The Fats of Life is mostly about storage fats, fats as an energy source, fats as adipose tissue. It's not about structural fats. So it doesn't have much to say about fats as components of cell membranes in, say, the eyes or brain. Nor is it about fats as the source of building materials for such vital messenger molecules as prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes. It's mostly about such things as fat storage depots, the special locations where fats are stored. It tells a great deal about fat storage depots in animals as varied as hares, humans, bears, seals, camels, horses, lions, stoats, birds and squirrels. It also tells a great deal about fats as the energy source during hibernation, migration or other times when food supplies are chancy. And it discusses digesting, transporting and using fats as an energy source, as insulation and as protection for vital organs, from an evolutionary viewpoint The book is meant for a lay audience, not scientists, so it lacks references. Sometimes this causes problems. For example, the book says that eating sugar is not an important source of weight gain in humans. But there is no reference to support this claim.  There are chapter notes at the end of the book. Otherwise, there is no bibliography. There are eighteen black-and-white illustrations.
