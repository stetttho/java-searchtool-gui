 This book makes the grammar of both English and Italian stand out in high relief. You'll emerge from it with a firmer grasp of both languages.  If you want to learn Italian, it should be one of the first five things that you buy. The other four should be a good dictionary, How To Pronounce Italian Correctly (the booklet and tape cassette), Ultimate Italian (the book and audio CD or cassettes) and Pimsleur Italian, if you can afford it.
