 This is a guide, in three parts, to more than 130 plants that are not only edible but ornamental too. Part One is an encyclopedia whose entries give a thumbnail sketch of a single plant or a related group of plants, tell the zones where it will grow, estimate the effort needed to grow it, tell its uses in the kitchen and the landscape and give information about buying, growing and preserving it. Part Two gives the special information you need to know to get your plants started and keep them growing well. It discusses composting and pruning, watering, fertilizing and pest control. Part Three lists 225 edible plants, includes an annotated list of nurseries where you can get them and gives sources of information about organizations, periodicals and so forth.  The book has handsome pen and ink illustrations, a good glossary and a quite useful annotated bibliography.
