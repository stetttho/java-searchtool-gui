 Alexander Solzhenitsyn's life began in 1918, near the start of a thirty-six-year bloodbath in which the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its leaders, Lenin and Stalin, murdered more than sixty million people. They committed most of their murders in out of the way places, in islands of secrecy. They buried the details beneath a petrified forest of lies. Often, the murder victims themselves did not know that they were being murdered. They just knew that they were cold, tired, sick and starving. Then they died. Little toads from the west, among them New York Times correspondent Walter Duranty, French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre, Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw and many others, hopped through the petrified forest and said it was a paradise. Meanwhile, Lenin and, after him, Stalin gradually bled Russia nearly to death. It was a butcher bill so horrific that today, if the victims of Communist Party of the Soviet Union had lived to have children, there would be 300 million Russians alive. Instead, there are 150 million. Following his arrest in 1945, Alexander Solzhenitsyn gradually became the chief excavator of truth about this butchery.  His "One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich," which describes a day in the life of one of Stalin's prisoners, sped the collapse of the Soviet Union. His "Gulag Archipelago," which describes the Soviet Communist Party's vast network of death camps, left Stalin's western colleagues and admirers nowhere to hide. In his finely crafted biography, "Alexander Solzhenitsyn: A Century in His Life," D.M Thomas, the English poet and novelist, unveils the personality and work habits which made it possible for Solzhenitsyn to write  his story.
