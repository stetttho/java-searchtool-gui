 This book is well organized, making it easy to find information. There's a short introduction to nutritional supplements and lengthy sections on vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, accessory nutrients and glandular products, as well as a quick reference guide to a number of specific health conditions. The book traces many of its health claims to medical journal articles in a list of references at the back of the book. Its index is good too.
