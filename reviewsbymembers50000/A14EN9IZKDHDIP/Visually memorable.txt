 Edwin Lundie loved to use heavy, visible timbers in his designs of country houses and cabins. And he loved to use warm, earthy color tones, custom-made hardware and rough-hewn, rustic fireplaces and chimneys.  The result is soothing, comfortable and visually memorable. His city houses have a storybook quality, evoking early New England. Interiors of these houses are lighter, more formal and delicate than those of his country houses, but there still are rustic elements in brick, stone, wrought iron and hand carved wood. You can see all of this in The Architecture of Edwin Lundie, a lovely book filled with color photography and Edwin Lundie's skilful drawings.
