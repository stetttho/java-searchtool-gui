 The houses described in this book are mainly in Ontario, Canada, with a sprinkling from Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and New England. So they're very old houses from the perspective of places further west, say, Manitoba, Wisconsin, Kansas or Nevada. Most date from the mid-19th Century, well before building codes existed, and a few date from the 18th Century. Of course, there are special problems in restoring one of these houses.  So this book tells where to find the right resources in hardware, masonry, paint, plumbing, wood, wallpaper and plaster ornamentation. It also lists places to find special tools, schools and workshops, magazines and books. And it tells you how to research, plan and do the restoration of the structure, the exterior and mechanical systems of these old houses. It uses well-chosen photos and drawings to explain things.
