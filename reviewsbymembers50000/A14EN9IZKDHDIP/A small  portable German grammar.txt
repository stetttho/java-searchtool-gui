 One nice thing about this little book is its durable plastic covers. They let you tuck it in a purse or shirt pocket and carry it anywhere, without damage. It covers the basics, such as pronunciation, orthography (capitalization, syllabication and punctuation) and punctuation.  It also treats all of the parts of speech, including nouns, articles, adjectives, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, prepositions and conjunctions. And, this being German, the book also tells how to make compound words from independent words and add prefixes or suffixes to words. There's a useful section covering such special topics as numbers, telling time, days, months, seasons and the weather, synonyms and antonyms, and common phrases and idiomatic expressions.
