 Would you like to have a resting pulse rate of 50 or 55 beats a minute? A pulse rate so low that your cardiologist will say that you have sinus bradycardia? Would you like to have the energy in the food that you eat equal your energy outgo, so that you won't gain weight? Would you like to be so superbly fit that you could do just about anything, at the drop of a hat? Sure you would. So read Physiology of Fitness and do what it says. It's out of print, right now, but keep your eyes open for a used copy.
