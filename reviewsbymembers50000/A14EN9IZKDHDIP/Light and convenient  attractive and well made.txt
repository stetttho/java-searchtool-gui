 This pleasant little book can be a valuable tool in the education of any amateur interested in architecture. It's of such a convenient size that you can take it with you, on long or short trips, and learn its concepts: ashlar, battered, common bond, dado, exoskeleton, firmitas, groin vault, and so on and so forth, through voussoir and wind bracing and many others. It's a coherent story of architecture, not a glossary or dictionary, but the fresh, new words accumulate.
