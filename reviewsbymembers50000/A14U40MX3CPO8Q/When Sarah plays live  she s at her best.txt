 This 1994 concert video of Sarah McLachlan is beyond words.  Sarah and her band confidently perform to a sold-out crowd in Montreal where Sarah is highly respected.  Besides the amazing concert, this is an interview with  Sarah and her long-time friend and producer Pierre Marchand, along with  in-studio sessions as well.  An intimate look into one of the most amazing  singers.  Well done, Sarah!
