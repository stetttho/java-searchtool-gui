 I guess you only have to have four records in todays music industry to warrant a greatest hits package.  Well, the Backstreet Boys seem to think they have to release an album like this, but what they're really saying is they've either run out of ideas or that they're breaking up.  If you're a casual BSB fan, this is a great album to get, but longtime fans don't need to waste their money on this.
