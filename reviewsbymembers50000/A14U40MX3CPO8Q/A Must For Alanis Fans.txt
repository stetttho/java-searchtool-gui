 The highlight of this rare single is the live version of Mary Jane.  Her singing is amazing and the lyrics will strike a chord with you.  The Grammy version of You Oughta Know is also beautiful, with strings and piano to accompany Alanis' voice.  The only thing I didn't like was the version of All I Really Want.  Still, this is great!
