 Since Sarah McLachlan hasn't released any new material since 1997's "Surfacing", I suppose her record company felt the need to once again release a filler album in an attempt to satisfy McLachlan fans who are craving new material.  Now that Sarah has recently had a baby, I don't expect any new material from her until about 2003.  Anyway, "Remixed" just doesn't cut it for this longtime Sarah fan.  We've heard these songs one million times before and these remixes don't breathe any new life into them.  The only ones I like are "Angel" and "Hold On" but the rest are silly and far too long.  Unless you love dance music (which isn't music to begin with) try Sarah's "Remixed" album.  I think I'll stick with "Solace" and "Surfacing" until she releases something new.
