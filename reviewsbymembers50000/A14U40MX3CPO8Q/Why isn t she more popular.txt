 Despite the recent flock of female singer/songwriters, Damhnait Doyle hasn't had a lot of success in terms of record sales even though she is probably more talented than most of the popular singers out there.  Her newest release, 2000's "Hyperdramatic" did fairly well in Canada and thanks to that success I found her debut album, "Shadows Wake Me".  Damhnait's voice is very unique and it has a beauty all in its own.  Her lyrics are pretty simple and so is the music, but this is still an amazing album.  My favourite song on here is "Shadows Wake Me" - it's just so haunting and Damhnait's vocals are outstanding.  If you are lucky enough to stumble across this CD, buy it!  Just a sidenote - Damhnait is from Canada and not Ireland...
