 I think Sarah Harmer's You Were Here is the type of album that takes numerous listens until you can really appreciate it.  The single Basement Apartment is addictive and fun to listen to, but the real gem here is Lodestar.  I do not particularily care for Sarah's voice - it's good but nothing special - but her songwriting makes up for it all.
