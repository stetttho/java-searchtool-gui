 Unfortunately I became a DMB a little too late, but boy am I glad I did become one.  Not only are they excellent in concert, they are brilliant in the studio.  Crash is my personal favorite of their records due to the  gorgeous "Crash Into Me" and "Cry Freedom".  This  record is really fun to listen to and it even has some really beautiful  songs on it.  If you want great music, get this and (hopefully) you won't  be disappointed.
