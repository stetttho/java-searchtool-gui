 I never thought DMB would disappoint, but they did that and more with their 2001 release "Everyday". Now that Glen Ballard is out of the picture for now, DMB have redeemed themselves with "Busted Stuff". There are some amazing songs on the album, including "Where Are You Going", "Grace is Gone", "Digging a Ditch" and "Bartender". Finally the band is back to what they do best and not that pop nonsense they did with Glen Ballard.
