 After many hit albums and singles, U2 decided to release a greatest hits package (yay!).  This is a limited release two-disc set and if you're lucky enough to find it, get it!  Disc one (obviously) contains their best songs, from the gorgeous "With Or Without You" and "All I Want is You" to the rockier "Sunday Bloody Sunday" and "Desire".  The b-sides disc is amazing as well and I found myself enjoying all of the songs on that disc.  I honestly believe that U2 are the most talented band around, so I was more than happy to spend the extra money for this edition.
