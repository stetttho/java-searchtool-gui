 I was never a fan of the band Veruca Salt, but when I heard Nina Gordon's  song "Tonight and The Rest of My Life", I knew she was something  special.  The album will satisfy both pop lovers and rock lovers.  As for  her voice, it isn't particularily good, but she sings with such emotion and  inspiration.  Good work, Nina!
