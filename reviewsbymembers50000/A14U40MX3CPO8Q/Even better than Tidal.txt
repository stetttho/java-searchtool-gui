 When the Pawn... took several listens before I could really get into it. At first I thought it was too weird but I gave it another chance and now I love it! My favorite song on the album is Limp, which has some cool drum beats. I just wish there was at least one upbeat song on this album. All of the ten tracks are gloomy and serious and it would be nice to have a happy song thrown into the mix. Still, this album is excellent!!
