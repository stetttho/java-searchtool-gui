 The Canadian group The Rankin Family is absolutely phenomenal.  Singer/songwriter Jim Rankin is an absolute genius, and the rest of the family complement him wonderfully.  "Fare Thee Well Love" is a  most beautiful song.  Too bad only Canada got to hear this amazing group.   Also, god bless the late John Morris Rankin.  He will be missed.
