 I am currently set to read the next Kay Scarpetta novel, "Cause of Death" and I can't wait.  After reading the previous novels and enjoying them, I must say that "From Potter's Field" ranks among three of my favourite Scarpetta novels along with "Body of Evidence" and "The Body Farm".  As with every novel in the series, Patricia Cornwell's writing is crisp and entertaining, even if the ending of this book is quite silly.  If you want an entertaining, gripping read, try "From Potter's Field" and every novel in the Kay Scarpetta series.
