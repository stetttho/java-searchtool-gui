 After reading the many positive reviews of this album, I decided to pick it up.  While Lifehouse doesn't exactly bring a unique sound into the world of music, this album is still beautiful and full of passion.  Jason Wade has an amazing voice and it's hard to believe he's only 20.  The real gem is Everything, which most reviewers here seem to agree upon.  Other favorites are Simon, Trying, and of course, Hanging By A Moment.
