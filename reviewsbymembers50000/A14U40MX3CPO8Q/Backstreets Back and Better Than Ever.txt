 I became a fan of the Backstreet Boys in 1999 after the release of Millennium, a more mature and enjoyable album than their previous efforts.  Black and Blue follows the same formula as Millennium but it's done with more passion and maturity.  The Boys wrote or co-wrote most of the songs on here, which is definately a big step.  This is a good, fun album that isn't to be taken overly serious.
