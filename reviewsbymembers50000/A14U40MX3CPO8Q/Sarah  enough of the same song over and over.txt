 I am a huge fan of Sarah McLachlan and always will be, though one area she's weak in is her choice of b-sides for her singles.  Not surprisingly, Sarah provides us with 5 remixes of the same song, and it grows quite  tiresome.  The radio mix of the song is great, placing a higher emphasis on  her gorgeous voice, though the same cannot be said for the dance remixes.   Sarah's songs nor her voice are suitable for a dance remix.  Can you  honestly say it's enjoyable to hear her say "Sweet Surrender"  over and over?  Whenever Sarah releases another album, I hope she puts some  amazing b-sides on her singles.
