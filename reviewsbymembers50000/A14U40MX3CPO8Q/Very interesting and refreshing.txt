 I found this album in the used bin at a record store and decided to pick it up. At first I was put off by her voice and "strange" music, but I have grown to love this album. This is the only Kate Bush album I own but I will definately check out her other albums. This album is perfect for any Kate fan or for anyone who wants to listen to something different and refreshing.
