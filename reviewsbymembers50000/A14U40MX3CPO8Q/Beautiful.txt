 After watching the film Traffic I wasn't exactly moved by the score until I heard the song which accompanies the final scene.  The song is called Ascent (An Ending) and was written by Brian Eno.  That track alone makes the soundtrack worth buying.  All of the tracks are great, but Brian Eno's contribution is by far the best track on this album.
