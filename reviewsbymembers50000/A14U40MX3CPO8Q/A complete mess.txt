 Pola X is beautifully filmed and well made, but that's about it.  You don't feel anything for the characters, no matter how good the actors are and no matter how hard the director tries to get the viewer involved.  This movie is a complete mess and even that explicit love scene can't make up for it.  Pass this one by!
