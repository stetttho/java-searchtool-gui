 Yes I am bored and have no life.  This is my third and FINAL review of Nelly Furtado's debut album.  My first review slammed her album, my second praised it.  But you know, I really can't stand Nelly Furtado.  Her lyrics have no emotion and she doesn't draw you into her songs.  She IS the Canadian Britney Spears, but at least she does write her own songs.  She only won a few Juno Awards because they felt sorry for her.  Skip Nelly's music, if you can.
