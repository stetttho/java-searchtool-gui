 After posting a five star review of this album and praising the band for "changing", I listened to Everyday over and over again. But something happened:  I realized this CD really, really stinks.  I never cared for the Glen Ballard/Dave Matthews pairing at all and now I really hate what Ballard has done.  His production WAS magical with Alanis Morissette and now she has decided to go alone for her next record.  After hearing Everyday, I don't blame her.  Ballard and Matthews have striped the emotion from the songs and have created Backstreet Boy songs which is fine, only that I thought DMB was a "real" band.  Ballard's previous work with Alanis was Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, which is the last thing from "mainstream", but his work with Matthews is just that.  Why did Dave and his band have to create an album so uninspired and geared towards top 40 radio fans?  I was really excited for them to come to my city to play, but that was before this pathetic album hit stores.
