 I am probably the pickiest person in the world when it comes to music.  So, when I first heard Tara MacLean's Passenger, I thought, "that was a waste of money".  Besides If I Fall and Jordan I just couldn't get into this album.  As with a lot of albums in the past, I have grown to like this one.  Tara has a nice voice (whoever said she's a better singer than Sarah McLachlan needs a reality check, since Sarah has a voice so beautiful, so unique, that practically no one can sing as well as her) and the musical arrangements are great.  However, I still find this album weak.  The songs sound too much a like, though they are all beautiful.  She's a nice songwriter and I am glad I gave this album a second chance.
