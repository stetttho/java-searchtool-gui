 I saw the movie "In Cold Blood" a few years ago and became instantly fascinated with the story.  A wonderful family died for what amounted to no reason at all, yet it also makes for a fantastic story.  Truman Capote wrote the book with such depth that I am amazed.  If you're into reading about real-life crime stories, "In Cold Blood" is by far worth the read.
