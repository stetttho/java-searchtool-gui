 Alanis Morissette's songs just don't suit the style of a string quartet, though the makers of this album pulled it off fairly well.  Songs like "Perfect", "Forgiven" and "Mary Jane" work well with the string arrangements, but "All I Really Want", "Hand in my Pocket" and "Ironic" are just hilarious.  If you're a die hard Alanis fan, this is a must.  All others avoid!
