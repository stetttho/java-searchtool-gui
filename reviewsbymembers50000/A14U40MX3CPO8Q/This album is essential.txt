 I've always loved Phil's music, so I'm more than happy to own "Hits".  My favorite song is "Against All Odds", which has to be one of the most beautiful songs ever.  "Another Day in Paradise" is another favorite - that song is so haunting and beautiful.  I only own a few greatest hits albums and this is one of them, so that's saying a lot about this album.  An amazing album!
