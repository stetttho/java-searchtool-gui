 A few years ago I bought the VHS edition of Sarah's video collection, but this updated DVD edition takes the cake (obviously).  It's amazing to watch how Sarah has grown from a 20-year-old trying to find her voice into a 30-year-old (in 1998) Canadian music legend.  My favorite Sarah videos have to be Drawn to the Rhythm and Building A Mystery.
