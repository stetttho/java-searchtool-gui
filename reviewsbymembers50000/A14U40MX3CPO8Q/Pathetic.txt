 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Matthew McConaughey can act, but with this poor excuse for a movie he is given no room to shine.  Also, I disliked Harvey Keitel in 1999's Holy Smoke and after seeing this I dislike him even more.  Do yourself a favor and pass this movie up the next time you want to rent a movie
