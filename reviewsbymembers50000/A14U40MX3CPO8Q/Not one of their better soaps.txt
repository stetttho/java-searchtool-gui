 My first Lush soap experience was Honey I Washed the Kids so I had very high expecations of I Should Coco Soap. Not only did it only faintly smell like coconut, it was too hard on my skin while lathering and that was a huge put-off. It does do a good job of cleaning but the texture and smell are a real turn-off.
