 I was dumbstruck after watching this movie.  Even though it begins as a sweet tale of friendship between two young girls, it ends off as a haunting, yet true story.  Kate Winslet, once again showing she is one of  the best actresses of her time, is amazing (as is everyone else).  This  movie isn't for all tastes, but it is a true work of art.
