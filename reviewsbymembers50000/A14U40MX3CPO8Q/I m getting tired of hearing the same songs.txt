 I can't think of another artist who has constantly repackaged the same songs over and over again.  In June it will be five years since "Surfacing" was released and since then Sarah has released a live album and an album of remixes.  Both albums feature many of the same songs and now Nettwerk has decided to release "Angel" as a single AGAIN!  They released it in 1999, probably to promote "Mirrorball".  I am tired of Sarah releasing the same songs and I urge longtime fans to avoid this.
