 I am probably one of the pickiest eaters, therefore it is very difficult for anyone to get me to try different meals.  After tasting some of Bonnie Stern's amazing recipes, all that changed.  Her cookbooks are varied and not only are the recipes delicous, they're healthy as well.  My favorite recipe thus far is the noodles and vegetables with peanut sauce (I forget the title of the recipe).  If you live in Canada, her books are available, though it's disappointing to see that it's not the same in the United States.  A must for anyone who wants great tasting food that is also good for you.
