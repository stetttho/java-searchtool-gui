 I am a huge Kate Winslet fan and I was excited to watch Holy Smoke.  I knew the film was off-beat and quirky, which gave me even more reason to watch it.  Unfortunately, half way through the film I turned it off.  The movie's story line was completely wasted, as were the talents of Kate Winslet.  Harvey Keitel's performance was, to say the least, stale, and Ruth and PJ's relationship was unconvincing.  Kate delivers a flawless performance that was over-looked by critics and audiences, though with a better movie she would have earned more praise.
