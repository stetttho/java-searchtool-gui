 I am the one who wrote the scathing review of Ms. Furtado, comparing her to Britney Spears.  I was listening to I'm Like A Bird for the 100th time on the radio when it hit me:  this girl can really sing.  At times her voice is annoying, but others it's beautiful.  I bought this CD and enjoy it thoroughly.  I feel like an idiot since I wrote a terrible review of this album before hearing all but one song, but I gave this chick a chance and I am glad I did.
