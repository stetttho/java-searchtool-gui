 I purchased this album based on the fact that Sarah McLachlan contributed her heavenly voice to the track "Silence", but I actually ended up loving the entire album. I'm not much for this kind of music, but I can't resist how beautiful these songs are. Aside from "Silence", favorites include "Duende" (which features Sarah's back-up singer, Camille Henderson) and "Remembrance". Even if you're not into this type of music, give "Karma" a try. I'm glad I did!
