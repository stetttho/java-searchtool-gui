 Few murder cases in Canada have sparked so much outrage and interest as the cases surrounding Paul Bernardo and Karla Hamolka.  Stephen Williams gives an in-depth look at their childhood and how they met and how they killed.  It also makes light of the justice system (well lack of) we have in Canada.  The fact that Ms. Homolka could be out in a few years is sickening and disturbing.  She is not a victim and Stephen Williams points that out very well.  This book is compelling though not for the weak stomach.
