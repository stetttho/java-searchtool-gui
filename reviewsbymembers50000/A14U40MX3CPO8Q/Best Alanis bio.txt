 ... I've read a few Alanis Morissette biographies but this one takes the cake! Paul Cantin gives us an indepth look into Alanis's life in a professional and wonderfully written way, unlike that so-called bio "Ironic:  The Story of Alanis Morissette".  If you're interested in an Alanis bio, get this one!
