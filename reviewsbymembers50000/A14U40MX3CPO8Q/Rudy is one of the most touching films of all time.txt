 I rented this movie in 1995 and was expecting some silly football story that we've seen numerous times over.  Instead, I saw a touching, true-life story about a young man we can all relate to.  Rudy was told he was too  small to play for Notre Dame.  He persisted and listened to his heart and  proved everyone wrong.  Sean Astin (who is an under rated actor)  beautifully portrays Rudy in probably his best performance yet.  This film  is touching, emotional, and uplifting.  A moving experience worthy of  everyone's attention.
