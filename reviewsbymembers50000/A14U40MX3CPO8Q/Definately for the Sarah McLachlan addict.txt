 Essentially this cd contains acoustic and demo tracks from her 1993 album Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.  Many of the demos, like the fully produced ones, are chilling.  Stand outs are Plenty, Ice, and the gorgeous version of Hold  On, where it's just Sarah and her piano.  If you're a hard core Sarah fan,  check this out.
