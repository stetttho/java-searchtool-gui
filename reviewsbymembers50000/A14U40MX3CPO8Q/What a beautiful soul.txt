 One word comes to mind after watching this DVD:  WOW!  This video/DVD offers nine tracks not included on the Mirrorball cd.  As soon as Sarah and her band begin the opening notes of Building A Mystery, the audience and  anyone watching this concert is stunned by her beauty and talent.  Sarah's  voice is beautiful, especially on the spine-tingling Fear.  Sarah and her  band have a great chemistry and love for music that is so rare today.   Also, the interview footage of her reveals a very down-to-earth and classy  woman who definately has not let her success go to her head.
