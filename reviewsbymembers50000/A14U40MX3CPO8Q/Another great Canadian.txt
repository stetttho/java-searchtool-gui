 The interesting thing is that I couldn't stand Holly until I heard "Coward", an absolutely beautiful and haunting song that I could relate to. While it is one of the most depressing songs I've ever heard, most of us can relate to the lyrics and message. Holly's voice can be beautiful ("Coward") and annoying ("Elmo") but generally her voice is great and emotional. Holly released a new album in June 2002 called "Home is Where My Feet Are", so look for it and "Stuff" as well.
