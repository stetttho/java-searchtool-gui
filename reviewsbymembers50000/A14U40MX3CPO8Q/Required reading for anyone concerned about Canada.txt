 Thank God Daniel Stoffman decided to write a book about Canada's incredibly lax immigration and refugee system.  As he points out so well in his book, you're labelled a racist or anti-immigrant if you dare speak up and question what our government(s) has done to a once responsible department.  He tackles all of the tough issues from Canada's incredibly generous and inept refugee system to the government guise of multiculturalism and even about how our immigration and refugee system is failing legitimate refugees and immigrants.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in where this once proud country is heading or for anyone interested in politics in general.
