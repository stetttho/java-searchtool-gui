 Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd are wonderful in this faithful movie adaptation of James Patterson's hit novel.  Ashley Judd plays a convincing victim and Morgan Freeman is good as Alex Cross.  The cinematography was outstanding and the supporting cast were great.  My only problem is with the ending - it was so dumb that it made me laugh when I shouldn't have been.  This movie is definitely better and more faithful than "Along Came a Spider".
