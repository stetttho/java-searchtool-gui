 If you're just getting into Mae's music, "Collected Works" is the place to start. It has all of her hits, plus remixes and rare songs. I have no clue as to why Mae hasn't made it in the United States, but give this amazing Canadian artist a try, especially if you listen to Sarah McLachlan, Natalie Merchant or Jann Arden.
