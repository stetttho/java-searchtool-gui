 This is a great adaptation of the score for The Last of the Mohicans, my favorite movie.  I am glad that this CD has more Trevor Jones tracks than Randy Edelman's because Jones clearly outshined Edelman on this one.  It doesn't have the same aura as the original soundtrack, but after hearing The Glade all is forgiven.
