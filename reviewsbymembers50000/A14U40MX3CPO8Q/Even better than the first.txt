 Natalie Imbruglia somewhat disappeared after her debut, "Left of the Middle", sold millions of copies and made Natalie a star.  Natalie is back with "White Lilies Island" and this album is an improvement over her debut.  This album has a mix of rock, pop and electronica and is enjoyable from start to finish.  Definately check out Natalie's new album!
