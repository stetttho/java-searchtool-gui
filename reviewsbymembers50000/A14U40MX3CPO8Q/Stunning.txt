 I never liked Joan Osborne's music until now, but after hearing her on The Chieftains CD I had to pick up Relish. I love all of the songs, especially St. Teresa and One Of Us. This album doesn't really show off Joan's gorgeous voice but the music and lyrics are great and overall this is a wonderful album with a lot of soul.
