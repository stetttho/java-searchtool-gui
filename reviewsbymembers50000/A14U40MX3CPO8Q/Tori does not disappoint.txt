 This is Tori's fourth album, and I must say how surprised I was at how beautiful it is.  The songs range from off-beat to beautiful, which is something Tori Amos is great at.  My personal favorites are "Black  Dove", "Jackie's Strength", "Northern Lad", and  "Playboy Mommy".  Tori has such a beautiful voice and it shines  on "Northern Lad".  If you're a Tori fan, definately check this  cd out!
