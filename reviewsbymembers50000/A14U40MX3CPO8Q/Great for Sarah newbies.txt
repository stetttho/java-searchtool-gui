 I must admit that Mirrorball is beautiful to listen to.  Sarah puts so much passion and energy into her music and it's truly inspiring.  However, this cd just doesn't contain enough of her older material.  Ice is one of  Sarah's most chilling songs, and Into the Fire is her fastest and one of  her catchiest songs.  Still, with the material presented, Sarah and her  band create an energy so amazing that it almost, just almost, makes up for  the lack of older material.  And after watching the Mirrorball DVD, I was  disappointed that she didn't include Vox on this cd.  That's truly a gem.
