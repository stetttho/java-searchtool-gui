 Even though 10,000 Maniacs are no longer a household name, their music from 1981-1993 has stood the test of time since Natalie Merchant's departure in 1993. After Merchant left the band, Mary Ramsey took over singing duties and the Merchant-less band released two albums without much fanfare. This collection of hits and b-sides appropriately only features songs from the Merchant-era, so if you're a Mary Ramsey fan look elsewhere. The first disc features many of their signature songs like These Are Days, Like the Weather and their live cover of Because the Night. I was quite surprised at the number of songs from their pre-The Wishing Chair days, but they included too many from their In My Tribe breakthrough album. The second disc features b-sides, demos and a few live selections. I suppose the only true rarities are the demo versions of Can't Ignore the Train, Noah's Dove, Circle Dream and Eden, plus the previously unreleased Poppy Selling Man from the early 80's, so if you own a lot of their singles this collection might not be worth it. For those of us who weren't around to witness the impact this underrated band made, Campfire Songs is well worth the investment.
