 This was the Sarah McLachlan album that gained her a cult status and critical and commercial acclaim.  Nevermind everyones praise of Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.  Solace was the stepping stone of her career.  A  remarkable album highlighted by Drawn to the Rhythm, I Will Not Forget You  and the haunting Black.
