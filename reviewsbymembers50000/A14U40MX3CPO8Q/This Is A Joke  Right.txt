 Oh I'll admit it:  I watch Making the Band and find it enjoyable.  I find it interesting how these five guys, who seem to genuinely love music, are being turned into manufactured pop geeks who can barely sing or dance.  Yeah I like the Backstreet Boys.  I think they can sing but I do not think they are music gods.  Anyway, the song Liquid Dreams is the most pathetic excuse for a song in years.  Why don't you spend your money on musicians who write from the heart and aren't manufactured puppets?  Instead of artists protesting against Napster, they should be protesting against music like this.
