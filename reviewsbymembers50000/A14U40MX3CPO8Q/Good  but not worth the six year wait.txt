 Sarah McLachlan's latest offering, 2003's 'Afterglow', features more of the same blandness featured on her 1997 blockbuster album 'Surfacing'.  Only this time it isn't nearly as good, but it's still good enough for me to recommend it.  Teaming up yet again with her longtime producer Pierre Marchand, McLachlan offers fans what could be described as 'Surfacing Lite'.  While 'Surfacing' did suffer from a few bad songs, McLachlan's lyrics were at least more heartfelt than anything that's on this record.  You know Sarah is running out of ideas when she comes up with trite lyrics like "there are times I can't decide when I can't tell up from down" and "'cause I'm a train wreck waiting to happen/waiting for someone to come pick me up off the tracks."  Despite a few corny lyrics and some boring arrangements, 'Afterglow' is a good album even if it offers nothing new from Sarah.  I just hope that in another six years (or even longer) she'll release an album that's truly worth waiting for.
