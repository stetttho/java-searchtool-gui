 I rented this movie based on the fact that it was praised by critics everywhere, but I really didn't know what to expect.  To my surprise, "Ghost World" was hilarious, touching and sad all at the same time.  I could totally relate to Thora Birch's character!  It's pretty rare that I can watch a movie and identify with a character that much!  Enid and Rebecca were "real" characters and not like your typical characters in silly movies like "American Pie", which make teens out to be only sex obsessed, lazy fools (alright, many teens are, but they're also so much more than that).  I was pleasently surprised by "Ghost World"!  So much, in fact, that I think I'll buy it!
