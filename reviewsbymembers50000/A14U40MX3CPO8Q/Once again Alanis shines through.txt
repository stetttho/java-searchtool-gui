 Alanis Morissette has proven to be an artist full of exploration (finally an artist who could care less about sales).  "Still" is a masterpiece, both lyrically and musically.  The lyrics are about Alanis'  views on god and they are very deep and introspective.  As for her voice,  beautiful!  Alanis does an awesome chant thing in the song that takes my  breath away.  The rest of the cd is great and Howard Shore did wonders in  creating music for "Dogma".
