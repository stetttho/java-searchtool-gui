 Jack Nicholson stars as a convict who is committed to a mental institution to decide whether he is really crazy or not.  During his stay, he tries to set the other patients free of the typical "routine" of their day.  The acting is flawless and you really get to know the characters as more than "mental patients".  A must see film.
