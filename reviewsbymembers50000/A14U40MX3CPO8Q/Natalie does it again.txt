 After her brilliant 1998 album Ophelia, I didn't think Natalie would be able to surpass it, but she equals Ophelia on her new album Motherland.  The album's first single, Just Can't Last, is reminiscent of Kind & Generous, but it's still a fun song to listen to.  My favorite songs on here are Golden Boy and I'm Not Gonna Beg.  Natalie's voice is SO BEAUTIFUL, though it annoys me a little on Saint Judas.  This is definately Natalie's most musically adventurous album to date and Natalie fans shouldn't be disappointed with it!  I love this album just as much as Ophelia, though it's much better than Tigerlily.  Natalie Merchant is the best!
