 Helen Fielding is an incredibly gifted writer.  There's no denying that.  But this book is so overhyped it's not even funny.  The storyline of a self-obsessed thirty-something (the book kindly hints that when you're in your thirties you're 'old') searching for a boyfriend and complaining about her weight is so boring, so unoriginal.  Yeah, 130 pounds is terribly overweight, isn't it?  This book makes women look like cry babies with nothing better to do than feel sorry for themselves.  Worse yet, there's a sequel coming.  Oh boy...
