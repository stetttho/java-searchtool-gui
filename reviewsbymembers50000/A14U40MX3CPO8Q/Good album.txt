 This album has been collecting dust in my house for well over a year now, so recently I decided to give it a listen. Despite the sometimes off-beat lyrics and less than charming vocals, this is a great album. Wilco has a sound of their own and this disc was definately a surprise. Personal favourites include She's A Jar, I'm Always In Love and How To Fight Loneliness.
