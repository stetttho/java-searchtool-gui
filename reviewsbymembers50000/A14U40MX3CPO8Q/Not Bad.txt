 Alanis Morissette's second album is definitely an improvement over her self-titled (minus the Morissette) debut. Now is the Time still features corny love songs like Big Bad Love and Rain, but the album also features a more mature side of Alanis. Songs like No Apologies and (Change Is) Never a Waste of Time are a little more introspective and her singing is great. While nothing can compare to Morissette's Jagged Little Pill masterpiece, she was certainly heading in the right direction with Now is the Time. An enjoyable listen!
