 It's pretty hard to pick a favourite Harry Potter book of mine, but "Order of the Phoenix" is definitely a contender.  The book has more twists and turns than the previous books and it will certainly keep you interested throughout the entire 768 pages (the Canadian and British versions have fewer pages).  I cannot wait for the sixth book of the series!
