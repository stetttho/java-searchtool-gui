 I really can't describe how amazing this album is.  It's hauntingly beautiful, thanks to the amazing songwriting and voice of Kathy Fisher.  If "I Will Love You" doesn't make you cry, I don't know what will.  This album has changed my life and has given me hope that there is actually good music out there.  A must for all fans of female singer/songwriters!
