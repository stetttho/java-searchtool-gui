 Many of todays popular teen shows like Dawson's Creek try to deal realistically with what the average teenager goes through.  Unfortunately, the cast members (not to mention pathetic student/teacher affairs) are too  pretty for anyone to take the show seriously.  Degrassi Junior High was a  show that told the truth.  All the characters were different but none were  perfect.  This show was shocking, funny, emotional, all without gorgeous  stars.  Maybe if Dawson's Creek took a good look at what made Degrassi such  a huge success in Canada they could perhaps touch the same nerve with more  people that the Degrassi shows did to me.
