 After becoming a Rosanne Cash earlier this year due to her new album, I decided to purchase all of her earlier work and I was completely blown away. I can't say she's ever released a bad album and "Interiors" is arguably her finest work to date. It's sparingly produced, full of passionate vocals and amazing lyrics. It's just a shame Rosanne's career after "King's Record Shop" has been largely ignored and undiscovered.
