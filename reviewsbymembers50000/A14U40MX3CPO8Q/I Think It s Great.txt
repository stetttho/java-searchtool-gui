 My friend bought this cd for me, as I was a little hesitant to get it myself.  Why?  Probably because the pairing of Dave Matthews and Glen Ballard doesn't seem right.  I enjoy Ballard's work with Alanis Morissette, but overall I find his production to be too much.  Anyway, I found the end result of this pairing to be great.  While there are no ten minute songs, this album has more passion then DMB's previous efforts.  Maybe I am stupid for thinking so, but that's what I get out of this record.  The Space Between is beautiful, as is Mother Father and If I Had It All.  For Dave's next album he should work with Steve Lillywhite again.  At least we won't have to hear Glen Ballard's overblown keyboard work.  Other than that, this album is great.
