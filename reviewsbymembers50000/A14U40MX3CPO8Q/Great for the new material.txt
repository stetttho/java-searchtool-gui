 The new material is great, especially Dear God, (who thought she knew how to scream) Gloomy Sunday,(excellent, excellent vocals) as well as covers of Gordon Lightfoot's Song For A Winter's Night and Joni Mitchell's Blue.   This album mainly consists of Solace or Solace-era material, so it's mainly  for the Sarah freaks.  It's great to hear new material from Sarah, though I  could do without all the remixes.
