 I've come to the painful conclusion that this is a solid Sarah album.  I'm still standing by my previous (and now deleted) review in regards to being sick and tired of Sarah rehashing her songs, but I'm enjoying this record immensely.  With the exception of the horrible "Just Like Me", all of the remixes are excellent and interesting to listen to.  My favourite is "Answer" followed by "World on Fire", "Dirty Little Secret", "Stupid", "Fallen" and "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy".
