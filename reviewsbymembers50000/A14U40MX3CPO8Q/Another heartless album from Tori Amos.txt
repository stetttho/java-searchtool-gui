 Here we go again, folks:  yet another dismal, heartless release from Tori Amos.  I shouldn't be surprised, because her 2001 release, "Strange Little Girls", was just an excuse to fulfill her contract with Atlantic Records.  I liked "Strange Little Girls" for what it was, but I can't believe that Tori has come out with "Scarlet's Walk", an album full of cliches and recycled material.  The whole concept of this album is quite ridiculous:  Tori thought she'd be treading new territory by writing an album about a woman's journey through the USA.  Gasp, how original!  To make things worse, all of the songs sound the same!  Tori's production adds nothing new and she is clearly running out of song-writing and production ideas.  There are some bright spots, however.  The albums first single, "A Sorta Fairytale", is a lovely, if not overlong song.  "Carbon" is also quite nice, but it also sounds like most everything she's ever done.  "Your Cloud", "Virginia", "Wednesday", and "Taxi Ride" are also good, but offer nothing new.  Tori Amos seems quite content to release albums when she clearly has dried up every idea in her.  I hope Tori will take a long, long break and then come out with an album that will be refreshing and original.
