 Amanda Marshall may be unknown in the United States, but she's a star here in Canada.  With Tuesday's Child, Amanda follows the same routine as her debut, but this album has a little more edge.  Shades Of Grey is amazing and I also enjoy Ride.  The only song I don't like is Right Here All Along.  If I Didn't Have You is nice, but Amanda goes overboard with her vocals.  All in all, a great album!
