 After listening to this so-called tribute to Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, it sure did remind me of how talented a singer Alanis is.  Her unique vocals are unmatched and this "tribute" album proves that.  This album is clearly a joke or a sincere effort to honor Alanis made by some untalented singers.  You Oughta Know, Joining You and Right Through You are hilarious, though So Pure and That I Would Be Good are decent.  If you're a huge Alanis Morissette fan, skip this!  This is a terrible effort!
