 I had no idea who Miranda Lee Richards was until I was browsing through amazon.com, trying to find some new singers. As usual, I didn't think much of the song clips I heard but I changed my mind when I heard "Ella", which is amazingly beautiful. The song "Seven Hours" is also amazing, with great guitar work. Miranda has a beautiful and soothing voice and this album definately showcases her voice perfectly. Check her out!
