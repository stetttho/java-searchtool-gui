 Just what we need: another compilation of women's music.  I love female singer/songwriters, but this collection is incredibly boring.  Sarah McLachlan sounds beautiful on Unchained Melody but it will most likely put people to sleep.  I Know by Sarah Sleen is beautiful as well, but overall this collection is boring.
