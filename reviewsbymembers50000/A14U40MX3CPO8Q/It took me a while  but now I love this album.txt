 I heard "If I Fall" on the radio numerous times in 1999 and I just had to get "Passenger". However, I pretty much hated the record and tossed it aside to collect dust. I decided to give it another try and I fell in love with it. Tara has an absolutely gorgeous voice, especially on "Dry Land". I am glad I gave this album another try because now it's one of my favorite albums of all time.
