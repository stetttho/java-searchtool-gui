 I recently rented "Harrison's Flowers" and I didn't know what to expect with it. I must say I was definitely impressed! Despite the silly plot and bad performance by Andie MacDowell, this film is incredibly emotional and the film did a great job a re-creating the war scenes. Look for Adrien Brody and David Strathairn in wonderful performances.
