 By now, everyone can name a couple of Sarah McLachlan songs. From the depressing "Angel" to the more upbeat "Building a Mystery", Sarah McLachlan has done well for herself in the past few years. However, there was a time, especially in the USA, when Sarah McLachlan wasn't well-known. Sarah's 1991 album "Solace" made Sarah a star in Canada, but failed to make waves in the USA. This EP, simply called "Live", was recorded in Toronto in 1992 at the end of her "Solace" tour. Everyone of the songs on here are from "Solace" with the exception of "Ben's Song", a ballad from her 1988 debut "Touch". This is Sarah McLachlan at her best, folks. There was no huge hype surrounding her and this album showcases the Sarah longtime fans miss. My favourite songs are "Lost", "Black" and "I Will Not Forget You."
