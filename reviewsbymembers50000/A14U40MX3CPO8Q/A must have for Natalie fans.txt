 If you're a casual Natalie fan or are just getting into her music, stick with the original Tigerlily.  If you are a huge fan of the woman with one of the most beautiful voices in popular music today, get this!  In my opinion, Tigerlily is Natalie's weakest album (I love Ophelia and Motherland equally) but it's still an amazing piece of work and the bonus songs are a great addition to this great album!  The original version of Tigerlily rates a 4 out of 5 but this special bonus edition rates a perfect 5.
