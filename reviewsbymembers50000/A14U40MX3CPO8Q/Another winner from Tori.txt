 At first I was disappointed that Tori's new album would be a collection of covers and not original material, but after hearing Strange Little Girls, my disappointment went away.  The album is generally mellow, with the exception of Strange Little Girl (brilliant) and Heart of Gold (which I can't stand).  My favorite song is Time, which is absolutely beautiful.  My only complaint is that Tori's voice doesn't have the power it once had.  She sounds like she's singing in whispers and when she does try to sing in a powerful tone her voice is hoarse and tired.  If you're new to Tori Amos this isn't the album to buy, but longtime fans who are open to hearing songs Tori didn't write should be happy with this.
