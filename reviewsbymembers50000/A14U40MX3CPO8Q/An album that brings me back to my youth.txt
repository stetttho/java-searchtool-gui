 I started to get into a-ha's music in the early 1990's, thanks to the popular song Take On Me. I ordered the album and became hooked on it. All of the songs are great (especially The Sun Always Shines on TV and Take On Me) and this cd is not to be missed. So what if this band may not be "cool" to listen to? Great music is great music and it will always persevere.
