 Despite the fact that 10,000 Maniacs have rarely released a bad song, get this single for "Sally Ann", which is one of the most beautiful and haunting songs I've ever heard.  Natalie's beautiful voice and Rob's amazing guitar playing are just two reasons why this song is so good.  All of the other tracks are great, but "Sally Ann" makes this single worth getting.
