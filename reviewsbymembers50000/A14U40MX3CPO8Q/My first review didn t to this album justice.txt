 I cannot BELIEVE that I gave a 4 star rating for Sarah Harmer's You Were Here!  I've been listening to the album almost non-stop!  Every song on here is great, particularily Basement Apartment and Lodestar.  Sarah has a beautiful voice and such creative and moving lyrics like no one else.  I have the honor of seeing Sarah live in concert in December and I cannot wait to be blown away even more by her talent.  Get this album now!
