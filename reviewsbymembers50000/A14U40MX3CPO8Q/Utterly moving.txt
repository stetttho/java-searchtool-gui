 Summer Sisters is the story of two girls who form the kind of friendship we all wish for.  Yes there are parts that are sexually explicit, but Judy Blume writes it with honesty, without being too graphic.  The character are  well drawn and you begin to feel as though you're there with them, growing  up and discovering new things.  I found it lagged a bit at a certain point,  but I still give my praise for Summer Sisters.
