 I knew I would hate this film even before I saw it.  Why?  Because it's trying to be like Titanic but it doesn't even come close.  First of all, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet made the audience believe they are in love and that is not the case with Pearl Harbor's stupid love triangle.  Ben Affleck is a terrible actor and Kate Beckinsale does a good job of being one of the worst actresses of our time.  Josh Hartnett does what he can with the poorly written role he was given, but the only good performance comes from Cuba Gooding, Jr.  His performance was emotional and amazing, but that was the only good thing about this film.  I hope everyone involved with this film are ashamed of it.  That's how BAD this movie is.
