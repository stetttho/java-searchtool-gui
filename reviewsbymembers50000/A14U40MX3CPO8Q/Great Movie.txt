 The Virgin Suicides has definately grown on me.  After my first viewing, I thought that this movie was silly and that it didn't reflect the lives of teenagers.  After my second viewing, I came to love this movie.  All of the actors are great, especially Josh Hartnett (see him in this rather than Pearl Harbor) and James Woods.  This is a great movie, though not for everyone.
