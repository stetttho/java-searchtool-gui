 While I am not a real fan of this type of music, I must say this latest release from the Backstreet Boys is quite enjoyable.  These five men are wonderful singers and are just beginning their crusade to write more songs  as well (which should throw them apart from other 'boy bands').  "I  Want It That Way" is a catchy and fun song, while "Show Me The  Meaning Of Being Lonely" is well sung yet somewhat depressing, though  high in meaning.  Other gems are "I Need You Tonight",  "Don't Wanna Lose You Now" and "Spanish Eyes".  I only  hope, however, that the guys can steer further away from these love songs  and shock us with something fresh.  Still, this is a good piece of music.
