 Mae Moore's music is incredibly uplifting, despite all of the tragedy this young woman has encountered in her life. She has a lovely, unique voice and songs that make you think. I can't think of anyone to compare her to since she has her own sound. If you stumble across a Mae Moore album, do yourself a favour and get it.
