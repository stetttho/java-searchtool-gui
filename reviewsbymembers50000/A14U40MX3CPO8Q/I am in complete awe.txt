 Wow!  This video from Tori Amos (possibly the most talented yet under rated artist of current times) is simply phenomenal.  I have never seen her play live and this video confirms praise for her live performances.  She  starts off slowly with "Beauty Queen/Horses" and eventually goes  on to her more familiar songs.  Tori's facial expressions are classic, and  she leaves the audience in awe with her beautiful voice, wonderful piano  playing.  I cannot say much else about this except BUY IT if you're a Tori  fan.  If you aren't, well you just won't understand what true talent is.
