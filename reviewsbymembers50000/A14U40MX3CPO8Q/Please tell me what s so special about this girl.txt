 Yes, Vanessa Carlton can play the piano. Yes, she can write her own songs. However, she cannot sing worth a dime and her debut album is nothing short of boring. The lovely single "A Thousand Miles" is the best track here, while "Ordinary Day" is a close second. Other than the songs previously mentioned, "Be Not Nobody" is full of weak songwriting and production that almost tries to be like "Little Earthquakes" by Tori Amos. I do give Vanessa credit for writing every song but one on this album, but I still fail to see why she's so popular.
