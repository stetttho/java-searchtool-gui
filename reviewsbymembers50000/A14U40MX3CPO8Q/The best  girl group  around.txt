 I loved The Bangles growing up and I still do.  Their music is timeless and it is always a joy to listen to them.  My absolute favorite song by them is Going Down to Liverpool which, in my opinion, does not get the praise it deserves.  If you love this group or are just a casual listener, get Greatest Hits!
