 Lifehouse broke out in 2001 with their single "Hanging By a Moment" and then they seemed to disappear from the spotlight. With no other hit singles from their 2000 debut, I figured they'd become one hit wonders. Even though I am skeptical that this album will sell well, the band has managed to put out another great album. I think the albums first single "Spin" is much better than "Hanging By a Moment" but I am obviously in a minority. My absolute favourite song on the album is "Wash" - Jason's voice is so emotional. I really do love "Stanley Climbfall" but the band failed to try something new with their new album. This almost sounds like a continuation of their first album and I was expecting a bit of a twist. Still, this is a wonderful album and I hope the masses will be able to appreciate it as well.
