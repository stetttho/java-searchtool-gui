 I heard through many people that this book was nonsence and that I shouldn't buy it, but unfortunately I did.  Judith's "biography" about Sarah gives us more of a laugh than factual information about the  Canadian musician.  The author spends more time writing about conversations  involving her than actually allowing us to know something interesting about  Sarah and her love and passion for music.  However, I did like all of  Judith's comments about Sarah having one of the most beautiful voices in  music.  Now THAT'S a fact.  Probably the only one in the book.
