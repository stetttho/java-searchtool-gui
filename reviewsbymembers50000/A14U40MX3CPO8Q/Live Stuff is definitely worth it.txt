 I've never seen Holly McNarland live even though she came to Ottawa recently, but "Live Stuff" is a brief example of how amazing Holly is live! Her voice can be powerful one minute and calm the next but it's always beautiful. This EP is worth it for her cover of "In the Air Tonight" alone. Hopefully Holly will gain more mainstream success in the United States soon!
