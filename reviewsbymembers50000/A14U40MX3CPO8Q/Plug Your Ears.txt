 Mariah Carey is one of the most egotistical singers in the industry today.  To be fair, I loathe rival Whitney Houston's music and just about every other woman who can't write their own songs or play an instrument.  I cannot stand it when women scream in what is meant to be a love song.  Mariah Carey has given new meaning to plugging your ears during a bad song, since every single song she's ever had (well besides Hero, which is gorgeous) stinks.  I'd rather spend my money on Britney Spears.
