 I didn't like AYTYKWLA at first but after listening to it numerous times I've grown to love it!  It still ranks as my least favourite Dishwalla album but it does feature their best song of all time, Until I Wake Up.  I'm glad I gave And You Think... another chance because it's yet another great album from a terribly underrated band.
