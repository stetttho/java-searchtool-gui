 I was hoping "The Pilot's Wife" would be an enjoyable read and not one I couldn't wait to finish.  Anita Shreve's writing is so predictable and boring that you can't wait to actually put the book down.  I know this review isn't exactly great, but there isn't much to say about such a poorly written and boring novel.
