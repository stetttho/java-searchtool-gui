 Tori's debut album is so amazing.  Every song is beautiful and rich with feeling and emotion.  The song "Me And A Gun" is one of the most chilling of songs, especially since it's just Tori and her stunning voice.   "Winter" and "China" are two lovely ballads, while the  up-tempo "Tear In Your Hand" is also enjoyable.  If you want an  album that is personal, emotional, and just great to listen to, listen to  this one, or any of Tori's releases.
