 I first saw Chantal Kreviazuk in 1997 at the NAC Opera in Ottawa opening for Amanda Marshall and I was blown away by her beautiful voice.  I rushed out to buy her cd "Under These Rocks and Stones" and fell in love  with it.  Now, with her second cd "Colour Moving and Still",  Chantal Kreviazuk proves she's one of the most talented singer/songwriters  to come along in a while.  From the meloncholy "Blue" to the hit  single "Before You", Chantal has created an album of true beauty  that will definately find a place in your heart.  Definately one of my  favorite albums.
