 I am a sucker for Tom Lord-Alge's mixes of Sarah's songs and this was the reason I purchased this CD. His radio mix of "Fallen" is better than the original and it's worth the price of this CD alone. As for the other tracks, the live version of "Answer" is lovely and the piano version of "Hold On" is excellent as well (despite the fact that this song is on "The Freedom Sessions").
