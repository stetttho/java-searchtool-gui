 Thanks to the mega-hit "All You Wanted", Michelle Branch has enjoyed commercial success with her debut album, "The Spirit Room". While she may write her own songs and play guitar, most of the songs on this CD offer up nothing new and are as catchy as can be. The difference, though, is that Michelle proves that having a hit song doesn't mean you have to have manufactured vocals and snappy dance moves. I think that Michelle has great potential as a songwriter and only once does she show how great she can be, on the song "Drop in the Ocean". While this album isn't spectacular, it's an entertaining one and it shows the promise of this young woman.
