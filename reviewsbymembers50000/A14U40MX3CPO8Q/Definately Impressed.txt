 The highlight of both of Tara MacLean's albums is her voice, which is absolutely beautiful and full of range and emotion. However, "Silence", Tara's debut album, is quite different from her second album. It sort of reminds me of Jewel's debut album in the sense that there is little production and it is full of ballads and haunting lyrics. I don't know if "Silence" is as good as "Passenger" (that album took me forever to like) but "Silence" is an album that definately needs to be heard.
