 Boys For Pele was the second Tori cd I bought, and like most people, I was disappointed.  I only liked a few songs and then just paid my attention towards her other cd's.  However, I decided to give it a chance.  Today I  listened to it in its whole and was blown away.  This album makes you think  about what she's saying.  Her lyrics are not so confusing as they force you  to read into them and try to understand what she is saying  Tori is a  musical genius that isn't for the mass music population.  She does it for  her art and inspires people along the way.
