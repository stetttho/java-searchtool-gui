 By now most of you have heard the music from Dragon on various TV commercials.  Even though it's been used too much, that's still no reason  to not pick this CD up.  Randy Edelman has created a score that suits the  movie perfectly.  Perhaps his best work to date (much better than his  compositions for The Last of the Mohicans where he was outshined by Trevor  Jones).  If you loved the film, buy the soundtrack!
