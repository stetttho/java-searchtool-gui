 Even though Jeff is no longer with us, his music still lives on and "Grace" is enough proof of his talent and passion to music.  Jeff's voice was absolutely beautiful, radiant, and powerful.  I haven't heard such a haunting vocal performance as I have on "Hallelujah" and "The Last Goodbye" and those two songs make the album worth it.  The entire album is amazing and all of the songs are great, but it's just a shame he wasn't given the chance to amaze us with more wonderful albums.
