 Hopefully Britney Spears and all of the other bubblegum pop acts will disappear in the next few years (how about in the next few days) but that isn't likely to happen (of course my predictions are always wrong).  I don't expect an 11-year-old to listen to music with any meaning, so they're off the hook.  As for the rest of you, there is no hope if you're spending your days listening to this talentless Madonna wannabe (and it's not like Madonna is a great singer either, but at least and co-writes and co-produces her own material).  Oh and I can hardly wait for her acting career.  But then again, her music career is already an act.
