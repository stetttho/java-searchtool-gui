 Ophelia is probably the first record where Natalie Merchant is completely in control of everything. Her first solo album Tigerlily was good but it seemed as though Natalie was holding back. Now, on Ophelia, she completely lets loose and this video is a wonderful companion to the epic album. Natalie isn't exactly a capable actress and I hope she never gets further involved in acting, but the amount of passion and heart she put into this project makes you forget that she isn't an actress. Natalie is simply telling the story of Ophelia from another perspective and this video more than works. I have never been so fascinated with an artist like I have with Natalie. Her records don't soar to the top of the charts and she isn't on every magazine cover, but she shares with us what she does best, which is creating beautiful and inspiring music.
