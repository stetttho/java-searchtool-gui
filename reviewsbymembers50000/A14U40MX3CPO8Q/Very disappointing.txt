 Considering Sarah McLachlan (after milking us fans with the same songs for so long) is taking a break, Nettwerk Productions probably thought "let's make a Sarah # 2".  They did.  Well, sort of.  This cd is  dull and Tara rarely uses her voice in an expressive way so the listener  can become interested in her songs.  Lyrically, she's weak as well.   Musically it's good and she can have a good voice, as she shows in the  wonderful "If I Fall".  I won't say to pass on Tara MacLean, but  if she becomes popular I hope Nettwerk doesn't milk us with her like they  did Sarah "I have no new songs" McLachlan.
