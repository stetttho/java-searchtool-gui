 This is one of my favorite Sarah songs, so when I found this single I had to have it for the live version.  All I can say is that this is one of her greatest (and under rated songs) compositions and any new Sarah fan has to  have this.  "Gloomy Sunday" showcases her vocal range and the  live version of "Drawn to the Rhythm" is superb.  Thanks Sarah  for this wonderful song!
