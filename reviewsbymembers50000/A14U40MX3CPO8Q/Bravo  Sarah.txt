 Even though I have already reviewed this album, I just had to review it again since I didn't do it justice.  Fumbling Towards Ecstasy is a poetic journey through Sarah McLachlan's deepest and most personal thoughts.  As  in all of her albums, she bares her soul in her music and proves she is one  of the most talented singer/songwriters of our time.  From the rocking  Possession to the beautiful and uplifting title track, Fumbling Towards  Ecstasy is an incredible journey to be taken time and again.  Sarah's  beautiful voice and songwriting skills are magical and so is this album.   Highly recommened.
