 I didn't think it was possible, but the second installment of Harry Potter's adventures is even better than the Philosopher's Stone (which is the real title).  I have read all four books and I cannot wait for the fifth book to be released.  Even though these books are geared towards little kids, adults alike will enjoy the tales of Harry Potter.
