 Sandra Bullock gets into a car accident, is sentenced to 28 days in rehab, goes to rehab, everyone hates her, she might get kicked out, then everyone loves her and she leaves rehab all happy and her problems are long gone.  This formula is so predictable, yet so wrong.  This movie tries to add a few laughs with a gay character, but I don't think this is the type of movie that should be generating any kind of laughs.  I didn't like this movie from the start and ended up laughing at it instead of walking away from it knowing that I've learned something.
