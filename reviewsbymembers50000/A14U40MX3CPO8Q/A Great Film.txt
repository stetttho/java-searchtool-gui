 I can't begin to understand why this film was ignored by audiences everywhere, but I am glad I had the opportunity to watch this film.  Love Field is about a woman obsessed with Jackie Kennedy and she has to meet her when she and JFK arrive at the Dallas airport.  Later on in the picture, Michelle Pfeiffer's character leaves her husband and on the way meets a father and his daughter and befriends them.  It may seem like a 'simple' movie, but Love Field is a touching film worth your time.
