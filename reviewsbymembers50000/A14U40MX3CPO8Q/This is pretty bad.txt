 While Alanis Morissette isn't one of the most powerful singers out there, she sure can sing when she wants to and this CD is an embarrassment to her talent.  The music is decent but the singer is absolutely awful!  Buy either Alanis Morissette's "Jagged Little Pill" or "Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie".
