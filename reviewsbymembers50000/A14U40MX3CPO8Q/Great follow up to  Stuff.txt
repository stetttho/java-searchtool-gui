 Holly McNarland took five years to release a follow-up to "Stuff" and in that time I wondered if she was ever going to release a new album. Thankfully, she did and "Home is Where My Feet Are" is a masterpiece! Most of the songs are slow and beautifully sung and exceptionally produced. While "Stuff" was a great album, I have to say that Holly's new album is wondeful!
