 Many of today's artists release a concert video/DVD, yet Alanis Morissette has added her own special touch to this one.  Containing all of her beloved songs off of "Jagged Little Pill", this video not only features  Alanis and her tight band perform to an adoring audience, but also how she  coped with the recent celebrity and adoration of her music.  The live  performances are incredibly strong, especially the heart-tugging "Mary  Jane".  This video is not only great for the performances, but it also  sheds light on this amazing and talented Canadian singer/songwriter.
