 I was foolish enough to pay $18.99 (BEFORE taxes) for this at Starbucks thinking I'd once again fall in love with Morissette's classic "Jagged Little Pill" album. Instead of enjoying her acoustic spin on her breakthrough CD I was bored to tears with the bland arrangements and horrible singing. Alanis has lost what little passion she had left and it's quite obvious that is a filler album and not an ode to the album that made her one of the most influential singers in recent history.
