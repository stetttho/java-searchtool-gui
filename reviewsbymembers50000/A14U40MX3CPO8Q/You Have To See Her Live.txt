 I saw Chantal in 1997 when she was opening for Amanda Marshall. I was amazed by this woman's voice and talent. I bought Under These Rocks And Stones the next day and was a little disappointed. Her voice isn't as beautiful as it is live (same with her second release) and the album loses Chantal's energy and passion, but all in all this is a great album (better than her first, IMO). She reminds me of Tori Amos (in terms of piano skills) though without Tori's strange and just silly lyrics. My favorite songs are God Made Me, Surrounded, and Wayne. If you like Sarah McLachlan, the wonderful Natalie Merchant or any of those Lilith artists, you'll more than likely enjoy Chantal's music.
