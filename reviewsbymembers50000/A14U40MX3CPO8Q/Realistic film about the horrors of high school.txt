 "Why do you hate me?" asks Dawn, a junior high outcast.  "Because you're... ugly," replies her classmate, in one of the most heart-wrenching scenes in "Welcome to the Dollhouse".  Heather Matarazzo plays Dawn Wiener, a junior high school student with no friends and parents who favour her younger sister Missy.  Dawn is constantly harassed, especially by Brandon, a boy involved in drugs.  After enduring what she does at school, Dawn comes home to her family - a family that could really care less about her.  During the course of the film, I couldn't stop feeling sorry for Dawn because, like most people who can relate to this movie, I was sort of like Dawn when I was in school.  Heather Matarazzo perfectly portrays Dawn in a way that most other actresses probably couldn't.  She brings realism and honesty to the role and keeps the movie afloat during the last twenty minutes when it gets a bit silly.  All in all, "Welcome to the Dollhouse" has been able to convey the realities of high school, unlike some recent movies and television shows.  This is a MUST for anyone who didn't have the greatest time in school.
