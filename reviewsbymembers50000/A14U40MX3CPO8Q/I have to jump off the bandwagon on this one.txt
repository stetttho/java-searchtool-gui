 The song Here With Me compelled me to get this album though I wish I didn't. The songs all sound the same: same boring synthesizers and dull vocals. There is no range at all on this CD and the lyrics are basically all about lost love. Dido has a lot of potential but I think this release is boring, uninspired, and not too different from what's already polluting the air waves.
