 When Natalie Merchant left 10,000 Maniacs in 1993, she made a huge mistake as far as I'm concerned. Although I do enjoy her solo albums, especially Ophelia and Live in Concert, nothing she has done as a solo artist can possibly compare to the work she produced with 10,000 Maniacs. This album is just one of the too few examples of what a great band they were when Merchant was the lead singer. This album has more of a folky sound than their later releases, probably due to John Lombardo's strong influence on the sound (he wrote most of the music) but this album can rock out as well. Songs like Scorpio Rising and My Mother the War are among the best tracks on the album, along with Lilydale (one of the best Robert Buck/Natalie Merchant compositions, IMO) and Cotton Alley. The only bad thing about this album is the fact that it's hard to figure out anything Merchant is singing. Her voice is sometimes overbearing, like on Arbor Day and Just as the Tide Was a Flowing but that's only a minor complaint since Merchant has gone on to become one of the best vocalists out there, IMO. I highly recommend this album for Natalie Merchant/10,000 Maniacs fans or for those interested in hearing the beginning of a terribly underrated band who deserved to have a much longer career with Natalie Merchant at the helm.
