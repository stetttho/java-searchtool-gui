 My parents picked up this book for me last year while they were in England because they knew I enjoyed the Harry Potter series.  I was pretty skeptical that this book would be as good as Harry and I was right.  However, "Artemis Fowl" is an entertaining adventure that I never wanted to end.  The writing isn't what I consider to be exceptional, but Eoin Colfer has written an incredibly entertaining book that is sure to please children and even adults like myself.
