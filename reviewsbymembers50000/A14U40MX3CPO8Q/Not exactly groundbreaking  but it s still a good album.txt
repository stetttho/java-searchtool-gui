 Train's album Drops Of Jupiter is a fun and solid album. All of the tracks are great and perfectly performed. However, this album doesn't offer us anything new. These are typical rock/pop songs that are fit for radio and these songs certainly don't push any limits. Still, this album is good and a fun listen.
