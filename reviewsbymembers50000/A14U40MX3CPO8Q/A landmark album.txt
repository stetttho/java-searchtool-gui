 I purchased this cd in 1996 and fell in love with it. For two years I always had it in my cd player and I bought all the singles and taped every performance on tv I could of Alanis Morissette. Three years later, while I still enjoy this cd, I have lost my connection with it, which is what made it such hit in the first place. There's no point in describing this cd since we all know it by now. All I can say is listen to it. Listen to what Alanis is saying because relating to Alanis is what got me through some of the toughest times.
