 A few years ago my mother tried to get me to listen to Natalie Merchant,  but for some reason I was reluctant.  I thought she had a beautiful voice  though I wasn't at all interested.  However, I picked up "Live In  Concert" and was moved.  Such a beautiful and pure voice.  I will  never doubt this woman again.  Go and get this for some true talent.
