 I bought this album the day it came out, mostly for the version of Building A Mystery, which sounds like every other live version of that song.  I admit that I don't even like most of these artists, but I enjoy every artist when they play live and on this compilation disc of the first Lilith Fair, it just doesn't work.  Meredith Brooks' song Wash My Hands is good, but her singing -or lack of- completely ruins it.  The only songs on here that are worthwhile are Water Is Wide (gorgeous), Hold Me Jordan, Mississippi, and Wash My Hands.
