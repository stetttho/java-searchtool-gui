 I cannot describe what a powerful force Tori Amos is.  She is highly underrated, yet remarkably talented.  While this cd is different from the other Tori cd's, it's still an amazing effort.  The songs create a mood;  Tori lets you into her most personal and deepest thoughts.  Her voice is  amazing as is the whole cd.  The live version of "Waitress" is a  gem, while "1, 000 Oceans" still makes me cry.  Tori is a true  artist.
