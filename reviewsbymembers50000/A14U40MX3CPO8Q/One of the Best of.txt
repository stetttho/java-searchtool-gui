 Benicio Del Toro gives an amazing performance in this film about the war against drugs.  I usually do not enjoy movies in which the story jumps back and forth between characters, but this film works.  The movie is engrossing from start to finish, especially the final shot which I think is a great way to end the movie.  I highly recommend Traffic!
