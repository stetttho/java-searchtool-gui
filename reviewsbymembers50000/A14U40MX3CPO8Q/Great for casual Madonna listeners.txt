 I am not a huge Madonna fan, although I enjoy 1998's "Ray of Light" and many of her hits.  "Live to Tell" is one of my favorite songs of all time and that was more than enough to get me to buy this.  I also like "Crazy For You" and "Like a Prayer".  Some of Madonna's cornier songs are also enjoyable, such as "Like a Virgin" and "Material Girl".  If you're a casual listener of Madonna's music, this is the perfect album to get!
