 Amanda Marshall's debut album is one of a kind.  Despite the fact that she wrote only one song and co-wrote two, Amanda sings these songs as if she wrote them herself.  Her powerful voice draws the listener in and it's almost as if she's singing to you.  The first six songs were hits in Canada and Trust Me (This Is Love) also had considerable airplay despite not being released as a single.  Beautiful Goodbye is haunting and Dark Horse is just beautiful.  Tuesday's Child is great, but this CD is even better.
