 I didn't have high expectations for this film, given the fact that most books turned films are never great to begin with.  Even though I found the film to be faithful to the book, this was poorly acted by Natalie Portman - she had none of the charm that Novalee had in the book and that is quite unfortunate.  Ashley Judd does a fine job as Lexie and Stockard Channing was wonderful as Sister Husband, but overall this film was a huge disappointment.  I'd only recommend this to someone looking for 2 hours of entertainment and nothing else.
