 Fumbling Towards Ecstasy is an album full of raw emotion and beauty.  The first track, Possession, gives the listener a taste for what's next to come.  However, since it's Sarah McLachlan, only beautiful music can be  found on this cd.  Fear is a spine-tingling track, Hold On grabs at your  heart-strings, and Fumbling Towards Ecstasy is an inspirational song,  highlighted by McLachlan's beautiful vocals.  While this isn't my favorite  Sarah cd, (that goes to either Surfacing or Solace) pick Fumbling Towards  Ecstasy up, as this is pure ecstasy.
