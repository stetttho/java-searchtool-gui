 I stumbled across Bully while watching TV late at night. I assumed it was going to be some lame teen movie we've seen time and time again. I was absolutely wrong! Bully has to be one of the most powerful and disturbing films I've EVER seen. The acting is superb, especially by Leo Fitzgerald and Daniel Franzese. The real star of the film is Nick Stahl as Bobby Kent. While he doesn't look even remotely like the real Bobby Kent, his portrayal is simply amazing. It's a shame his performance was largely overlooked. This film is definitely not for everyone. It's one of those movies you either love or hate. Either way, Bully is a film you won't soon forget.
