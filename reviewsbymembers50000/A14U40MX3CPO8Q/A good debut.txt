 Sarah McLachlan's debut "Touch" is a whimsical and ethereal one.  This was the first time she composed full-length songs (and what a great start).  In comparison to Sarah's later works, "Touch" is a far  cry from them.  However, this album does have its strong points.  Her voice  is beautiful and she shows some superb guitar playing.  The lyrics are  confusing yet show a young woman trying to find her place in the world.   Any teenager with an open mind could relate to this record.  "Out of  the Shadows" and "Vox" are beautiful songs and I wish Sarah  would give them more attention.  If you love Sarah McLachlan and are aware  that she has more albums than "Surfacing", this album will surely  satisfy you.
