 In all honesty, like most over-hyped things I was a skeptic about the Harry Potter novels.  After a friend of mine read the first installment and loved it, I decided to read it for myself - and I am glad I did.  The character's are brilliantly written and it's so action packed that you don't want to put it down.  I am now well on my way to the second book.  Great fun!
