 When I first got this album, I loved it.  Now, two years later, I barely listen to it.  Why?  Because Alanis has managed to put out an uninspired live album with only a few bright spots.  I rarely listen to Alanis now, but that's because I love her music so much.  For me, when I do decide to listen to her, it's a treat because it reminds me of how much I love her music.  Anyway, MTV Unplugged does little for me.  I suppose most unplugged albums are like this because the 10,000 Maniacs release is also uninspired and at times boring (though I prefer it over this one any day).  No Pressure Over Cappuccino is an absolutely gorgeous song with some of Alanis's best lyrics yet.  That I Would Be Good also benefits from the acoustic arrangements, with lovely strings accompanying Alanis's passionate vocals.  The only problem with this song is Alanis's hideous flute playing.  I also like Uninvited, though it suffers a lot without the amazing guitar solo at the end.  I can't possibly give Alanis anything less than three stars and this record does deserve a passing rating, but avoid this if you love the 'harder' sound of Alanis Morissette.  Her new album, Under Rug Swept, is coming out in February 2002 and I can't wait for it.
