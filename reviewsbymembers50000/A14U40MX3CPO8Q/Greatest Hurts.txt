 I'm not the biggest Jann Arden fan, but I do enjoy many of her songs, so naturally a greatest hits album is the perfect choice for me.  I heard 'Never Mind' on the radio and fell in love with it.  Her voice is so soothing and the lyrics are excellent.  I like most of the tracks on here, and if you're an occasional Jann Arden listener, this is the perfect CD.
