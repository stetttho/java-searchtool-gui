 I picked up this album after downloading some clips off the internet, and what a joy it was for me to purchase this cd and love it. Sinead writes wonderful lyrics and melodies, though it's her beautiful voice that stands out. Favorite songs of mine include "No Mermaid", "Loose Ends", "What Can Never Be" and "Hot on Your Trail". If you love beautiful and serene music, Sinead Lohan will give you that and a lot more. A beautiful album.
