 I remember I rented the film "Rudy" and I really had no idea to expect.  I knew it was about football but that was it.  I didn't expect it to become my one of my favourite films, nor did I expect to love the soundtrack so much.  Jerry Goldsmith's score perfectly captures the emotion in the film, especially in track 5 where Rudy tells his girlfriend he's leaving for Southbend and especially in the song "The Final Game", which is one of the most emotional and beautiful scenes in a film I've ever seen - the song accompanies that scene perfectly.  Even if you haven't seen the film, this soundtrack is a must!  I've had this since 1995 and I still listen to it frequently and I can't say that about many CD's.
