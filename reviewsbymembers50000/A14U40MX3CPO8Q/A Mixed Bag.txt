 After hearing the song Yellow numerous times on the radio, I felt compelled to purchase this album. I definately wasn't expecting a hard rock album, though I definately wasn't expecting something as mellow as Parachutes. There is really nothing exceptional I can say about this album. When you're hearing the same monotone songs over and over again it's hard to pick out any one thing. However, there is something about this CD that grabbed me. All of the songs are gorgeous and the production is solid. I do not think that this is a great album, but it's certainly better than most of the [stuff] out there today.
