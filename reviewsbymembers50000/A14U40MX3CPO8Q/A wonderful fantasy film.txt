 Tim Burton does a marvellous job in re-creating the legendary tale of the Headless Horseman.  Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent to Sleepy Hallow to find and capture the Horseman (wonderfully played by Christopher Walken).   The special effects are great, the acting is superb and this is definately  a film that will scare and make you laugh, all at the same time.  One of  the best of 1999.
