 This is definately one of my favorite movies of all time.  While sometimes the film can get a little corny, Jason Scott Lee's acting is phenomenal.  This isn't a text-book copy of Bruce Lee's life, but rather it tells the  viewer about his personality, his love, and his struggles.  This is a  thoroughly entertaining film that honours a true hero.  Lauren Holly is  also excelling as Linda Lee.  Perhaps this is one of her best performances  to date.
