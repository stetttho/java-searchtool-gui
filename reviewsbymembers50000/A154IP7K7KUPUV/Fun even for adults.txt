 The ultimate toy, even for adults.  For those who don't know, Connect Four is a game of skill; the object being to connect four pieces in a row, diagonally, horizontal or vertical. This game is good for younger people because it teaches them to think, to anticipate their opponents next moves and observation so that a checker won't be slid a prime spot. This game is good for adults because it brings back somany memories. Either I'm getting stronger or the material is getting weaker because the version that my niece has seems to be very fragile and the legs are either stuck or hard to get on.  Otherwise a good buy and guaranteed a few hours of fun.
