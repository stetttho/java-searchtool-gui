 When I read the jacket for Fearless Jones I immediately wanted to compare Paris and Fearless to Easy Rawlings and Mouse. The characters seemed to be the same: straight and arrow and the wild guy with L.A. as a backdrop. I have seen the errors of my ways and have gladly welcomed Fearless Jones into my library. Paris Minton is literally minding his own business when trouble in the form of Elana Love comes walking through the door. As Paris and Fearless search for Elana they get caught up in a web of lies and thieves searching for a lost treasure. Set in the 1950's Mosley delivers a great period piece. The characters are developed and they feel "real". Each page left me wanting more. If you are looking for a good mystery and are tired of the same cookie cutter factory drivel that seems to be the norm, here is the book for you.
