 I love this movie!  Yes, the story of Vianne as the scandalous new woman in town who changes the lives of the old stuck in thier way villagers is quite predictable but this is a great, excellent, wonderful feel good movie that is best viewed cuddled with your sweety. Alfred Molina deserved an award as the Count whose obsessions with Vianne almost destroys himself and Johnny Depp is hot as ever as Irish river rat Roux. The DVD extras include a "making of", deleted scenes, the trailed (which in my opinion should not be classified as an extra),  little something about chocolate and a piece about the costumes.   This is a great one to own for us time.
