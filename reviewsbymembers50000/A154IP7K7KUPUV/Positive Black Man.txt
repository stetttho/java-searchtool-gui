 I wanted to really, really like this book and anxiouly tore through every page but after I was done I found myself a bit disappointed.  I enjoyed the positive look at single fatherhood and I appreciated the feelings that the Jackie charater had but I felt that the characters were all extreme: Catherine was a witch without even a smidgeon of humanity and everyone in Terry's camp seemed flawless and darn-near perfect.  Plus the ending was quite predictable. Again I appreciate the positive, fresh look at single fatherhood but would recommend borrowing from a friend.
