 I will never be able to look at the news the same!  After reading This Just In...  I gained a whole new respect for the nightly news and all of the drama that goes on behind the scene.  I found the story and the characters totally believable and I stayed up all night to finish the story.  If you are looking for a light read with positive female role models, this is the book for you.
