 I admit that sometimes I listen to this CD when my daughter is not around.  It's so much fun and I just love some of the theme music (Pooh and Rolie Polie Olie).  I am disappointed that the theme and the Goodbye songs from Bear in the Big Blue House were not on the CD but the songs that are on the CD are pretty good.  I didn't recognize a lot of the songs at first but after multiple listens (and if you have a little one you WILL hear this a lot!) I got know the songs and we enjoy them.  Otherwise this CD is great for dancing to, a car ride or for pre-bedtime music.  My six-year-old niece even requests this when she comes over so this is good music for the family.
