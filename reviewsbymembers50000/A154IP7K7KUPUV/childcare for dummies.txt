 This book is truly a sourcebook for those who have young children and at times feel as if they don't know what to do next with them.  Maxim's book is designed for childcare workers so there are a lot of group activities but the one on one activities serve it's purpose for the only child. The book is quite comprehensive but has indexes for items by age as well as skills.  The price tag made me hesitate but only for a split second.  This was a purchase that I do not regret and look forward to sharing.
