 Two months ago my then 16 month old grabbed this book in Best Buy and would not put it down.  Now two months later she still grabs this book as her favorite.  Full of hidden surprises and colorful pictures this is a great book to introduce shapes, colors, alphabets, counting and opposites.  This is a book that children will not tire of easily as there are so many things to discover and find and again there are just so many pictures to see.
