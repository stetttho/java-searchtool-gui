 My little girl loves this book!  This book features Cookie Monster as he prepares for a dinner party for some of his friends.  The story is told in rhyme and it's full of pictures of Sesame Street characters.  There are a few "interactive" parts whre Cookie Monster addresses the reader.  This is destined to become a quick favorite.
