 When I first picked up Shades of Jade I was drawn in by the cover blurb, "You will not be able to put this book down" (or something like this).  I wasn't sure who the stalker was and I was anxious to get to the end of the story.  However I had an overwhelming desire to skip past the Marissa/Levi predictable love story.  I also couldn't understand why Marissa's friend, Charmaine kept being her friend even after how nasty Marissa treated her. I don't see why this book has so much hype.  It is a thriller but the characters were not really developed or real.
