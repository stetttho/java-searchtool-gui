 This was a Christmas gift for my little girl who was reluctant to start walking.  Within two months my little girl became independent and has been going strong ever since.  This cart is better than a walker because a it gives little ones more freedom to move from place to place. When my little one was smaller she did have a bit of trouble steering and would get frustrated when she would get stuck in a corner or up againt some furniture.  Now that she is older the cart is used to transport her dolls and other various items from room to room. I took a star off for durability because the wheel covers fell off after we took the cart outside and rolled it on the pavement.
