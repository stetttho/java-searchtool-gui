 J.D. Mason's debut novel is for all the sistahs out there who think that abuse doesn't happen to us.  This is the book for all of the women who feel that they can't say "Man please!".I was hooked from the first lines as Ruth describes the abuse and humiliation that she endured FOURTEEN years from a man who was unable to be a man.  I was drawn in to the way Ruth talked to me as she described the years of abuse, how she was broken down to feel as if she was less than nothing.  I felt every hit, my heart beat faster every time Eric was on the scene and I almost wept as Ruth realized that she needed to be free. J.D. Mason doesn't gloss over the issue of abuse and she doesn't make this book "easy".  She addresses the abuse and the healing that Ruth goes through .  The supporting characters were also developed in a way that I could actually identify with some of them and see where they were coming from.   Great book however I was a little disappointed with the the Ruth/Adrian outcome.  (I won't spoil it for those who have not read it.)  Maybe because of what Ruth endured I felt that she needed a different resolution but otherwise this is an excellent, excellent worth the money read. This is a buy your own copy and don't lend it to anyone untrustworthy kind of book.
