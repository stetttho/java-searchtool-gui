 8 Minute Arms is exactly that: 8 minutes of arm exercises with very, very little breaks in between.  This is an excellent tape to add to your collection for the days that you really don't feel like working out (but would feel even worse if you don't) or for the days that you want to go easy and just have to do have do a little something. This tape assumes that the viewer is familiar with the exercises and that you have warmed up beforehand. There is no warmup, Jaime jumps into the program immediately after explaining what types of weight to use.  Each exercise lasts for 30 seconds and the triceps, biceps, upper back and shoulders are targeted.  This tape is challenging for beginners, those who have backslid and someone who wants to get a quick workout with out leaving the house.
