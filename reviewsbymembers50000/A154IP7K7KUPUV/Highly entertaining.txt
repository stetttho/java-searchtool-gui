 This is the original Material Girl. Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell star as nightclub singers and dancers who get caught-up in mistaken identity/ jewel thief plot. The DVD doesn't have too many extras -there is a news reel with the two stars in front of Mann's Chinese theater and a few commercials for other Marilyn DVDs but the songs are fun.
