 Because Omar Tyree is from Philly I admit that I am biased and try and give all of his books a chance.  With Just Say No I found myself not at all as interested in the book as I should have been.  A brief synopsis: Darin Harmon, an outgoing kid befriends shy John Williams.  Although the two are opposite (Darin is into sports and John is into music) they remain friends throughout grade school and high school.  Once in college John comes out of his shell after singing at a talent show and becomes John "Loverboy" Williams.  The book moves along through Darin and John's sometimes rocky, sometimes sweet road to fame and the girls, drugs and drama that goes with success, fame and money. The story seemed to move along at times and I found myself savoring every moment.  There were parts that I couldn't wait to get through and had to force myself to read (the lyrics so some of the songs for example) and that's when I found myself wanting to put the book down in frustration. The inside look at the life of a celebrity was really interesting and I found myself glad that I wasn't on that road but this book did lead me to ask if I could "Just Say No" to the temptations that were avaiable to John and Darin.
