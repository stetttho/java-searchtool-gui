 This is standard Sesame Street, pre-Elmo.  Big Bird is the host of a game show that introduces numbers through clips and songs.  My little one doesn't seem to like thistape, she wanders from the TV whenever it's on but for the child of the '70's this is the tape to have from the king in the castle to the martian girl.
