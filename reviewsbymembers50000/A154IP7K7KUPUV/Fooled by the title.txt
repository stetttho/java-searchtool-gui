 When I learned of a book called Nappily Ever After I thought, "Thank God!  A book for those of us who have true kinks, not the curly 'do that blows in the wind that is the norm of Black characters on TV and in magazines."  I was expecting something new and fresh since the book promised to be a Cinderella story for the rest of us. I am still disappointed by this damn book.  I appreciate that this book was entertainment and I was glad that this wasn't a soapbox to damn those who are still chemically dependent.  However I feel duped  by the title and kept waiting for something, anything that would make me like this book. I should say that when Venus was going through all of the drama of dealing with first getting her hair cut hit close to home. I know what it is like to dramatically change and alter your appearance and what you think others will think.  But there was no more developement and the rest of the characters in the book seemed wooden and stale. Save your money.  Get this from the library.
