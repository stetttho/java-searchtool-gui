 Usually I love Desiree Shapiro and the methods she uses to solve a crime but this book seemed unorganized and I found myself not even caring what the outcome was.  There were side stories about Ellen picking out a wedding dress and somebody giving a party but this was not one of Selma Eichler's best. Don't waste your time.
