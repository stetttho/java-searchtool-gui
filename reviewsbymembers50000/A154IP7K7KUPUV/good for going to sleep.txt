 I had never heard of Goodnight Moon until my niece was born but since then it has become a favorite.  I read this to my little one as a signal that the end of the day is near and it's time for bed.  This book has a lulling quality that is soothing and calming.  At times I still can't see the hype but my little one loves this book so that's all that matters.
