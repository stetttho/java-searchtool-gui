 Undra Biggs wonderful debut book, "When You Look at Me" is (please forgive the tired phrase) a dynamic coming of age story of Tamlyn Blake, 17 year old mother of two and it is also a love story between Tamlyn and hustler Hasaan Corbirth.  Ms. Biggs invites the reader along to hear Tamlyn's thoughts as she grows from naive child to strong woman. What I love best is that Tamlyn could be anyone of us: she came from a good family yet made some bad decisons. The reader is invited along to grow with Tamlyn and experience both joy and pain as she matures.   The style of writing is excellent and tight, unlike other AA works, without the benefit of a tacked on ending.
