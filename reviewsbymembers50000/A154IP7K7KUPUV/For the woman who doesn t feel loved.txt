 I was reluctant to read this book.  I was first introduced to Patty Rice via Somethin Extra and lets just say that book wasn't my bag.  However, "Reinventing the Woman" left me with a wholenew respect for Patty Rice and a chance that I will go back to the first book. This is the story of deceit, betrayal and love.  Not a love story of the usual kind but a story of a woman learning to love herself.  Camille Foster a woman abused by her boyfriend for seven years.  Camille makes a deal with herself to leave the next time the man who says he loves her hits her and flees to the home that she has long since abandoned.  On the road to recovery Camille takes a job with Nora Roberts, a motivational speaker and author of a workshop 'Reinventing the Woman'.  From here Ms Rice weaves a story of a woman longing to be loved, learning to love herself and what it means to reinvent Camille.  There are some loose ends with Camille and the relationship with her abusive boyfriend as well as her relationship with the mother who ignored and shunned her.  I believe (and I hope correctly) that this means that there will be a sequal. The developement of the main characters was pretty good.  I appreciate the fact that Camille wasn't written as someone who automatically was able to turn off her feelings for the man that hurt her.  The supporting characters could have used a bit more developement, especially some of the players in Nora's company and Camille's mother Catherine.  All in all this is a very good read, engrossing and kept me rushingthrough the pages so that I could see what was going to happen next. ~R
