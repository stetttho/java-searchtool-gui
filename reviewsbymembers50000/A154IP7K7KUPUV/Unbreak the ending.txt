 If this movie hadn't come out so soon after "The Sixth Sense" I would not be comparing the two. Since it did, well.... The DVD features were pretty good, excellent in fact especially if you like comic books.  Being a native Philadelphia I would have loved to see a little section on where in Philadelphia the movie was filmed. The movie itself was pretty good. I was disappointed in the ending. Very disappointed with the way M. Night Shyamalan wrapped things up especially since this was supposed to be a good -vs- evil deal. This is a good buy for the extras and to pick apart with couldas, shoulds.
