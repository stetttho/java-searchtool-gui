 Although this phone will not prevent your little one from grabbing your remote and pretending IT'S a phone, this phone is fun to explore sounds, colors and to tweek the senses. This phone is excellent for travel, small enough to fit in diaper bags and easy to carry. There is an on/off switch and volume control to use when the phone (and mommy) need a break and also the phone can be switched from a mode that counts to a mode that teaches words. Worth the money and excellent for visits to the doctor's office.
