 I'm sorry to be so negative but I don't really like this book.  The story seems to long and the pictures are kind of weird.  AFter reading and loving Goodnight Moon, I found this story not at all interesting and it felt like it was just thrown together. My little one loses interest in this book about halfway through so we have never read it in one sitting. Borrow this.
