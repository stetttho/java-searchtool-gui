 Karen Voight really makes this tape. I bought this tape because of all of the hype that was surrounding Elle Macpherson and all reviews saying that this wasa a good workout. I find this tape is excellent for easing back into working out. Don't get me wrong, it is a challenge but after I while it gets a bit easier. The tape has Karen Voight leading Elle through a circuit of cardio and toning. The sections vary between cardio and toning and the exercises are easy and fun, things that don't require a bunch of equipment. Elle Macpherson is a pain in the behind. Her comments were irritating and distracting and I wanted to reach into the televison and smack her silly. At times I thought I saw Karen Voight roll her eyes at her. If you can ignore Elle then this is a good one to own for lazy days.
