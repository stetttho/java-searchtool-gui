 This is an excellent tape if time is not a luxury yet you want a lovely midsection.  Three ten minute sessions works every part of the muscle on your middle.  I would have liked to have a warm up at the beginning on each section; it is such a pain to have to rewind the tape to warm up (if you are so inclined).  Tammy lee's cuing is great and she doesn't have an annoying condescing tone in her voice that usually accompinies most instructors. This is worth the buy.
