 After Joan Hess's last Maggody book I wondered what else Chief Arly Hanks, Ruby Bee and the Buchanon clans could get into and I will say that I am pleased with the latest effort.  Chief Hanks stumbles along the body of a cult member while chaperoning ten of Maggody's future on a retreat.  The rest of the book is the usual fare with adventures of the townfolk of Maggody and Arly solving the crime. As always Joan Hess keeps the antics of Kevin Buchanon, Mrs. Jim Bob and Brother Verber (to name a few) laugh out loud but Arly is not the typical heroine who is always kicking butt and able to solve crime. I did find this book a bit lacking with the Maggody parts.  There didn't seem to be the same development as if they were rushed.  Otherwise an entertaining read.
