 After waking up the past few days and feeling like I slept on a board I popped this tape into the machine to give it a go.  I usually shy away from Yoga, it moves a tad to slow for me, but I found this tape to be relaxing and soothing.  It's only about twenty minutes which is long enough to give a good stretch without getting frustrated and really stretches out your back without trying to have you bent up like a pretzel.  The gentle sounds of the ocean helps guide you along through the tape and Rodney's instruction is good.   To be fair I have to mention that there should be some kind of listing on the box to let the exerciser know what equipment is needed (for this tape a chair and a yoga strap) but otherwise this is a good one to own to loosen up.
