 I love Tamilee Webb's videos.  SHe has excellent cuing, the exercise tapes that she makes are really effective (of course if you are consistent!) and she is very non-threatening.  Legs of STeel is a wonderful change from the usual leg exercises and instead of laying down these exercises are performed using a chair for support while standing. Each area of the thigh and butt (inner, outer, hamstring) is worked with a set of squats in between.  This a a tape in which you will truly feel the burn. My only complaint are the lunges done at the end of the tape.  Since I am not as strong I had to struggle to maintain proper support.  The tape can also be made more difficult with the addition of ankle weights. All in all a good bargain but watch your knees.
