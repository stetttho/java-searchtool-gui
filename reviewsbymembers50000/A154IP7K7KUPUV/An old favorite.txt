 This toy was given to my little girl before she was able to walk independently so in the beginning it was mostly ignored.  Now that my Maddie is walking this is a favorite.  The popping sound that the plastic balls make are a bit noisy and seem extra loud when Maddie decides to play with this toy at 6AM but otherwise this is a good deal.  I think it teaches kids control and it's early prep for vacuuming!
