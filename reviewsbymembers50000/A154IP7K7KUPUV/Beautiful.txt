 Being accustomed to America movies: action, action, little if no plot, and more action, I was blown away by the sheer beauty of this movie. The love story, the scenery and the kick butt fight sequences. This is a great one to own. The DVD features an option to view the film with English dubbed instead of subtitiles. There are other extras such as director commentary and a making of featurette.
