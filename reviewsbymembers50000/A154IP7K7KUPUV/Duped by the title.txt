 I so wanted to like this book. The title and the blurbs that I read promised a good read but when I finally got a chance to read Trisha Thomas's book I couldn't put it down for fear that i may have missed something. The idea that Black women are so identified by the hair on their heads and how they look is an excellent topic. While I didn't expect this book to be a soapbox and a rallying cry against the makers of relaxers I did expect to read a book that had some character developement, a decent outcome and entertaining. Don't waste your money. Get ye to a library. When I learned of a book called Nappily Ever After I thought, "Thank God! A book for those of us who have true kinks, not the curly 'do that blows in the wind that is the norm of Black characters on TV and in magazines." I was expecting something new and fresh since the book promised to be a Cinderella story for the rest of us. I am still disappointed by this damn book. I appreciate that this book was entertainment and I was glad that this wasn't a soapbox to damn those who are still chemically dependent. However I feel duped by the title and kept waiting for something, anything that would make me like this book.
