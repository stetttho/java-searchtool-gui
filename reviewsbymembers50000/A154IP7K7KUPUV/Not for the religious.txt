 This movie is hilarious! It took me a few viewings to actually appreciate he movie but I laugh everytime I watch the movie. Jay (Jason Mewes) steals the show and of course Chris Rock is hilarious. The version that I own is not the deluxe super duper packed one but I still think this is a great movie. This is the story of the search for the scion, Bethany (Linda Fiortino) to stop two angels (matt Damon and Ben Affleck) from returning to heaven.  To really aprreciate the movie watch and enjoy.
