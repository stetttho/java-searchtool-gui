 Maybe I set the bar too high but I cannot understand the hype about A Chocolate Affair.   The book seems to be about...what is this book supposed to be about?  The back of the book reads like it's a juicy "sister friend" book but the words between leaves much to be desired.  I do agree with others who recommend reading Chocolate Star so that one can become familiar with the characters but I cannot say that I would recommend this book at all.  There is more name dropping than plot, no kind of character developement and the writing just seems a bit dry.  There are times that I found myself rushing through the page in an attempt to get to a better part. If you are truly in need of boring yourself or just want to see what's next for Topaz and the gang then get a copy from the library.
