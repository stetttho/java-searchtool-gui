 I really enjoyed the Harris Men and was thrilled to see this sequel but found myself not even caring how this book ended.  There was no character developement, the plot seemed to slow down and stop at certain points and I found myself bored.  These brothers don't seem to know what they want and was it just me or did all three Harris boys have problems with violence?  Borrow this from a library.
