 Lisa Saxton's first novel is a fun, enjoyable read.  The story of selfish, insensitive Jewel Averick and her polar opposite Dee Sweet as they track the mystery of Two-Mile Mclean's baseball mitt.  Each woman has her own reasons fo tracking the glove: Jewel to show her husband that she is not a selfin spoiled person and Dee to show her husband that she is no doormat.  Throw in a couple of gangsters and all bets are off as the race to home plate (I had to throw that in!) heats up. A good read, so much fun, this book will have you laugh out loud, on the edge of your seat and cheering out loud.
