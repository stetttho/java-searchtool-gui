 I am so glad that I borrowed this book from the library instead of buying it.  This was one of the worse books that I have ever read.  I want to applaud Nina Foxx for writing and having her book published but I swear this book was terrible.  The main character, Amber, was a psychologist but she was so dippy and I felt that she had such a damsel in distress attitude.  Why was she so dependent on a man?  Her husband did her wrong and the man she got with was married so you know he couldn't have been about nothing.  Her best friend was a trip.  Why WAS she still friends with Che?   There were so many unanswered questions like what happened when Tyler came back into town?  Why was someone so smart doing so many dumb things?  What was the deal with all of the women hitting on her?  If she was so close to her family why didn't she talk more about the stuff going on in her life?  What was the deal with the color thing?  For an educated woman Amber was really, really ignorant. I love AA fiction but this book seemed to be poorly thought out, rushed towards the end and just all over the place.  Don't waste your time.
