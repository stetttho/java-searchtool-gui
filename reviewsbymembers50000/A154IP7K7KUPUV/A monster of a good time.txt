 In all honesty I don't like Grover from Sesame Street.  I can't really say why but he really irks me.  However I love this book!  From the fact that he is on the copy write page urging young readers to turn away from the boring part to his (over) reactions to each page turn.   This book is best read doing sound effects and pretending to have trouble turning the pages as Grover chains and bricks up the pages. I wish the board book was exactly like the thin paper version but  other than that this book is a great but for your money.
