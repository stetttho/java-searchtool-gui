 Although this book was a slow start for me I was hooked after I got into it.  Norma and Moxi are friends although they are from opposite sides of the track.  Their friendship is put to the when Norma reveals a secret to Moxi.  There is also Moxi's relationship with her teenaged daughter Zadi and how Moxi must learn to let her little girl grow up into the young woman she has become. This was an excellent book.   The characters and situations were real:  Norma's relationship with her son and the feelings that she must confront as she struggles to balance motherhood and her career.  Zadi and the hair drama.  This is a must read for every mother, sister and friend.
