 If my child doesn't grow up with multiple personalities it will be a miracle.  I have found myself calling my Maddie everything but the name I gave her so I wonder if she feels like Hannah.  This story is so cute and it's fun to read.  I love the pictures and my Maddie likes to hear this over and over.
