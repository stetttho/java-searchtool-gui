 Science fiction is sadly ignored, especially in the AA community.  This book, however, is a fantastic introduction to the powerful words created by Octavia Butler.  Not your stereotypical sci-fi (there are no spaceships, interplanetary wars, ray guns, etc.) but this book invites you to condsider what if: What if the world that you knew was filled with gated communities, corrupt police who will investigate a crime for money, drugs that so alter your mind that fire is akin to sex.  This book will challenge what you beleive, your faith in a higher being, man , politics.  A realistic view of what could be the future.  I like to think that this book parallels the problems that we face today: the crack epidemic, religion, classism and crime.  This is a book that should not be passed over but devoured.
