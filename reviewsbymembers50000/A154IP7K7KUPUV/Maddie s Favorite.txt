 After watching Snow White no less than EIGHTEEN TIMES with my 20 month old I feel as if I am somewhat of an exprert.  Disney has outdone themselves with this masterpiece of a film.  The story is greatly known, although the message that this sends to young women may need some interference from mom and dad but ths movie is timeless in it's good vs evil themes and true love. The DVD extras are quite fun: visit Snow White through the years.  Play Dopey's mine game (well this is a bit dull for adults but the little one loved it), a "Hi-Ho" sing along.  There is also Barbra Striesand belting out "someday My Prince Will Come".  This is a great DVD to add to your collection and one that will get much play.
