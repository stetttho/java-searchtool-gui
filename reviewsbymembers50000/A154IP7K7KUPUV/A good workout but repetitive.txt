 I love Petra Kolber.  She is an excellent instructor and she gives really easy directions. HOWEVER I found this tape a bit repetitive after a few workouts and I really didn't like the music (hence the three stars).  The tape does give a good workout.  Petra seems to assume that the person soing the tape knows step lingo but after a few viewings you'll know what "V" step  and "over the top" mean. This tape is a good value and worth the buy but I would recommend getting it along with another tape for variety.
