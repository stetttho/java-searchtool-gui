 What's not to love about "Ghost"?   In my opinion one of the greatest love stories of all time.  Patrick Swayze's Sam is killed one night and he is "trapped" between worlds as he tries to figure out who and why.  Whoppie Golgberg steals the show as Otta Mae, the role that she rightly won her Oscar for.  The effects are kind of dated but who cares?   A good one to own.
