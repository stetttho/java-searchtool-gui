 This tape is a challenge.  It got my heart beat up, I sweated and I felt good but this tape is also very repetitive.  The same moves are done over and over and then Tamilee reverses her position on the step and does the same moves from the beginning all over again!  This a great tape for someone who is familiar with the step and more advanced than begiiner but beware that the same moves are done over and over and can lead to boredom.
