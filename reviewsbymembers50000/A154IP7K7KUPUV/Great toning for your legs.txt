 It's been years since I actually took a ballet class so while I had some idea what Melissa Lowe was talking about I think someone who is new to ballet would be lost.  This tape is really great for toning.  The exercises are first done on one side then repeated on the other.  I got a great stretch and would recommend this tape as a change from the ordinary. My only beef with the tape is the fact that at times the other dancers seemed to be doing their own thing.  It is a little distracting to see arms and legs flying all over the place.  Otherwise great workout.
