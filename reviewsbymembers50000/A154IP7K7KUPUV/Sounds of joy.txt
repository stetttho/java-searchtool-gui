 I bought this tape for my 16 month old not knowing what to expect.  This was to be an alternative to the television that finds itself on all day long in my house.  My little girl loves this CD.  The kids on the tape can be annoying but they do sound so cute and the songs are just long enough that when they start to grate on the nerves (and believe me listening to this CD over and over and over will get on your nerves) the song is over and the next one starts. This is a good buy if you want a distraction while you are making dinner.
