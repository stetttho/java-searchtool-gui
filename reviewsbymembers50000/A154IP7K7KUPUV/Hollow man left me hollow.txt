 A new twist on the Invisible Man is what I expected when I saw the advertisements for the movie.  The plot started out good enough, Kevin Bacon's character, a know it all scientist, has come up with a solution that can turn lab animals invisible.  Being the pompus scientict that he is, Bacon's character decides to test the formula on himself and things go straight to hell from there.  The special effects were awesome, but the lackluster, sucky (there is NO other word for it) plot made the effort seem waster.  In reality I would give the special effects 5 stars and the plot minus 2 stars.
