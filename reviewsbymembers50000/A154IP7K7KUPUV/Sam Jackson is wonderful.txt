 The great thing about DVD and movie rentals are to be able to catch those gems that were here this morning, gone this afternoon from the movie theater. This is a can't miss film from Kasi Lemmon (Eve's Bayou) starring Sam Jackson as Romulus Ledbetter, a former Julliard trained musician who has been driven to the streets due to mental illness. He discovers a "valentine" in the form of a dead body that was left outside of his cave on Valentine's Day and sets out to track down the killer. The movie just rumbles along with plot twists, the mental images are beautiful and the movie is a thriller to the end. I was disappointed with the deleted scenes. It would have been nice if the director could have let the viewer know why the scene was deleted and what the relevance was.   There is a short cast and crew bio that is pretty nice and of course the director's commentary.
