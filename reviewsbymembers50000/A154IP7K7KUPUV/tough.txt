 This tape is the Original Buns of Steel and promises visible results in (I believe) six weeks.  This tape is very tough and not for beginners.  I felt frustrated as I tried to get through the tape and I was so sore that I decided not to continue a few times that I attempted to do the tape.  Plus I felt the tape was long and I found myself concentrating on when the tape was over instead of form and what I was doing. Skip this.
