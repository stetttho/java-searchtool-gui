 I really mean it.  Every time I watch Shrek I find something that I missed before and I enjoy the movie more.  My 21 month old has picked Shrekn as her new favorite so I feel confident after 6 viewings in 4 days I can speak on this. This is a movie that pokes fun at Disney, has the fairy tale ending and shows that inner beauty is all that matters.   I must say that the animation is wonderful; the computerized characters look real, not the cartoony way that cartoons (duh!) can look.  The picture quality is awesome, clear and sharp. The extras on this DVD make this movie all the more enjoyable, for those who just gotta see how the animators did it there are goofs, a making of spot andthe best of all, the dance party. This is one to own.  Run, don't walk and get your own copy.
