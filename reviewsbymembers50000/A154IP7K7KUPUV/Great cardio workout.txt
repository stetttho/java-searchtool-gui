 I was a bit disappointed with this tape.  I will admit that I thought bellydancing was just rolling your stomach and shaking your hips.  I was expecting to learn how to roll my stomach and shake my hips so when I previewed my tape and saw Neena and Veena jumping around I got a little po'd.  However I do think with only slight variations but this tape is excellent for toning your calves aand good for getting your heart rate up.   I would not buy this tape if I havesome kind of knee problems this tape is great for cardio.  The tape is a bit repetitive since there is so much jumping about but if you are looking for a change in your workout then this is the tape for you.
