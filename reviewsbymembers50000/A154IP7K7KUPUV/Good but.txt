 Shandra Hill's debut novel deserves 5 stars for addressing the issues of the STD Herpes.    In a time where HIV and AIDS dominates our lives it is good to send a message that there are still other diseases that can be caught and that one still must be careful.  However this book seemed to jump all over the pace as if she wanted to get so much infomation in and wasn't sure how to organize it.  I give the author her "props" for writing a book and getting published but parts of the plot dragged on and on and at times she jumped from idea to idea.  I kept re-reading pages thinking that perhaps I skipped a few lines. I did like the way she kept Jasmine "real".  I felt like Jasmine when I was layed off and when Jasmine got into it with Jennifer at work.  However the plot was a bit predictable and the story was a bit boring. I would recommend borrowing this book from a library or a friend.
