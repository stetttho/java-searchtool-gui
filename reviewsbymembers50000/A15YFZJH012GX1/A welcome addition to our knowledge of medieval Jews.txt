 Author Stefan Reif is Director of the Taylor-Schechter Genizah Research Unit at the Cambridge University Library. This book discusses the amazing treasure-trove of documents from Egypt's Cairo Genizah, which yielded several important documents about the Khazars, included writings by famous Jewish personalities like Moses Maimonides and Yehuda HaLevi, and also helps us better understand the daily lives of medieval Jews in subjects as wide ranging as medicine, music, marriage, philosophy, religious practices, and relations with Muslims and Christians.  Reif provides capsule histories of the amassing of the Genizah Collection, biographies of the personalities who worked on Genizah research and preservation efforts, and summaries and illustrations of many of the documents contained in the collection.
