 When the U.S. Postal Service's "Celebrate the Century Express" train stopped in my hometown during September 2000, the songs coming from the outdoor speakers were those from this album, including "Girlfriend" and "It's the Falling in Love". This was fitting, because "Off the Wall" is one of the finest pop albums of the 20th century. Produced by Quincy Jones, who also produced George Benson's magnificent 1980 album "Give Me the Night", the album is enjoyable from start to finish, with 10 solid songs that deserved their popularity among radio listeners and rollerskaters. In his autobiography "Moonwalk", Jackson described Jones as "the best producer I could have asked for" and explained how the two felt it was important to "capture passion and strong feelings in a recorded performance." They succeeded in their quest. Michael's singing is brilliant. Bassist Louis Johnson plays as well as Chic's bassist Bernard Edwards. The rhythm section varies the beats at various parts of a song so that they don't end up being monotonous. And the guitar players are great, too. The songs "Rock With You" and "Off the Wall" have solid grooves that can be listened to repeatedly with great enjoyment. The vocalists and musicians on this album are masters of the R&B, disco, and pop genres.
