 This book establishes the theory that the Ashkenazic Jews are largely descendants of converts to Judaism, especially West Slavic converts such as Sorbians and Polabians.  The main focus of this book is linguistic, and certain sections will be difficult to follow for the average reader.  Paul Wexler, an Israeli professor, shows that Yiddish contains many Slavic words and also that Yiddish culture has a large Slavic base.  He also presents new archaeological evidence -- from Jewish sites in Chelarevo (Serbia), Aphrodisias, and Switzerland -- that many peoples converted to Judaism or adopted Judaic beliefs. I do not feel that Wexler is correct that Yiddish is structurally a Slavic language rather than a Germanic language.  I also disagree with his conclusion that the Turkic ancestors of many Ashkenazim came from the Balkans, because evidence quite clearly shows that most Turks who became Jews lived in the territory which is now Ukraine and Russia.  He also fails to prove that the West Slavs definitely converted to Judaism.  His hypothesis essentially is that Sorbians and Polabians were owned by Jews as slaves and that they converted to Judaism, but he admits that there is no documentary evidence that these particular Slavic groups ever converted, and almost entirely relies upon linguistic and cultural arguments, many of which are untenable.
