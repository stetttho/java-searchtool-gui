 Around the time this 1980 album came out, James Mtume and his partner, Reggie Lucas, were known for their excellent production work with singers like Phyllis Hyman and Stephanie Mills. Mtume and Lucas are also skilled musicians, as demonstrated here. Mtume contributes lead vocals and background vocals and plays keyboards and percussion, while Lucas shines in his lead and rhythm guitar playing and joins in the background vocals as well. The stand-out track on this album is the disco song "So You Wanna Be A Star" (5:16), its sophisticated lyrics masterfully sung by Tawatha Agee. "Give It On Up (If You Want To)", a catchy disco song, is a nice way to start the album.  It's followed by "You Can't Wait for Love", a powerful funky number which is another winner and my second-favorite here. "Dance Around My Navel" is a short, hilarious funk song, clocking in at just under 2 minutes. "We're Gonna Make It This Time" is a decent ballad. "Everything Good to Me" is a beautiful, slow "sunshine" song with violins. "Mrs. Sippi" is a repetitive but fun funk song which emphasizes the guitars. There are three songs which I found disappointing: "Anticipatin'" is an electro-funk song that's OK but not particularly memorable, and the disco songs "She's a Rainbow Dancer" and "Spirit of the Dance" don't reach the heights of the other two disco songs on the album and somehow sound dull. But overall this is a good album that more people should hear. Also featuring drummer Howard King, bassist Basil Fearrington, guitarist Ed Moore, and keyboardist Hubert Eaves.
