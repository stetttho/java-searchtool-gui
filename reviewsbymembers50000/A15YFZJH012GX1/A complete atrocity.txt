 This album contains disco versions of classics like "I Get a Kick Out of You" (a Cole Porter tune), "I Got Rhythm" (from the musical "Crazy for You"), and "There's No Business Like Show Business" (penned by Irving Berlin), all arranged by Peter Matz. The album was produced in the summer of 1979 at the height of the commercial overkill of disco, when rock and soul stars as well as untalented singers were rushing to record sub-standard disco songs. Merman sang these songs all in one take on one day. The arrangements were not well thought out, with plenty of disco cliches and the instruments sounding out of place and lifeless. The way the background singing was handled, with lyrics like "Why why why, baby", is laughable. The album is horrible and unenjoyable. If you want to hear disco done right, check out artists like Chic, Jamiroquai, Voyage, Shalamar, France Joli, and Players Association.
