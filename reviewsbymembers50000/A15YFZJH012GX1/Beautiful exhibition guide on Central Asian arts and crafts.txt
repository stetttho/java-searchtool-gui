 I highly recommend this superb illustrated look at the Powerhouse Museum's collection of Central Asian arts and crafts. Included in this large 80-page book are color photographs of rugs, dresses, coats, headcoverings, jewelry, embroidery, architectural drawings, glass pottery, horse covers, bags, Uzbeks, Kazakhs, and Turkmens. The handcrafted items possess a rich treasure-trove of complex geometric forms and designs. The images are accompanied by helpful introductory texts by Christina Sumner and Heleanor Feltham concerning the history and culture of Central Asian peoples and a large map of the Silk Road routes. The selected bibliography lists 22 books and 4 websites where one can explore Central Asian traditions further.
