 Sophie's "Murder on the Dancefloor" has all the right elements - interesting lyrics, strings, superb guitar and bass-guitar playing (by John Themis and Guy Pratt respectively), a driving rhythm, and good singing. It deserves to get lots of radio and club play. It strikes me as better than her "Take Me Home", and it's not as repetitive as "Groovejet".
