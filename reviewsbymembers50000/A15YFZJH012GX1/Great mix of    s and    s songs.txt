 This 2-disk CD with 28 tracks features a lot of great songs. Most spectacular is the rare mid-tempo soul groover "Looking Up to You" by Michael Wycoff (1982). This CD also has the pop classic "Too Hot" by Kool and the Gang, good disco songs like "Love is You" by Carol Williams and "Make That Move" by Shalamar, a nice romantic song by Barry White ("It's Ecstasy When You Lay Down Next To Me"), and the cool Brazilian-tinged classic "Soul Bossa Nova" by Quincy Jones. You also get two disco songs by Carrie Lucas, powerful vocals by Chaka Khan on the 1981 song "Fate", and Lakeside's great 1980 funk song "Fantastic Voyage". Herbie Hancock sings through a vocoder on his 1978 disco song "I Thought It Was You". Artists like the Gap Band, Thelma Houston, Cerrone, and Sister Sledge are also represented with their lesser-known songs.
