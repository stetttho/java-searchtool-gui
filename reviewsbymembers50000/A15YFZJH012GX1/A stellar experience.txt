 The musicians did a fine job on this 1978 album. The strings towards the end of "Perfect Love Affair" are heavenly, and Ray Mang sampled that section for his 2002 song "Orchestral Manoeuvres". My favorite part of "Cosmic Melody" is the string portion that follows the playing of bell keyboards. The best song on the album is "Funk Encounter", a very catchy track which is perfect from start to finish.
