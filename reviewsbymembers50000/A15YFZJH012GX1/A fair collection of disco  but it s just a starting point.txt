 When exploring the amazing genre of disco music, too many people limit themselves to the "hits". To be sure, radio stations during the late 70s and early 80s often limited their playlists to the hits alone, but this collection only barely scratches the surface of disco. In my opinion, there are many excellent tracks in The Disco Box. Among the best are the songs by Sister Sledge and Chic, plus Ain't No Stopping Us Now, Turn The Beat Around, Disco Inferno, Never Can Say Goodbye, and Forget Me Nots.  A lot of great singers are represented here, including Evelyn King, Thelma Houston, and Donna Summer.  At the same time, a lot of the songs in this set are headache-inducing, like Disco Nights and Knock On Wood, and there's a lot of low-quality disco like Shake Your Booty, Get Dancin', and YMCA.  Every genre has its high and low points. There are hundreds of much better disco songs than those.  A complete disco set should have included excellent and timeless songs (many of them hits) like Give Me The Night by George Benson, Cocomotion by El Coco, Rock With You & Off The Wall by Michael Jackson, Spacer by Sheila & B. Devotion, The Love I Lost by Harold Melvin & The Bluenotes, I Like Love & High Society by Norma Jean Wright, and Never Knew Love Like This Before by Stephanie Mills.  And what about super party songs like Stomp by the Brothers Johnson and Relight My Fire by Dan Hartman? They aren't here either. And it has already been pointed out that nothing by the Bee Gees is here. More recently there are superb disco songs by Jamiroquai like Cosmic Girl (1996) and Canned Heat (1999). I hope that some people who buy The Disco Box will also check out other disco albums, especially the "Best Of" compilations of the great artists I mentioned above. Don't miss out on the hidden treasures!
