 This is a great swing- and a swing is a must-have item for any mother. I promise you won't be sorry. This swing in particular kept my son happy for 7 months. He started in it at birth, (remember to lower the seat to protect their neck) and he used it until this week- almost 7 months. He stopped using it because he was so tall, he could grab the fish on the mobile and grab the legs on the swing- yeah, not safe. The main drawbacks for this item were listed very clearly in the review before mine, however I will mention my points anyway. 1st, it was noisy, it needed WD40 after only a couple months, and it eats up a lot of battery. It is a tad unstable and you have to kick the legs out every so often to make it perform better. However, there are so many more pros, I won't name them all. It is just a safe, fun, must-have item for any baby.
