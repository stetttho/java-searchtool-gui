 I fell in love with this glider as soon as I saw it at the store. It looks great and is pretty comfortable, but the quality is 7/10. It won't last forever or anything, like Lazy Boy's but the material also looks like you need to treat it well or it will tear or shred. Also, when you want to recline, you have to push your body back yourself, not with the handle. You can manually lock it in recline though. Overall, I am happy but if you are a picky person, try it out before you buy it.
