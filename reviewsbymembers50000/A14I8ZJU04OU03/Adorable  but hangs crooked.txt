 I love this mobile, it goes great with the Winnie set I bought but I have one problem. The mobile stuffed animals are not well balanced. The toys each weigh differently, so the mobile is crooked. We tried to balance the heaviest toys but it did not make enough of a difference. If you do get the Peek a Pooh set though, I would still recommend this mobile.
