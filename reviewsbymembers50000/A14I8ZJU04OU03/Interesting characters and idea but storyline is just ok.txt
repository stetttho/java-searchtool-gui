 This is a decent Vietnam story. If you want a gory book like the movies make it this is not for you, however- if you want a book that has an original plot and good characters, read it. Tim O'Brien has a first hand take on war and reveals his experience through ideas in this book. It isn't a book you can read in one sitting but it is a decent read for a boring weekend or plane flight.
