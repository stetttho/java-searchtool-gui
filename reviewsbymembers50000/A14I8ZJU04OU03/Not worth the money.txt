 I think a Snuggly is just as good and half the price. This is expensive mainly because it is made of great fabric but it is not that important to pay double. It is also hard to figure out and not great for busty, short women like myself or big and tall men like my hubby. Best bet is to go to the store and try it on and see what you think in person. You  may save money by checking other ones out.
