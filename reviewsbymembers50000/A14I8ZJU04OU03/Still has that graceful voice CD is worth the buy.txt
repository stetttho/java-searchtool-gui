 Amy Jo Johnson has a great voice. Her song from the show Felicity called "Puddle of Grace" really proved that. In this cd her voice is still great and some songs are that style but some are more "rock-alternative" sounding than you may expect. Bottom line: If you love her voice you will at least like the cd if not love it.
