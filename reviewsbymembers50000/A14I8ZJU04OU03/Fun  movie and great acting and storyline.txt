 The storyline- although based on a true story (so sorry no originality points) is great. Such a clever idea for a movie and so fun to watch the cat and mouse game between Tom Hanks and Leo DiCaprio. Leo does such a great job- I still am not sure why he isn't an Oscat winner... and the movie does not have a dull moment.
