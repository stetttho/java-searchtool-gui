 This book was a great guideline for a first time mother. I didn't know when or what to feed my son when he first started solids at 6 months and this book helped me choose easy on his tummy foods and I could do it step by step. It also had great ideas on how to prepare and store food. However, as a reader below noted also, the author advocates peanut butter which is a big no-no in my book until 1+ yrs of age due to the high allergic warnings for babies. As long as you read this for ideas and not follow what she says word for word and also consult your doc and other moms, you will be all good.
