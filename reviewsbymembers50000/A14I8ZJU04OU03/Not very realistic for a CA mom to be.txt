 This book is sweet and old-fashioned but it is all about giving birth at THE FARM with midwives. For somoeone like me who knows I will have the baby in a hospital with a doctor, though naturally, the book did nothing for me. It in fact made me feel like what I wanted to do was not good enough. Plus, half of the book was just people's boring stories, all of which were pretty much the same. If you are in my shoes, don't buy this book.
