 If you loved No Doubt, I am sure you would at least like this CD. It is different of course, she has no band, it is more electronic in the background, but it has a great sound. It is fun music. Lyrics are silly but her voice is great as usual. The cd has a mix of hip hop, r n b, dance, club, and 80s rock which is really cool. I would recommend getting it if you know you like Gwen!
