 I have not experienced other playmats but I do know that this is an essential item for your baby. It is excellent for development and by 1 month, they get bored and want to play and this is excellent. I lie him down after a bath or changing and he plays until he is sleepy.   I like the colors and layout. It has a good amount of toys to play with BUT:  the star with music sometimes goes dead and the music stops playing for a few seconds and this is NEW...  the rabbit picture is a lame toy  it could be bigger...  otherwise it is a great item...  I would recommend checking other ones out first to see if this one is right for you.
