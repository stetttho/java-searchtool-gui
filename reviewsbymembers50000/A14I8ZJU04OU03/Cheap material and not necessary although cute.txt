 I bought the Winnie da Pooh "Peek-a-pooh" set for my nursery and I love it. However, I went a little crazy and bought EVERY ITEM it comes with when I should have thought about whether I really need it or not. This is one of those items. The material is not the best, although, since you don't wash it all the time, it should not matter. Also, for my nursery, the white blinds and moldings around the window are enough since the rest of the room has so much polka dot pooh stuff. It is good if you know you need a window valance, but not a must.
