 What an amazing album. Alot of people have compared this to their debut "Mr Tambourine Man", but the only real similarity lies in the fact that they are both extremely solid albums which predate this groups mostly succesful (but sometimes dissapointing) exploration of psychedelia. "Turn" has a more subdued, slightly darker tone than the first album. The unstopable youthful energy of a song like "I'll feel a whole lot better" is replaced by a more subtle, surging vibe that is epitomized on the title track. Here, and on "set you free this time", and "the world turns all around here" the Byrds manage to sound optimistic, world-weary, and undescribably wise all at once. The only thing that keeps this from being a great "rock" record is the inclusion of some fine folk songs executed in a very understated matter. Then again, that type of variety is hard to come by these days in the rock arena, so I say, listen with an open mind, and you'll understand why the Byrds are STILL a very meaningful band.
