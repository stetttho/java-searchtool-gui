 The bottom line, Maladroit is a winner: Solidly-crafted songs, walls of heavy-metal-crunch-meets-punk-grunge distortion, post-modern (yet emotional) lyrics, the most compeling guitar solos and drumming in modern rock, and tasteful, garage-ethic production. Those criticizing the album are unfairly expecting certain proportions of this element of the Blue album and that particular feeling from Pinkerton, and non of that from the Green album; the way to approach this album and enjoy it is to listen for how Weezer is evolving and trying out new things, and for the most part succeeding. long live RoCk
