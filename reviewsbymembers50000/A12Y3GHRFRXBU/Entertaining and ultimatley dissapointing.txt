 The first few times I listened to this album I was genuinley excited; these guys are definitley a tight band, firmly rooted in the sonic architecture of sixties pychedelia. OTC doesn't just make stabs at sounding vintage, they get alot of the details right too, from the wonderful McCartney-esque tone of the bass guitar to the four-track recording technology. To keep it current, the overall sound is just a little grungier and angstier than the music they're emulating; I found the "Jumping Fences"/"Transparent Dream" medley to be the highlight of the album. Yet this track epitomizes the problem with this album: they could have done SO MUCH MORE with it!! The songs just don't have enough substance to hold up to repeated listening, which is too bad, given the albums conceptual promise. Plus, it's too long. I'm sorry, but 30-45 minutes really is the ideal length for a rock album, unless you have some killer tunes to keep your listener interested. "Cubist Castle" doesn't have killer tunes, or even decent floydian soundscapes. It's a collection of ideas and experiments. To the modern rock fan, it may be a revelation, but to the vintage psychedelia listener, it will pale in comparison to most of the records in your collection. Having said that, I still think it's worth a listen. But it wasn't worth my 14 bucks
