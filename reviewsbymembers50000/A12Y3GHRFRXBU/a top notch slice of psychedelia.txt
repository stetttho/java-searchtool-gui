 With 'Satanic Majesties", the Stones weren't really attempting to copy Sgt Pepper as they were simply responding to it. Jagger and company recognized Pepper as the innovative masterpiece that it was, and put thier own spin on it.  While the results may sound dated or kitschy to some inexperienced listeners, the sound of this album typifies the near-avant-garde mindset and experimental spirit that dominated studio productions of this era. The Stones's search for new sounds may not have yielded results as conscise as the music of the Beatles, but the Stones were always less polished and more down and dirty rockers anyway. This is typified on 'Citadel' an incredibly rockin' track that thrashes for 2 and a half minutes with a Nirvana-like aggresession. Then there's '2000 light years from home' a drugged-out anthem, where Charlie Watt's pounds out the kind of droning rock groove that seems tailor-made for today's club scene.  The re-occuring theme "Sing this Song", has a sing-songy british feel, counterbalanced by displaced loungy vibes and brass, and at times recalls Pink Floyds early forays into sound effects.  Overall, this is a bold and entertaining album.
