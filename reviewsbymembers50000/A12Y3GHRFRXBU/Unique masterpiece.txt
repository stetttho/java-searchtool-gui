 The original Fantasia is an undeniable masterpiece, and in bringing it to the digital medium, Disney has done the best job possible under the circumstances. The visuals are stunning (making the VHS practically unwatchable), and I am still amazed at the fidelity of the orginal soundtrack (probably one of the first to be recorded on to magnetic tape, hence the crispness). The long forgotten intermission has also been included, which really gives the film the feeling of a concert. However, for the DVD, Disney made a bold move. For the sake of completeness, the narration in between pieces has been fully restored, and in some cases is over twice the length of the original. To accomodate this Deems Taylor's VOICE has been dubbed over by a similar voice reading his words verbatim. Apparently, the audio portion of the restored segments was unsalvagable, and the re-dubbing was done for consistentcies sake. Too bad. The only other discrepency, was that the classic art-decoesque "Fantasia" title that flashes on the screen before the curtain opens is GONE. Perhaps that was not part of the original cut.
