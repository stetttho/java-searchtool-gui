 Only The Kinks can deliver lyrics about tea-time and family photo albums, only to lace them with melodic cynicism and a youthful sneer, and fuel them with propulsive, (yet rarely distorted) guitar parts framed by broadway-informed song structures. On this 1968 album, Ray Davies has come along way from the savagely-rocking riff songs like "you really got me", and now examines the psychology of nostalgia, with themes that would be almost confrontational to the average hippy: he asks the listener to "picture yourself, when you're getting old", and sings about the fallibilty of youthful idealism. The songwriting is consistantly strong, resulting in a tightly nit, engaging album.
