 There is absolutely nothing wrong the original theatrical version of E.T.! I am so sick of washed-up directors like Lucas and Spielberg futzing with their old works and then considering them worthy replacements for the originals. I would urge anyone buying this DVD to please watch the original, unaltered version first. I actually threw out the disc containing the "2002 version" (shudder), and got this solely for the 1982 version. The idea of "updating" older films by inserting computer graphics is sickening, and it's an idea that oughta be resisted by anyone who cares.
