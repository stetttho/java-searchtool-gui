 Up to this point, I have never been much of a rap fan, but this CD, on pretty much the first listen, made me an instant Outkast fan, and made me suddenly aware of the artistic potential of hip-hop. Outkast has been brave enough to break the hip-hop mold. They have gathered all the formal elements of rap and started fresh, far distanced from the cliches of the big city hip-hop scenes in their Stankonia, Georgia studio. Make no mistake. These guys still rap about smoking dope (on almost every song), they cuss frequently, and they give each other (and themselves) superflous props. What sets Outkast apartis that they don't stop at the status-quo. They use the inescapable elements of hip-hop culture as a mere point of departure to make some truly great music. What it comes down to, is that anyone who can appreciate well crafted *music* will understand just how much these tracks transcend any preconceptions you may have about rap. Outkast uses alot of real instruments, like electric basses, harmonicas, distorted guitars and funky vintage keyboards. All of the songs are entirely original; there are no samples to speak of. The production has sturdy analog grit. The vocal arrangments are persuasive: incredibly melodic choruses and very clever use of multi-tracked vocals. Most importantly, there is a lot of genuine soul and a heartfelt sincerity that is practically unheard of in the rap mainstream. Not to say every song carries the emotional weight of "Ms. Jackson" (arguably the most indelible track here) but even on a tune like "Ain't no Thang" (a song that is about little else than smoking pot) the boys win you over with the sheer funkiness and studio ingenuity they display. Here's hoping Outkast will continue to grow musically and make a lasting mark on the music industry.
