 Although the Kinks are most popularly associated with the riff-rock numbers of their early repertoire, and while afficionados endlessly praise the later albums, "Kontroversey" finds the Kinks in a fruitful mid-period. Much like the Beatles 'Rubber Soul' from roughly the same time, the emphasis here is on solidly constructed, folk influenced pop. In case we forget the Kinks are a rock band, however, they dish up plenty of sneering garage-punk on "Till the End of the Day" and "Where have all the Good Times Gone"; but even these numbers reveal a more reflective, plaintive aspect to Ray's lyrics that permeates the mellower tunes on the album; "Ring the Bells" and "The World Keeps Going Round" have an almost Byrds-like grace to them, while revealing Ray's keen skills as an arranger.  The Kinks approach to rock and roll throughout the sixties was always the most working-class, and intensely British when compared to thier peers, and while that individuality does shine here, this is probably one of their most accesible albums.  The production and remastering only make it more so, as "Kontroversey" does not suffer the somewhat tinny quality of most of the Kinks re-issues from this decade. This is not the Kinks most revolutionary stuff - check out "Village Green" or "Something Else" if you like this album and want to hear more complex songwriting and adventerous arrangments; check out "Kinks Kontroversey" if you want proof that simplicity is sometimes just as effective.
