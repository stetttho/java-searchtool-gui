 led Zeppelin II proves there are just as many possibilities for artistic sophistication within the realm of "simple" blues songs as there are in more obtuse and expansive songwriting efforts by performers like the Beatles or Bob Dylan. Despite the various titles that have been on thrown on various hard rock bands, Led Zep truly IS the thinking persons Metal. Jimmy Page's natural feel for built-to-last guitar riffs is mirrored in his equally essential ear as a producer. Every arrangement is one finely crafed slab of solid rock that asserts it's unequivocal masculanity on all levels: swaggerring rhythms, over-driven amps, and lyrics of a crude passion devoid of pretense. This is the essence of rock&roll. And how brilliant is it to *begin* an album with a long drum solo??!!
