 With the Green Album, as Weezer's third release has come to be know, the band essentially delivers a breezy, economically composed pop album to show the world that, after the throw-MTV-for-a-loop of Pinkerton and 4 years of reclusiveness, Weezer is back. This is easily the least substantial and least creative Weez album to date, but it still stands head and shoulders above any other guitar-driven pop/rock bands out there today. The musicianmanship, though streamlined and offering fewer surprises than usual, is excellent, and the band delivers it's trademark vocal harmonies tinged with melancholy. Overall, the songwriting here is just not as arresting as anything on the Blue Album or Pinkerton, both on a musical and lyrical level. That having been said, the first half of the album does include some great tunes: the breezy, driving retro-pop of Dont Let Go and Photograph; Hashpipe, a rather uncharacteristic vamp driven stomper which I think is Weezer's way of joining in the fun of the nu-metal craze; and Island in the Sun, a terrific change of texture and one of the bands best songs yet. Things start ot drag by the albums second half, but Weezer was smart to make thier comeback album short (30 minutes) and sweeet (obviousley too sweet for some Weezer fans who call themselves die-hards). The band is currently wrapping up their 4th album "Maladroit", due in April, which promises to offer us the deeper, rock-ier geek rockers we all know and love.  I think it's more important to accept this album as the quality piece of work it is. If it must be compared to past albums, it should also be seen as a mere appetizer to what is to come from this band, and a great album to throw on when the monumentally distorted angst of Pinkerton has started to bring you down.
