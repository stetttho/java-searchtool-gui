 Jose's come back with Travesura is beautiful and unforgettable. His fan will not desert him dear reviewer who gave 1 star to this album. Since Jose luis Encinas's last album, I have been waiting for his next album. This album will  take your pain away and make u feel joy and love. Jose has added some nice track such as Travesaura, A-chi-li-pu and many nice songs which will take you through a unforgettable journey. Jose plays a beautiful spanish guitarist, passionate and beautiful. He has added spanish guitar with nice pop music background.He is a spirit, his spanish guitar playing is beautiful.Jose also added some latin,slow,sizzling melodies which has blended itself with spanish guitar and vocal of gipsy woman who sings with jose's music in the back. Since DUENDE, jose's first album, I become fascinated in his passsion for spanish guitarist. Jose also has added some traditional style like in track 8 he plays  solo guitar which is beautiful. The track 9 and 3 are my favourite. Listen to track 3, como el sol Al Desierto. YOUR heart will fly through this song and experince the magic. Buy Travesura and feel the passion. viva jose....
