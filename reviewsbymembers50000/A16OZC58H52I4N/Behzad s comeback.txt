 He is one of the greatest and passionate guitarist today. Behzad's third album Luna y Sol is just beautiful. Since I heard to his second album, strings of desire, I became fascinated with behzad's music. Behzad plays a beautiful spanish guitar which will take your pain away and will lift your spirit. This album is blend of pop, eastern and spanish music. There are so many tracks which is my favourite like track 2 and 5 and many more. Behzad's music is a perfect music for romance and unforgettable moments which you never forget.VIva behzad, Zendeh bad Behzad.Buy this album, you will not be disappointed.
