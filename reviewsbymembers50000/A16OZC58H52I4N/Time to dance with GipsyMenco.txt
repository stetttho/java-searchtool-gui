 Gipsy menco's second album no boundries is great just like a first album perfection. Sal hanna who was part of the novamenco band until two years ago, created a new band, and he plays the lead guitar. No boundries will move your body and shake the spirit within you. Sal is a talented spanish guitarist. This album has some middle eastern percussion mixed with spanish guitar. The track sahara will live up to expectation. Sal has a talented band which they play in CA, san diego most of time. I recommend this cd to amazon's spanish guitar lover. Oh yeah, the track solo sin ti, sal, for first time, sings and it sounded as a beautiful song. check their web site.www.gipsymenco.com buy this album, and experience the Gipsymenco, check my reviews for more spanish music which you will like, thanks.
