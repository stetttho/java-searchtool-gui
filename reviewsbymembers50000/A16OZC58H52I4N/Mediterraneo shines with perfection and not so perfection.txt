 Since I heard Antoine's music in his Cd Madrid, I knew that he is very talented spanish guitarist.With his album such as Urban gypsy, Universal language, and Cruising, He became a rising and magnificant artist.His lates CD,Mediterraneo is perfect but also not so perfect.In this Album, Antoine has added nice jazz and rock style music with the spanish guitar.Mediterraneo starts absloutley magnificant with the tracks such as Mediterraneo and Preludio. Antoine plays a beautiful spanish guitar which will take you away. In middle of album has added nice sizzling jazz music with pop background to his spanish guitar music. Antoine is aunique artist and will bring romance to you.The thing I didnot like about Mediterraneo is the latest track at this album.Meditterraneo and early tracks fulfills your wishes and desire of nice music but it disappears its perfection.The tracks at end are not that perfect because guitar's note is accompanied with tedious backround music.But my purpose is not to criticize Antoine.I still believe that he is a magnificant spanish guitarist. Buy Mediterraneo and experience the magic.
