 I have listened to many guitarist, but casta I expected more from u, but u let me down. This album was your first and last album in my opinion. Tedious rhytm and boring voices. Guitar palying is way off , and doesnot accompany the singers. If you really want a nice spanish guitar cds, check my reviews. Casta's cd will give u a big disappointment if u buy. Casta tries to join guitar with spanish mood and latin percussion, but he fails. I have nothing against casta, he may be a good person as his label comapny alula records says, but his music is very weak, and gipsies won't like this album at all. Plz, donot call your self gipsy. The album has some tracks that you will hate it, lake of talent and passion. Casta feels like gipsy, but real gipsy's music comes from heart and passions. Casta has to improve his style and music. Work hard Casta, you can do it.
