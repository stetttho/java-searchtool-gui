 I heard about Mehdi by chance in amazon. He is a talented multi instrumentalist.Mehdi plays a beautiful flute, keyboard, many other magical instrument. The vol 1-7 are all great albums. Mehdi's music is undescribable. He has agreat talent and vivid imagination which will calm ur spirit and heal ur wounds. I recommend this gift set to u,and this set is a ideal choice if u want to give gift to someone u care about. Each of 7 cds are filled with beautiful, soothing,inspiring,magical,unforgettable,passionate,and romantic songs which is filled with great middle eastern rhytm. Mehdi's albums sooths any soul , and it fills up new positive and inspiring emotion. Mehdi writes his own songs, and u will never become tired of his songs. Some tracks keeps u dancing, some tracks made me remember the sad time I had in past, but some track sooths my soul and inspire me to continue the great journey of life. U see his music is a journey of desire, lost love,found love, romantic, soothing and creative. Mehdi has a great vision in making his music. Volume 1 to 7 are all great albums, and each has its own unique style. Relaxing mood and soothing rhytm which you will love to listen more and more. I thank amazon for introducing music of mehdi to me. Similar to Mehdi is Mory khaksar, the iranian flute musician. Enjoy mehdi's music. Buy the gift set and experience Mehdi'd journey.Check my other reviews for more great music.
