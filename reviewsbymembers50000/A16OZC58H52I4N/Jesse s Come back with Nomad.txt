 I have waited for this album about two years.Jesse comes back with highly new style.Jesse has gone to many countries to record this album.He has added more arabic music with spanish rhytm.He plays spanish guitar very beautiful and unforgettable. Unlike the other Cds,he has added some more vocal song to his album.The beautiful vocal song,such as early on tuesday, and under the rain.The song has perfectly has nice rhytm which jesse has chosen.It is inspiring and romantic.Jesse is coming to our town in November, and I cannot wait to see his soon in concert.The thing about Jesse's Nomad I like is,Jesse has preserved the spanish music style,and he also added some unique arabic music with nice beat to it.Many critic may say that jesse's Nomad album is not the one that Jesse's album is about.I disagree with them.Jesse has his own unique style,and he developed his music by playing with some vocal voice.From fragile to fall at your feet,and jesse comes with more song which his fans fall in love when they hear his new album.Buy this album,and you will fall in Love.Viva Jesse....
