 Right now.I am listening to Incendio's illumination cd.This cd starts with some magic of sitar,tabla,violon,flute,and spanish guitar.They mixed mostly the spanish guitar music with nice rhythm of trance,pop music.I love the way these talented guitarist plays their music.WIth fury,skill,passion,care,and love to the spanish guitar.This cd also has some latin style songs,some middle eastern music with trance music.track number 2 is my favourite track.My heart flies when I hear this song.VIVA the INCENDIO....
