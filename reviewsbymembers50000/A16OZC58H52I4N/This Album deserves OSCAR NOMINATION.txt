 I have been one of the strongest fan of the novamenco.They inspired me and opened a new door to the journey of spanish music.Their first ablum Gypsy Fusion and 2nd album flight to the paradise was outstanding.NOvamenco was composed of 5 talented people.Thay are from spain,and this latest cd is just GREATTT.i loved it...the three brother sam,edmond,sal, have created an lovely music that will take u through the unforgettable journey of love and emotion of spainsh music....U will love this cd,because it has mixed modern flamenco new age style with some eastern and rock,pop music....this CD DESERVES OSCAR nomination..;))
