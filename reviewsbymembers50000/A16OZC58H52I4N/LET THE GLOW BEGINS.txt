 I have criticizied peter's music for a year with his second last album.However,peter has improved his music to very sensual and beautiful melodies.The peter plays his best classic guitar ever.In this CD,peter has put nice songs that it will make your heart glow.Peter's song has played a emotional effect,joy and happiness for me.I think peter deserves best applaude with this record.Out of these 11th tracks...I love all but mostly I love track 10,,the song which peter has dedicated to his father.As he says in cover of the cd, life story is the life story of peter's dad.This album is dedicate to him by peter.Peter has mixed jazz with pop style to create a romantice and sensual music which will live in my heart forEVER MORE.... VIVA PETER....
