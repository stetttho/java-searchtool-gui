 I have been waiting for this album for a long time.Johannes fourth album,zabuca,which means shake up, is beautiful and magical.Johannes mixes his spanish guitar style with some nice modern pop latin music.He plays a beautiful spanish guitar which takes you to the journey of passion and romance.Johannes's creative music shows his  oustanding vision and love which he has toward his music.Vasil papadyouk,the violenist appears as guest on this album.The best track I love in this cd is number 6,echoes of the forest1,.Johannes,good work...all the best...buy this cd and you will feel the real passion... :) Viva Johannes...
