 I just purchased this great and outstanding cd,and I love it.This Cd starts with some hot spanish gypsy  style with the lead guitar of Marcus Nand. Ziroq blend the spanish music with pop,latin,also arabic style.The ziroq  express how well they play this music.The most vivid and beautiful of this cd is on some tracks,Marcus plays an outstanding guitar music with fury and passion. The adding the arabic music to the flamenco music is a creative job that Ziroq had done.Oh,yeah,the vocal sound of Marcus really are melodious and gypsy syle,and it matches with this music....After all of these,the track the most I love in this Cd, is number 11,NOMADE,..My heart flies when this song plays.Buy this cd, ENJOY IT.....viva ziroq......
