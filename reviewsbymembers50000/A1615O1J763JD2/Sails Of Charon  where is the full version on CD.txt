 Any of you Scorp Heads from years gone by must remember the vinyl version of "Taken By Force" That had the full version of "The Sails Of Charon" with the psycadelic intro! Why has this version never made it to CD? I keep buying new versions of this CD hoping to find it. If anyone can help me with this please post!
