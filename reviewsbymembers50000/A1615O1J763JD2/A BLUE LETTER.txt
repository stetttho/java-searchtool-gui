 I am a new Cohen brother fanatic! I have owned "Raising Arizona" since it's relesed and have now recently ventured into the "Cohen state of mind". These are movies that captivate and are eye and mind candy. The only Cohen movie so far that left me confused was "Barton Fink". Still, an interesting movie. You need to watch that one more than that once.    "The Hudsucker Proxy" is fantastic! The film flows like a delicious latte'. This is a very unique manner of filmaking, If you are into movies that are a thrill ride. Gotta see this one!      I also recommend highly "Raising Arizona" and "The Big Lebowski" If you like deep movies with lot's of twists, go with a Cohen Brothers film!
