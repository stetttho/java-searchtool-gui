 First off, let me say I love these "Classic Album" DVD's! They are so informative and I love hearing the master tape going through the board while different tracks are pointed out and enjoyed. This disc is every "Dark Side Of Tne Moon" fan's dream come true. For these reviewers that put down this DVD by saying "Phoey, no live stuff!" I usually read the package before I buy something. Since you can't do that with Amazon or other online stores, these reviews are great. No where did it say this was a live concert. The "Classic Album" series has been around for some time now so if you don't want to chance your hard earned 15 bucks (yikes, haha)on something, maybe it's worth finding out what you are getting!    Other great "Classic Album" DVD's are "The Who- Who's Next", "Elton John- Goodbye Yellow Brick Road", "Fleetwood Mac- Rumors" just to name a few. I have quite a few of them and love them all.  A real treat for musicians and fans alike!
