 Ok, my opinion on "Meddle" is it's a great peice from Pink Floyd. From the incredible "One Of These Days" to the opus "Echoes" Which has gotten a new nod with the recent "Hit's" collection. My dogs love "Seamus"!  Now to what I don't get in people like the last reviewer. Comments like :You are not a Pink Floyd fan at all if you don't love this album" I am sorry. You don't need to  love EVERYTHING by a band or artist to make you a fan! Everyone has different tastes and thank God for that or someone like Mr. Roger Waters wouldn't be so unique! To add insult to injury by adding "Not wanting to sound like a fanatic...", looks like ya already did. It reminds me of Trekkies who love every episode of Star Trek. There is good with bad in everything. I love reading people's alternate opinion. That's what makes this forum so great. I also don't agree with this album should have been called "Intro to Dark Side Of The Moon" It is a fine peice all on it's own without being attached to an album released 2 years later. I would be disappointed if "Obscured By Clouds" didn't get released. Which came out in between "Meddle and "Dark Side.." My review in a nut shell: If you are a fan of Pink Floyd's unpredicible genius. You will love "Meddle"!
