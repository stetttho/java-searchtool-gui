 I wished, as everyone did, they just put out the 2 Japan only albums on CD, I wished they had put the oiginal "Slick Black Cadillac". My favorite from QR II. see in the US, Actually QR III should actually be QR V. I only have the secong LP on vinyl and the pressings, even mint have a bit of static. Still this is a Randy dream come true! GRAB this while you still can! "Killer Girls" is a great strip song!
