 Absolutely the best AC/DC album! I am a fan of the Bon Scott era. I am not a big fan of Brian Johnson. Powerage is just that... POWER! Great blues and unbelievable riffs! It is a shame they don't release the alternate version of this album on CD. IT's almost a totally different mix, different endings and intro's on some tracks. Some are minus background vocals, Most missing is the track that has never been released in the US. "Cold Hearted Man"! Dynamite song with awesome Bon vocals. I have 2 copies of the alternate version LP, one from Gremany and one from England.   The Australian version is the same as the US. It's bizzare that it is not more talked about! Hopefully someone involved with the AC/DC catalog, who I believe Sony now owns with these new 2003 reissues, will read this and consider the long lost version be released with all the songs the US is missing from Australia! What a thought!  Long Live Bon!
