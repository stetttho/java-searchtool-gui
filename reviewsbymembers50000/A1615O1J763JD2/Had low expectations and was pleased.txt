 Being a fan of Armand Assanti, he tends to get stuck with odd roles and type-cast as a spanish only person,also being a fan of mob movies, I borrowed this movie from my son. I was very surprised! Well acted and very entertaining! If you like The Sopranos, 4 cast members are in this movie. Ok, this is Hollywood. They have to make the story better than reality and they sure did. If you are a fan of Mob movies you will love this one! ya Gotti trust me!
