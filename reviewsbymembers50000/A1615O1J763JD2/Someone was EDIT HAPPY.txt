 I have the original broadcast I recorded from TV which is the best! The full show! I also have the Laser Disc version which is excellent and includes 3 songs from Metallica, The Guns N' Roses set and the best part (IMO) of the show, the fabulous Extreme tribute medley!Also the Laserdisc starts at the beginning! Whoever threw this edited and poorly transfered video DVD set, is out for the buck, not the fan! Hopefully someone in the Queen camp will read this and make a proper box set of the full concert!
