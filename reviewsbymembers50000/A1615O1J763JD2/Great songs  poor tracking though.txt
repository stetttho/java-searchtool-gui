 First of all, I still have the LP "Messing With The Boys" and always liked it. Being a long time "Runaways" fan, I have been looking for a CD release of this album! Well, here it is! Unfortunetly, the tracking between songs is choppy! That 's a major let down. The track "Beauty Is Only Skin Deep" has static too! Bummer! Although, this CD is worth the 4 stars JUST on it's including the Runaways tracks "Hollywood Dreams", "Strawberry Fields Are Forever" & "Here Comes the Sun" from the rare "Flaming Schoolgirls" LP. Sounding GREAT! Right from the masters! Runaways, Cherie Curie & Jettheads gotta get this! I wonder if the other CD has better tracking. I guess I have to buy that one too to find out! To be continued......
