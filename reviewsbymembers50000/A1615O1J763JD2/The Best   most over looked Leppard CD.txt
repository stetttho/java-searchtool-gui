 When this Cd first came out, I was hesitant. Once the Cd starting playing, I was taken on a wild journey through the creative and often stifled talents of Def Leppard. The album has a variety of sounds and gets away from the poppy controlled "Mutt" Lang productions. This may not be a CD for Def Leppard "Pour Some Sugar.." fans but for music fans that can appriciate change and growth. Unfortunetly, they returned to the pop drone on their latest effort "X". If you want to hear some great music from a great band, buy this one up! I still play this one over and over. Never a dull moment! Great ballads too! "All I Want Is Everything" has some deep great lyrics. Cheers to the boys from Sheffield! Maybe a "Slang II" in the grain of Metallica's much dissed but superior "Load, Re-Load" albums. Some people hate change. I welcome it. Another example is the panned "Carnival Of Souls" by KISS. A dark and experimental masterpeice.   "Slang" will stay in your CD player for some time! Go on, give it and taste! "Slang" with me!
