 I am late on reviewing this book but had to comment. I LOVE this book. Very goog work and research! Great photography! It's so nice to see someone put this much effort in a Monkees collectible book. My only complaint is the records are not valued correctly. We need a Monkees record collecting guide. If not for values, just to see the great world wide covers of the albums, single and EP's that differ from country to country.  Marty Eck ( Is that his real name?)bought most of the items in this book. Since most of us could never afford such a collection or FIND some of these gems, this is a great coffee table book. Again with putting values on collectibles, any kinds, is a matter of supply and demand.  To me, Ebay is where I usually can find recent values. Being a Monkees record collector, I am thinking of joining forces with a major colector in the UK to create the book I always wanted. This book is a great asset to anyone's Monkees collection! Buy it!
