 First let me say to the guy that said Mario must have turned in his grave, he was alive and involved with this production when it was filmed.You should research before making a fool commment and then following it by a stab at mentally handicapped people, you must be quite the human being!    Anyway, like was said this picks up where "The Last Don" left off. Not bad for Television and if you are a fan of Mob-style movies, this is a great endcap to the Mario Puzo legacy. I always thought Joe Mantenga stole the show in "The Last Don" and it's great to have him reprise his role again although the focus is mainly on the younger generation. This may not be "The Sopranos" but very entertaining none the less.
