 This collection, in my opinion, is a better buy that the "Greatest Hits" CD. Just wished Rhino squeezed just a few more in like "D.W Washburn" & "Oh My, My" just to round out the set. Well, for the basic light fan, there is a great selection of hits and best tracks. For the Die-Hard fans there are the Karaoke tracks!! For those who already have the Japanese release by Rhino "Best of with Karaoke", these are mostly different versions minus "I Wanna Be Free". (Theme From) The Monkees is the TRUE music only track to the TV theme version! "I'm a Believer" is not the demo audio only track from the Japanese CD. Also, this collection adds a great karaoke version of "(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone"!  The other 3 karaoke tracks sound better than the Japanese CD. Monkeefanatics must have this! If you never got the Japanese version, That one has the demo Tommy Boyce "Theme.." audio like the bonus track from the Rhino CD issue of "The Monkees" debut album. Also the Japenese "Best of with Karaoke" has "I Wanna Be Free".  So what are ya waiting for?
