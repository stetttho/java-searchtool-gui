 Cheers to RHINO for finally putting this set out! I am a long time Monkees fan and collector. This is a dream come true. I heard rumor the second season is coming out in October of 2003! The video looks so good! The audio sounds as good as it could. The extra "stuff" is great even if they didn't have the masters to all the commercials. I have NO complaints! I LOVE the mini 45 sleeves! People have complained that they will scratch the DVD. Maybe if you are an animal! Be careful, let them slide out easy and they will keep find! Also, if you slide them back easy, the disc won't wreck the cool sleeves. Want things to last? It's your job to take care of them! Long live RHINO and long live The Monkees!
