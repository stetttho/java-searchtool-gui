 How any Priest fan can give this less than 5 stars is beyond me! This DVD is "LOADED"! You get all the videos, rare appearances, PLUS the entire Turbo Live concert! All this for 12 bucks? This is a great DVD for any true Judas Priest fan! With Rob Halford back in the band, I am sure other DVD's will become available. This makes a great companion to the "Iron Maiden- Visions Of The Beast" DVD if, like most Priest fans, you are a Maiden fan too.
