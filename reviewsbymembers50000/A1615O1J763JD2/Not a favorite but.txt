 I had to make a comment to a prior review that said: "HAPPY ENDING: Mercifully, this is the only Elton album that has not been released on compact disc in America!  Little hint, look at the product detail, you are not only reviewing a CD version but the remastered CD! Your review doesn't hold much water when you review a CD you don't even own! Although this is not by means anything I would recommend to a friend, being a EJ completest, I do know the story of why Elton lended his vocals to this one off project. I own the CD, I admitted it!
