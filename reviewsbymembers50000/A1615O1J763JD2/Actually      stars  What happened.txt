 First, it's hard to write a review after the great one Mark Jones did. A few pointers I wanted to point out having the "John Lennon Video Collection" on Laserdisc. I don't understand why Yoko messed with the original videos. All The videos from "Milk And Honey" are sadly replaced with what I feel inferior versions. Not the versions we all remember that comforted us after John's life was taken. The one thing I DID like was that they fixed the audio speed for "Slippin' & Slidin'". It was way too fast on the video collection. If you don't have the Video collection..track it down! It's worth keeping. Yoko oh Yoko, you messed it up again. Not to say there is some great footage here!
