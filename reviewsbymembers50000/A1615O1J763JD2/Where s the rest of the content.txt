 Wow! I just shelled out a lot and got jipped! I was expecting a book(at least)of the lyrics and original photo artwork! I actually have to keep my original CD's! So, basically I bought this set for the bonus tracks! Also, the live Tokyo stuff from the first "EP" sounds like it was taken straight from the old video! Sound quality lacks. Remasterered? I have been a fan of Queensryche from the EP. I had all the records (until CD came out) then bought the CD versions, now I figured this package would be the best AND most economical way to go. I wished I had followed my first thought and bought them individual! QUEENSRYCHE fans, don't do what I did! They should have called this set "No Photo's or Lyrics Included!"
