 Since this is a hits package, one of which the band doesn't rip off the buyer by adding a bonus unreleased track like so many other artists do, I felt this was a good spot to praise one of the great bands that kept rock on the map and don't go by trend. I don't even have this collection because I have all their albums. If you are a fan of the 70's era Stones or the Faces and haven't heard the Crowes, check this collection out! Unfortunetly, this CD was released in 2002 and doesn't include tunes from their over-looked and great LP "Lions". These guys will make you smile and groove, doobie in hand or not!    If I were in charge of this collection I would have to make it a double CD. Too many damn good songs missing! People kinda lost interest or John "Q" public forgot about them after "Amorica". What a shame because "Three Snakes And One Charm", Their 4th effort is incredible and you get a taste here.    In 1998, they re-released the first 4 CD's and if you bought the box set you got a live EP. This is a great starter and grab "Lions". Then I bet you will go back and get the rest!
