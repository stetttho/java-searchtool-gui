 This is a true gem of a story about love and family. Richard Dreyfuss, Holly Hunter and Danny Aiello should have all been nominated for oscar's for their incredible performances in this quiet masterpeice. If you don't shed a tear and feel better about your life after watching this film. You are missing emotion. What surprises me is why this has never gotten released on DVD yet! Buy It! Rent It! Watch it! and "Fly To The Moon"!
