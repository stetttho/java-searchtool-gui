 They could have squeezed a bit more onto each DVD. Only 6 episodes in a 3 DVD set? I have The Monkess Season One set and with 6 DVD's they fit 32! I know that these shows are longer but really not by much sans the commercials. All in all though I am thrilled to have these finally "uncut" on DVD! I don't have the "Trio" network, which airs them so, this was a relief! Dan & Dick are probally the best "funny/straight man" duo of all time. I hope Volume 2 is packed more!
