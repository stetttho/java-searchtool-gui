 I have been a longtime Meatloaf fan and have always been nervous when a new album was coming out. Especially in a case where Jim Steinman isn't involved. To my surprise, I don't even miss a steinman composition! This album is great from beginning to (hidden) end. There is a bonus hidden track of the well covered "Mercury Blues". The thing I found surprising is that a frequent co-writer is none other than that Motley man, Nikki Sixx! What a great job he does! Sure, out of Meatloaf's now 8 studio album collection, a few fall short, but not this one! If you love The Meat, You gotta get this one! You will be more than satisfied and want to "Testify" that Meatloaf is still a musical must in the new century! Some stand out tracks are the title track, "Did I Say That", "Tear Me Down", "Man Of Steel", "Love You Out Loud" and hell, the whole rest of the album!    Cheers to The Meat! Keep on stunning me!
