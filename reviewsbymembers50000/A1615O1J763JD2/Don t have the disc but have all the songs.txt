 I think Joey did a great job compiling these tracks. It's great to see some of the later lesser known tracks on here that Rock hard and fast! "Mama's Boy" from "Too Tough Too Die" just shows how the crew grew into deeper stuff. Looking over these tracks, there isn't a bad cut in the lot! Joey has good taste! May he forever rest in peace!
