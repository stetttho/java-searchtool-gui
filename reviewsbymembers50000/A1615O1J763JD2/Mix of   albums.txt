 Don't quite understand why such a collection would be put together. This is basically a mix of the 2 Krokus albums "Stampede" and To Rock Or Not To Be", with "You Ain't Seen Nothing yet" as a bonus. The later being the reunion track that brought the original line up together with Marc Storace at the vox! Stampede has Peter Tanner on vocals. Personally, a much better deal is to get the double CD set of both albums "complete" with "You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet" 12 inch mix and regular mix as 2 bonus tracks. "To Rock Or Not To Be Rocked" is an awesome album! Stampede is ok, but you really miss Storace singing.
