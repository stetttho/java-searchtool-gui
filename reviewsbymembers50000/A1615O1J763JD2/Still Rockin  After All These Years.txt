 I am a long time fan of The Monkees. I am so glad King Biscuit had the guts to release a Monkees DVD Live! This is without a doubt a great taste of what went on during the Monkees Final Tour. Of course and unfortunately without Micheal Nesmith. Regardless, Micky, Davy & Peter put on a musically sound show. Playing the hits and songs from the TV show. Some songs were cut. I wished they had kept in "Porpoise Song", "Listen To The Band" and" Since I Fell For You" which really shows off Mickys voice!  It's too bad that Peter was fired after this show.    The DVD was filmed great and the audio is awesome! Better than the CD's sold at the last few years concerts. It captures the energy of the 3 and shows the real talent they have. Peter is fabulous on all the instruments played! Too bad Micky only plays drums on "Mary, Mary", he is one of the most underrated drummers! Davy does not just shake a tamborine, He is an acomplished guitarist and his voice is great! Every Monkees fan should own this!
