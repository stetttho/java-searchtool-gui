 That is the dumbest thing I ever heard! Worshiping every single note from a band or artist is scarey. Doesn't make you a fan it makes you a fanatic! Every band has peeks and valleys. Maiden is a prime example of this. This album is ok at best and guess what......I am a Maiden fan. Will I be be-headed now? This is a free country and everyone has freewill and tastes. This is why I read reviews. To get people's opinions!
