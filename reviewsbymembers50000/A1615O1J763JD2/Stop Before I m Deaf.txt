 I have every Meatloaf CD including this sad effort. There are NO stand out tracks on this CD and I LOVE Meatloaf. It's seems that Marvin tried to sound too much like the era music and that's not what he is loved for. Proof positive on the less thatn sltellar writing of this album is the exclusion of any of these songs on his "Very Best Of.." CD. Buy any other Meatloaf Cd, just not this one! His latest to date "Couldn't Have Said It Better" is a masterpeice and without the help of Jim writing the songs! I am here to review this CD though. His only album on Atlantic Records and I wonder why they never let him do another? Hmm..     Meatloaf is one of the most underrated Rock and Roll gems but this album is a poor example of that. Try "Bad Attitude" or "Dead Ringer" if your looking for the more unknown Meatloaf. Even "Midnight at the Lost And Found" Is better. His best are "Bat Of Ouf Hell", "Bat Out Of Hell II: Back Into Hell", "Welcome To The Neighborhood" and his latest I already mentioned.
