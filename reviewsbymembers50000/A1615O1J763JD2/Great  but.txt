 Being a Motley-head since the leathur album, this is a great collection. Let me get the few complaints out of the way. The original Leathur mixes are from a pristine record. Not from the masters. Which I found odd because "Stick To Your Guns" & the "Too Fast for Love" (bonus alternate intro version) from the Crucial Crue remasters are from the masters. "TFFL" bonus alternate intro version IS the leathur mix, So on this set you get the same version twice. One from Vinyl and the master tape. A bit odd and redundent. So you have to keep the Crucial Crue "TFFL" to get the master tape version of Stick To Your Guns". You can hear slight suface noice on the Leathur mixes and a few "pops" but hell, If you are a crue nut like me, you aren't gonna find a copy sounding this good for the price PLUS it's on CD! My other complaint is there is no album artwork or lyrics so I need to keep the "Crucial Crue" CD's, again redundent. It's great to get the Japanese extra tracks that eventually came out in the US on the Hip-O re-reissues of the crucial Crue series.Especially the GREAT demo of " Too Young To Fall In Love", it is kickin'! I still have the "Beyond" Crucial Series, so this is cool.  As far as most box sets go, they include lots of previously unreleased material which this set doesn't (except the Leathur album) I doubt I will be buying the next 3 sets that are planned for the one bonus track that was added on the Japan reissues. Nikki, add some unreleased gems and you have my $$! I would LOVE to have the single versions of "Stick To Your Guns" since it is so different (hint). To me, the set is worth it JUST to get the far superior Leathur version of "TFFL". The wait is over Motley heads! you too can own these great gems, it's worth the bucks! Take me to the top!
