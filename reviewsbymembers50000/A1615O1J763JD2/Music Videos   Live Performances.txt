 I don't understand how one veiwer gave this DVD 3 stars because it wasn't all "live". No where on the package does it mislead you. To alot of Journey fans like myself, this is an awesome package to get all of Journey's videos, some never seen before on MTV. Many of the live cuts are the actual clips that were shown on MTV back in the day when MTV was a music video channel. Thank God for VH1's new digital channel "VH1 Classic" They have shown some of the lesser seen videos like "Just The Same Way". I wondered, why don't they put out a collection of these cool videos...whata ya know! Here it is! Sounding great too. This really makes you crave the original Journey line-up. The first time I saw Journey live was the "Evolution" tour and was lucky enough to get back stage passes and meet the guys. This was Journey at their most magical in my opinion.   They went on to replace Greg Rollie for Johnathan Cain who changed the feel to a more radio friendly "Journey". Not that that was bad, it was part of the "evolution". To me though, Steve Perry is the most missing in today's line-up. I have all their CD's right up to the last ep "Red 13" which isn't bad but isn't like the ole Journey.    Fans of Journey will love this DVD! They took the time to make this collection look and sound great! Flashback to a better time in music and "Don Stop Believin'"!
