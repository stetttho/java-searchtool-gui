 You have to see this movie if you love comedy or horseracing or Richard Dreyfus or just wanna have fun! David Johanson, that fab frontman from the very first glam band "New York Dolls" is a GREAT actor! Made me laugh my a** off! I actually have this on the ancient Laserdisc format and went nuts finding the DVD! Gotta get it! If you are a DVD nut like me, you know you can't depend on regular stores to stock everything! Gotta get this one online. What are you waiting for?
