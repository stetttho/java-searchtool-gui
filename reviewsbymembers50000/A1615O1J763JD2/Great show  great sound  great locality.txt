 Let's be frank first, you have to be a fan of David Cassidy to enjoy this DVD. I am assuming the bad reviewer is not a fan. The show is great and filmed great. Great pre-show footage too! Here's a little hint on how to get this cheaper from Amazon, Use there canadian site since this is a Canadian pressed DVD. (www.amazon.ca) It sells for 27.88 (CAD) which is about 21 US dollars. A lot better than 35 dollars. Great show and well worth the USD or CAD!
