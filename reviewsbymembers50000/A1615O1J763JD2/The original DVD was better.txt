 I am glad I kept the original MPI DVD with the Stereo remixed versions of the songs. The music sounds flat and muddy. The only advatage to this version is that is widescreen. The bonus features are not all that great. I figured when this movie got released for a second time on DVD it would be far superior. My mistake! If you are lucky enough to find the original DVD, I recommend that over this. It's a shame seeing how well "Yellow Submarine was done and the Anthology DVD set. I wasn't even happy with the packaging. When I saw the DVD I though "This is it?". Very bland like the audio and the bonus features. Why didn't Apple give this their superior treatment? Boo for Miramax!
