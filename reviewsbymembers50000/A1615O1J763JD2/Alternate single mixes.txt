 If you are like me, you have all her great CD's. This is basically a collection of tunes from her first 3 albums. The great thing about this collection is it contains 3 very alternate mixes to 3 songs that take on a whole new personality to the tunes! "No One Else On Earth", this version rocks! cool play with her vocals and added percussion! "It's Only Love" & "Rock Bottom" differ alot too. In some cases better than the original. I can finally throw out my lousey cassette singles! Now I am waiting for Volume Two to get more remixes! Ahem, Curb/MCA! By the way...if you haven't, grab her latest CD as of this posting, "What The World Needs Now Is Love", and no, it's not the Burt Bacharach song! (thank God!) It rocks!
