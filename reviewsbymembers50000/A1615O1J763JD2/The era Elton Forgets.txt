 Back in the Reg Dwight Days, it was common play for "sound-alike" albums to be released in the late 60's and early 70's. I remember having a few on the Pickwick label. Even though Sir Elton doesn't ever talk about doing these tracks, they are a hoot! The quality is surprisingly good, although there are many labels that put this out. I have the one with this cover and it's on RPM International, which is under Pickwick. Some of the tracks don't sound like Elton but there are definitly some great tracks with Elton doing his best at these covers. Best tracks for me were Badfinger's "Come And Get It", Cat Stevens' "Lady D'Arbanville", The Beach Boys version of "Cottonfields" and "My Baby Loves Lovin'" could pass as an early track like his own "I've Been Loving You". If you are an Elton fan like me, this is a must! I took a star away because I doubt that ALL songs are Elton singing.
