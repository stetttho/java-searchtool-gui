 Whether you are a surfer(haven't been since I was a kid), or someone that likes to see amazing wild footage of people who have a love for, to me, one of God's greatest creations next to Anna Kournikova, The Oceans, this is a "must see"! You don't have to be a surfer to go nuts over the great filming of this docu-film. If you don't live on either coast, you will feel like you do after seeing this. If you are someone who would love to give your TV and mind a drug-free trip, you gotta see this! Visually Spectacular and no special effects!   For the surfer, this is the DVD to have! These incredible surfers can't say any better why people surf. So step off the concrete......and step into liquid!
