 Sure, this CD is great, I will get to that ..but I just read a review on here by someone who called her a "New" country star! I hope you are just kidding around or have been in a cave for the past few decades but as of this posting, Wynonna has been in the music business, be it Country or rock or even "cross-over" which is a doubtful genre (I hate genre's!), for Twenty-One (21)years! Ever hear of that little know duo "The Judds"? (LOL) Anyway this Cd is great but "Tell Me Why" is still my favorite even after hearing her latest "What The World Needs Now Is Love". All great CD's! Still would love a complete Judds reunion with the original band mates as well! With Don Potter on the helm!
