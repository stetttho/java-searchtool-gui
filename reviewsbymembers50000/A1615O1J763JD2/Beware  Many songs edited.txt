 If you are a casual fan, this is a great collection. If you are a major fan like myself and looking for cleaner mixes of these great classics, BEWARE! Many of these songs are not the full versions! To fit another song on the disc, some songs have been chopped from their original length. Such a shame, this would have been a great collection!
