 In my four and a half years of working in the bookstore of a major computer retailing chain, this was, in its various editions, the book I consistently recommended to customers looking for that proverbial  "good book on HTML," and everyone who I happened to see again  agreed that it was a great purchase. Like the rest of the Peachpit Visual  Quickstarts, this book covers HTML in its latest incarnation in a  straightforward, understandable way, without wasting time on stupid  "humor" like the Dummies books. The examples are well illustrated  and explained, and the book includes useful extras like a chart of the  "safe" internet colors. Like I used to say to my customers as I  handed them this title in the midst of our huge HTML section, "This is  the book."
