 It's hard to picture any expedition more ineptly run than Scott's, but the Karluk expedition was indeed even worse. And while Scott's mistakes were exposed for the world to see, the leader of the Karluk expedition,  Vilhjalmur Stefansson, was so successful in covering up his that he was  lionized after his return by the National Geographic Society and no less a  personage than Robert Peary.   This book was written some sixty years after  the fact by a survivor of the expedition, and while the execution could be  better, this is an interesting tale that provides a useful counterpoint to  the story of the Endurance. While Sir Ernest Shackleton, through his  courage, self-sacrifice, and leadership saved every one of his men when the  Endurance was crushed in the ice and sunk, when the Karluk was similarly  beset the vile Stefansson left his men to die.
