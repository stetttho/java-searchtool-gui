 This is a great edition of the collected letters of Pliny the Younger, ably translated and introduced by Betty Radice who for many years was the  editor of the Penguin Classics. While many readers will immediately look  for Pliny's most famous letters, i.e. his description of the eruption of  Vesuvius, written for his friend Tacitus, and his letter to the Emperor  Trajan asking for an opinion on how to deal with those troublesome  Christians, there's a great deal more here, including Pliny writing on  ghosts, talking about Roman politics and law, and just chatting to his  friends. Especially interesting is the final section of letters which Pliny  wrote to the Emperor Trajan when Pliny was the emperor's representative in  Pontus and Bithynia. Pliny's obsequious tone is quite different from his  personal letters, and I can almost picture Trajan rolling his eyes when his  secretary arrived with another of Pliny's overly deferential missives.  Overall there's a lot to enjoy here; not only do we obtain a unique glimpse  into the workings of the Roman Empire at its height under one of its best  emperors, but we also get more of a feel for Pliny than we do for Cicero in  his equally famous but often less personable letters.
