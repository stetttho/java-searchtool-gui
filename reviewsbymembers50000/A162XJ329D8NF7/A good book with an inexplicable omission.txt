 This is a well-written and researched guide to a number of the famous ships of exploration, from Cook's ships to some that are exploring currently. Fans of Antarctic exploration in particular will be pleased to see Scott's Terra Nova, Shackleton's Nimrod and Endurance, Charcot's Pourquoi-Pas?, Amundsen's Fram, and other great ships of the Antarctic included, with rare photographs and descriptions of their entire career. Causing the book to lose one star, in my ratings estimation, is the inexplicable absence of the Aurora, the ship used in the 1912 expedition of Douglas Mawson and later as the Ross Sea supporting ship for the 1914 Shackleton expedition. Other than that, a worthwhile addition to the library of anyone interested in exploration, adventure, and great ships.
