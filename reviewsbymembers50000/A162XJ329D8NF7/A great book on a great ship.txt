 John McKay's book is well up to the very high standard set by the "Anatomy of the Ship" series and covers HMS Victory in fantastic detail. Anyone interested in the ship (or other sailing warships of the period, which would be similar in detail) and especially anyone interested in building a model of the Victory should add this book to their collection. My one disappointment with McKay is that he didn't include any drawings and only one illustration showing HMS Victory in her pre-1801 condition with her original elaborate figurehead and open stern galleries; the book entirely focuses on her appearance at Trafalgar - admittedly her most famous battle but she was also Sir John Jervis's flagship at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent and it would have been useful to have more data on her pre-reconstruction configuration. Another book well worth having on the Victory is C. Nepean Longridge's "The Anatomy of Nelson's Ships," which I also highly recommend.
