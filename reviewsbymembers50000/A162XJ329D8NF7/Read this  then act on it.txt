 Contrary to the claims of Dennis Avery in his posted review, even the  scientists who discovered that parasite infestations do cause some frog  deformities do not claim that parasites cause all the deformities or that  they cause all types of observed deformities. This book is well written and  absolutely terrifying; its only real fault is lack of an index. Souder is  familiar with his topic and the people involved and has written a clear,  compelling account of this scientific mystery. Unfortunately, people with  well-established biases will continue to ignore the message nature is  sending us; that humanity has become an absolute plague on the face of the  earth. We can no longer continue to breed like a virus and expect earth to  recover from our insults. Frog deformities and massive drops in amphibian  species worldwide are just the tip of the coming iceberg that will sink our  civilization like the Titanic unless we sit up and take notice. Read this  book, think about it, and for your children and grandchildren's sake, do  something about it.
