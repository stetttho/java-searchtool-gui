 It's a shame that George Orwell's two best-known novels, "Animal Farm" and "Nineteen Eighty Four" are neither one his best novel. The peak of Orwell's fiction is this almost forgotten novel,  "Coming Up for Air." Set in the last few years before a World War  II that was obviously looming on the horizon, this elegant book memorably  chronicles the life of George Bowling and his attempt to escape domesticity  and the horrors to come for a few days by visiting his old home town. Every  time I reread "Coming Up for Air," I wonder what Orwell might  have achieved if he had lived longer and had not been as ill as he was in  the ten years that remained to him. If all you've read of Orwell is his two  "famous" novels, you owe it to yourself to read this.
