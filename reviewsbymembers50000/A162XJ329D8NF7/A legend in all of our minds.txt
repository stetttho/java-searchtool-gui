 Ten years after, "Pump Up the Volume" holds up brilliantly as a  glimpse of American youth culture. While the film is uneven (the best parts  are "Harry's" radio interludes), it suggests that even in a time  of plenty, growing up is just as difficult - maybe more so - than it ever  was (especially when all the great themes have been used and turned into  theme parks!). The one lingering disappointment I have with this film is  that neither director Allan Moyle nor star Christian Slater have yet lived  up to the promise they showed in this film. But there's still time.
