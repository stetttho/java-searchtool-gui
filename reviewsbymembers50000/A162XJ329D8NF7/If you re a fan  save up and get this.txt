 It's past time that someone put some thought and effort into a book of  this nature. We've had "Science Fiction TV" guides before, and  they've uniformly been written by authors whose axes could be heard  grinding away throughout as they slagged shows they disliked and drooled  over shows they (often unaccountably) were fans of. Mark Phillips and Frank  Garcia have done a good job of research and writing here, with few and  minor mistakes. The chapter on "Battlestar Galactica," which is  accurate and contains a good deal of information, much of it from new  interviews done especially for this book, is worth the price of admission  alone. If you're a fan of science fiction on TV, this book, in spite of its  price, should be on your bookshelf. Very highly recommended.
