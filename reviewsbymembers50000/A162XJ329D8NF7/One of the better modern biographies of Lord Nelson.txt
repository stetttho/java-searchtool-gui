 There have been three biographies of Nelson written in the past few years that are worth reading; Tom Pocock's, Christopher Hibbert's, and this one by the Howarths. Pocock's is in many ways the most enjoyable to read,  Hibbert's has some new information, but "Nelson: The Immortal  Memory" is my own favorite and a good selection for someone just  beginning to find out about the contradictory, fascinating man who was  unquestionably the greatest fighting admiral who ever lived and whose  memory lives on in the modern Royal Navy.
