 If one tenth of this book's charges are true, the former captain of the Iowa, his executive officer, and all of the admirals and lower ranks involved in the coverup of this accident should be hanged from the yardarm.  Their efforts to make an understandable ammunition loading accident look  like a supposedly gay sailor's violent suicide are beyond the pale. Anyone  who, like me, is appalled at the increasingly pathetic state of the surface  fleet, should read this book and then write their congressman. The Navy  needs to be cleaned up from top to bottom, and as a kicker, the military's  asinine policy on gays and the paranoia it evidently inspires has got to  go.
