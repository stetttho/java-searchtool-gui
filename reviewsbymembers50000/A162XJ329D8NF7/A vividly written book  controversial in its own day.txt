 It's worth knowing that this book was originally commissioned by the Left Book Club, a Socialist book club in the UK, and when the manuscript arrived they realized Orwell had delivered more than they'd bargained for. In part  one, Orwell brilliantly reports on the atrocious living and working  conditions in northern England in the 1930s. His chapter covering his visit  to a coal mine has been often anthologized, but the entire section consists  of equally vivid portraits. In part two, Orwell discusses Socialism with  such a jaundiced eye that it had the editors of the Left Book Club  wondering if they could get away with printing only the first half of the  book! Orwell did not fully believe in Socialism until he fought in the  Spanish Civil War after "Wigan Pier" was printed, and contrary to  the right-wingers who have claimed him as one of their own, Orwell was a  dedicated Socialist to the day he died, but a skeptical one.  Read  "Wigan Pier," and for more information, read Orwell's diary he  kept during his trip to the north in Volume 1 of the Collected Essays.
