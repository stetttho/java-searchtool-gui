 What a shame that Mitchell's "Rome Trilogy" ("Procurator," "New Barbarians" and "Cry Republic") is out of print. He brilliantly brings the Roman Empire  forward to modern times with likely technological "improvements"  and introduces several marvelously memorable characters, most notably Gaius  Julius Agricola, the Procurator of this title. If you can find this and the  two sequels anywhere, read them. They're a real pleasure. And how sad that  the Empire had to decline and fall....
