 Anyone who has read Jon Krakauer's "Into Thin Air" should read this as well. I was curious to get a chance to hear Dr. Beck Weathers' side of the story, and he tells it in a straightforward way, not blaming anyone  for the tragedy that left him with multiple amputations and several other  people dead, when in fact there was plenty of blame to go around. What is  off-putting are the included comments from Dr. Weathers' wife, who clearly  does not understand him in the least and has consistently refused to share  any of his interests (one fine example being her comment that she wouldn't  go sailing with him because the boat wasn't air conditioned) and then  complains that he has ignored his family. Well, it seems as if there is  plenty of blame to go in both directions. Fortunately it's fairly easy to  skim over the family dysfunction stuff and concentrate on the climbing. Dr.  Weathers is a courageous, humorous man, and he seems to have survived his  ordeal in better order than might have been expected. You'll finish the  book wishing him well, as I do.
