 This new book combines Charles Laseron's 1947 "South With Mawson" and Frank Hurley's 1948 "Shackleton's Argonauts" in one volume, continuing the wonderful flood of reprints relating to the  heroic era of Antarctic exploration. Laseron's account of the 1912 Mawson  expedition is full of human interest, and makes a useful adjunct to  Mawson's own, somewhat drier account in "Home of the Blizzard."  Laseron was a careful observer of his surroundings and his fellow  expedition members, and his writing style is vivid and often humorous. This  half of the book includes photographs by expedition photographer Frank  Hurley, whose own memoirs of the Endurance voyage make up the second half  of the book. Frank Hurley's "Shackleton's Argonauts" is a  gripping description of the Endurance expedition, also illustrated with  some of Hurley's magnificent photographs. Having served with both Sir  Douglas Mawson and Sir Ernest Shackleton, Hurley compares the two men in a  couple of wonderful paragraphs, concluding "Shackleton grafted science  onto exploration; Mawson added exploration onto science," a very good  way of summing up the differences between the leaders. Hurley also shows  himself to have been an early environmentalist, and expresses in no  uncertain terms his horror of the South Atlantic whaling industry and its  slaughter of those great animals, commenting "I had marvelled at the  devices that enabled man's ingenuity to triumph over nature's moods and  most powerful creatures, but I marvelled still more that man was unable to  triumph over the seemingly more potent monster of his creating; its name is  greed," to which I can only add, "amen." Anyone interested  in Antarctic exploration will want to add this valuable reprint to their  library, and I cannot recommend it more highly.
