 My former boss at the computer retailer where I worked was an early adopter of the USRobotics Pilot, as it then was, and I could do little but follow his wise lead. Well, the PalmPilot, or Palm as it now is, has  continued to improve and we've both moved on to later models. David Pogue's  book is the one I recommended to my customers looking for a book to  accompany their PalmPilot purchase. It is comprehensive, well-written, and  includes a wonderfully useful CD of add-on software in both free and trial  versions. If you own a Palm of any model or version, from the very first  128K Pilot to the latest iterations of the Palm V and VII, you need this  book. You especially need this book if you sync your Palm to a Macintosh,  as Pogue, Mac enthusiast that he is, is about the only author writing Palm  books who has paid much attention to using the Palm with the Macintosh  platform.
