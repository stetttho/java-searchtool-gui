 This is the definitive book about the United States Marine Corps during the Second World War. Leckie vividly tells their stories in a clear, personal style that brings their honor and courage alive for those of us  fortunate enough to live in the world they saved. As the daughter of a  Korean War Marine and the great-niece of a Marine who fought on Iwo Jima, I  cannot recommend this book highly enough to anyone interested in the  Marines and their contribution in World War Two.
