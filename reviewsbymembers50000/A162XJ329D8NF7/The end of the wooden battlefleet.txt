 It's a shame that this highly interesting book has been permitted to go out of print, particularly as the era it describes is one widely ignored by naval historians. At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, it rapidly became evident that steam was going to supplement and eventually replace sail as the motive power of future navies. Lambert describes in fascinating detail the efforts of the Royal Navy to make the transition, first by equipping older ships with auxiliary steam engines, then by purpose-designing wooden battleships to be fitted with engines from the start. For a short period, these massive, dignified-looking ships with their retractable funnels, hoisting screws, and enormous, often badly-stressed wooden hulls ruled the seas. Lambert's research into the original sources is comprehensive and his discoveries often clash with accepted wisdom; it's Lambert's opinion that explosive shells did not doom the wooden fleet, but the lesser-known and extremely deadly Martin's molten iron shell, which was essentially a hollow cannon ball filled with molten iron and an understandably effective incendiary. The molten iron shell and the fact that wood had reached (and passed) its limit as a structural material ended the wooden steam battleship; when HMS Warrior appeared on the scene, the wooden ships vanished rapidly into harbor service and the breaker's yards. Lambert covers this period well and if you can find this book it's a great addition to your naval history collection.
