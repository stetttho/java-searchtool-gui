 Although modern writers discussing the events of the Endurance expedition have indeed pretty much forgotten this side of the expedition, it should be pointed out that Sir Ernest Shackleton himself covered it in his own book  "South." Bickel has used recently found documentation and other  materials to put together the complete tale of the Ross Sea Party of the  Endurance expedition. After their ship Aurora was pulled away from her  moorings by a storm, the men left on shore brilliantly improvised stores  and equipment to lay the depots required for the planned crossing the  Antarctic continent. During their sledging journeys one man died, and the  survivors had to struggle to save two more (who ultimately were lost  through their own foolishness in crossing sea ice when a storm threatened).  All in all this is a valuable contribution to the story of the Endurance  expedition. I also very highly recommend "Mawson's Will" by the  same author.
