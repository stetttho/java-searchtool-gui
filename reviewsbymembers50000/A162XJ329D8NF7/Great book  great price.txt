 Conway's History of the Ship is a very good series indeed, and this is, to my mind, one of the most valuable books in the series because it covers an era in naval history little discussed elsewhere, the years between the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the coming of the dreadnought battleship. Fortunately, this great team effort fills the gap. Among the contributors are Andrew Lambert and David K. Brown, both authors of notable works about this period that are not currently in print. The authors cover developments with a focus on the Royal Navy and French Navy, but do not ignore developments elsewhere, and the chapter on the American Civil War will prove a useful introduction to those who may not realize what a crucible of experimentation that conflict proved to be. Other chapters cover the development of paddle warships, the steam-auxiliary ships of the line, warships built of iron, the introduction of steel as the material of choice, and the final pre-Dreadnought era. Given chapters of their own are the development of the torpedo boat, early submarines, naval armament and armor, and a very useful chapter on the varying kinds of steam engines in use during the period. The book is well illustrated with period photographs and illustrations. It would be a useful addition to your naval history library at any price.
