 This is a good edition of two of Tacitus' works, the Agricola, which is a short biography of his father-in-law, and the Germania, a look at the Roman view of the Germans (timely at the moment in view of the opening scenes of  Ridley Scott's film "Gladiator"). I am especially fond of the  Agricola, in particular the last few pages, where Tacitus is finished with  the biography and can speak about Agricola like a son. His love and  admiration for his father-in-law still reaches us, almost 2000 years later.  Anyone interested in Rome owes it to themselves to read the source  documents, and this is a good start.
