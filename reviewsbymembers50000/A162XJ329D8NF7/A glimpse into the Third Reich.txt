 Dr. Bruno Manz has written an honest, searing story of his experiences  growing up in the Third Reich with a father who he loved but who was an  enthusiastic Nazi. First person accounts of this quality are rare and  valuable, giving those of us who are curious as to how a civilized nation  like Germany could turn itself into the soulless, mechanistic killing  machine it became under Hitler a look at how ordinary people contributed,  by omission or commission, to the coming horror. Dr. Manz has more than  atoned for his own omissions by writing this excellent, gripping book,  which I recommend to anyone interested in this perplexing episode of  history.
