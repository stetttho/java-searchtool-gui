 British master modeler Tony Greenland has produced a useful, beautifully illustrated book describing his favorite model building techniques, tools, finishing supplies, and the weathering method he was using at the time he  wrote it (people who have argued that Greenland's models are "too  pretty" should know he is weathering his models more extensively now).  Greenland is probably one of the best scratchbuilders in the business and  his models have been used as masters for the production of resin kits. His  discussion of scratchbuilding techniques is worth the price of the book  alone. He finishes with a gallery of inspirational photographs of some of  his models. Although some may find this book a little one-note in its focus  on German armor of WWII, armor modelers of all stripes and interests will  find many useful tips and information. Well worth your time and money.
