 This is a good new business book that posits that today's businesspeople can learn from the leadership example of Sir Ernest Shackleton as displayed during his famous 1914-1916 Endurance expedition. The author takes lessons  from Shackleton's experience, his own experiences as a Marine Corps officer  in Vietnam, and from the business world, and contrasts them with examples  from unsuccessul expeditions and businesses. He and his coauthors then  finish up with a series of cases from the real world that illuminate the  thesis, especially the tragic Malden Mills fire, in which Aaron Feuerstein  was able to show truly Shackleton-like leadership characteristics and care  for his employees. Not only will businesspeople learn valuable lessons in  leadership from this book, but it can serve as a useful introduction to  Shackleton's adventures.
