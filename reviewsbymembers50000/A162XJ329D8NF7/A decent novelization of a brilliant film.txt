 Dewey Gram has produced a readable novelization of Ridley Scott's brilliant new film "Gladiator." There are some minor dialogue differences from the film and a few extra scenes, and he doesn't go into  the character's motivations as much he might, but he at least does slip in  some historical details and the book is a nice substitute for the film  until the VHS and DVD versions are available! It would have been useful,  incidentally, to include an afterword pointing out the differences between  the film's version of history and what really happened. Interested readers  are directed to book I of Gibbon's "Decline and Fall of the Roman  Empire" which, no surprise, begins with Commodus.
