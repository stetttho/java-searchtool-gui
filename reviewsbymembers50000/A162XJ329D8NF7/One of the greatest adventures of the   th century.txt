 Frank Worsley begins his book just as he realizes that his ship Endurance is doomed to be crushed in the ice, and that's a good place to start, for the adventure was only about to begin. Worsley not only discusses the  events of the Endurance expedition but his own adventures in WWI, during  which his Q-ship rammed and sank a German U-boat, and his final expedition  with Sir Ernest Shackleton in 1922 aboard the Quest. Read this, also read  "Shackleton's Boat Journey" by Worsley, and of course  Shackleton's own book "South." My only complaint about this new  edition of Worsley's book is the addition of a preface by the tendentious,  trendy, wildly overrated Patrick O'Brian, who clearly doesn't have the  faintest idea what he's writing about. Read the original intro by Admiral  of the Fleet Earl Jellicoe, ignore O'Brian, and learn what courage and  leadership truly are.
