 SimCity 2000 has been around for awhile, but don't let that hold you back from buying it, especially at this price. Although not as graphically beautiful as SimCity 3000, it is considerably more playable and almost as detailed. In addition to the ability to design and build your own city, something that can be endlessly fascinating, there are several interesting scenarios good for an hour or two of play. Also, this game is well worth your consideration if you have an older computer. It runs beautifully on everything from a 486-66 up. If you haven't played SimCity 2000 yet, you owe it to yourself to check out the game I firmly believe was Maxis' finest creation.
