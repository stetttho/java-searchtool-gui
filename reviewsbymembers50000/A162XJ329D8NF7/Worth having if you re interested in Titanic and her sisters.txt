 Definitely good value for the money, although the author makes some unaccountable errors; there are at least 2 photos of Britannic captioned as being Titanic and a couple shots of wooden patterns for Olympic's turbine  engine captioned as being the engine itself; these are so obvious I'm  suprised McCluskie missed them. As other reviewers here have pointed out a  lot of the shots are of Olympic; in many of the photos an easy way to tell  which shots are of what is to look for hull numbers stenciled on the parts.  Anything numbered 400 is from Olympic, 401 is Titanic, and 433 is  Britannic. Not a perfect book, but a useful addition to anyone's Titanic  collection.
