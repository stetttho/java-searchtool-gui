 Casual glancers at the title of this book about the 1912 Scott expedition may automatically assume that it refers to the death of Captain Scott and four of his companions on their return from the South Pole. Instead,  "The Worst Journey in the World" was the trip to the Emperor  Penguin rookeries undertaken in the middle of the Antarctic winter by  Cherry-Garrand, Dr. Wilson, and Lt. Bowers, the latter two of whom would  die with Scott on the polar trip. It makes absolutely terrifying reading;  the men were not equipped or trained for the rigors of the expedition, and  the scientific results from their collection of penguin eggs appear to have  been absolutely nil (Shackleton fans will be interested to know that Dr.  Eric Marshall suggested such a journey during the 1907-1909 Shackleton  expedition, but Shackleton thought the idea was cracked and refused to  countenance it). Cherry-Garrand is indeed a bit of a ragged writer, but as  a non-heroic account of the Scott expedition (compared to Scott's own  journals, written with Posterity in mind and "improved" by J.M.  Barrie) this book is a valuable addition to the bookshelf of anyone  interested in the heroic era of Antarctic exploration.
