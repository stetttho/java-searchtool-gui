 During my almost five years working for a national computer retailer, I became a major fan of Peachpit's Visual Quickstart Guides. Unlike the cretinous books for dummies, idiots, morons, etc, they cut right to the  chase and are full of useful information presented in a clear,  understandable fashion (besides, no dummy, idiot, or moron would own a  Palm!). No jokes, no cartoons, just facts. These books are absolutely  perfect for beginners and intermediate users. If you own any version of the  PalmPilot or Palm, you'll find this book a very useful introduction to the  life-changing device in your pocket, purse, or on your belt. As an early  Pilot adopter (128K!), I recommend this book unreservedly.
