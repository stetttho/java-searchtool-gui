 I've been playing Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri since the week it was released. When the expansion pack, Alien Crossfire, was released, I bought that right away as well. That was some time ago. I'm still playing it. Regularly. About the only other game I have ever owned with this kind of addictive play is SimCity 2000 (SimCity 3000 is graphically lovely but not nearly as absorbing). With all of the factions, random maps, difficulty levels, customizable units, etc, gameplay is surprisingly different every time. Mixing and matching the factions is fascinating. Perhaps the best feature of the game is that it forces you to think strategically as well as tactically - you literally have to think 20 to 50 turns ahead of the game all the time. Really a wonderful piece of work; I cannot recommend it more highly. And now I think I'll sign off and boot it up...
