 Tom Pocock, whose biographies of Nelson are also very much worth your time, has written a wonderful short history of the Seven Years War, which he is correct in referring to as the first truly world war, and as the war  that set Britain on its road to empire. Pocock has a real talent for  vividly depicting people in a chapter or two, including the unfortunate  Admiral Byng (shot to "encourage the others" as Voltaire wryly  observed), Wolfe, and Clive. Very, very much worth reading; the Seven Years  War (which has been consistently reduced to the status of a minor squabble  in American history books under the misnomer of the "French and Indian  War") has been almost forgotten but its effect on the history of the  late 18th and the 19th centuries cannot be overestimated.
