 I have to confess being unfamiliar with Ron Rosenbaum until reading his  excellent, perceptive book "Explaining Hitler." What a pleasure,  then, that he has followed that book up with this collection of his  magazine work extending over the past three decades. The essays collected  here are a mixed bag showing Rosenbaum's extensive range, from amusing  short pieces to long works in depth. Some personal favorites include his  early exploration of the world of phone phreaks (in which Rosenbaum  predicted, correctly, that computer hacking was the wave of the future -  this in 1971!), his exposure of the Henry Lee Lucas serial killer hoax, his  slightly crazed looks at TV culture via the war over canned laughter and  the eminence of Mr. Whipple in toilet paper advertising, a short but  incredibly horrible glimpse of early 60s teen film star Troy Donahue  debauched and decrepit in the early 70s, his explorations into the world of  the Kennedy assassination mythos, a brief, horrified look at Bill Gates'  house, and his wonderful exposure of Yale's weird Skull and Bones  fraternity. Every piece is well worth your time and several are worthy of  close rereading. Rosenbaum is a fine writer, improving continuously as this  collection shows (and he started at a very high level), and I'll be looking  for his magazine pieces from now on.
