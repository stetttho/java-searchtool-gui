 Having enjoyed Pocock's biographies of Nelson and his history of the Seven Years War, I was a little disappointed by this book, but it's likely not Pocock's fault; it's the material. On the surface, Admiral Sir Sidney Smith had as spectacular a career as any during the Napoleonic Wars, climaxing with his brilliant defense of Acre against Napoleon's army of Egypt. Looking closer, it's obvious that his contemporaries thought he was a total ass. Now Nelson and Cochrane both had faults, but they also had redeeming factors: Nelson was not only the greatest fighting admiral who ever lived but he was obviously personally likable and his contemporaries have left no end of favorable memories of him for history's perusal. Cochrane could be impossible to authority, but he was, like Nelson, a brilliant fighting officer and possessed of a slightly wacky charm. Smith, on the other hand, was a brave man, a fine fighting sailor and soldier, and an astute diplomat, but he was also absolutely full of himself, and his contemporaries never forgave him for it. The result is that this biography, while full of incident, adventure, and history, is also somewhat toneless. Anyone interested in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars will find this book valuable, but it may not be as appealing to the general reader as some of Pocock's other books.
