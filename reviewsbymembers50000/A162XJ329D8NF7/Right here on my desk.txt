 This is an exceptionally useful reference to HTML 4 that I keep on my desk  for looking things up as I work on my web sites. It's also a book I  recommended highly to customers when I sold computer books in a previous  job. If you're somewhat familiar with HTML, this is a perfect reference,  and has the advantage of being comb bound so it doesn't snap shut while  you're using it. If you want a book with which to learn HTML, this isn't it  (Elizabeth Castro's "HTML 4 Visual Quickstart Guide" is), but if  you use HTML daily, this is a necessary book to have and keep handy.
