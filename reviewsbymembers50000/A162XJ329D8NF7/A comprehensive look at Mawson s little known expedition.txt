 After his contributions to Sir Ernest Shackleton's 1907-1909 Nimrod expedition, Australian scientist Dr. Douglas Mawson decided to put together his own expedition, one that placed more emphasis on science than any up to  that time and many afterwards. Although his own experiences were by far the  most gripping of the expedition, Mawson is careful to tell the entire  story, with excerpts from other member's diaries and reports. His style is  a little dry, compared to Shackleton's books, but the tale of the  expedition is a compelling and interesting one. The book is very well  illustrated with photographs, maps, and diagrams, and the cover is really  handsome. Read this, but also read Lennard Bickel's "Mawson's  Will" for more emphasis on Mawson's own terrifying adventure.
