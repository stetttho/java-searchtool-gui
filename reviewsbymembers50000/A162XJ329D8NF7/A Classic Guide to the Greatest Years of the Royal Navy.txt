 Once again a wonderful book about the era of sailing warships has been permitted to slip out of print. Brian Lavery's two volume opus is a fascinating, well-researched guide to, in this volume, the development of the battlefleet from the inception of line of battle tactics to the arrival of steam, and, in volume two, the design and fittings of ships of the line. Lavery focuses on the Royal Navy thanks to the large quantity of surviving references, but touches on foreign developments where appropriate (American readers will especially enjoy an appendix to Volume One consisting of the report of a British naval officer who visited several American shipyards and gives his views on the state of America's small but powerful battlefleet of the early 19th century). Exceptionally well illustrated with period drawings, art, and plans, and printed in a suitably large format, this book and its accompanying volume are necessary additions to the library of anyone interested in the era of fighting sail. Let's hope the Naval Institute gets these back into print some time soon!
