 The epic story of the Endurance expedition has overshadowed Shackleton's earlier Nimrod expedition, during which he and three comrades trekked to within 100 miles of the South Pole and other members of his expedition were  the first to climb Mount Erebus and locate the South Magnetic Pole. This is  a well-written account and gives a complete overview not only of the  expedition but also of Shackleton's careful preparations. Read  "South" by all means, but read this book by Shackleton too; it's  excellent.
