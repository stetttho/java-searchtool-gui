 I bought CIII when it first came out, and recently reinstalled it and started playing it again. It holds up nicely, especially compared to its successor game, Pharaoh, which was based on the same engine. While you can die waiting for your pyramids to be built in Pharaoh, Caesar III, in spite of a few minor faults, remains a fun challenge in city building. One thing this game could have used was a minor revision to add the most useful feature of Pharaoh, the roadblock. A problem you'll find more troublesome in CIII than its successor is that "walkers" will wander all over the place, sometimes leaving parts of your city lacking essential services. Check the overlays frequently; make sure you have plenty of prefectures for fire control, with more needed in dry provinces, and engineer posts for preventing structural damage, with more required in wet provinces. Also make sure to keep the gods appeased. There's nothing worse in the Miletus sequence than getting Neptune upset and having him sink your entire fleet of fishing boats, a really bad scene. Isn't it funny, by the way, that Romans ALWAYS have British accents?! If you love Rome, enjoy city building simulations, and like strategy, this is a game for you, especially at this great price.
