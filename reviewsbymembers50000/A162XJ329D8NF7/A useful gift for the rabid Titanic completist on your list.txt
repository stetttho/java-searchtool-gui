 Dover Publications is one of my favorite imprints for their combination of low cost and high quality. This book, with its 24 well-printed black and white postcards, will find a place on every Titanic enthusiasts' shelf.  Some of the photos are common, others are more unusual; this is the only  place I've seen the photo of Captain Smith and Lord Pirrie (builder of the  ship) together, and the photo of Titanic with Olympic is also nice to have.  The accompanying notes are useful, well-written, and accurate.
