 It's good to see Pellegrino and Stoff's book back in print after so long. Anyone who saw Tom Hanks' excellent HBO series will recognize where the episode about the development of the lunar module came from. Pellegrino is  a passionate writer, and that comes across here. You'd hardly expect it of  a book about technology, but this book almost sings. Very highly  recommended. Read his book about the Titanic, too.
