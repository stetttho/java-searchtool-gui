 In the trade, we refer to this as a book "printed as a remainder," i.e. a book intended to be sold inexpensively. But for an inexpensive book, Leo Marriott's "Titanic" is well worth having.  Its selection of photographs is excellent and include real rarities like  early construction photos of Olympic (it's worth noting here that a lot of  the pictures printed as being of the Titanic, especially shots of her  interior and many construction shots, are actually of Olympic. The reason  is simple; Olympic was available for photography a lot longer than her  sister ship was!), many of the famous Father Browne photographs (Browne, at  the time in the novitiate and later a Jesuit priest, travelled from  Southhampton to Queenstown on the maiden voyage and snapped away the entire  time; Cameron paid tribute to one of his photos in his movie), and shots of  the interior of an English hotel which is furnished with interiors torn out  of the Olympic when she was broken up. Marriott also discusses the  filmography of the Titanic disaster. Ignore the occasional typos; the book  is well worth the price.
