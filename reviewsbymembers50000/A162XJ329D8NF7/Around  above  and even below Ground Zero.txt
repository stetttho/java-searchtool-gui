 "American Ground" is indeed one of the best of the flood of books that have come out since the terrorist outrages of 9/11/01, and William Langewiesche tells his story with eloquent prose and the experience of having been the only journalist allowed unrestricted access to Ground Zero. His description of an expedition underground to locate and examine the remains of the WTC's air conditioning plant is utterly fascinating, a kind of archaeology of ruins. Langewiesche's honesty is refreshing too, and apparently upsetting to the few 1 star reviews you'll see below; no, not everyone at the site was a hero, and while some heroes were dying, some losers were looting (anyone who's worked an airplane crash with the NTSB will tell you that the crash site is thoroughly looted before they arrive - this is unfortunately common "human" behavior even in the face of tragedy). My one gripe about the book is the fact that what's here is basically what was in his three-part series in the "Atlantic Monthly." Considering that Langewiesche was at the site for months, 205 undersized pages seems awfully succinct. I think most readers also would have preferred to pay a few more bucks and have some illustrations included. Langewiesche's final scene of the book has the steel from the WTC being chopped up and dumped into the hold of a rusting ship to be sent oversas as scrap. To send the steel of these buildings to be turned into cans and possibly weapons to be aimed back at us is the ultimate irony. The steel should have been saved, carefully studied (the hurried clearance of the site and ensuing destruction of the evidence has always seemed foolish to me), and then it should have been melted down and gone into an aircraft carrier. THAT should have been the fate of the WTC's superb steel, but once again America sells her heritage for a mess of pottage. Shame.
