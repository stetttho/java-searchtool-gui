 Tom McCluskie, an employee of Harland & Wolff, the Belfast shipbuilders who designed and built the Titanic, has made a bit of an industry for himself putting out books on the subject. This book is  probably the one most worth having, as it has all of the photos in his  other books plus some amazing and unusual photos of Britannic under  construction that I had never seen before (especially impressive were some  shots of the reciprocating engines being installed). The price is  definitely right, but be warned that for the massive size of the book the  binding is a little on the weak side.
