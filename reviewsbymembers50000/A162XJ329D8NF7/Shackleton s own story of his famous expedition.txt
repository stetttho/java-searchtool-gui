 Although there have been a number of new books and reprints recently focusing on the Endurance expedition, this is the one book everyone should read, Sir Ernest Shackleton's own story of the tragedy he turned into a  triumph. Shackleton fully covers the expedition from its inception, through  the loss of the Endurance, the stranding of the men on desolate Elephant  Island, the majestic small-boat journey in search of rescue to South  Georgia, the many attempts to evacuate the men from Elephant Island, and  the little-known story of the Ross Sea Party of the expedition, who  established a base on the opposite side of the Antarctic continent to lay  depots for the planned Antarctic crossing and in spite of horrible  deprivation caused when their ship was swept out to sea in a storm, managed  to complete all their work laying the groundwork for a trip that never  happened. After rescuing his men on Elephant Island, Shackleton had to  rescue this party as well, something pretty much ignored in most modern  books about the expedition. Very much worth reading; also read "Heart  of the Antarctic," Shackleton's book about his earlier expedition.
