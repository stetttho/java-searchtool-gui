 This is the book that really started the current round of "Shackleton-mania" and it is a good introduction to the story of the Endurance Expedition, well written, researched, and, of course,  beautifully illustrated with the classic photography of Frank Hurley. But  it's important to view it only as an introduction. Heacox'  "Shackleton-The Antarctic Challenge" goes into more detail, and  Shackleton's own books "South" and "Heart of the  Antarctic" are also must-reads, while Lennard Bickel's  "Shackleton's Forgotten Men" chronicles the little-known  adventures of the Ross Sea party of the Endurance Expedition. So if this  book leaves you wanting more, go on to those other titles. Alexander's book  also suffers badly from not having an index. I still highly recommend it  for its writing style and the wonderful reproductions of Hurley's  photographs.
