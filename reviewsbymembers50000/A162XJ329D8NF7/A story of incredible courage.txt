 It's good to see this book back in print. Douglas Mawson, a veteran of the 1907-1909 Shackleton expedition, returned to the Antarctic in 1912 with his own team. His sledge journey with two companions turned from a harsh but  rewarding exploration into a terrifying fight for survival in an instant.  At almost the same time as Scott was busily scribbling inspiring hoo-hah in  his diary trying to cover up his appalling faults of leadership and  organization, Mawson was courageously fighting for his life and refusing to  lie down and die. An incredible story! One hopes that Australia remembers  Sir Douglas Mawson and his fortitude. He is an example to all of us.
