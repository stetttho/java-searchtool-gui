 Originally published in 1913 as The Truth About the Titanic, Titanic: A Survivor's Story was the first book by an actual Titanic survivor to appear in print. Colonel Archibald Gracie, a military historian who is treated  really brutally by James Cameron in his film, was not only a brave man but  an indefatigable historian of the disaster. In the months remaining to him  after the sinking (Colonel Gracie died in December 1912, possibly of  aftereffects from his harrowing escape), Gracie tracked down other  survivors and was the first to make an attempt at putting each survivor  into the boat he or she escaped from. Written with period charm, this is an  important book about the disaster and will dispell any remaining images of  Cameron's doofy "Archie."
