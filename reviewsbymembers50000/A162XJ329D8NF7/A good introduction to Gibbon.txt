 This is an excellent abridged edition of Edward Gibbon's classic "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" and it makes both a perfect introduction for those just getting into Gibbon and a useful  portable copy for people who have the entire set. This abridgement includes  much of Gibbon's coverage of the decline and fall of the western empire and  some interesting chapters and excerpts from the remainder of the work,  ideal for the general reader. Most of Gibbon's history still stands up  after 200 years (and footnotes point out where it doesn't), and it is  written in an absolutely gorgeous English style. Anyone interested in Rome  owes it to themselves to read Gibbon, and this is a good place to get your  feet wet.
