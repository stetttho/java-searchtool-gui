 Escaping more or less by accident from the scrap-o-rama that decimated the historic Royal Navy in the latter 50 years of the 20th century, HMS Warrior, the world's first true ironclad battleship, has recently been restored and has joined HMS Victory in Portsmouth as a jewel of Royal Navy history. Andrew Lambert discusses in this excellent book how the ship was designed, how she was (accidentally) preserved by being used as a jetty at a Royal Navy fueling facility (!), and how several years of hard work in Hartlepool restored her to her original grace. The book is exceptionally well illustrated with period and modern photographs, as well as line drawings and plans, and will appeal to anyone interested in a generally overlooked period of naval history, when sail and wood were giving way to steam and steel.
