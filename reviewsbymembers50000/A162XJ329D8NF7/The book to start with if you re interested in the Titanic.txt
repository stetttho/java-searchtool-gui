 For entertainment purposes, I recommend scanning down through the reviews of this book and reading any that are less than 5 stars. Hoo boy, what can you say? Walter Lord's book is a classic, the result of numerous interviews  with actual survivors, and is probably as close as we will ever get to a  complete recounting of the events of that awful night (also read Lord's  "Night Lives On" where he adds some new information and corrects  some errors he made in this book - he wasn't the only person caught out  when the ship turned up in two pieces!). If you're just getting into the  story or need to be cured of some of the more egregious excesses in  Cameron's film, this is the book you need to read. On the other hand, if  you're a victim of our educational system, go watch the movie. Hmmm.
