 Ken Marschall has become the definitive artist of the Titanic, and his art has the reality of the photographs we so often lack. This book includes much of his Titanic work, including his very first painting of the great  ship, and as a bonus includes some of his other liner artwork, of the  Lusitania, Mauretania, Queen Mary, Normandie, and the Andrea Doria, as well  as Titanic's two sisters Olympic and Britannic. The Titanic was simply the  most beautiful ocean liner ever built - her lines are absolutely perfect -  and Marschall captures her with love and respect. Very highly recommended.
