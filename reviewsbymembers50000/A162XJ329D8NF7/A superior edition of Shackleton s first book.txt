 This is a very nice, somewhat abridged edition of "Heart of the Antarctic." Compared with the Carroll & Graf trade edition, this does have some bits edited from the expedition preparations and the account  of the Furthest South journey, but, unlike the Carroll & Graf edition,  it has Professor David's account of the march to the South Magnetic Pole  and an account of the Northern Party journey and so is overall a better  text. The selection of pictures is decent, although there is one photo that  I suspect is from the 1912 Scott expedition (of a tracked motor-sledge; the  Shackleton expedition had only a car with it). The story of the British  Antarctic Expedition is just as exciting as the doomed Endurance voyage,  and I would highly recommend this edition to everyone interested in  Shackleton and his adventures.
