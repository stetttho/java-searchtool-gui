 I'm the biggest Madonna fan and booster out there---I buy all of her stuff to show support for an artist who I think is head and shoulders above most of her peers. I loved AMERICAN LIFE, and was disappointed it was not well received by others. However, this remix EP is really poor. If Madonna were going to release a remix CD, I would expect something as amazing as YOU CAN DANCE, not a hastily thrown-together collection of cast-off remixes, none of which are even passable let alone the best remixes of each individual song. It's nice to have the Britney/Christina performance from MTV, but not essential. The Gap song I had. "Your Honesty" is a dreadful cast-off from BEDTIME STORIES, which already was her least consistent album. Add it all up and what have you got? A lot of "nothing." A project that Madonna clearly had "nothing" to do with. And you know what? "Nothing" fails. Speaking of which, I am now anxiously awaiting the upcoming release of the "Nothing Fails"/"Nobody Knows Me" maxi since the mixes of the latter that I've heard are brilliant. Hopefully, in 2004, Madonna will focus more and give us more stuff of the quality we expect. A 20th anniversary box set would do nicely...and one with wisely selected extras.
