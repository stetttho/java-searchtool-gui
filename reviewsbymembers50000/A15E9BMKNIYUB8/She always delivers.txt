 Love her or hate her, Kitty knows how to write compelling, juicy stuff. As for those who have trashed the book (ironically) as "trash," maligning it as being tabloidy or "like the NATIONAL ENQUIRER," I think it's funny because the tabloids are in themselves very right-wing and based on the idea of tearing down the facade of the supposedly elite Hollywood celebs. The people who love tabloids are a conservative base. So...live by it, die by it. Me, I'll just enjoy.
