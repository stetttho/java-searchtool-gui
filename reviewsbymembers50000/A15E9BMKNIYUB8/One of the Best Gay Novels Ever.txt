 Ken Siman's PIZZA FACE was one of the first "gay novels" I ever  read. It communicates the feeling of being an outsider so poignantly, with  humor and razor-sharp perception. It's beautifully written from beginning  to end, and will stay with you. I admire this book so much and strongly  recommend it.
