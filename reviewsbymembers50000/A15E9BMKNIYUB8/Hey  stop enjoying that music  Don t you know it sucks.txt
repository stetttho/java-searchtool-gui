 Chicago's worst critic, Jim DeRogatis, is a terrible writer as well as a malevolent reviewer. This book proves that for a national audience. Critics are a valuable resource, but they lose their importance when they take more pleasure in gunning down art that was made sincerely than they do in honestly evaluating it, for better or for worse. I think it's pretty funny that a guy who hates on U2, Rolling Stones, Madonna and more earns only an average score of 2 stars from Amazon reviewers and hasn't cracked the Top 200,000 in (rock of) ages.
