 I am a writer and editor, and work a lot with teen music. I have met Britney Spears and think she is a doll. But I've never liked her music, except for "...Baby One More Time," which is one of the best pop singles of all time. Until now. I really, really love this CD. I did not expect to! But I feel that it's her first real album. It's cohesive, it takes artistic risks (the primary one being that it is not shy about being about having fun) and has a sense of excitement missing from her previous work. As the world's most diehard Madonna fan, it pains me to say I don't love "Me Against the Music," but it did grow on me. Same with R. Kelly's laughably written but undeniably catchy "Outrageous." "The Hook-Up" is one to skip, but not an aural assault or anything. The rest, I embrace. "Breathe On Me" is one of the best songs of all time---I can't get enough of it. It's like "Love to Love You Baby" or "More More More," breathy and satiny and a pleasure. My other faves are "Toxic," "Early Mornin'," "Touch of My Hand" and "Shadow." "Brave New Girl" is a giddy tribute to Madonna's entire career---it sounds like "Material Girl" and throws in "Ray of Light" guitars. And "Everytime" is absolutely sweet and sincere, the perfect antidote to Justin Timberlake's uncomfortably vicious "Cry Me a River." Great record. Try it if you like pop and dance music.
