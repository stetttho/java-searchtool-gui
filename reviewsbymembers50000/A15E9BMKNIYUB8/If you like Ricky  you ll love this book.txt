 I heard about this book from a magazine called POPSTAR! (v. 3 Special) all about "Latin superhunks" with Ricky on the cover and inside. There was an ad for it. THIS BOOK IS LOCA-COOL! The writing is fun and  informative, and there are really interesting early-years photos of Ricky  with various hair lengths. Love it. If you like Ricky, you have to order  this book.
