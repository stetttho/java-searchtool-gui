 Whether or not you care about who the author is, the book is delightful for kids and the illustrations are really pretty---very UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG. If there are "haters" out there who tend to be offended by Madonna's sexier image, instead of trashing her for daring to do a children's book, you should be applauding her for doing something that fits more with your moral outlook. Kaballah-kaschmallah, the book is anti-jealousy and very positive for any belief system. If you still hate the messenger, then your reasoning is base politics so what's the point? Fans: Rejoice. Kids: Enjoy. Anti-Madonnaites: Gnash your teeth because she is never going away.
