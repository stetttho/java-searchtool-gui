 It's arguable whether or not THE CURSE OF BLONDIE is their best CD---but I would say it is either their #1 or #2 best. It's splitting hairs, though, because it is exhilaratingly brilliant. There is not one bad track on this record, and some of them, like "End to End," "Golden Rod," "The Tingler" and "Songs of Love," are just about perfect. Debbie Harry's voice only gets better with age and her confidence has soared over the years. Not only is this CD a real pleasure, catch the band live sometime---just saw them here in NYC at J&R Music World and they were the best I've ever seen them. Don't miss this CD. Support a band that deserves it and you'll be rewarded.
