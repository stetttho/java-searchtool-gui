 This calendar is pretty flawless. Cheesy nude calendars are very 1985, but this series is a way to get the nudity without feeling like a sleazeball. Beautiful photography and it's always useful to break down the stereotypes of masculinity. I mentioned it on my Typepad blog "Boy Culture" and got lots of pings. Everyone loves it. If it's the kind of calendar that you THINK you might like, you will like it.
