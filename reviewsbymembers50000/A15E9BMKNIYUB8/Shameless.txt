 Really poorly written and constructed with zero reliance on fairness. Was this even vetted? Apparently not, since so many of the contentions have been rebuffed in the press. Even Dubya has said he does not believe John Kerry lied. So...what is the point of this book? Oh, yeah---a personal grudge. I'm as vindictive as the next son of a gun, truly I am, but this is taking things too far. Instead, invest your time in examining issues other than John Kerry's active Vietnam history. Like Bush's non-existent one, and how it got that way!
