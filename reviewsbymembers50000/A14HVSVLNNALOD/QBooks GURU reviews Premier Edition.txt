 This "deluxe" version for QuickBooks is GREAT for ones that need ALL the features. I am a Certified QuickBooks ProAdvisor and have used several versions over the years--would I recommend this upgrade??   I have and will advise ANY of my clients to upgrade to the 2002 version, but not all would need this one. It's excellent for those clients that I need to see their files more than once/ month. They can, along with myself( I have the Acct's Version) REMOTE ACCESS (with passwords) specific files/problems/updates. CLOSING Date--and faster RUN time: Remember how your software would slow to a crawl if you have been using QuickBooks for more than a few years?? NO problem anymore--close off those past years and archive them. Improved Accounts Receivable, Better Bank Reconciling, emailing statements (great time-saver !)..these are a few features I really like. The 2002 upgrade has many improved features, which IF you have not upgraded for a few years, NOW is the time to do it!  I have said, and will continue to admit I am NOT fond of raised prices---and I have not changed my position...but I also am happy to be using the 2002 version ! Nancy M.
