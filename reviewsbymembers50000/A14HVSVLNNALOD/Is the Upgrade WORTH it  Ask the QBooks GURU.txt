 I've been using QuickBooks for several years, and I am a Certified QuickBooks ProAdvisor---do I think the upgrade to the Accountant's Version is worth it? YES--if you are an Accountant or Bookkeeper--this version saves you a TON of time and effort. The differences are first subtle to the eye, but as you start using the program, you will better access the features you have been accustomed to IN addition to: REMOTE Access: Great time saver to not only help your client with day to day entries, but also I am able to send back seperate files. With this feature, I can accomodate clients in any STATE, with no problem ! CLOSING Date: Remember how cumbersome it got if the client has used QBooks for a few years??? With alot of entries , the software slowed to a crawl--NOW, you can CLOSE off previous years and store it. EMAIL Statements: Another time saver for me, when I need to "remind" clients to send payment..Credit reports:Why not find out about prospective clients or customers before entering into your own time and money? IMPROVED Bank Reconciliations: A feature I found cumbersome previously is now something I use with any upgraded 2002 client. There are now some audit trails not used previously...also some improvements with journal entries...and so on. Okay, I admit I am NEVER fond of raised prices---and I am not happy that this new version will only accomodate 2 computers, but I still REALLY feel that this upgrade is worth the money. Nancy M.
