 I have a Bookkeeping and Accounting Service business and frankly, initially I was a "hard sell" converting to Quickbooks. That was 6 years ago..now I am a Certified QBooks Pro Advisor. Each updated version makes it more comprehensive and user-friendly. Intuit /Quickbooks has 85% of the small business market, so if you fit this parameter, it would be prudent to look into this software. I would suggest, however, perhaps to have a bookkeeper or accountant look over or set up your initial start up ----that way you'll be saving alot of $$$ when tax time comes around. Quicken is good(also by Intuit) BUT it is really for personal finances, not business. QuickbooksGuruUSA@aol.com
