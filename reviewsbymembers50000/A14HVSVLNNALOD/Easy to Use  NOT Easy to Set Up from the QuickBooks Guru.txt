 People that are disappointed with the software usually have tried to set this up themselves without help. I have been a Certified QuickBooks ProAdvisor since inception of the program, and my MAIN job is FIRST to set up the program correctly. Once it is set up, it is easy to train most anyone to use most of the functions, especially in the 2002 Version. Intuit Customer Service is minimal at best, I agree---but that is why you should call a CERTIFIED advisor in your area (but with the QB remote access, ANYplace is adaptable now) with an accounting background. It will save you time, and aggravation ! I have used every other accounting software package out there, and I really just recommend QBooks for most businesses. It's functionality, ease of use and reporting functions are GREAT!. I have all my clients up and running with deposits, checks, invoices, emailing statements, job profitabilities etc etc.within 2 hours WHEN it's been set up properly ! I have taken many clients off other software out there in the market that has cost them many lost hours, wasted money and MUCH frustration. Intuit has raised their prices, I agree---(something I am NEVER fond of) BUT it's STILL a big Bang for the Buck ...from someone that KNOWS the product very very well! Nancy M.
