 As a Certified QuickBooks ProAdvisor in Southern California.   It's by far their best program and certainly the way accounting software has become for small business. NO, it is NOT easy enough to SET Up for maximum accounting but absolutely easy and comprehensive enough for any average busines owner to USE on an everday basis.That's why I always suggest someone does hire a Certified Advisor with an accounting background to set up your initial books and if possible, also have them maintain certain aspects. Intuit's tech support is NOT ideal..that much I will agree with. I do believe with all the new integration with other software AND all the new entities such as Point-of-Sale software etc,there are "growing pains", which hopefully they will resolve . There are over 120 PREformatted reporting functions in QBooks 2002...along with easier access to all these features. I used to have to format alot more reports for my clients, whereas they are now standard, in most cases. YES, you have to pay for the payroll...but they have cleaned it up so well, it's a cinch for my clients to do themselves now, if they so choose. In previous editions, IF a client even tried to set it up themselves, the results were NOT optimal. Job costing, invoicing,Accounts Rec and Payable are far easier for me to set up, train and/or maintain with clients books.This is even more true with each upgrade. There are reviews BY professionals in many accounting magazines...and QuickBooks is STILL at the top of the stack and growing in the more inexpensive accounting software packages. I am one of those professionals that have used most everything out there in this price range----that is why I direct my clients to QuickBooks. I have stated before, I am NOT thrilled with raised prices...but again, do I believe it's worth it?? Yes, and even more so now than 5 months ago.
