 IF you haven't upgraded your QuickBooks software, NOW is the time to do it !Between the subtle differences and the innovative ones, you can get so much more from this package.I am a Certified QuickBooks ProAdvisor in Southern California and Beta-tested the 2002 software, so I DO know the improvements made.  There are 4 desktop versions..QBooks Basic, QBooks Pro, QBooks Premium and Accountant's QBooks Premium. Obviously I will be using the Accountant's version, and with this, I will be able to do so much more than before. For one, if you have had QBooks for a few years, you do know how slow it can get with entries..well, NOW we can close off years FINALLY, and store them.A BIG PLUS is the Remote Access: When you have a problem,I can access your QBooks online (with YOUR permission, naturally) and fix the problem, or we can discuss it right then and there, no matter how many miles apart we are ! I'm NOW able to set up, and maintain ANY client's books, no matter what state they have their business. Also look for the improvements for time tracking, job costs, e-mailing statements etc. QuickBooks now integrates with a TON of software applications specific to industry--go look on their site. QBooks also has a Point of Sale software package for retail..and for construction, they have teamed up with Master Builders, just to name two. YES, they also have raised their prices..do I think it's worth it? I am NEVER fond of raised prices, but with all the significant changes, I do see why. With any new upgrade, I'm sure there will be a few problems, but the techs will patch them, as they always have. I have also had complaints about their tech support help...but normally I can answer all my client's questions.  Frankly, QuickBooks has basically become the standard for small business..it's the ONLY accounting software I do install for my clients now. ... Nancy M. Schiff Certified QuickBooks ProAdvisor...
