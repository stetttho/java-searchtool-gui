 This package is perfect for the Accountant, the Bookkeeper or the Owner of a Small to Medium Size Business that likes to use most Accounting functions/reporting etc. As  the "QuickBooks Guru", I use this particular version for all my clients no matter if they have Pro, Basic, Contractor or Premier Version. The reporting functions are built in, so there is very little modifying if at all. Between the new templates, add on features, invoice functionality (much better)---and naturally the remote access feature that makes a great training feature between my clients and myself ! The people that are disgruntled either have had poor set up,or are not understanding the ease of the program. I customize every client specifically to their business, and I have had NO complaints when they get their Income Statements, updated books, Bank Reconciliations...cash flow reports, Job Costs, Time tracking etc. If you KNOW QuickBooks, this is the program to BUY!
