 I am a Certified QuickBooks ProAdvisor and again, have beta tested the new version of QuickBooks. Frankly, I have ALL my clients on QuickBooks software and found it to be the best user package for the small business owner.  The refinements in all areas including expanded reporting functions, easier and more comprehensive Bank Reconciliations, tracking all Income and Expenses/class, more options for templates etc and more options for backing up data. I love the remote access feature that I can conveniently reach my client's data screen and we can do online training or on-the-spot journal entries.  QuickBooks still is NOT easy enough for most users to set up properly, accounting wise...but very easy to use once you have the initial set-up, it is a basic common sense approach. Basic training for everyday use is simple and straightforward. For the Naysayers out there....QuickBooks has basically become the standard for Accounting Software for small business for a REASON>>>because it continually improves the product. Intuit has also several add-on packages to customize YOUR business to your specific needs. This is more than any other comparably packaged price accounting software out there. They even are offering customized forms/products to let you stand out from your competition. "The QuickBooks Guru" www.schiffmgmt.com
