 In Worship Evangelism, Sally Morgenthaler writes a book that is doctrinaly sound, and informative.  She arugues against watering down the worship experience to accomodate seekers, instead, she shows how seekers will come to Christ in the midst of a genuine worship experience.   Morgenthaler gives several examples of churches that are reaching people through genuine worship.  Those who are serious about reaching postmoderns must read this book.  I'm glad I did.
