 In Seasons Under the Son, Tim Wesemann undergirds his readers with stories of God's Grace in his life and the life of others.  You'll discover the courage of a death row inmate who finds Christ, laments his sin and longs to set things straight.  You'll delight in God's grace that protected a post operative baby in a massive pile up on a snowy highway in a circle of indemnity.   But you'll also benefit from watching Tim interact with these and other people and see how their faith journey affects his.  This book touched my soul.  I'm a better person because I read it.
