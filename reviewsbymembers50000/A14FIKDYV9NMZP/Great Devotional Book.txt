 In "The Only Holiest" Walter Price brings some strong devotional thoughts to Isaiah's vision from Isa 6.  The book is a reminder that our life is not to be lived selfishly, but in pursuit of pleasing God.  In many ways, it is a "throw back" book.  It has the familiar feel of books produced by authors like Tozer or Torrey.   The book is easy to read and well worth the investment of time and money.
