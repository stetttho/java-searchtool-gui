 In reading Out of the Whirlwind, I've grown closer to God and gained a greater perspective for understanding the times when I went through times of suffering.  This book isn't pop-theology, it springs out of the authors extensive Biblical research and personal experience.  I've already passed a copy on to someone who is questioning "why God is allowing her to go through bad times," and plan on keep other copies handy to give to others.  This book will benefit you whether you are struggling or not.  It is for anyone who wants to draw nearer to God and gain a greater understanding of who He is.
