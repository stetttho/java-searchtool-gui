 Would you like to energize your teachers, revitalize your organization and realize exponential  growth in your Sunday School?  Have you ever thought about releasing a TIGER in all your classes?  That is exactly what Josh  Hunt suggests you do in his new book: You Can Double Your Class in Two  Years or Less.  "Tiger" is an acrostic for: 	Teach a halfway decent  lesson each and every week--nothing less will do. 	Invite every member  and every prospect to every fellowship every month. 	Give Friday nights  to Jesus. 	Encourage the group to ministry. 	Reproduce new groups. 	 Though Josh has experience as a Pastor,  Minister of Education, and a  Church Growth Consultant,  he wrote this book from his rich experience as a  Sunday School Teacher.  It is written to people on the front lines of  ministry by a person who ministers on the front lines. 	This book will  help teachers become reachers.  It stresses the importance of developing  and maintaining relationships in the small group ministry.  "People are not  looking for a friendly Church," Josh writes, "they are looking for  friends."  Classes stop growing when they stop being "friends" with new  people and settle with being "friendly." 	Josh moves the reader away  from an emphasis on formulas and growth charts to people, where it belongs.   This fresh emphasis works!  I used these principles to grow a class from  five to twenty in six months. 	Pick up this book and learn a  no-holds-barred, tired-and-true, Biblical approach to teach/reach people  for Jesus Christ.  Go ahead, "grab the tiger by the tail," you'll be glad  you did!
