 Culture has shifted, and the predominant worldview has left many Christians scratching their head wondering how to respond. In Mission to Oz, Mark Tabb explains the changes in our culture brought about by the postmodern worldview and shows Christians how to minister in the new world they find themselves in. He doesn't pass judgment on the worldview or its proponents. Instead, he teaches us to think like a missionary and proclaim the timeless truths of the scripture in our changing culture. I am recommending this book to every Christian who wants to understand the times and usher in the Future Church.
