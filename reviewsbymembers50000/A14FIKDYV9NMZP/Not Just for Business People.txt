 The book arrived yesterday afternoon. I started reading it after dinner and finished it before I left for work this morning. It is  a real page turner.  I'm not a business person, so I didn't read it for the advise, I'm just a fan of the show and wanted to know more about Carolyn.  What surprised me is how much I learned about relationships.  Thanks Carolyn for a great book on treating people with respect while earning it from others.    Also kudos to Stephen Fenichell for doing a great job in assisting Carolyn tell her story.
