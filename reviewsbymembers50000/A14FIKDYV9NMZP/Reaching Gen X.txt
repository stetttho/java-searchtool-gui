 Geno Robinson believes the key to understanding GenXers is to examine their life development issues not to make assumptions about individuals based upon trends of a generational group.  In his book, Intersecting  Lives: Road Maps for Ministry with Young Adults, Robinson explores the  challenges and opportunities of ministry with today's young adults.  Using  case studies, he shows churches who reach and develop young adults with: 	 	big events 		challenging discipleship courses 		 small groups 		and choirs.
