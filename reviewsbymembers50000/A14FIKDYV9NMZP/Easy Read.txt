 In Living with Less, Mark Tabb gives his reader a chiropractic priority adjustment.  It is a guide for how to invest your most precious resource:  life.  As a mid-lifer, I found it helpful to evaluate some past decisions in light of current priorities and to consider some mid course corrections.  But I also found some chapters that I want my young adult sons to read.   Tabb writes, with a friendly, comfortable tone.  The book reads like a conversation between friends.  And like a friend, Tabb gets direct at times.  Not drill sergeant direct, but he doesn't pull any punches either.  I found the book did a great job of organizing things I knew to be true, but hadn't necessarily thought through. 	 Thanks Mark, for connecting the dots for me.
