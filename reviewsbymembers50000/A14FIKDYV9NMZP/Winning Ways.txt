 There are two ways to evaluate success, one focuses on the end results (scored 36 points had 12 rebounds) the other focuses on the means (played my best, worked hard, was in my "zone").  In Go the Distance, Ed Rowell coaches his readers to be a success in life and focuses more on the means than the end results.  He writes, "Real success is the result of implementing simple disciplines and practicing them consistently over time." 	The book explains 21 habits and attitudes a person needs to win at life.  Certainly, the book reflects significant research into current literature and the opinions of others that Rowell gleaned from interviews with people he admires.  And those insights are helpful, but the strength of the book is when Rowell looks inward and examines his own personal demons. 	When you buy the book, read chapter 11 first.  It is powerful.  In it, Rowell talks about his own struggle with anger and the things he is doing to get the best of it before it brings out the worst in him.  He shows how he turned to others for help in managing the fire that raged in his soul and how he is finding victory.  Maybe this chapter spoke to me so much because of Rowell's brutal honesty, or maybe it is because I too struggle with anger.  Either way, it was worth the price of the book. 	I'm glad I bought this book, after I post this review, I'm going to buy another copy to give to my son as a High School graduation present.  I know that before I'm done shopping for this special occasion, I will give him other gifts that will be more expensive, but I can imagine how I could give him one that will be more important.
