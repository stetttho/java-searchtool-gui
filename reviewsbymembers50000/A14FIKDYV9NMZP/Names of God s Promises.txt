 Have you ever needed a Pastor to come beside you during a trial to assure you of God's presence, love and concern?  In Names of God's Promises, Pastor Mark Tabb comforts, encourages, and inspires those needing to claim  a promise from God.   	Pastor Tabb is transparent in this book; he  doesn't try to cover up his own frailties, doubts or frustrations.  Rather,  he teaches about God's promises by showing how God's promises made a  difference in his life.  He wrote the book with a  tone of  a genuine  friend talking to a friend, not an expert lecturing a subordinate. 	The  chapters are brief enough that a reader can use it for daily devotionals,  and then use it as a reference book for Bible Study or to help prepare a  lesson to teach to others.
