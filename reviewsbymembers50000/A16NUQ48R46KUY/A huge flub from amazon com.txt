 I would love to be able to tell you what I thought of Tom Ford's book.  I think he's a fashion genius, incidentally, and I was so looking forward to being able to look through gorgeous, glossy pictures of his clothes.  However, I ordered this at the end of February.  It is now mid-June and I STILL haven't gotten it.  Amazon just keeps telling me there are delays and asking me to approve them.  I am now due to receive it in July, but judging on past experience, I doubt that I will.  And yet, it still says on the website that if you order today, you should receive it in 11-12 days.  NOT TRUE!  Buyer beware, in this case.
