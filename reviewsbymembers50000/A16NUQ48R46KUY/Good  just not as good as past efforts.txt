 This is a beautiful album, one that is perfect background music to an artsy day, but that doesn't have the emotional or musical complexity of "Surfacing" or "Fumbling Towards Ecstacy."   "Fallen" is incredibly beautiful, a song that I replayed multiple times upon first hearing the album.  "Perfect Girl," "World on Fire," and "Train Wreck" are lovely songs too, but overall, there wasn't much to sing along to on this.    This is in part because Sarah's voice is frequently drowned out by the instruments.  And the notes themselves seem to be right in the middle of her range, so that while she sings beautifully, it can be nearly impossible to hear what she's saying.  This just makes it seem more like background music. It's lovely, though.  If you want this sound with a bit more emotion and poppiness, try her other albums.  They're fantastic.
