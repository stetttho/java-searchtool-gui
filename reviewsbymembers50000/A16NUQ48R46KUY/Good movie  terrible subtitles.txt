 Let me say right off: this was a pretty good movie.  The direction was very good, the cinematography was beautiful (especially when they're on open water much of the time), it was a bit slow, but that speed felt right for what was going on.    But at least 30% of the movie didn't have subtitles and, since I don't speak Polish, that's a lot of the movie that I missed.  Granted, I could pick some of it up from context, but in a movie with so little dialogue, every bit matters.  I don't understand how the vaunted Criterion can translate Japanese and Korean with ease, but not be able to get a good Polish translation.  There wasn't much of a story and sometimes it felt more like a sailing movie than a thriller, but this is a movie one should watch just to see how good direction can elevate a story.
