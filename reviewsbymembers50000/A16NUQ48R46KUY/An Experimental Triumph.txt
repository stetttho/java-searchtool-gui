 This is one of the best albums I've ever heard.  Somehow, Radiohead has managed to create an experimental album, with lots of computerized and synthed touches, that still has emotion and beauty.  The technology lays bare the emotion and pure gorgeousness of the production.   I have been told that this a concept album about the first human clone.  That's interesting, but it's not necessary information to enjoy the album.   Some highlights: The album  begins with "Everything in its Right Place," which begins "Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon," something that I still don't understand, but that I couldn't get out of my head once I heard it.  "How to Disappear Completely" is one of the most beautiful, depressing songs I've heard.  "I'm not here, this isn't happening," sings Thom Yorke, with such incredible despair. "Optimistic" and "Idioteque" are far more catchy and quick.  Not coincidentally, they are also the only ones to get any radio play. If you're an "OK Computer" or older Radiohead fan, this may not be the album for you.  For though it is brilliant, it has very little in common with the alternative rock/pop of their previous works.  It also takes a few listens to really understand the artistry of the album and figure out some of its idiosyncracies.   This is not an easy listen, but it's perfect mood music to zone out to, or to play as a background at a gathering.  It's mellow, but not invasive, and still electronic enough to keep the room moving. Amazing album.  You have to hear it to believe it.
