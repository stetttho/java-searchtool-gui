 I really thought I would love this movie, based on the rave reviews it's gotten, but I left feeling vaguely unsatisfied.  Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannson did a very nice job, but as some of the other reviewers have mentioned, I didn't feel that there was any chemistry between them.  And the movie is supposed to be about a connection between foreigners, so without that element, it loses a lot of authenticity.   I also spent most of the movie trying to decide whether there was supposed to be a sexual tension between the characters and I couldn't decide.  While a certain amount of ambiguity is interesting, a "just friends" vibe that suddenly gets blown away by a passionate kiss at the end just seems like Ms. Coppola couldn't decide what she was trying to go for. Speaking of, the direction wasn't great.  The movie felt overly long, primarily because the pacing was terrible.  It often felt like the characters were thrown into situations, just for the shock value or an intended mood.   This isn't a terrible movie, but I'm not sure that it deserves the accolades it's getting.
