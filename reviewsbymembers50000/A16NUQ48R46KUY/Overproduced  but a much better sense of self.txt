 That may sound like a contradiction, but I got the feeling that this just-out-of-the-club album was the direction she really wants her sound to go in.  And, for that sound, it's a great album.   The only weak songs on the album are the ones that go against that sound, the ballads.  "Shadow" is particularly weak, a watered-down Aerosmith ballad from 1988.  Another weak one, "Outrageous," I expected to be a lot better, based on the R.Kelly production, but it was just a tribute to excessive living and spending.  More than that, it went against the "I'm just a normal girl" vibe that I got from the rest of the album, as well as her previous ones.  "Brave New Girl" sounds more like Hillary Duff than Britney, but as pop-lite, it's not bad. Her strong songs are much more impressive.  "Toxic" is fantastic, catchy, edgy, and fun.  I've heard that that's the next single and it's a good choice.  "Me Against the Music" isn't as strong as "Slave 4 U" from the "Britney" album, but it's got a harder edge than the earlier singles and a very strong club beat.  I don't think Madonna's presence made it any better than it would have been otherwise, but she was okay.  The remix (also featured on the album) wasn't great, just not different enough to justify being a second song.  "I Got That (Boom Boom)" has become one of my favorites on the album.  Fun, funky, sexy, and though it sometimes sounds like the Ying Yang Twins' song (who, frankly, sound like Ludacris), rather than Britney's, it's really good.  "Breathe On Me" is a great slower dance song, as is "Early Mornin'," which benefits from Moby's production. This is a very interesting album, and fun besides.  I painted my apartment to it and it was perfect for that.  Bouncy, sexy, not too deep.  If this is where Britney is going and she can get a cohesive production team next time around, I look forward to hearing it.
