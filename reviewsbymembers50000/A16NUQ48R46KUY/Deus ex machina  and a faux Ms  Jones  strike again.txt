 It's been said before, but I'll say it again: "Bridget Jones's Diary" is better.  If you're going to read a piece of light British chick-lit, read the one that basically invented the genre.   It's not that "Mr. Maybe" is terrible.  It's just not very good, either.  I'm feminist enough that I find it more than a little galling that Libby, attempting to find a wealthy man, settles on someone she's not attracted to and who isn't that good to her, just to attain that monetary status.  A frivolous heroine (a la Ms. Jones and others) is fine, but one that is a money-grubbing social climber is not sympathetic or empathetic.  She's just. . .you knew I would say it--pathetic. Although Ms. Green admirably tries to go for a good moral message, albeit one that has been done many times before (love is more important than money, money doesn't buy everything, etc.), she ruins that by giving the poor hero the prospect of many banknotes in his future.  Deus ex machina is fun, Ms. Green, but not always necessary. Ms. Green also doesn't win points for story originality, either, with a plot line that reads like she cribbed from more popular books in the genre.  Although she doesn't quite need to start running from Helen Fielding's copyright lawyers yet, she might want to get some ideas of her own soon.   And please, how many more "real women can't cook--no really, they can't" scenes do we need in these books?  According to the genre, women will burn the house down if given the opportunity, a sentiment that I find appalling.  As feminist and pro-woman as this book claims to be, it subverts that with every plot twist.   That said, Libby's relationship with her married best friend is very well-written and realistic.  Her hottie does indeed live up to that nickname.  Jane Green's wittiness is evident throughout the book and I wished that her characters and plot had lived up to that.
