 I really expected a better movie than this, considering the star power involved.  But this one had so many problems. 1)Mob extortion kick-start plot just seemed lazy and sloppy and out-of-place.  It's hard to laugh when the guy seems to be one step away from getting cacked. 2)No chemistry at all between Kate Hudson and Luke Wilson, actors that I otherwise enjoy very much. 3)Sub-par plotline.  One of its "strengths" is having Kate Hudson dress up and affect different accents (not well, which I guess is the point) about every five minutes. 4)Seems outdated.  Who really gets someone to type up their manuscripts anymore?  When the mob smashed up Alex's laptop, why didn't he go to a free one at the library?  A cheap one at an Internet cafe? 5)If this an example of Alex's bestselling plot/writing skill, I can't quite understand why the publishing house is not more eager to dump him than harass him into pounding out a new book. 6)Ms. Hudson's hard-to-get little miss gets old fast, as does Mr. Wilson's bumbling author. Just. . .not good.  Kate Hudson and Luke Wilson both have real comic talent, so they need to find a project worthy of it.
