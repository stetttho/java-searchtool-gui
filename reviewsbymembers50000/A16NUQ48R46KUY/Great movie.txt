 This is the most profitable animated movie of all time and there's a reason for that.  The plot is excellent, the voices of people like Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, Willem Defoe, and Geoffrey Rush are skillfully done, and the scenery is just amazing. . .so beautiful and realistic that you simultaneously feel like you could swim in the water and that you want a print of every scene for your wall (well, maybe not the scene when they're in the dark. . .) I took another look at this one the other day and, although Disney/Pixar went with a special features format that doesn't make it the easiest to access, the special features it does have are really quite good.  See, the special features are split up, with some on the full-screen DVD and some on the wide-screen DVD (both versions are included).  I found that the better features are on the wide-screen DVD.  That one has an amazing visual tour with such highlights as watching Ellen DeGeneres and Geoffrey Rush reading their lines (surprisingly entertaining) and snippets on the evolution of the characters and story.  There are also pictures of the models that they used for the characters and the aquarium feature on the wide-screen DVD has different scenes that you can choose.  On the full-screen disc, Msr. Cousteau's "documentary" is a highlight. This is a truly wonderful movie.  Everyone I know who's seen it, loves it.
