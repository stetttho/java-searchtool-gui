 For the most part, I really enjoyed this book.  It was the smartest piece of chick-lit I've read and I liked the story and the character.  Both were consistent throughout the book. My problems were small ones.  First off, although I enjoyed the character and felt she was pretty realistic and well-rounded (and she could cook!), I was seriously annoyed that she allowed herself to be walked all over by everyone.  She realizes that this is her problem and even takes a class for it, but still allows her cousin to stay with her for months without paying rent or bills or anything and even allows her cousin to change her furniture around and take her bedroom.  I don't know anyone who would just allow herself to be stomped on like that and past wanting the character to succeed, I wanted to knock some spine into her.   I also felt that the book was a bit too long.  Cut out about one hundred pages (and the mom-charity debacle and peripheral-characters-getting-theirs subplots) and it would have been just about perfect.  She could also have cut out about 90% of the "mint" puns.  "New Mint" as a way to show that Minty's changing is only clever once. Overall, though, I strongly recommend this.  It's more drama than comedy, but it's still funny and witty and thoroughly enjoyable.  Definitely one of the top tier of the genre.
