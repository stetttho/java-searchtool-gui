 This movie is unlike both what I heard of it (S&M extravaganza) and what I read on the DVD jacket (quirky romantic comedy).  It's use of S&M is far more subtle and, for lack of a better word, likable, than I expected.  If you're a bit squeamish and uneasy at the idea of S&M being a potent ingredient in the movie you're about to watch, I would still recommend "Secretary."   It's about a slightly unbalanced girl (Maggie Gylenhaal, in a very vulnerable, but strong peformance) who, upon coming home from a mental institution, is pushed to get a job.  She's very shy, but James Spader's character is attracted to that, against his will, and hires her.  What follows is the story of their attraction to each other and the needs that each one fulfills in the other.  The S&M element is not overblown and is not shown in a nasty, explicit way.  Rather, you see it as just one of the things that gives them an understanding. This is a funny, though still quite dark, love story and by the end of it, you empathize and enjoy the characters, even though they are far from perfect.  This is one of the more realistic versions of true love that I've seen.
