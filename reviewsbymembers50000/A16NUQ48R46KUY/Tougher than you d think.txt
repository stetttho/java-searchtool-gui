 I've had my eye on this for a while and finally bought it for a relative.  I've looked through it pretty extensively and concluded that this is not a book for the non-scientists (including myself) among us.   Perhaps the first sign of trouble should have been the international scientific A-team that the author thanks in the introduction.  This is exquisitely researched and really very interesting, but if you're expecting a cheeky offering with medium-hard scientific explanations, this might not be quite what you're looking for.  For though it is fascinating, there's some complicated physics in there.  If you don't have some significant college background in this, at least half of it will probably go over your head. If you're wanting fairly hard-core scientific explanations, this is a great choice.  It's well-done and (I assume) pretty accurate.  However, if you're looking for something a bit lighter, you might want to to look somewhere else.
