 I would give this book five stars, because it is extremely detailed, with great pictures and ideas.  However. . .I bought this to make screenprints for T-shirts, which the book's water-soluble method won't work for.  This is probably because the water-soluble ink will come right off in the wash, but I certainly did not think of that and nowhere in the book description or Amazon description did it mention that it wouldn't work.  In fact, in those descriptions, it mentions that it will work on fabric.  And it will, but only on fabric that you don't intend to wear and wash.  I'm a bit disappointed that this information wasn't anywhere on the website, because I think that most people that recreationally do screenprinting (recreationally enough that they need a book to tell them how to do it) want to do T-shirts or other clothing.   This is a great book and I'll probably keep it, but keep in mind that it is more for artists than for recreational users.  It gives detailed instructions on how to use it for canvas, handbags, and other art materials and it has great instructions and illustrations on how to do that.  Definitely get it if you're using screenprinting for those purposes.  (Maybe wait for the paperback edition that comes out in April, though.)
