 Perhaps I'm in the minority, but although there are a lot of great songs on this album (the haunting beauty of "The Scientist" and "Warning Sign," the sing-out-loud joy of "Green Eyes"--please please please don't let that be about Gwyneth Paltrow--,and the falsetto catchiness of "Clocks"), I still think that it's far more likely that, in five years, I'll be listening to "Parachutes," rather than this album.  There's a lot of greatness here, but for all their liner notes and "Politik," I just don't feel very much heart on this album.  Beauty, yes.  Artistry, definitely.  Real feeling, not so much.  That said, it's a wonderful album and if you're thinking about buying it, do.  You'll enjoy it.  Just listen to "Parachutes" too.  It doesn't have the complexity of "Rush. . ." but that simplicity is part of its joy.
