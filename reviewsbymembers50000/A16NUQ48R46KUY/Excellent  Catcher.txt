 "Igby" has a quick wit and darkly comic mentality that set it apart from just about everything I've seen lately.  Unlike most black comedies that are anything but funny, "Igby," partly due to its terrific cast, delivers a funny, sardonic, surprisingly poignant look at a very messed up family. If it is a rip-off of "Catcher in the Rye," at least it's a good one.  Despite a lack of confidence on my part with the acting abilities of Ryan Phillipe and Kieran Culkin, they delivered great performances, as did Susan Sarandon, Claire Danes and a host of peripheral characters.
