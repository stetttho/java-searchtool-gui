 I wasn't prepared for how funny and edgy this show is. And I think it shows what a unique comedian Dave Chappelle is that he can make me laugh so hard I cry, while also making me a bit horrified that I'm laughing at all. The racial jokes that he has in here are hilarious (the blind black white supremicist might be the funniest skit I have ever seen, Mad Real World, the crack addict, Real Movies, they're all way too funny), and make me think that Dave Chappelle is ushering a whole new era of race relations.  Not for the easily offended.
