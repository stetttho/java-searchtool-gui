 This is a movie that I really thought and felt like I would like.  And certain elements of it are very good: cinematography (although northern California doesn't really represent a challenge to film well--it's gorgeous), acting (Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley both perform well, as does the actress who plays his wife).   But it's hard for me to watch a movie without happiness, and this is one of those.  You can only be hit so many times before you stop coming back for more and "House of Sand and Fog" keeps hitting you with problems until you just end up asking, exasperated, whether the characters have gone through enough yet. There are other problems:   -The movie is over-long by at least a half-hour.   -Jennifer Connelly, who supposedly hasn't showered in days, looks dewy and beautiful.   -This woman who has had a hard time giving up on her marriage after eight months, gives up on a guy after a few hours?   -And all of this starts because she hasn't opened her mail, which doesn't make sense.  Because wouldn't other bill collectors have come running when she didn't pay month after month?  She wouldn't have electricity.  Or a phone.  -It's hard to get an emotional connection with characters that keep doing hurtful, selfish things.   -The violence at the end seemed completely unnecessary, just there to be horrifying.   -The scenery, dense with fog, that provides the segues, are lovely but overdone.  Okay, I get that this is a foggy, unclear situation.   This could have been a great movie.  The talent was there, both in acting and cinematography (direction was mediocre).  However, the story is just lethal.  Slow, with no happiness or humor.  Characters that give you no reason to feel a connection with them.  Why would you want to put yourself through something like this?
