 I saw this movie for a class and, though I consider myself to be very much a Led Zeppelin fan, I thought the movie was terrible.  Part of the problem was that this is 1/2 very bad, pretty much plotless movie starring Led Zep, and 1/2 pretty darn good concert footage. What this movie does well is show the amazing showmanship and incredible magnetism of the band, something that may not be evident to those of us too young to have seen them perform.  Robert Plant is an amazing frontman and it was fascinating to see the unattractive Englishman with bad teeth (sorry, Mr. Plant) that I saw at the beginning of the movie morph into an amazingly attractive, vibrantly sexual performer by the end.  The raw passion of the band is laid bare.    A drum solo from John Bonham that lasts (I kid you not) 20 minutes exemplifies my feelings on the movie, because though I found the solo electrifying in short bursts, I was also checking my watch by the end of it. Again, if you're a diehard Led Zep fan, you might like this.  I would still suggest you rent it, rather than buy it offhand.  If not. . .buy the albums.  Enjoy them, because they are phenomenal.
