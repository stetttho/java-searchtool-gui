 Although I am a longtime Jude Deveraux fan, I haven't loved her newest books, but I was pleasantly surprised with this one.  The characters were very well written, and the story itself felt lush, if a bit unbelievable.   I liked the idea of a woman setting out on her own, learning to live independently (even though there's another guy waiting in the wings), while solving a mystery.  If the plot is a bit pat at points, and Lillian/Bailey's life seems controlled by men, well. . .it is a romance novel, after all. The only big problem I had with the book was that I found the ending far more complicated than it should have been, especially for a book that was otherwise such a perfect beach read. This is not Ms. Deveraux's best, but if you're looking for a light read with great characters, that really draws you in, this would be a fine choice.
