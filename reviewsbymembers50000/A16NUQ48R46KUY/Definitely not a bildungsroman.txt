 I was enthralled with "The Secret History."  Beautifully written and intelligent, it's a book that makes you feel more well-read for reading and understanding most of its many classical references.  After free-basing on chick-lit for the summer, Ms. Tartt's dense work is welcome. There are many things to enjoy about this book, that the reviews don't give you an idea of. 1. The tone and characterization throughout the book are remarkably consistent.  You feel like you know their next move, and you understand why they do what they do. 2. This is a college book.  But before you get turned off by that, realize that Ms. Tartt uses the college setting to create a time-within-time narrative that is skilled and fascinating.  She writes of Hampden college as though it were the 1950s, even though small details indicate the modern setting. 3. There are many, many classical references in here, so the more you know, the more interesting you will find it.  There is also a fair amount of text in other languages, so Greek, French, and Latin will come in handy, but are not absolutely necessary. 4. The description and setting are masterful.  The college and the characters are written out in such detail that you can see and smell them. 5. This is NOT a bildungsroman (a work where you see the characters grow up and evolve, usually into better people, because of their experiences).  One of the things that I liked best about this book was the lack of that.  These characters are basically the same throughout the book.  They don't really learn anything or have any epiphanies about life.  They are as stuck in time as their school is. This book is overly long.  Some of the passages move from detailed to verbose very quickly.  But her characters and setting are flawless.  If you have the sense of nostalgia for your college years that this book demands, read this.
