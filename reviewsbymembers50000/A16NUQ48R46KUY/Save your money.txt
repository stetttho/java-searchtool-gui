 Well, it's hard to completely blame the filmmakers for this stinker when the book that it came from isn't well-written either. However, there's so much of this movie that doesn't make sense and, when you're making a suspense/thriller, it helps if the situations are plausible, and audience members don't shake their heads in disgust upon the denoument. I won't tell you who did the crimes, but I'm only saving you about five minutes of time: once you're that far into the movie, you'll have it all figured out. The movie borrows heavily from "Seven," "Silence of the Lambs," and another, much better Morgan Freeman movie, "Kiss the Girls." That was also written by James Patterson, but the director managed to make it a decent movie anyway. Watch any of those, they won't insult your intelligence quite as much.
