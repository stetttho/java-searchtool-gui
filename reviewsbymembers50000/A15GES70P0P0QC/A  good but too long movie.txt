 Even if you take into account the fact that it is a mini series it could be edited. Four hours are just too long to keep up the suspence. In the house, various scenes are just repetitive. Although I watched it at night, I was not scared at all! So much for all those creepy creatures that show up. The para-psychologist also gets a little lost in her "research" in the house. In fact, her figure is just pathetic. It is not a bad but far too long and, at times, repetitive movie. There are better ones out there.
