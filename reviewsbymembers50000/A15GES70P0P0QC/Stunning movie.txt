 Quite frankly, I cannot understand that people do not give five stars! Sean Connery as the frustrated writer is very well chosen as he reflects a man full of life - as one other critic mentioned - but is frustrated as life has shown him that it is not worth deploying that potential as most people do not get what you write anyhow. Another William Hurt performance, no please. The young black fellow plays excellent and any comparisons to Morgan Freeman and others I find far too early. This film is highly recommendable to buy as you can watch it hundreds of times. It asks the question "what do we expect from life, what do we want to achieve in life?" in a way that it does not come blasting in your face. It is a mellow but powerful message. Every serious collector ought to have this wonderful piece on his/her shelves. Go, buy it!!!!
