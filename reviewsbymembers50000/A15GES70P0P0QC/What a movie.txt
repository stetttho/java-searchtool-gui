 This is an excellent movie in many respects. The perspective is certainly original: it talks about drugs from the point of a drug dealer. He (Johnny Depp - great performance) starts as a small marihuana dealer in California, just to smell the big business changing to harder stuff. I would show this film to kids to show them the brutal world of drug dealers. The message is that even if you think you have friends and you are on top of everything, it is only an illusion that changes very quickly. Go buy it. You will watch it more than twice.
