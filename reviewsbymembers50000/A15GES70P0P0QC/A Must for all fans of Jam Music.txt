 This is yet another great album of Trey Anastasio. Simply perfect. It is typical Phish-like Jam Music that Trey enriches with all sorts of rythms you can imagine. Even a trumpet is used. Some stuff reminds you of Carlos Santana, something of some kind of Rumba/Salsa/Mexican-type good feeling music. Do not hesitate, run and buy it, you will not regret.
