 This is a wonderful overview of Bluegrass. It gave me - as a beginner - an idea where, why and how Bluegrass originated and why it became so popular. One of the singers on the tape said something that is very true: Bluegrass is music that is appealing to many but those people cannot really say why they like it. That says everything.  Buy the tape if you want to know more about Bluegrass and if you really appreciate that music. Hands off it if you do not like the music.
