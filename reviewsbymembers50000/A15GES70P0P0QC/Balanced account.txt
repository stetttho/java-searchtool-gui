 This is a very concise and easy to read book on the "day(s) Dixie died"; indeed a good title. As a critic below said, the book consists of small chapters which allows you to put the book down without losing the train of thought. The Goodrichs rightly point to the unfortunate event of Lincoln's murder as one of the reasons why reconstruction turned sour and bad feelings on both sides superseded common sense. It also confirms what General Robert E. Lee had warned of when he was about to prepare his wife's slaves to be freed: he said that this can only be done slowly as the black people (and he certainly also meant the white folks) were not yet ready. This is also the message of this book. Sometimes a little bit of patience and tolerance on both sides could have avoided that terrible war as Southerners had to free their slaves at some point anyhow.
