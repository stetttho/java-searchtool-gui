 This is the second movie, next to Uprising (highly recommendable too), that shows the tragic Warsaw uprising. Only, the Pianist goes beyond and tells the story of the Jewish-Polish pianist Szpilman. I was not only fascinated by the performances of the actors but - as a German - I felt sad and extremely sorry for what has happened to all those people in the name of the German people. Actually, it was hard to swallow to see a German officer walking up to some Jews, returning to the Ghetto, and randomly shooting some of them dead. It was the way it was performed that was utterly believable. This inhuman capacity that some Human beings have is shown brilliantly in this movie. However, it is not only the Germans but also the one Polish character that supposedly helps Szpilman to survive and simply betrayes him and almost let him die. It is the human dimension that makes this movie special. A very nice and very believable scene is placed at the end when Szpilman was saved by a German officer who eventually dies in a Soviet concentration camp. The film shows also that not all Germans were bad; something many movies end up doing: bad Germans, good Allies. However, life is not like that and there is a lot of grey in between black and white.
