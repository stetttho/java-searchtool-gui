 This is a film about the tragic Uprising of the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto. Although, I am not an expert on exactly that topic the film seems to cover the story fairly well. The heroic struggle of people who were outgunned and desperate against an enemy that would actually use the worst of mankind to terminate the uprising. A film covering both, German atrocities against Jewish AND Polish people together would not have been possible. The two hours normal length cinema movies would not allow a proper coverage of those two related and complicated topics. Some of the reviewers do not seem to grasp what this film and other movies such as The Pianist like to show: the human and inhuman dimensions. If people think that they can just point to the Germans as the bad guys, they did not get the point. Plus: some scenes showing German troops marching into the Ghetto were clearly over the top. If you like to see an excellent movie that portrays the Nazis' mentality, watch "The Wannsee Conference".  What some people here forget to mention are all the Jews who served as "Kapos", policemen, that helped the Germans to gather all the Jews to be transported to the camps. Those "Kapos" are also shown in the movie. The element of survival plays a major part here and if you want to see how various people react to that problem, go watch and buy it as it is worthwhile.
