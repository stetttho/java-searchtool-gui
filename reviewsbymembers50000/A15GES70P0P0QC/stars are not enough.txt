 Michael Wood has done it again. After his Alexander the Great (also highly recommendable) he came up with this fascinating account of the conquest of the New World. The video as well as the book are concise and highly informative. The video was almost like a movie. It resembled a thriller that you do not want to leave as you fear to miss something. For me as a European it was extremely interesting and a "must buy". For Americans it should be a MUST. You will not regret to buy this excellent documentary. Let us hope Michael Wood produces something else soon.
