 There is not much I can or want to add what other people have already mentioned. While it is certainly recommendable to buy, I find the end a little predictable. That is why I only gave four stars. Cate Blanchett, Keanu Reeves and all the others deserve five stars for acting. One more point: certain things seem to be standard in a hollywood production when the movie takes place in the South. That is either a Klansmen appears or a slave owner that beats up his slaves continuously or, as it is in this case, a redneck wife-beater (played well by Keanu Reeves) who shows no tolerance for his wife's excursions to the fortune teller (Cate Blanchett) and obviously beats her up badly. Now, if you are not offended by these eternal stereotypes, the movie is enjoyable. However, it is about time to make a film that depicts Southerners as they are: as normal human beings with all the good and bad sites to it.
