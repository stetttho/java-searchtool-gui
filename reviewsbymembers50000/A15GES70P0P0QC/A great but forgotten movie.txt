 This movie is excellent from the beginning to the end. For once, German officers were portrayed in an acceptable way. They are not the robot machines as they are usually shown. Although, in the beginning you seem to see that typical old picture of the cold blooded Nazi-beast. But the more the film develops the more you find out that behind those "strong" characters stand people like you and me. People who have doubts. People who have weaknesses. This is exactly the strength of the movie. Why? Because the more the character unfolds the more you become intrigued by it. Obviously, General Tanz is a little bit of a carricature. This exaggeration of his character is however used deliberately to come to a surprising end. The cast is absolutely stunning and every single one of them deserves five stars. Especially Peter O'Toole plays it very well. I would say, anyone who is interested in murder cases connected with a film on Nazi Germany and the Second World War should get it.  A last comment: Although produced in the 1960s it beats most of the recent productions on Nazi Germany in terms of really understanding what was going on.
