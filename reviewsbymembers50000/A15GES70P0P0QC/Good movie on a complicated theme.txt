 This is a very enjoyable movie which tries to be historically accurate and, at the same time, provides us with a personal touch. It is a film about the English breaking the enigma code of the Germans in World War II - most likely one of the decisive "victories" of the Allies in that war. If you are into spy movies connected to World War II combined with a personal story of the codebreakers, buy it. The actors do a very fine job.  A last remark: finally the credit for this decisive "victory" goes to the ones who deserve it, the British counter-intelligence.
