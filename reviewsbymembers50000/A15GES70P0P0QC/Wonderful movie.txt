 This movie will appeal to all people who have "a couple" of years of marriage behind them. It is a story of a family falling apart as "love has come to its conclusion". After 27 years of marriage time has changed: All the members of the family still love each other but in different ways. Mother and father live apart but still respect each other. The two daughters slowly find their own way - one through pregnancy, the other through the painful teen years.  Do not expect a stringent story line. This are rather various shots of family life - but well taken. Here, the talks between the father and his younger daughter stick out, especially when the father admits to his daughter that he had never found a way to talk to her as her mother had monopolized her. And he confesses that if she would have been a son it might have been different. But now that the mother was gone he finally came to appreciate having a daughter (in fact he has two). Younger people might not enjoy the film as they will not (no offence) understand the message of the film. Also recommendable: the wonderful scenary of the South Carolinian coast area. Wonderful impressions. A film with a lot of emotions. So, if you are 35 and above, have children and ... buy the film.
