 Anyone who is interested in the history of the "Civil War" ought to watch this movie. It is an honest account of an episode which happened daily during that war: a group of Yankee soldiers arriving at a farm in Kentucky requisitioning food for the Union army. The farmer is absent, fighting for the Confederacy and leaving behind wife and son.  Interesting are the emotions between the Captain and the farmer's wife, between the Captain and his soldiers, and, last but not least, the human aspects which come to the forefront within the course of the movie. Again, anyone who is into an honest account of what happened and is not into bombastic Hollywood productions would be delighted having this movie.
