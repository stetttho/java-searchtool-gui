 This is another case of a well prepared advertisement campaign. Weeks before the film entered the cinemas the world was praising the film as something nobody else had ever seen before. Now, there lay exactly the problem. The 1964 version of "The Fall of the Roman Empire" (with Sophia Loren) tells more or less the same story but without all the sound effects available now. Take those Dolby Suround/THX effects and you will have a very dull story. That's why I insist watching The Fall of the Roman Empire might lack some technical quality but it beats The Gladiator in most parts. If you like battle scenes and man-to-man fights you get the right movie. Anything beyond that is an insult.
