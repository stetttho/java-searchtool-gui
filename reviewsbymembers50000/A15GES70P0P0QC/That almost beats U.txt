 This film almost beats the worst war/history movie I have ever come across: U-571. Druids looks to me like a bad soap opera. The costumes looked as if the makers of this film have studied cartoons like "Asterix and Obelix" rather than history books. Christophe Lambert has played in a lot of good movies but also bad ones and this is one of his worst. Everything in this film just has the feel of being fake. The worst are the Teutons who are ALL shown red-haired. What a joke. Did they all fall into the same pot of red paint? Brandauer and his cynicism kept me going in that movie. This is how Caesar should be portrayed: as a ruthless, cynical, and ice-cold careerist politician who walks over corpses to achieve his political aims. That portrayal of Caesar in the film is good and historically accurate. The rest should be kept in silence. If the French ever see how the Gauls are portrayed in this film, the director will never be allowed to enter France again.
