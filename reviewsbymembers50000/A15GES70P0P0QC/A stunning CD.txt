 This is a wonderful compilation of Bluegrass music. Anyone interested in that kind of music and anyone who likes the movie or lives nearby the actual site of the movie MUST buy this album. Alison Krauss' "You will be my ain true love" should have won the oscar. What a wonderful and deeply sensual song. You can feel the emotions. Go get the album tomorrow!
