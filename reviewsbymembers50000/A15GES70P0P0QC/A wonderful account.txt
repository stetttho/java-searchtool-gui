 This book explains very well why there was so much violence in the Western scenario. If you like, it also explains the violence following the civil war in the reconstruction era. If you are used to draw a gun whenever you see a political opponent one should not be surprised about the cruelties committed by the Klan after the war. This book also shows the problematic stand the civilized (Indian) nations were confronted with, being forced to choose between Union or Confederacy. To all Southerners, this is a ballanced account descibing that particular period of time. Buy it.
