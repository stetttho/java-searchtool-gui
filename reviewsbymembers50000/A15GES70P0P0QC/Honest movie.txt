 One can be as favorable as one wants, but the James-Younger gang were criminals that saw the big "bucks" in front of them and that is what counted. The movie tries to be accurate, yet sometimes it sounds a little stiff. Nevertheless, anybody who is interested in a straight forward story is going to be fine with this one. Certainly recommendable.
