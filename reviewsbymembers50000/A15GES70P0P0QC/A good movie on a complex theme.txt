 This film is a very brave effort to cover the complex story of Vlad Dracula or Vlad Tepes (the impaler). It is a story of a Romanian prince who tries to keep his country independent from the Turks. Although outnumbered and outgunned he makes every effort to unite and prepare his country for a long fight with the Ottomans. The film depicts the conspiracies and back manoeuvres at the court levels very well and the viewer will get an idea of the historical settings. Also, the costumes and the images of the castles in the background are fairly accurate. In short, it is not a fantastic but interesting movie. Towards the end, the film makers do something utterly unnecessary: they link the Vlad Tepes story to the Dracula theme of Bram Stoker. Something that is taken from the realms of fantasy. Vlad Tepes was never connected to the vampyre theme. This is an innovation of literature and the film makers unfortunately follow it, instead of just leaving the story as it is; a story that is interesting enough to stand on its own.
