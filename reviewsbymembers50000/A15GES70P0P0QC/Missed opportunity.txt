 What a pity! For once, a kind of historical theme based in the Middle Ages was picked up by the film industry and what is the result: a mixture of Mad Max, Alien and the 13th Warrior plus Techno-Music and technical equipment that did not quite fit into the time. I wonder how the producers put those things together!  Anyhow, if you are looking for action-type movie without hoping to see mythical themes covered then you may enjoy it. But: thank god it only lasts for 89 minutes. Christoph Lambert is not as bad as some reviewers write but lightyears away from his performance in Highlander. In conclusion: a lost opportunity to show something interesting. Never even consider buying this ...
