 This is a wonderful movie with a very original plot. It shows the prejudices of a small and narrow-minded community towards anything that comes from the outside. The local aristocrat rules over the village as a feudalist landlord. The opening of the chocolaterie comes into this - to say the least - conservative setting like thunder and lightening. Obviously, the landlord immediately sets out for maintaining desperately the social and moral status quo undermined now by the exotic owner of the chocolate shop. You cannot better show to what results prejudices and sudden judgements can lead. Wonderful. I would recommend this film to everybody who is interested in the display of various characters and their interactions. All the characters are wonderfully played. I liked especially the young priest dancing to Elvis' tunes while working in the garden. Just wonderful.
