 Thank you Harry. I read this book years ago and I can only recommend it to anyone that really wants to know what happened in Nazi-occupied countries. This is not necessarily about the Netherlands only. You may take any of the countries under Nazi rule.  Mulisch describes what happens to a man who starts investigating into the death of his family during WWII and he slowly finds out that things were not the way people thought. History books may tell us facts but they cannot reveal the human tragedies that happen.
