 This film is the ultimate nightmare! When reading some of the reviews I could not believe these people had seen the film, neither could I believe what some people wrote. I mean, not being accurate about historical facts is one thing, but simply misleading the audience to show once again how great the boys did is another - and on top of it to read: "teaching history belongs to the classroom" that - I'm afraid - kicked my brains out. Man, wake up, nobody pays attention in history lessons at school (I am a history teacher - I know what I am talking about) The youngsters nowadays learn by visual effects! So, to show a film and refer to fiction but then claim it is a tribute to various U-boat crews during WWII????!!!&%$? Isn't there something wrong in the logic? Then, Harvey Keitel was a miscast. The Captain not at all convincing. Several sequences simply copied from Das Boot. The tension on the boat was more than fake! How can people compare this film to Das Boot. And last but not least: the scene when they capture the German submarine ... please don't let me comment on that one. Those scenes reminded me of Steven Seagall, Bruce Willis and some others of that category - only they do it much better. Last: the shoot-out with the German submarine?! Please do not insult our intelligence. No, this film does not even deserve a single star. Do not buy it.
