 This movie characterizes in a very enjoyable, light and humorous way the hypocritical world of advertising. It shows how easily one can rise and fall in the world of advertisment. It certainly is true that sometimes a young and fresh spirit can bring a lot of "swing" into an advertisment firm. The actors do a fantastic job. Highly recommendable for people who like to think a little critically about modern society, yet wants to have fun at the same time. Just wonderful. Go buy it.
