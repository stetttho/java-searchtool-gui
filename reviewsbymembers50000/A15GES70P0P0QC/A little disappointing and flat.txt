 When the DVD was out on sale I, based on the previews and excited about another movie with Tom Hanks, ran to pre-order. Finally, I got the chance to see it and I have to admit: I was disappointed. Godfather has definetely not been beaten. Ok, it is a story about a mobster's son who discovers his father's true "profession". But, that his boss, who considers him (Tom Hanks) like a son, would turn against his favored "son" and put out a contract on him, is simply not believable nor logical. Only because the son has witnessed a killing, the "godfather" orders the extermination of the entire family of his favourite "employee"? Also, Tom Hanks is very flat and utterly unbelievable as a mobster. The killer that is supposed to get rid of Tom Hanks is indeed a joke. And Paul Newman as a godfather like mobster boss? Somehow, throughout the movie I missed the connection to the movie and I trapped myself looking at the watch. Not an ideal scenario for a movie of that genre. If you are a fan of Hanks, get the movie in order to complete your collection. If you expect yet another good movie in the line of Godfather or Untouchables you will be sadly mistaken.
