 Although I am neither an expert on Bluegrass nor on women performing Bluegrass music I like this record very much. It gives an overview on Bluegrass played by women which is excellent for beginners who have no idea about that kind of music. If you hate what some people might call "Hill-Bill" music don't buy it. But if you like Bluegrass you will enjoy it. How can one not enjoy Rhonda Vincent or Laura Lewis?
