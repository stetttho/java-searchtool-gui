 What happens when you take your favourite directing / writing team and combine them with one of your favourite actors?  In spite of the negative reviews herein, I took the chance on this film wondering how it could possibly go awry... and sadly it does BIG TIME!  This is literally the worst movie I've ever seen Tom Hanks in and for the Coen brothers to allow this tragedy to happen is beyond words.  The Tom Hanks character would have been far better (and as a result the whole movie much easier to watch), if Hanks' learned, PhD, professor portrayal had been a TOTAL FARCE and displayed to ONLY the landlady.  At all other times in the film, Hanks should have portrayed a mis-fit character just like everyone else.  Geez guys, I'm a rank amateur story-teller and I saw that one a country mile away.  Having said all that, once you learn to ignore Tom Hanks' character in this film, the remainder is classic Coen brothers.  Every one of the other characters is PERFECTLY cast and written... and Marlon Wayans!  BRILLIANT!  In spite of this, the secondary characters are not quite enough to carry the entire film on their own shoulders;  the Hanks master-mind character was essential in the film, but badly done.  The plot and writing of the overall film is hilarious, the physical comedy well done and the background characters are vivid and totally believable just like every other Coen film.  This is a comedy well worth seeing and highly enjoyable ONCE you learn to watch everything other than Tom Hanks.  Recommended.
