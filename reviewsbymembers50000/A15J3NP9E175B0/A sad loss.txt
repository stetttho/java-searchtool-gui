 Well if Porter Cable have discontinued this router it truly is a sad day.  "Little Round Top" has been around for as long as I can remember and I have used mine for millions of tasks over the years with absolutely no problems, issues, or down-time.  Original switch, cord and brushes still intact and no sign of wear or tear.  Look up the word "reliable" in the dictionary and you will see a picture of this router. Yes it is wonderful that there are high-powered, variable speed, multi-use routers on the market with a plethora of attachments.  But many times you need a small, powerful router bigger than a laminate trimmer and smaller than a plunge router that you can easily handle with one hand.  And the fact that the base was interchangeble with the 1 3/4 HP PC router (including the plunge base for it) was an added bonus that I have taken advantage of uncountable times over the years. Fairwell old friend, hopefully PC won't "replace" you with some piece of junk made in China.
