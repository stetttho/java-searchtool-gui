 Over the years I've purchased many styles & types of clamps for a variety of uses.  These aluminum bar clamps are wonderfully lightweight and can effectivly be used in a variety of applications.  However, I would not consider these to be a mainstay in any clamp collection.    These clamps are great for both price & performance, but because the bar is aluminum they do bend as pressure is applied which renders them useless in certain circumstances such as glueing up frame and panel doors or flat panels.  For these operations nothing will ever replace super heavy duty steel 'I' beam or box beam clamps for reliability and long service life... but building up a collection of these takes a great deal of money.  If your buying clamps forget pipe clamps (although we all start out with them because of price) and consider buying a few of these instead.  They are a worthy tool for the price but I would never consider buying them longer than 48".
