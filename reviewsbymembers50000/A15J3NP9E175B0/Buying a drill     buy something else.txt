 Buying a potential collectors item?... buy this.  I must admit I had a rush of nostalgia when I saw this drill (I had one of the originals and it literally served me for decades before I finally killed it), and I raced out a bought one (for considerably more money than it is offered here).  Athough it looks like the original, all comparisons should stop there, and as a drill I must say this was a major disappointment.  First, the chuck is the cheapest chuck I have ever had on any drill at anytime.  I defy anyone to get it tight enough to hold drill bits without slipping in use, on driver bits and holders it's fine.  Second, if I had a nickle for everytime I've pinched my finger in the trigger I wouldn't need to worry about making a living using tools.  Hard to explain but there is a gap between the metal case and the plastic trigger, and when you pull the trigger the gap opens, and when you let the trigger go my finger is generally in that gap... youch!  And finally, the drill cannot stand on it's battery it must be laid down flat.  All it would have taken to rectify this was a miniscule adjustment of the angle of the battery to the handle. When I bought the fore-father of this "look-alike" Black and Decker made industrial quality tools for use and abuse on a daily basis, today they make "consumer products" that happen to include "tools".  This drill is a classic example of the poorly designed, poorly made in China junk B&D now try and fob off as real tools.  If you want a drill for daily use, buy something else, if you want something that is a potential collectors item buy this.  But don't make the same mistake as I did and take it out of the package and use it... it then becomes worthless as both a tool and as a collectors item.
