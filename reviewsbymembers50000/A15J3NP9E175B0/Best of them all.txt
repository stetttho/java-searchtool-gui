 I'll admit that this is the best 1/2 sheet sander on the market and has been for 30 plus years.  Simple to use, vibration free, reliable as the day is long and a high quality finish are all part of what you are buying with this model.    So why have I given it a 4 star rating?  Two words, dust collection... or lack thereof.  For as long as this model has been on the market PC have still not given any serious consideration to how to effectively collect the considerable amount of dust generated by this tool.  There is a boot PC sells as an add-on that fits over the base.  However, unless your only sanding flat surfaces AND are willing to drag a vacuum hose around you can rule this accessory out.  Something, anything would help especially with so much dust control regulations being imposed by various government agencies, work place safety boards, fire marshals and insurance companies.  Other than that a great tool that will basically last forever.  Highly recommended.
