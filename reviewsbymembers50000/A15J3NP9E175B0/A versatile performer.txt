 I'm pretty sure everything that should be said has been said about this belt sander.  I worked with the PC "locomotive" belt sander for years and that is a fantastic tool for heavy duty, continuous surface sanding.  However, if you are looking for "medium range" belt sander (not too heavy, not too light) and versatile (can sand large surfaces, but is also capable of fine control for things like sanding the joints of frame and panel doors) this is the sander for you.  I find this model versatile enough for all purposes even to use one handed for scribing panels, trim and moulding on site.  The DeWalt variable speed 3 x 21 is too heavy for one-handed use, and the super light plastic belt sanders made by DeWalt, Makita and Black & Decker are worth avoiding. Belt changes are simple, belt tracking is spot on, dust collection is quite good and the noise level is worthy of hearing protection during extended use.  The dust bag and cord placement is fine once you get used to it, and as with any power tool don't let your mind, power cord or fingers wander (my sympathies to the poor guy who got his fingers sucked up inside... that's gotta hurt!).  The clogging of the dust intake (not common with finer grits of sanding belts, but I've had chunks of wood get sucked up in there too) can be cleaned with a blast of compressed air from the outlet (where the dust bag fits on) back down.  Although it would be good to have a vacuum hook-up to use instead of the dust bag, I've always found that dragging the hose around while your sanding becomes more of a pain than it's worth. Powerful, reliable and a joy to use.  Highly recommended.
