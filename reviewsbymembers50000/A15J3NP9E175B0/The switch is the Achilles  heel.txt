 Other reviewers are correct, this is a terrific little sander with one problem, the switch is tricky to operate.  The switch is too small and the rubber dust cover over it makes the action of the switch awkward at best.  Getting it to turn on or off can be a two or three attempt task, this should be a no-brainer for DeWalt to fix in future production.  Other than that the quality of the finish it produces is excellent, noise level acceptable and the dust collection is a major improvement over the old 1/4 sheet sanders.  I typically use this sander immediately after my 1/2 sheet Porter Cable (with no dust collection) and the DeWalt sucks up all the dust left behind by the PC.  Highly recommended.
