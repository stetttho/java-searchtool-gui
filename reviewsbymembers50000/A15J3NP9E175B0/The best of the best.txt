 Although my Lamello is over 15 years old the design and quality has changed very little over the years.  After all there is very little one can do to improve on perfection.  This is a standard tool in just about every professional shop I have ever worked in or visited, and I would recommend this item without hesitation.   Costly... yes.  But try and tell me there is no cost in screwing around with a tool in order to just use it, or having work ruined because of a mis-adjustment.  Plate joinery is a high precision task, therefore a high precision tool is required and the Lamello gets 5 stars in this regard.  My Lamello comes out of the box, gets used, and gets put away, no muss no fuss, perfection everytime; and has done so for 15 years and will likely be around for my grand children to use when I pass on. I can't comment on service relative to this product as I've never had mine serviced, and in almost 30 years of woodworking have I ever met anyone who has done more than change the blade when it gets dull.  That in itself is quite a testament to the durability and longevity of this product. At one time all woodworking tools & machinery were made the way Lamello make their tools.  It's a joy to find a company that still manufacture products to the highest standards possible.
