 I have owned and used this saw daily for 3 years and I have never been disappointed.  It was specifically purchased for the construction of a 12' x 17' storage shed and was used to cut everything from 2 x 4's and window trim right up to a laminated 4 x 12 beam.  Mitre cuts, cross cuts and compound mitres in all materials is a breeze, but invest in the proper blades for the job and keep them sharp (goes without saying but I never cease to be amazed).   My saw is used primarily in a shop environment and mainly as a replacement for a radial arm saw (cross-cuts 8/4 hard maple like a hot knife through soft butter), honestly I cannot imagine working without it.  I had heard from other trades that the saw "goes out of adjustment frequently" and I must admit I have had this problem on job sites.  The primary issue is the saws weight and awkwardness in moving it around.  The four screws used to secure the adjustable platen to the saw base do loosen up with use and just picking this Mother up can effect the saws precision.  The good news is it's not a major ordeal to re-set the alignment and a little bit of lock-tite prevents the set screws from wiggling loose.  Although the saw can be placed on a work-mate (barely), I would recommend the DeWalt stand (the adjustable material supports alone make it worth the money).  And if DeWalt would just put adjustable legs or feet on this stand it would be a perfect solution both in the shop and on-site.  Yes the saw throws dust everywhere (which is more of a problem in a client's house than in the shop or outside), but a vacuum hook-up greatly helps and in reality every mitre saw does the same. Don't be intimidated by the price or the size of the saw and use care when moving it around, you will not regret making this purchase.  Highly recommended.
