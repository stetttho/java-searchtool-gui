 I have one of these and I find it invaluable.  However, based on  what I've heard from others and what I've read here, there seems to be a great deal of confusion on how it works.  BEFORE you use it for the first time, roll up the edges of the sanding disc and put dust on the crepe surface.  Being both a male and a typical male I didn't read the instructions (instructions are for sissies and beside I know what I'm doing... most common last words prior to getting a Darwin Award), put my sander in it for the first time and had it vibrate right off my work bench with my sander in it... "what a piece of *&^%$#~!" was pretty much my reaction.   However, after reading the instructions (humble pie can be quite tasty) and several months of use it has paid for itself time and again in both saved time (not waiting for the sander to wind down) and sandpaper (the crepe scrubs and cleans the sanding discs like a charm).  In fact I'd say it gets better with use, and there is a tension adjustment to control the rotation resistance (if required).   Made in beautiful Angus, Ontario famous for... well Angus is just up the road from me. Highly recommended.
