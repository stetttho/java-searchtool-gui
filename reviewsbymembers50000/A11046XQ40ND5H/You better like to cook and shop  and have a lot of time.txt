 While the concepts behind this diet are solid, the thought and planning that went into the menus and recipes are maddening.  You need to do a LOT of planning ahead to follow the meal plan (I've been on it for one week, and already I've had to marinate steak, shrimp and chicken overnight.)  The recipes are by and large excellent, but the ingredient lists are expensive.  And if you're cooking for one, as I am, you wind up trying to cut things in halves, quarters or eighths, or have a lot of leftovers.   Breakfasts are problematic.  Who has time to get up and cook a smoked salmon frittata before work, while preparing dilled shrimp salad for lunch (if you remembered to marinate the shrimp overnight) and assemble snacks of cottage cheese stuffed tomatoes or cumcumber rounds with salmon spread.   I believe the diet works, but a much more flexible menu plan is needed.  Also, factual information is inconsistent.  The book says you can eat eggs or regular mayo, yet many recipes call for egg substitute (no problem) or light mayo (nothing can make that taste good.)  Portion sizes are also vague.  For example, one night you make marinated steak, the next day you're supposed to have the leftover steak on greens with a salad dressing.  What leftover steak?  If you make the right amount, you have to cook more for lunch tomorrow.  I still recommend the book, though.  Just beware or wait for the 2nd edition.
