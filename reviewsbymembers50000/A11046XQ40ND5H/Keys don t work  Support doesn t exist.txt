 I've had my keyboard for about four months.  At first, it was a pleasure to use and I had no complaints.  But it soon developed a problem.  The "a", "q" and "2" keys started working intermittently.  They soon stopped working at all, and now the problem is spreading to the surrounding keys.  I've called Palm support a couple of times trying to get it fixed, and the responses ranged from, you need to update the driver, to the keyboard is dirty to, yeah, other people have had problems with it, too.  I asked if I could send it in for repair, and they said, sure, IF I sent it in the ORIGINAL PACKAGING with the ORIGINAL RECEIPT.  The reciept I have; the original packaging I don't.  Sorry, they said, then we can't fix it for you.
