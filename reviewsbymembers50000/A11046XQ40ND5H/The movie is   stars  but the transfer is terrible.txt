 There are numerous problems with video transfer on this disc.  The progressive scan seems to be off in every three out of five frames, causing weird blurring and shifting of scan lines.  On some players (mine, for example) the disk is pretty much unwatchable.  It looks like a badly deteriorated VHS tape.  Wait til Universal studios offers a reissue with the transfer problems corrected.
