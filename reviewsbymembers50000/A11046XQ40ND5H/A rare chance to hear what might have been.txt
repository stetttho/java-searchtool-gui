 No one could write a melody line like Leonard Bernstein.  Coupled with a gift for rhythm and harmony, he created some truly lovely moments now captured on this recording.  The quasi-operetta style of "Candide" is clearly evident in Captain Hook's songs, but it is the lovely and lyrical moments of "Who am I?" and "Dream with Me" that epitomize Bernstein's gifts as a Broadway composer.    The incidental music runs a gamut of styles and moods depending on its place in the show, and all are wonderful examples of his ability to create a mood.  Both the vocal and orchestral numbers demonstrate a composer beginning to come into his own, and there are bits here and there which clearly foreshadow his later Broadway and more "classical" works.  Of particular interest is the bonus track, "Spring Will Come Again," intended for a musical version of Thornton Wilder's "The Skin of Our Teeth."  It's a gorgeous melody, and when the project was abandoned, Bernstein, like many composers, recycled it.  It became the main melody of the second movement of his choral piece, the "Chichester Pslams," composed in 1963 for the Boston Symphony Orchestra's 75th anniversary.  (He was a couple years late in delivering it.)    The performers, Linda Eder and Daniel Narducci do a fine job with the material.  I highly recommend this.
