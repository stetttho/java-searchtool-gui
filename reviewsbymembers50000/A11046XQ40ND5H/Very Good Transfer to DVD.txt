 Commenting on what a wonderful Christmas special this is would be superfluous: I would only be echoing the comments of all the reviews of the  VHS edition.  As for the DVD edition, it's a good transfer, clean, no  artifacts, good sound.  Skip the second feature, "It's Christmastime  Again, Charlie Brown."  It just doesn't compare.  My only gripe about  the DVD: they fixed the one moment in the original master that captured my  attention and my heart.  Every year, I watched for the moment when the  Peanuts gang gathered around the newly decorated little tree and began  singing "Loo loo loo, loo loo loo loo loo" to the tune of  "Hark the Herald Angels Sing."  As the camera pulls in on the  left side of the group and pans right, Pig Pen's head disappears for one  frame when they all take a breath.  You can see Patty's orange dress  suddenly appear where his head was.  I was really sorry to see them fix  that.  I don't know why, but it makes the cartoon even more endearing to  me.
