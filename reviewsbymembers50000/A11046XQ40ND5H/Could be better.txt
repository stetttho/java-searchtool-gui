 I agree with the reviewer who commented on the editing and content.  The editing is appalling, and I found a number of inaccuracies in some summaries (for example, Beethoven's first two symphonies contain the Sonata in c-minor and the Moonlight Sonata!)  It makes me wonder where there are other inaccuracies I didn't catch because I don't know enough about the subject matter. Some of the content is interesting.
