 I like this light for the fact that you can remove the base and use it to directly mount the unit on a homemade bracket or mounting hole on your tools. I found the magnet was not as strong as i would like, but by mounting it directly on my DP with a homemade bracket (connected to the bolts used for mounting the motor) it works great, not utterly perfect, but better than any other light of ths nature.
