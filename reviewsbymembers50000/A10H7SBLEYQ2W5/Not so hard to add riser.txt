 I ordered the riser and it arrived a week later. took it out of the box and started to install with the fear in the back of my mind that the top would fall off etc. etc... between the top and bottom sections, and also on the riser block, there are pins that make sure you align the block. These alignment pins also allow you to release the top to grab your long connecting bolt and nut and place them. Removing the top is not so scarey, and not so heavy as some might make it out to be... the directions could have better close up pictures of the adding the new blade guard extension in the fron of the saw. Now i just have to wait for my new blades to arrive from Timberwolf/Suffolk machinery and i can test this out.
