 This magazine does well for the regular joe woodworker geared to a garage shop or small separate shop (less towards a pro or highend furniture maker, but plenty of tutorials to help get you there.)...nice to have tips and tricks that i would actually use, and a decent companion website. four stars only because they need to do more of what they do best and drop the tool issue and replace with a regular issue. as with all wwing mags it is only 6-7 issues per year.
