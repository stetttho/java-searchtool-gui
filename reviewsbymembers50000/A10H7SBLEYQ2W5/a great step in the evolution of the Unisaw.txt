 I have been researching the new Delta saws and comparing them to both powermatic and jet models. After extensive side by side comparisons i came to the easy decision to have the 36-844 Unisaw as my main saw until I die. Many people will tell you that the powermatic is beefier and better built, but i would beg to differ. I found the Unisaw to be rock solid, and more importantly with a better finish in many respects. also with PM being bought out by jet i wonder where that saw is going...already they have changed the PM saw where some parts are pre or post 2001, i think delta has the staying power here... With this new saw the motor cover has been redesigned to improve dust collection (DC) as well as the DC port has been moved to the rear of the saw (port included) (the port is in the rear so that the cabinet can be used for right or left tilt models), with an added interior ramp for the dust to find its way into your hose (when my DC is running the interior of the box is dust free)...also when you compare the two saws try to remove the motor cover on the PM, it is nether quick or easy...try to compare the movement of the height and angle adjustmnent between the PM and delta...I found the delta was much smoother and without slop in the wheel...the PM does have a nice finish on the top, but i think that is only done because you immediately see 'a finely polished top' and think the rest of the saw is as such...look closely and look under the hood...compare the blade guards and how you expect to use them...i always found the PM to be difficult to see your cut line causing me to get closer to the blade to see what i am cutting...not safe...also one thing to look at is the package that you get with the saw, mobile base, decent blade and others make this the new standard for unisaws....I did not mention Jet too much as it did not make the final cut to two saws, i want to be able to give this saw to my son...and his son.... the only gripe with this saw is having to wire the garage for 30 amp 220 power as directed by the local Delta Servicing Center. A few added points about the saw...set up went very well with every hole lining up and all parts there...the biesmeyer table(box frame construction) is rock solid and stronger/more durable than the Unifence table(single sheet laminated)...connection of table to saw is better with the beisemeyer, the miter guage was off by .001" and the arbor runout was .001" (no need to change those)...the fence was off by .005" and very easily corrected...I really like the stability of the fence, very square and very stable. I have not checked the top but i don't see that it is off by more than .002" with .003" being the tolerance. when setting it up the only time you might want someone it to get it from the pallet to the mobile stand...it doesn't hurt to move it gently and not bust a gut...the rest of the saw goes together well with one guy....when it comes time to add the ext.table measure carefully the location for the legs and attach them...turn the table over and put the feet into the corner of the mobile base...the table will not go anywhere or fall over...if the table is standing to high...adjust the feet to make the legs shorter...you will see the table drop slowly to the level of the extension wing...works very well.... the unifence setup comes with a shelf below the extension table...there is not reason you can't do the same...on the body of the saw there will be two holes where the unifence shelf bracket would go...you can either create your own bracket, or ask for the bracket from Delta (~$8) with the same color as the Limited edition paint...then all you have to do is create a wooden cross brace at the legs to support the other side of the shelf....make sure that you take into account the need for the mobile base lifting arm to rotate...you may want to screw a couple of supporting stretchers on the shelf depending on the weight of what you might put there...I store my tenon jig and a couple of sleds.... if you are interested in an outfeed table there is one from Delta that is hinged and will fold down when you don't need it, and one from beisemeyer that is more fixed...another option is to build a table on lockable castors that is 1/8" shorter than the table top...with the wheels you can move it to the center of the shop if you need a workspace...maybe add a couple of fold down wings on piano hinges so the work table has more space, and fold them out of the way when the table sits behind the saw....if you have never tried an outfeed table then I would strongly suggest making one/buying one...once you have had one you can never go back to without...imagine being able to cut full sheets of ply with no help at all... A few notes about why i chose left tilt instead of right tilt: you get a safer cut when cutting beveled panel goods the panel will not bind between the fence and blade as easily as with right tilt you will have the pretty side up when beveling and you will get a much cleaner cut...with right tilt the pretty side will be down and you will have more tear out on the delta left tilts the motor door will be on the outside of the saw and you will get easier access...you will have more space under the saw extension table for a shelf... if you have any woodworking questions on the Delta or other WW tools vist the free forum located at woodnet dot net, they will help you with everything from care and feeding the shop wiring..a large and helpful group of guys and gals.
