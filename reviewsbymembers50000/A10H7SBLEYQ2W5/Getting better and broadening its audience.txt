 FWW is the standard for WWing magazines. It has gotten much better in including more tips, tricks, and tutorials for those WWers who are more hobbyist level, I would say that is very welcome. Each issue has at least an item or two I would like to do, or implement, or learn....they have greatly improved the drawings and article support information (no full-sized plans if you like that sort of thing) If I had only one WWing mag, i would select this one, a few years ago i would not have. if you are a mid level WWer, you will expand your abilities with this mag and be inpsired to do greater/more  difficult techniques and pieces....price is a little steep compared to other mags, but you will find yourself keeping these, because something you read may not be used today, but next year you will want to read the article again. I really like that the major articles can be read on the binding when the magazine is sitting on your shelf...like national geographic.
