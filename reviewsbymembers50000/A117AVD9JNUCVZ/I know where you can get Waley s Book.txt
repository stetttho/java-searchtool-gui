 I agree with my friend from Paris...Waley's book is one of the greatest books printed in the 20th century. It brought to Western eyes the great riches of Chinese Literature. It was a standard work in colleges in the U.S. and Britian. It is an indictment on our bankrupt American culture to allow such great works like this to go out of print. However, I have good news for you. You can get a copy very resonalbly priced at abebooks.com. It will be a used copy but it will be hardbound and if you are lucky you might get a first edition.
