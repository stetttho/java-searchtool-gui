      I will have to brake it to you guys.....Allah is a PAGAN GOD! He was worshipped as a MOON GOD in pre-islamic Arabia. The crescent moon image on the flags of most arabic countries is a symbol of this pagan connection. Also the muslim calandar is based on the cycles of the moon. The sacred Hebrew Calander uses BOTH the sun and moon to figure time and dates.       So you think I am wrong? Oh really? No God but a pagan and satanic one like Allah will require his devotees to cut the heads off of human beings. Christ says "love your enemies"...Allah says "cut your enemies throats". Hmmmmm...which God would I like to serve....  ASK NICK BERG WHICH GOD HE WOULD RATHER SERVE!!!!  Think about it.....
