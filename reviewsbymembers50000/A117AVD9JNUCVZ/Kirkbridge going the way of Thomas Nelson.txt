 I was very disapointed with the Black Genuine Leather KJV Thomson Bible I recently obtained. My older Thomson Bible was printed on quality India Paper and had a nice stitched in binding. It was made to be worth the 90 dollar price tag charged. Now however the Kirkbride people are producing shoddy and inferior bibles and still selling them at a premium price! The new Thomson Bibles have CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP paper (Thomas Nelson/Zondervan quality) which is nothing like the supple and long lasting paper of the older bibles. The paper is so inferior that the words of the text on the OTHER SIDE OF THE PAGE show through and cause a very distracting and annoying reading experience. Also the Kirkbridge clan is not stitching the bindings in anymore - it is all glued like the cheaper Bibles you see at Wal Mart. But please do not take my word for it. Place your older Bible next to the recent printings and you will see the shameful deterioration of quality. Kirkbridge should be ashamed! It is cheating the public by still charging top dollar prices for their goods when they obviously do not any longer put quality materials in their Bibles. BUYER BEWARE !!!!
