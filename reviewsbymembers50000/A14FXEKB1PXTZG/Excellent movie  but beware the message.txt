 I found Fight Club to be an excellent movie, as the title of my review suggests. Although ultraviolent, this movie is also well crafted with spot on direction. It's also a visually stunning movie with cleverly interweaved effects. This aspect of the movie is too often ignored. I should say however that I was a little disturbed by the overall message. I happen to like Ikea furniture with its always fashionable Scandinavian design.
