 This item is brilliant in its simplicity. In today's litigious world, one really can't entertain without the Prodyne Beechwood CS/STwRCW. For years I have been nervous that one of my guests would hurt themselves with a knife while cutting a hunk of Jarlsburg or White Cheddar. The attached slicer takes away all of the worry. Thank you Prodyne! P.S. The cheese slicer can also be used for olives and hard boiled eggs.
