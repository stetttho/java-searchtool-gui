 The familiar art deco design, rich glazes, and vibrant colors of Fiestaware evoke a simpler time. A time when people actually cooked food instead of microwaving it. A time of Monte Cristo sandwiches and snickerdoodles and Sunday dinners of roast chicken, mashed potatoes, and gravy. And although you may not be able to recapture this time of yore, or even be able to reproduce the food, you can at least eat what food you do have off of this wonderful dinnerware. You can practically taste the nostalgia.
