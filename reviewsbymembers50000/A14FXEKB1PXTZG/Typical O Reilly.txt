 This book is anything but subtle which should be no suprise to fans of Bill O'Reilly. The book is essentially a 300 page, very enjoyable rant. Bill packs a punch like no one else and has no sacred cows. I found my self laughing out loud and wanting to give out "high fives." If I had to give only one citisism it would be that Bill has almost become a characature of himself and tries a little too hard. That hardly mars a very enjoyable book. I'll be buying a case of these for Christmas presents.
