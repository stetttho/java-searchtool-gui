 This books is the best high level undergraduate algebra book that I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Not only does it give so many advanced topics explained in a concise and clear manner, its section on group theory and ring theory is as best as could be hoped for. It's written carefully enough to serve as a set of notes, but covers enough ground to satisfy any intellectual's mind. I may have several algebra books at home, but if I have to look up something, I invariably pick up this one first. It's pure goodness.
