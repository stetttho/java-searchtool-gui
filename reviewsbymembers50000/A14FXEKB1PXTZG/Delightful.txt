 If you're a soapcrafter you'll love this book. The author does a very good job of selecting interesting projects with remarkably easy to follow instructions. I gave this book to my niece as a gift and she too adores it. Even being a beginner, she was able to follow the book and make wonderful soap. I highly recommend this excellent book.
