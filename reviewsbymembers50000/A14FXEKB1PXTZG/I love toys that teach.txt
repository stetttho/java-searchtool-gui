 Yes, I love toys that teach and I love this toy. Kids love music and songs and I think that that's the best way to teach. Froggie sings some catchy tunes while he teaches so the knowledge sticks. It also has a wonderful interactive feature that teaches while playing games. A nice response comes with a correct answer.  Unfortunately the durabilty of this toy is poor. Don't hit the buttons hard enough and you won't get a response. Too hard and the toy can break. There is just too narrow a range between the two points. Still, it's an inexpensive toy so I don't mind having bought a second one.
