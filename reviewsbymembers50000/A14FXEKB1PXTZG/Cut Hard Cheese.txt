 When used on semi-soft and semi-hard cheeses (such as mozzarella or cheddar), the performance of this cheese plane is comparable to similar (and much cheaper) instruments. However, where the Hoffritz truly shines is in the arena of hard cheeses. From the stubborn pecorino romano to the crumbly parmesan reggiano, this tool tames them all. Effortlessly peeling off perfectly formed curlicues of dairy goodness with its exceedingly sharp stainless steel blade, the Hoffritz cheese plane is an ideal kitchen aid for those who enjoy the sharp taste of a nice, aged, hard cheese.
