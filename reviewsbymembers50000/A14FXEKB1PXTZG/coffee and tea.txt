 This sleek thing (for lack of a better word) seems somewhat ostentatious at first, especially for my somewhat wooden feeling home.  But after a while it fits right in, not that you don't notice it though.  It sits on the table as if it were saying, hey look how great I am.  But you say, okay, you don't seem so great,  sure you look great and all, and you can do the things you do, jeez man, you are great.  And my guests love it too, some even call it sexy. One of the things that I do with the hot tray, is that I sometimes place it in my office or bedroom.  I do this because I like to drink several hot drinks at once and I do drink slowly.  I have my latte usually on the left.   Some vegetable soup is usually beside it.  A tea, and of course my necessary black coffee.  That's four great drinks on one heater.  And what a heater! You can remove the cord, which is great because I sometimes want to grab my drinks with my other hand, for those times I'm doing something awkward.  And it stays hot! For a long time, even when unplugged.  One of the downsides of this heater is the fact that it can only be placed on flat surfaces quite large, and sometimes I run out of space.  I know that a heater with adjustible feet is not an easy add-on, but it would make this great hot tray even greater.
