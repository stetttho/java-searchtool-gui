 Yeah I was fooled.  I only got 32.  And that was with my imagination as well.  I can't believe it wanted me to think.  What was confusing was that I bought the book after looking at the title and not the subtitle.  So I assumed it was 101 nights of grrreat sex.  I was fooled you see, because I didn't read the subtitle: "...for couples"  When I got home and saw this, thought it was limiting, but I didn't realise that it meant for a couple of people.  I thought of couple of anything that included me. So before you buy this book, make sure you know that it's meant for a couple of humans, not chickens, nor chicken human couples.  The book is still mildly enjoyable.  Also Tony the tiger is missing.
