 I must admit that this costume very quickly caught my eye. I was always more a fan of Dr. Evil than of the international man of mystery. This costume was however a big disappointment. It has the quality of the pair of pants I sewed back in home economics in high school. It does look like Dr. Evil's suit, but so would and costume with that specific shade of gray. The quality isn't very great either, but you can't expect much from this price. All in all, if you're a really big fan of Dr. Evil and have to look like him, then by all means buy this. It's not a HUGE investment. However, if you like him, but don't love him, then this costume is more bad than evil.
