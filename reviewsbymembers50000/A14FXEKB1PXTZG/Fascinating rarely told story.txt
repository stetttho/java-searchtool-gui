 Hochschild tells the story of the Belgian colonization of central Africa very well. I want to describe it in a way that reviewers typically describe a work of fiction but it is a true story. The book is meticulously footnoted and referenced yet reads like a novel. It tells the story of Leopold II of Belgium who ruled an area many times larger than his true country yet never set foot there. He was a master of P.R. who used the popular press to manipulate his way to tremendous wealth. Leopold's reign was brutal and devastating to an innocent population.  The stories of many other players in this era are also very well told from heros like Morel and Casement who tried to put an end to the horror to rogues like the famous explorer, Stanley. Most interesting of all of them is the story of Stanley, famous for finding Livingstone, who's true past is explored in great detail.  The wickedness of went on in present day Congo still echos today. This book give great insight to a sad, sad era.
