 Nothing says masculine sophistication like striding into a hotel bar and confidently ordering a Manhattan as you ask the leggy blonde at the end of the bar what she's drinking. Nothing except, perhaps, mixing a Manhattan yourself at the wet-bar in your swinging, shag-carpeted bachelor pad as you entertain that very same leggy blonde. Even if you don't have a wet-bar or shag carpeting or care much for leggy blondes, you'll still need a cocktail shaker to make a decent mixed drink.  This particular model is certainly more modern than the ones I'm used to handling. First of all, it's lighter which may be either a good thing or a bad thing. Personally, I perfer a little more heft in a shaker. However, if I were mixing scores of drinks per hour, I think I would appreciate the lighter weight. Second it has a built in strainer which is certainly convenient. The brushed-steel finish matches nicely with more subdued bar environments (e.g.: wood finshes, earth-tones, etc..); more dramatic environments (e.g.: polished steel, glass, etc...) might call for a shinier finish.
