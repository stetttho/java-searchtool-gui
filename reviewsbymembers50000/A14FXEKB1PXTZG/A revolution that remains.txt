 This edition of Moore's classic book is handsome.  It has a nice navy colour with the title written in bold roman font.  And when you carry it, there's a good feeling of weight.  You know this book is long enough to be important, but at the same time short enough to be read. This edition comes with a wonderful introduction from Thomas Baldwin, quite a scholar himself.   If you haven't read Moore before, read this one.  His writing is so utterly clear and eloquent that you will be wondering why can't all philosophers write like this.  When it was written, some people thought it was better than Plato. If you have read this book before, read this one.  But you will not find answers to the open-question argument.  Sadly enough, Moore passed away before he could respond to the objections to this book.   This is a beautifully bound book with the text and thought of a philosophical genius.
