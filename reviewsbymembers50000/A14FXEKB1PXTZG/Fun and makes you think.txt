 This is a truely clever toy. You're given a castle and several action figures. The castle is smart enough to know to open the draw bridge for the good knights but not to let the bad knights in. It makes a warning sound when a bad knight approaches. The bad guys can get in by carefully aiming the cannon and getting a direct hit. This toy really opens up children's imaginations. I am amazed and amused by listening to the kids play with this acting out their character's stories. Every day is a new adventure with the Magic Castle.
