 I wish that I could have given this six stars for educational value. This teaches counting, the alphabet and how to tell time. There's an electronic voice that tells you if you are right or wrong. If you're wrong it doesn't scold and helps to find the correct answer. The kids have a great time and end up learning. Ever since my nephew got this, he wants to tell me the time every five minutes. I can't believe it's the same kid that you couldn't tear away from Pokeman.
