 This is an excellent manual for new owners of goats. Everything is in here from cradle to grave. I have raised goats my entire life and I even learned a couple of things from this wonderful book. While I had some minor disagreements with some things here and there, I felt that the book was 99% accurate in its content. While I don't eat goat meat myself, I am told that the recipes are excellent.
