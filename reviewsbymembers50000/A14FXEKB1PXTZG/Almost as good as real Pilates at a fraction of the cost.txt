 I love Pilates but at $60 to $100 per hour for a trainer with the "machine" makes the price of the workout way out of my budget. Austin's workout is based on Pilates but all that you need is a yoga mat. The strength, balance and stretching exercises are as close as you can get to an actual Pilates workout on your own. Now I can get my workout and still afford my car payment.
