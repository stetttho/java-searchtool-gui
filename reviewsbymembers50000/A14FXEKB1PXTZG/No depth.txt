 Despite the divers on the cover, this work lacks depth. This is nothing more than a "concept" album with one or two catchy tunes. The CD is suprisingly short (<60 min) for a mix album and ends right when it starts to grow on you. Other than the couple of songs that I really liked (tracks 9 and 11), the rest just sort of floats along with no direction. It would be nice background for a dinner party if it were longer. I would get their other works before this one.
