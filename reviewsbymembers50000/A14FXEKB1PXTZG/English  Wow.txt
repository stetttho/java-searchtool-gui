 This dictionary is great man.  It's better than any thesaurus, it tells you the difference between words that are alike , or similar, or kinda the same, or akin, or homogenous.  You may be thinking that I used the same word over and over again, but this book says, uh unh.  These words are different, so use them differently. Pure genius.  Why didn't I think of it?  Probably because my english sucks.  But if you want to be a writer like me, man, this is the book for you.
