 This is actually a great product that will let you know if the roast is ready. It takes all of the guess work out of cooking large pieces of meat (beef, lamb, pork, turkey). You get 18 of the thermometers in a package that comes with a cool metal jar for storage. You can reuse the storage jar after you have finished all of the thermometers as a bonus.  Be careful, these are not meant to be cooked with the roast like standard reuseable themometers. These are plunged in and removed from time to time to check the heat. If you leave it in during the entire cooking process you could get very inaccurate results and possibly ruin the roast! Simply throw away the thermometer after each use. This is an excellent value. If you save just one dinner party it is worth the price of the package and then some.
