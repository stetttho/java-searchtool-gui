 She croons the album title, "Oops I did it again" with a fake sincerity.  I should say this of the whole album.   There is missing a sincerity and intelligence that was definitely audible on her first album.  Before her lyrics had force and what gave it that was its ambiguity, its unwillingness to tow the line.  The old Brittany would never have given into corporate pressure or public opinion.  So no she did not do it again. She seems to be more selfish than ever with words that refer always to herself.  That's usually okay, but she has lost some picture of who she really is.  Who is the "I" in "I did it again"?  Clearly it's not the "me" in "Baby, hit me one more time." I was disppointed with this album, though I believe in her.  I believe that she can see what she has become and learn that she has lost that wiseful innocence and become privy to something less.  Though I must admit there were a couple songs that made me cry.
