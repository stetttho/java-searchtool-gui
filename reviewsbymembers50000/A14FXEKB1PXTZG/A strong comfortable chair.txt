 Well, I guess my title describes the chair perfectly.   I go on trips to see my nephews and nieces play soccer.  I guess I'm a soccer uncle.  Sometimes my brother-in-law sits in the chair, and even he admits something about his weight, but the chair holds.  I know I shouldn't do this, but I once jumped on the chair to test its durability -- and it held. It was quite amazing, I stood on it as if I were king of the world.  My sister was a little worried, but her children loved it. As a bonus, the chair looks great and it looks great on me.  (Or I look great sitting on it.)  Some single soccer moms commented on the chair, and its stunning beauty.  Anyways, the chair folds easily into something compact and easy to carry.  It's efficient, simple, strong, and good-looking.  What's not to like.
