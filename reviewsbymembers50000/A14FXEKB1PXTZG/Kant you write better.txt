 "Immanual Kant was a real pissant who was very rarely stable." In what?  did he drink? This book, the first critique, is genius; there's no disputing that.  But how valuable is this particular edition or translation. This is perhaps the only case where, I think, Hackett didn't hack it.   There are an abundance of footnotes, there are references to Kemp Smith, there are references to the Meiklejohn, there are just damn too many references. This edition may serve the Kant scholar well, but not the student.  The words used to replace the "confusing ones" used by Kemp Smith are no less confusing.   But Kant is Kant, and he will remain stable even after a long night of translating alcohol.
