 I guess I was a little hesitant on reviewing about vacuum bags, but these are pretty good.   Though I know it may not be necessary for those without a Hoover Upright vacuum cleaner, and that they must be bought for a Hoover user, these are still good bags.   If you are thinking of buying a vacuum cleaner, you should consider not only the power and quality of its cleaning power, but how easy it is to clean it's container or change its bags.  And Hoover makes changing bags easy, plus the bags are quite strong.  Did you ever see those garbage bag commercials where they test bags by rolling them down a hill?  Well, these bags are stronger. A great dirt bag shouldn't be a reason to buy the Hoover Vacuum, which is a great vacuum by the way, but it should be one of the considerations you make.
