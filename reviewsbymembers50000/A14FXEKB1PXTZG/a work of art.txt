 This work by Neal Pollack has what Beaudelaire would call the "double simultaneous postulation"; every word has two meanings, every sentence can be seen differently they are forces that act on you with joy and sadness.  You are left confused but with a feeling of satisfaction that reminds you of a good steak.   Mr. Pollack does not write for a specific human group or way of life.  He does not even try to appeal to the intellectuals as opposed to the bores.  He works on all levels, the brain and the gut and everything in betweeen.  And it stings like hell.   But you love it, and you want more.   He has gotten at the root of American Literature with more vigor than Twain and more eloquence that James.  He has understood the American question of culture and answered it.  We are now at the beginning of a new generation of literature and intellect that will change American society forever.     Some will think Pollack a rebel, others will cite him as nothing more than today's fancy, some will accuse him of corrupting the minds of the youth.  And to that all, I say Pollack is Pollack, he will last forever in English literature through his brilliant fictional narratives, his ingenious twists of prose, and more than anything else his penetrating insight.  His anthology is the most impressive since Nicolas Bourbaki's and I would argue even more important.
