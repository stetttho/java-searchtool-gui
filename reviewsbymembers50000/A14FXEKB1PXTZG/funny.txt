 This is a funny book.  Whenever I used to think of Yiddish humor, I thought of Jackie Mason, Groucho Marx, Woody Allen. Now I learn that theirs was just Jewish humor.  The Jews really get their humor from the Yiddish.  Now whenever I think of Yiddish humor, I think of this book and I fall off my chair laughing.  Buy this book!
