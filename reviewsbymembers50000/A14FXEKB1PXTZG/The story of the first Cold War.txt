 Good stuff for the history buff. This is the story of a century of great adventurers from Victorian England and Tsarist Russia as they struggled for control of Central Asia. The back and forth between the two great Ninteenth Century powers is gripping as they use force and guile over what is now Iran, Iraq, Afganistan and the various other "-stans" that were former Soviet states. The history is told through the varios exploits of Russian and British men who travel through lands unknown and risk their lives for adventure and Mother Country.   While most all of the stories are fascinating, it is hard to keep track of the years when the stories take place. The book is more like a series of great stories rather than a flowing narrative. It is also very Anglo-centric and would have been better to have been more balanced. This book is recommended for those particulary interested in this era but not to anyone else.
