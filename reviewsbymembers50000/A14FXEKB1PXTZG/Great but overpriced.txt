 (This much) for a corkscrew? They've got to be crazy, right? Actually, this thing works very, very well and is super cool looking. If you've got money to burn, it's probably worth it. If not, there are plenty of cheaper fancy corkscrews on the market. As a rule of thumb, never spend more on a corkscrew than what you spend on an your average bottle of wine.
