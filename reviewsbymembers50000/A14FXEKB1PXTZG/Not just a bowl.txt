 I feel guilty giving only four stars for it has served me so well.  In fact, the whole Mikasa Firenze collection has served me and my numerous and beautiful guests so fabulously well. The reason I don't give five stars is for personal reasons which I don't want to go into right now.  But this bowl always reminds me of Italy, the painted blue flowers and dark yellow lines invoke a sense of wonder and sadness about a place I've been to many years before.  It reminds me of those dance halls, the swaying dresses of young women, the harmony of those musicians on stage, the gaiety, the fun.  Oh, the fun! But the bowl's sturdy and microwavable porcelain sometimes take something away from those fragile moments, something almost ineffable, something I wish was more ineffable.  It does, if you're wondering, hold a lot of salad.
