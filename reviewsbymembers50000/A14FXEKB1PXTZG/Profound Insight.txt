 The title of Harvey's book refers to something insidious in our so-called civilized societies. Harvey's focus is on human relationships.  She is not concerned with long lasting relationships between partners or family members, but the relationships that exist between all of us as members of a moral community.  She deconstructs with incredible insight the ways the privileged oppress the unprivileged.   My short explanation of Harvey's work does no justice to it.  It seems simple and perhaps common.  But I assure the work is neither of those things.  This book, I think, is one of the best books in ethics to come in recent times.  There are parts where she struggles with arguments, but I think Harvey's points are essentially right. "Civilized Oppression" is a must for all people who like to think themselves as moral. I think everyone should read it.
