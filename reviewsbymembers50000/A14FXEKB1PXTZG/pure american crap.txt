 This is Steven Spielberg at his most childish.  He doesn't know anything about what it was like to be an American in WWII.   It was loud and stupid.  I'm an American and proud that we fought in that war, but also greatly saddened by the loss of american lives in the war.  But I'm not proud that Spielberg is an American.  An American flag at the beginning and an American flag at the end is the dumbest form of patriotism I have ever seen.
