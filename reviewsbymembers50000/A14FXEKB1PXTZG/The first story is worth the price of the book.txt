 ... but the rest of the stories disappoint. The first story, Santaland Diaries, is a classic. I have rarely, if ever, laughed so hard at a short story. It is a true, though possibly embellished, story of the author and his experiences as a professional elf in a mall during the holiday season. As I said, this story alone is worth the cost of the book. Sadly, the rest of the stories don't even come close to measuring up. They are all cynical holiday season fare but very uninspired. My high hopes after reading Santaland Diaries were dashed.
