 It should be said that these are great fun for the kids but they are not true night vision goggles. These are more like light up scuba masks that work kind of like a miner's hat (hard hat with a flash light on top.) It is NOT an infrared sight. That doesn't matter to the kids though who love the things. My nephews like to play "explorer" with these in dark hallways and in the attic. Not only are they fun but they look cool to boot. This toy is highly recommeded.
