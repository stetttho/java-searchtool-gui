 I used to love Clancy but the man has become seriously addled and now only puts out formulaic trash. This book had a huge flaw than unbelievably got past all of the editors. Without giving too much away, the bad guys decide to release a deadly biological agent during the Summer Olympics in Sydney by releasing it in a special cooling system designed for the very hot weather in September. How could that moron not know that September is WINTER in Austrailia? It's COLD then. Super-brains that want to take over the world usually don't miss details like that. To slog through hundreds of pages to come to that glaring error was irritating to say the least. Clancy should retire before he embarrases himself any further.
