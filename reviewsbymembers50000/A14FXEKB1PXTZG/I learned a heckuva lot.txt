 This book is great.  It reads easy and it tells you what you're doing wrong if you don't seem to play well enough.    But don't expect this book to work magic, it takes time and effort.  You have to practise so much before you realise how valuable Pim's stuff is.  It's funny because I play for high school basketball and I've been using this book and I see myself progress faster than my friends who didn't use the book.   It ain't because I'm taller either.  Pim has these good training exercises for beginners or pros or people in between like me.  If you want to be good at basketball, this book is for you.
