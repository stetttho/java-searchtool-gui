 There's no word to describe this book other than fantabulous. It is the one book every coin prestidigitator must have. It has everything you could ever possibly want to know about coing manipulation from simple passes and vanishes to spectacular routines and seemingly impossible flourishes. It starts from the very beginning so anybody can learn from this book, and finishes where few masters of the art tread. Completely comprehensive, if you so much as master the first couple chapters of the book, you can amaze almost anybody and if you master a couple more, you can amaze the rest. Eveything is clearly explained with many detailed diagrams. It has been the bible for coin magic ever since it came out and I doubt it will be replaced anytime soon. This is a classic that you cannot do without.
