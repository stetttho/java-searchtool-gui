 This book has everything that you need to know about inet security. Doraswamy and Harkins start at the beginning and explain things for the true novice in a way that can easily be understood evne for those without a technical background. The rest of the book is extremely thorough and even an expert should learn quite a bit. I can't think of a thing that has been left out. I have been in the field for over seven years and I learned a thing or two. As the security manager of a medium sized firm, I give a copy of this book to all of my new employees.
