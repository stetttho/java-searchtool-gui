 I was never a fan of Bobcat's stand up comedy. In fact, he used to irritate the heck out of me. I had to be tricked into watching this video by a friend and I am glad that he did. The concept of this movie is brilliant. An alternative world full of different types of clowns who live a twisted life. I was laughing out loud from beginning to end. The film is full of some great cameos as well.  If you like twisted, dark humor see this film as soon as possible. I am not kidding. Forego all else and see this film.
