 It is unbelievable that this abomination is once again available. It is my sincerest hope that everyone involved with this project die a horrible, painful death. I saw the movie as a teenager over 20 years ago and it still ranks as one of my life's worst experiences. This detestible piece of garbage should never been allowed to happen let alone be allowed to rise again from the muck. This marked the lowest point of the 1970's which is saying a great deal. Stay away.
