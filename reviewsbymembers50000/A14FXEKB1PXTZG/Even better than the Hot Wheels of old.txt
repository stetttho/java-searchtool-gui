 I remember Hot Wheels from when I was a kid. The orange track with the purple connectors. Technology has come a long way since then. This has molded tracks with grooves for the cars. It's way more durable and better looking. This particular set has jumps and bank turns which are great. Of course, like before, the set is expandable but it's not compatible with the old style Hot Wheels stuff. A great toy has gotten even better.
