 Sure this book is a little out of date. And sure nobody knows what a progressive school is anymore. But this is a fine book. It gives a very insightful view of the problems and strengths of the American education and even though this book is over 50 yrs old, it still makes sense today. The author's style is magnificent, he is truly a craftsman who can interweave wit, humor and seriousness as smoothly as chocolate fudge oozes down a woman's naked body. I like it.
