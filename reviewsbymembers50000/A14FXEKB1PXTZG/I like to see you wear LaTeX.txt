 LaTeX.  It's pronounced LAY-TEK.  Leslie Lamport made LaTeX.  LaTeX is a macro package based on Donald Knuth's TeX.  TeX is pronounced TEK.  Donald Knuth is of no relation to Donald Duck. What more can be said.  This book is the reference book for LaTeX users.  Sure it's old, and there have been many packages added on to LaTeX since this book has been written.  But most other references can be got for free, since there is a high correlation between LaTeX users and Linux people.  So to sum up, this is the only LaTeX book you'll ever need to buy. (You can all the other ones for free.)  This book good.
