 One of the most eagerly awaited video games of 2000, Spider-Man by Activision didn't find its way into my home until December. I wondered if, by then, all the built-up anticipation would inevitably lead to disappointment. The answer: certainly not. The overall look and feel of the game remains remarkably true to the comic strip (I particularly enjoyed the characterization of Spawn). It's interesting that so many other video game adaptations of comic strips (or movies or whatever) fail in this aspect, producing games which have only a superficial connection to its underlying motif. The game's adherence to the comic strip's themes and conventions is by far its strongest aspect.  As for the gameplay, the most entertaining features are (as you've no doubt heard) the web-slinging from building to building in the exterior scees and the ability to climb on the walls and ceiling during the interior scenes. The various levels provide different types of challenges ranging from run-and-gun, chase, and find-the-keys/press-the-levers scenarios. Still, there are a few flaw which prevent this game from acheiving true greatness. First, there is little replay value in the game. The gamespace is deceivingly vast (especially the exteriors) since most of it is populated with empty, anonymous rooftops. Second, the difficulty level could be raised a notch. At the highest difficulty setting, it still took only a few hours to beat the game. And finally, the game controls could use a little fine-tuning. Trying to turn Spidey just a few degrees left or right shouldn't be as tricky as it is. All in all, I would definitely recommend this game to any Spiderman enthusiast. By the way, I never did figure out what Spidey was anchoring his web on when he's swinging from building to building. Clouds? An invisible dome? Unusually steady and co-operative seagulls? It's a minor point, but it's always bothered me.
