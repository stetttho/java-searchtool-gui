 One of the main problems of writing a textbook on graph theory is the relative immaturity of the field. Unlike, say, algebra or analysis, it is difficult to establish exactly which concepts and topics are considered part of the "canon" and where they rank in importance. Sure, matchings should be covered but is that more or less important than colouring? Should edge colourings be even considered? And so forth. There is no universally agreed upon introductory graph theory syllabus. Given this complication, I find it hard to fault this book for its seemingly slap-dash selection (and treatment) of topics. Personally, I would have preferred less on planarity and k-factors and more on coloring and random graphs. Also, I don't think that spectral graph theory and Ramsey theory belong in an introductory text. After all, why bring up these topics if you can't explore them to any intelligent degree? But again, I realize that these complaints may be petty and reflect only my personal tastes. However, what truly sinks this book are its errors. Sprinkled liberally throughout the text like chocolate chips in a Chips Ahoy cookie, these mistakes (typos?) are at times flagrant, at times subtle. In any case, it is these errors which make this book unsuitable for beginners which, judging by the subject matter, are the target audience. Unless you are already familiar with the theorems and their proofs, it is very easy to become terribly confused.
