 Everyone that I knew who bought one of these things loved it. Not only did they love it, they couldn't stop talking about it. Finally I relented and bought one. All that I can say is that they were correct. This is one awesome machine. It's very easy to use and flavor isn't sacrificed. This one is perfect for a couple or a single. There is a larger size available if you're cooking for more people.
