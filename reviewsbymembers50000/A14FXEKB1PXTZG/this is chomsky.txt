 It would not be in the spirit of the book or Chomsky's views if I called him the greatest living American intellectual.  He would ask what that means, and perhaps deny that he is. If one disregards for a moment his thoughtful political activism and his watershed work in lingustics, Chomsky is still one of the most insightful thinkers I have ever come across.  In this book, he turns his attention to the way we learn.  He concerns himself with the whole learning process, the education system, its flaws.  He exposes them with wit and eloquence.  Chomsky, as ever, writes without condescension and without pretension. Even if you disagree with his thoughts, you cannot deny his sheer intellect, his astounding command facts, and his unwavering determination to be clear.  As always I'm amazed at his abilities as a scholar and his ability to dissect major probles in our country.  This book, as any book, by Chomsky is definitely important. (A note: This book is published by Rowman & Littlefield; they have accomplished to be a respected publisher of alternative views in academia.  Almost anything they publish is important.)
