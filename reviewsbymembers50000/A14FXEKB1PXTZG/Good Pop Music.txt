 With Radiohead's new album, we are confronted with music that sounds visual.  It reminds me of Kubricks' 2001.   This isn't pop.  But it's supposed to be.  It feels strangely comfortable, and it leaves an aftertaste of too many cigarettes, too much coffee, and not enough alcohol.  It is contemplative, slow, and despite what one might ordinarily describe it, I think it melodic.   There are no liner notes.  Thom Yorke's voice is smoother than ever, but it's also indecipherable.  There are no liner notes because there are no choruses, and maybe no lyrics.  The words seem to accompany the social comments made by the music, they say nothing by themselves. And as with most reviews concerning this album, you will inevitably see this line: "optimistic" is anything but.   The album is anything but.  It is a movement of rock entering outer space with all the impetus of a brooding adventurer.  I cannot guarantee that you will like this album, I cannot guarantee that I will like it tomorrow.  I can only guarantee that it will not be forgotten.
