 This forty-seven dollar paperback is an adequate introduction into poetry writing.  In fact, it's quite compreensive in its approach. But it won't make you a good poet.  You need other things, like a dictionary, a dictionary of synonyms, a brain, and a heart.  Now to get all of these things after paying $47 for a paperback is tough.  A good dictionary is tough to find these days.  So is a good brain, and even harder to find after you got the brain is the heart.  Who has all five things? I'm holding the book in my hand and it seems small.  It's helped my poetry skills (but, of course, I'm only writing for myself)  but, I don't think it was worth the whole $47.  Maybe $20.  But it's worth having.
