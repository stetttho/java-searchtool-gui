 This doll is certainly a good likeness of Rosie O'Donnell. However, when I showed it to some co-workers, half of them identified it with a certain infamous intern. There's just something uncannily similar about the shape of the head and the hairstyle. Perhaps the designers were fortunate to have chosen a red pantsuit instead of a blue dress.
