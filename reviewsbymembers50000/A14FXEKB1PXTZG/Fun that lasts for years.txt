 What's great is that this will last for a long time. The hoop can be set from anywhere beteen two and five feet tall so kids as old as 10 and as young as two can enjoy it. The ball is soft enough to play with inside (in the family room, of course) but durable enough for the outdoors. The whole thing is fairly light weight and has wheels so it is easy to move around. It's simply a great way to get your son or daughter started in sports. A slight downside is that it is a bit difficult to put together but not so hard that you will need help from an engineer.
