 Calphalon cookware is the best for the home chef. With proper care, the nonstick surface will last for many, many years but that is true of most nonstick cookware. What makes Calphalon special is that is a very efficient cooking surface. In other words, it takes much less heat from the burner to cook on Calphalon. Many chefs learn this the hard way by cooking a recipe that they know well for the first time on their new Calphalon and burning the meal. The one downside to these pans is that the handles are metal and will get very hot. You should always use oven mitts or, better yet, get the cozies that they sell to use on the handles.
