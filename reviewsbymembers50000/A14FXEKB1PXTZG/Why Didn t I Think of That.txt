 After wrestling one too many greasy fowl out of the oven with makeshift tongs and prongs, I finally decided to get this tool. At first, I was hesitant to make this purchase since I didn't see how such a simple instrument could wrangle a roast holiday bird. But wrangle it did! The simple hook design provides ample leverage for even a 20-pound butterball and the rubber grip ensures a steady grasp. Never again shall I be scalded by boiling goose fat.
