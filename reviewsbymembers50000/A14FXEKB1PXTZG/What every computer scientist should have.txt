 If one were to make a list of the 100 best books in computer science, then winnow that list down to 10 books, and then again down to 1 book, surely this would be that book. Known in computer science circles as CLR (for the authors) or simply, "The White Book", Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest is the de-facto standard text for algorithms and data structures. It covers all the basic subjects (big-O notation, trees, graphs, etc...) as well as a few intermediate subjects (amortized analysis, matroids, etc...). Of course, this book is not the be-all and end-all of computer science nor does it pretend to be. It touches on NP-completeness only lightly and all but omits randomization; but if you wanted a text on NP-completeness, you would be reading Garey & Johnson and if you wanted randomization you'd go to Motwani & Raghavan. But if you need a reference on data structures and algorithms, this is the book for you. Now, some have complained that while this book is an excellent reference that it is a poor text to learn from. I beg to differ. I concede that it is certainly more demanding than many other introductory texts, but this is a boon not a curse. By remaining true to computer science's mathematical heritage, Cormen et al. force the reader to become accustomed to rigourous, formal reasoning, something which is unfortunately absent in many computer science curricula. The authors present the concepts cleanly and clearly, without the distraction of any specific programming language/paradigm. Perhaps it is this removal from a familiar C/C++/Java/flavour-of-the-month/etc... milieu which makes some readers nervous. But it is precisely this separation which forces the reader up into the realm of abstraction where computer science truly resides.
