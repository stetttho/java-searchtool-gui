 Remember the 90's? Remember The Simpsons, rap music, and the Internet? I know I do. And if you remember rap from the 90's, you undoubtedly remember these two artists: Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer. Once on top of the world (and Billboard charts), Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer are now fodder for countless "Where are they now?" shows. Furthermore, they are endlessly mocked for their lightweight entries into the rap genre. However easy it may be to mock them, it is even easier to forget their true contributions: namely, bringing rap music into the mainstream. No matter how much is made of, say, Public Enemy's surprising cross-over appeal, one must concede that mainstream popular music still considered rap as an alien entity. That is, until Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer brought their own brand of watered-down, whitewashed pablum to the stage. So, sit back and enjoy the greatest hits of these two ex pop sensations, whether for their historical significance, kitsch value, or just plain fun.
