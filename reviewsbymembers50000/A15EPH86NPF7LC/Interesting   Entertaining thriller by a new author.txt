 I have never written a review before but I met the author at a book signing at my local Borders Book store.  He asked me to write a review when I finished reading the book, so here I am.  This is the story of a young couple who get into trouble while on an adveture tour of the Yucatan.  The main character is Jack Phillips who is just a normal everyday guy who gets caught up in a bad situation.  I don't want to spoil the plot but there are plenty of twists, action, violence, mystery, and a little sex.  The background of the Mayan ruin sites and culture makes for an excellent backdrop for the story. While this is no literary classic I enjoyed it more then 90% of what I read in this genre.  As has already been mentioned it is a great beach read.  If I had one complaint it would be that the author could have spent more time on character development.  [...]Overall this is an exciting and interesting thriller.  [...]I also liked the way the author developed realistic action - there are no scenes of the hero jumping out of a Jet at 20,000 feet and landing unharmed without a parachute. whta happens makes sense and seems possible.  Anyway, I recommend you read through the reviews before purchasing this book, especially if you are a literary snob type of person (I dont mean this in a bad way, but you know who you are!).  But if you like good action adventure and thrills definitly check out this book.
