 [...]I don't wish to give away the ending but in the last ten pages or so the author neatly punctures all the tales of derring do and tiger-management that have gone before with an alternative take on Pi's life at sea. [...]Young Pi is forced to abandon his vegetarian, egalitarian, humanitarian gentility and draw upon the darkest aspects of his nature including murder and cannibalism [...]to realise the one true religion of self-preservation. After the enjoyably preposterous tales of life at sea with a bengal tiger named Richard, the book was saved for me and made memorable by the revelations of Pi's alternative story.
