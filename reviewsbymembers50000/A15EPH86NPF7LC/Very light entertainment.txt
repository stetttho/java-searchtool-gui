 I was expecting this movie to be laugh out load entertainment, but alas it was more giggles and a few smiles.  I am begining to realize Owen Wilson has little talent beyond portraying the king of slackers!  He is cute and likable, but I am starting to feel there is nothing there?  Overall it is entertaining but I am glad I waited until it came out on DVD and did not pay $10 to see it at a theater!
