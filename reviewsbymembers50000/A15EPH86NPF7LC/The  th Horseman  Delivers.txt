 I was so excited to get an advance copy of "The Fifth Horseman!"  I have been a fan of the Woman's Murder club series since the first book.  This time out Lieutenant Lindsay Boxer is helped by the newest member of the Club, Yuki Castellano, to look into a series of strange deaths occurring at a local hospital.  Patients dying just prior to release from the hospital.  The Mysterious deaths have been looked into by Specialists form around the nation, but no answers come forth.  Are these strange deaths just a terrible coincidence? Or is there some maniac playing death angel?	The investigation is hamstrung by the hospital administration which fears the truth may ruin its reputation.  Of the 5 books in the series I thought this was the most suspenseful.  Paetro/Patterson prose is clean and direct, he does not waste time on unnecessary descriptions but sticks to the heart of the story (I actually should be giving credit to Maxine Paetro as I have a feeling she wrote most of this book).
