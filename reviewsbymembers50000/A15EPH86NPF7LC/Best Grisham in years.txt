 Through a friend in the industry I was able to get a copy of "The Broker" and I think it is Grisham's best thriller since the Firm! And is also a departure from his legal thrillers - this is more an international thriller- think  Robert Ludlum. The basic premis is, During his waining hours in office a lame duck President of the United States pardons Joel Backman from Federal Prison. The Pardon creats a firestorm of controversy as Backman is a notoriuos political power broker who has spent the last half dozen years in prison for his crimes. What is not known is that the president's hand was forced by the CIA as Backman apparently has secretes that compromise the US satalite surveillance system. The CIA has come up with a plan to get a handle the situation. Once Backman is released with a new name and Identity and home, the CIA will release information about him and his wherabouts to the Russians, Isralis, Suadis, and Chinese. The question now is, not when, but who will kill Mr. Backman? The story takes off from here with plenty of twists and turns, but I wont spoil the story! The author does a great job of mixing action with the suspense and some decent character development - just don't expect too much! I also enjoyed the international tone of the book.
