 I am a long time Crichton fan having read every one of his books, but this is not one of his better efforts.  lets just say it is better then "Sphere" but no where near the greatness of "The Great train Robbery"   [...]Mr. Crichton's dresing down of the fear mongers in the envioronmental movment is the most enjoyable part of the book.  [...]My problem with the book is the premis of eco-terrorist being able to control the weather, to me it is just as farfeched as BEING ABLE TO PREDICT GLOBAL WARMING!  This being said the book is still an entertaining read and if you are a Crichton fan you will want to read it, just don't expect his best.
