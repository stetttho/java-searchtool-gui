 I have read all the Scarpetta adventures and loved them all, but I am disappointed in Trace - it does not measure up to the others. [...]The characters and the plot are just not snappy enough.  They fall flat.  I am not as hard as some reviewers, I will give the book 3 stars as there was some entertainment value, it just does not measure up to the other books in the series.  [...]
