 As someone who grew up on a ranch and lived a few years in Idaho, I know something about the west, and this book did not come off with much authenticity.  I love a good western, but it must be good and real, Like "Lonesome Dove". This book was like a cheap TV version of the west written by some guy from New York City (NEW YORK CITY!!!!!).  If your looking for the real thing try "Across the High Lonesome." Just finished reading an advance copy and its the real deal.  Much Like "Lonesome Dove" it transcends the gnere.
