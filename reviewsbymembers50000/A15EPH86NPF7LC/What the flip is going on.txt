 I have read all the Scarpetta adventures and up until "Trace" loved them all, sadely "Predator" follows in the footsteps of "Trace." To me it feels like someone else is writing the book? The characters and the plot are flat. [...]I have to give the book 3 stars as it is still more entertaining then most the junk I read, but it does not measure up to the other Scarpetta books.
