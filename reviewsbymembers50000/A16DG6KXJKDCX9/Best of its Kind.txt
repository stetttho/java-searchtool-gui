 You have an attention deficit. An overly academic, wordy textbook is not your friend. This book is exactly what you need. The layout and the informality of the writing allow even the most scatterbrained reader to stay focused and get the maximum amount of information without struggling to grasp it. It's incredibly helpful for the AD/HD adult, their friends and families and anyone else who just wants to know exactly what is known about this horribly frustrating, yet occasionally wonderful condition.
