 No need to belabor points that have already been very well made, but I'll share this with you:  I first heard this album on the overhead system at work one day.  The first song that really made me take notice was "My Doorbell."  I wasn't aware that it was White Stripes playing and thought that it might be the new Robert Plant disc.  I was so happy.  What a great return to that classic bluesy Zep sound, I thought.  I was later thrilled to discover that it was actually the fantastic new White Stripes release.  And then I heard the new Plant CD.  Yuck.  Dear Jack and Meg, please help Robert Plant remember what he does well, but in the meantime, go on doing it for him.  Also, I love "Little Ghost."  Between it and "Blue Orchid," I end up doing a lot of car-dancing whenever this CD is on.
