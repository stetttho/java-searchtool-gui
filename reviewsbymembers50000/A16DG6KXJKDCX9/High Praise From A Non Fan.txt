 One of my coworkers asked if I minded if she put Gutterflower on the other day.  I have to admit that I've never cared much for Goo Goo Dolls; I've always found them generic and bland.  So my reaction was kinda like, "Um, sure, whatever," as I asked God why he had forsaken me.  Ten seconds into the CD I was hooked on it.  This is such a huge leap for these guys artistically!  It's obvious to me that all the guys spent the last couple of years growing outside their comfy, little plateau they had reached.  To me, the hardest thing a band or artist can do is change a successful formula and come up with an even better sound.  Rzeznik and the boys have done it.  It's growth like this that will keep them from ending up an obscure Trivial Pursuit answer five years from now like Hootie & The Blowfish.  I'll definitely be buying Gutterflower.
