 Okay, so I admit that it took me awhile to buy this one.  I was intrigued by the "Human" single after hearing it as the theme to the much-too-short-lived ABC show "Cupid", but not enough to rush out  and buy it.  It was months later when I saw it on sale that I bought it on  a whim.  Having now heard every album the Pretenders have recorded, this  stands alongside LEARNING TO CRAWL as Chrissie and the gang's finest  efforts.  I really could just gush about this CD for hours, but here's what  you really need to know: This CD is solid from beginning to end.  No  filler, no lame ducks.  If I could buy each of you a copy of this disc, I  would, but I can't.  That would cost a lot of money.  Besides, I don't even  know you.  Buy your own copy, ya moocher!  You can thank me later.
