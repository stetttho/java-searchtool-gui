 Sheryl's not my favorite artist in the whole world, but I respect her for always raising the stakes with each album.  She's not like a lot of artists where every album sounds just like the 5 before it.  So when Sheryl finally made an album where she just kinda coasted along and relaxed on her current plateau, I was disappointed, but she's due.  C'mon, C'mon is like a soundtrack for sitting on a porch in the country with a pitcher of lemonade and an old hound dog. That said, I have never felt as neutral about an album as I do this one.  This is my new barometer for measuring other albums.  There was a song I really liked ("Soak Up The Sun") and one I didn't like at all ("It's So Easy" with Don Henley).  Aside from that, I had no feeling one way or the other about these songs.  It seemed as though very little effort was put into it.  I'm sure that it will spawn 3 singles which will play all over every "The New Lite Mix FM" station for the next few years.  Thankfully, I won't be listening.
