 Others have already given you the vital facts, so mostly I'm only echoing.  This is the tightest, yet most-relaxed, sounding album the Chilis have ever done.  In fact, contradictions like that one abound here.  By The Way is experimental, going off in all sorts of intriguing directions (Latin guitar, Beach Boys-ish harmonies, Missing Persons-ish synths, Mexi-Cali barrio beats), but it all sounds natural, not forced.  Most of the album doesn't sound much like the Chilis punk roots, but then the punk spirit isn't about sounding like some guys sounded 35 years ago, it's about doing what no one expects and doing it balls out, so in many ways, this is their most punk album. The title, By The Way, sounds casual like an afterthought, yet even the most laid-back tracks on this album have an urgency that belies their seeming laziness.  On the surface, the lyrics seem to be more meaningless than ever, but those words stick in your head and you find meaning in the nonsense when your humming it to yourself later.  It doesn't matter when you discovered these guys, whether you go way back to the mid-80s like I do, or if 1999's Californication was your introduction, or if you've never owned a Chilis album.  This album is already going on my list of 25 CDs that I would rescue if my house was on fire.
