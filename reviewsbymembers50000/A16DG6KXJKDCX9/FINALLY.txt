 There are probably millions of books in print dealing with the subject of children.  Only one of them deals with the horror of Other People's Children.  Adrianne Frost tells it like it is.  This book was everything I expected it to be with a whole lot of stuff I didn't expect such as a history of OPC-hating.  Brilliant!  I can't wait to see what she does next.  Buy a copy for yourself and buy a copy to leave somewhere strategic like the doctor's lobby or Starbucks.
