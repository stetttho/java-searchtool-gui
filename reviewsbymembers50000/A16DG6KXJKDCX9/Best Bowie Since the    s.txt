 I'm a Bowie fan from way back.  I was 13 when I saw the video for "Fashion".  I rushed out and bought ChangesTwo which led me to buy Changes and then I rabidly collected all the individual albums.  My interest began to fade as the 80s ended.  Bowie seemed to be going in a direction that simply didn't appeal to me.  Every now and then, I would pick up a new Bowie CD, listen to it a few times with optimism, but eventually sell it off.  Eventually, I just stopped setting myself up for disappointment.  I can honestly say that the only thing that Bowie did in the 90s that I still like to listen to is "Real Cool World" from the "Cool World" soundtrack.  Okay.  So having said all that, I bought "Heathen" today.  Wow.  It's the most relaxed, non-high-concept, rock project I've ever heard from David.  Instead of having to listen again and again to try to like the songs, they immediately felt warm and comfortable.  I've only listened to the entire CD twice, but I know that I'll still be listening to this one years from now.    I promise to write a more detailed review in a couple of days, but in the meantime, do yourself a favor and buy it!
