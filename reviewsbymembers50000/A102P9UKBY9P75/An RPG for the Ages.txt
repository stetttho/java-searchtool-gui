 This is the Final Fantasy game that took the series from it's fantastic roots on the Super Nintendo into the heights of RPG legend. This game set the standard for RPGs in 1997, a standard which it has maintained since then. The combination of adult themes, superb deep characters, a riveting storyline, and <at that time> simply unparalleled graphics made it the highest grossing RPG for the 1990s.  The story revolves around a host of memorable characters: the mercenary Cloud, his old girlfriend Tifa, a mysterious lady by the name of Aeris, and the malevolent Sephiroth (arguably the most celebrated villain in video games), the corporation Shira, and over all of this: the apocolyptic Meteor rushing towards the planet bent on destruction.  I have played every single Final Fantasy game that has been producted. This game has been the most memorable (with Final Fantasy X coming in 2nd) and continues to hold it's place in RPG legend. This enthusiasm has maintained itself so much so that a movie set in the future of the FFVII world is coming out in Final Fantasy: Advent Children and a spin of with Vincent is in the works.  Simply put: buy this game...whether for the PC or the Playstation. Play it and realize the greatness that it is.  One of the best console games ever created.
