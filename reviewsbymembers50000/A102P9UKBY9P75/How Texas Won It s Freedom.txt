 H.W. Brands does a really great job of combinding fantastic storytelling with historical fact in a way that is both entertaining and will provide the reader with a good grasp of how Texas became both a nation and eventually a state.  What this book does is trace the origins of both the anglo and hispanic populations of Texas beginning with folks like Moses Austin and later Stephen F. Austin, profiles the greats of Texas history such as Sam Houston, William Travis, and Davy Crockett as well as those on the other side of the conflict: Santa Anna and Martin de Cos.  The main argument of this book is that the revolutionary war in Texas was a disorganized shamble that blundered it's way to freedom. Such disasters as the Alamo and Gonzales could have been avoided or were not really necessary in retrospect, but what they provided were key events that a lot of settlers could draw motivation from. The eventual victory at San Jacinto is told from a different standpoint that you won't find in traditional Texas history books.   What Brands is trying to do is both dispel the myths of the Texas revolution while trying to shed a little light on what actually happened. He does so in a very good way while still giving credit where credit was due. All in all, I highly recommend this book. It's a good general overview and is told in such a way as to keep you turning the pages.
