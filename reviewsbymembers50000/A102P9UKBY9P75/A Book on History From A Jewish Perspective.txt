 The first comment I would like to make on this book is that if you are looking for a book which approaches the figure of Jesus Christ from a Christian Apologist perspective, this book is not for you.   Geza Vermes' approach to Jesus Christ is made very plain in the introduction: he is attempting to find the "historical" Jesus through interpretation of the New Testament, the works of contemporary writers of the time period such as Flavius Julius, and through an analysis of the culture and historical events of the time period and how that shaped the Jewish culture of the time.  He does this through an examination of Jesus in a very nontraditional manner: his focus begins with the Jesus of John and works toward the gospel of Matthew. Liturgical scholars and even the casual reader of the Bible can see a different focus given by each of the different writers of the Gospels, this difference is explained in depth by Dr. Vermes. He thoroughly explains Jewish religious traditions of the time period and ties these in to specific dialogue in scripture in order for a reader of the Bible to attempt to see this religious document through the eyes of a Jew or Greek reader of the time period.   Again, this is not a Christian apologetic work and it does not profess to be. Geza Vermes attempts, through this book, to explain Jesus Christ through the culture and events of the people he was spreading the Good News too: the Jews of Judea and Palastine.
