 This 112 card expansion to the Munchkins game add an additional race and class to the game, as well as more loot and even more monsters and curses.  The Gnome is a powerful race which can stand on it's own and the Bard class is provided a variety of cards which increase it's power over time.  The new cards build on the core in a very good way and really flesh out the original Munchkins game. Additionally, these cards easily fit in the original box.  I highly recommend this expansion both because it adds to an already great game, but because it's relatively cheap.
