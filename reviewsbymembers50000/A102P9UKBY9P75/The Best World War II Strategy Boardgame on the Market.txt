 Axis and Allies is a board game set during World War II which allows 2-5 players to assume the roles of the great powers of the global spanning conflict of 1945: Germany, the United States, Great Britain, Russia, and Japan.   The board is a replication of the world split into various zones which correspond to either direct land holdings for that power in the form of colonial governments or through intercession such as British Africa.   The game consists of many different land, air and sea-based units which have different offensive and defensive capabilities which are purchased through a monetary system controlled by how much land you have acquired.   This game generally takes atleast 2-4 hours with a lengthy set up due to the sheer amount of starting units that need to be placed ont he board prior to starting. Combat is conducted via a series of dice rolls in a unit vs. unit fashion.  The game itself plays out fantastically and really requires the player to carefully consider every move to a degree which simply isn't necessary in most board games. It adds a facet to the game which has been one of the big reasons for it's great popularity over the years.  This newer version is more balanced than the previous and is played on a slightly different map. Additionally, certain units such as the tank and plane have been modified. New units include the artillery and destroyer (both carry overs from A&A: Europe and A&A: Pacific).  All in all, a very fun thinking game which I highly recommend for a group of players who have the patience to play the game.
