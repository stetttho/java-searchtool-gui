 My wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed this game. Despite having owned it for over 2 years we still regularly play matches on what have become almost memorized courses.   This game was a follow-up for a very successful first version which was released for the Nintendo 64 about 5 years ago. You choose a member of the Mario series cast of characters, each having different strengths and weaknesses, and then play on one of the many courses which will open up for you as you continue to play the game. Not only are courses unlockable, but different playstyles, new characters, a "star" ability which allows a character to hit further, and other types of games.   Gameplay: Very solid and intuitive. The heads up display provides a wealth of information.   Graphics: The graphics are similar to the cartoony 3-d style that make up most of the Mario series of games. The courses themselves are richly detailed and provide an easy way to tell heigth and depth. Very easy on the eye.  Sound: Many of the sounds you hear from other Mario games are present. Each character has a series of taunts which you can use to unnerve an opponent. The music is low key and provides good background.  Replayability: This game has drawn me back again and again for the past 2 years. That says enough.
