 I was first introduced to Settlers of Cataan on recommendation from an avid player of Civilizations.   The object of this game is to colonize the continent of Cataan using roads and settlements. The settlements and upgraded cities give you points with the winner being the first person to 10 points.   The board is a circular hexagonal board. Each hex (for the exception of the perimeter hexes which are water and deserts) produces 1 of 5 different resources.  Settlements are placed at locations where the hex's meet and roads run along the hex edges. Each hexagon is given a number which will give the player one unit of that resource.  Settlements are built using resources which are obtained by rolling 2 dice and then consulting the board. Wherever that number lies a resource is produced if your settlement/city lies on it's hexcorner.   At it's core, this game is a practice in trading. Throughout the game the person who trades the most is able to generate enough resources to expand out by building additional raods and settlements. Seaports provide additional means of trade  The strategy of this game is determining the supply and demand factors which will most likely occur and then placing your settlements in a manner which will be most advantageous to your victory.  This is a fantastic game perfect for the family, friends and pretty much anyone who has an interest in very basic supply and demand economics. It has not only an entertaining component, but can serve as a great introduction into the foundations of economic principles.
