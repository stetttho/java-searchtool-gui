 Coming off of the great success of Axis & Allies: Europe. This Pacific campaign-focused game is a great substitute for the regular game if you do not have the requisite number of players or enough time for regular Axis & Allies. The game contains 2 new units: artillery and destroyer which are great additions to the game. Additionally, inclusion of convoys, naval and air bases create an A&A game style that is quite unique and creates a variety of different strategies that can be employed throughout the map. In this way it is quite different from both Axis & Allies and Axis & Allies Europe. Every game does not end up being the same. Overall, a great game that typically takes 2 to 3 hours and has replayability value that is just as high as A&A and A&A: Europe
