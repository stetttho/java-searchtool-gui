 Some of the negative comments here are complaining about the lack of a "how to grow" in this book. No where does this book state that it is a HOW TO GROW dreads. This is a survivors guide. Sadly, we live in a society where we are judged by our appearance. If one has dreads people assume one smokes pot. People assume one is into alternative lifestyles. This book will help you survive and overcome those bigotries. This book is a good one for anyone doing anything left of center and being judged by society for it.
