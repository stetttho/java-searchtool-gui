 The NIV bible (New International Version) is a very simple read. Clearly written, though not exactly the best translation. Excellent for ANYONE wanting to really ingest the bible. Remember, however, that Protestant versions are missing 6 "books" with some of the very best "women of the bible" removed. Bummer.  Inspite of all that, this bible is beautiful and a joy to have around. Feeling blue? Pick this up. It will warm your heart.
