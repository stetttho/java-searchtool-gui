 This book is positively gripping. I must disagree with the other Catholic reviewer listed here. Yes, both Frs. McKenna and Martin went against the Vatican's grain in speaking out about evil in our midst. But if you look at the history of our church, it's people like them who planted the seeds of changed. Padre Pio never said the Novus Ordo, and is now Saint Pio. God Bless Them! As for relics of the True Cross, Amazon.com has a number of excellent books on the subject! Check them out... As something of a square peg myself, much more comfortable with the writings of Jane Austin, I found I very much enjoyed Officer Sarchie's New York style of "speech." His writing is very much like a discussion with a friend. He takes you through his cases at high speed while still bringing you face to face with real evil. He explains the difference between demonic evil and the evil that men do. Yes, we humans can get down right nasty. Excellent book.
