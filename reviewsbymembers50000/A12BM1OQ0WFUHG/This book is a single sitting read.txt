 I sat down, one morning, with a cup of coffee and thought I'd read a chapter or two of this little paperback I picked up. Lunch came and went without my notice. This book is great! Stephen Molstad is an expert at  drawing your right in to the events unfolding! Action packed with just a  touch of romance on the side! Everybody is getting copies in their  Christmas stockings this year!
