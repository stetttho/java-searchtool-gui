 Littermaid is a great idea, but the motor is too weak and too loud. I have two Maine Coon cats. The average cat is 9 pounds. These guys are 25. Poor little Littermaid gets stuck at a large ball of urine. I have to turn it off when I'm not home or it will burn itself out going back and forth trying to push something out that it's not strong enough to push. I have to turn it off at night or it wakes us up. The rake gets dirty just as often as your hand held scooper would. Unfortunately with the rake you can't just chuck it and get a new one. You're forced to scrub.
