 I've known Fr. Bart for about two years now. One of the things I love best about him is his ability to tell stories. He has a great many of them and tells them so wonderfully. This book is filled with his stories. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll say "Hey, I've done that..." This book is full of peace and joy. I keep it on my credenza at work. When folks in my office get stressed, they come get the book and read a few stories. When they give it back, they are always smiling.
