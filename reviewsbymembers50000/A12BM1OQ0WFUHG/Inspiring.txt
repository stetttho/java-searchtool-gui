 I just had to borrow that word from another reviewer here. It best describes this bible. Douay Rheims Version, if memory serves, is the first English translation, predating the King James Version. With the archaic language this bible is best read slowly, enjoyed like a fine meal. I very much wish someone would come out with a pocket edition. I found a pocket size New Testament at Tan Books . Com - if anyone wishes for the same.
