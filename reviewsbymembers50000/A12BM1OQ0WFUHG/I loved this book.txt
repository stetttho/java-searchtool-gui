 I wouldn't normally have picked this up. I'm a Sci Fi fan. But I've read Mr. Molstad's ID4 and Godzilla books. I was not disappointed. He paints such a vivid picture for the reader! You feel like you're right there in  the thick of it. I think the only other book I've read that brought me to  tears like this one was "Outlander" another historic type novel.   I couldn't put "The Patriot" down. Read it straight through,  cover to cover.
