 I hope this doesn't end up another Davinci Code. This is a work of fiction people!!!   The early biographies of St. Francis were NOT destroyed. In fact, you can buy the Omnibus on this very website.  His body was NOT stolen. There is NO conspiracy.   If you can keep in mind that this is fiction not FACT, it's a good read. I would have rated it better if it weren't for all the people regularly led astray by such works of fiction.
