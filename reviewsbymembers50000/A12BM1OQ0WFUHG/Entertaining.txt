 I grabbed this because of the title. I love books about Angels and Demons. The back cover mentioned a guy out to save the Vatican. It sounded cool.   However, it had nothing to do with either angels or demons. It was one long anti-Catholic diatribe. It criticizes the Holy See for spinning rumors then does just that itself. As a person of faith, this reader found the writer to know nothing about faith.  The Vatican apologized to Galileo - publicly - about 10 years before Brown wrote his book. Science and religion CAN walk hand in hand. Today, scientists study the power of prayer and communicating with those who have passed on. The Vatican has had its own observatory in Arizona for decades. As far as faith protecting believers from all harm - that's about the silliest thing to say about a faith launched on a man who was crucified.   It was entertaining. I do feel very sad for folks who think this stuff is truth.
