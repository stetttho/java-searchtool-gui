 The first few chapters really grabbed me. But they lost me at the part where they began writting as if the theoretical "Q Gospel" was a reality. Several lengthy chapters dedicated to an imagined reality. And one might miss the single sentence that says "let's suppose..."   Biblical scholars know Matthew's gospel is longer because Matthew was likely the only apostle who could write. He was a tax collector and probably knew shorthand. Luke's gospel varies because he learned second hand. Mark's gospel varies further as he learned from Luke.  But what do I know?  ;)
