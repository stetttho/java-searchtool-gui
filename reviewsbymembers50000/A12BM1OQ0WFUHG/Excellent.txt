 I've been using the 4 volumne Liturgy of the Hours for years now. The endless flipping back and forth can undermine devotion. Not to mention ribbon finding can distract from contemplation. This book (and kin) with its single ribbon is SUCH A JOY! I wouldn't mention it, but with all the recent discussion about God in the classroom, I discovered the woman responsible for ousting prayer from schools was a Catholic woman who didn't want her child saying Protestant prayers. Readings are taken from the King James Version of the Bible and not the New Jerusalem Bible (used in Catholic Liturgy) and Psalm segments are those of the Protestant Book of Common Prayer, not the Breviary.  However, St. Paul tells us to pray always (1 Thess 5:17) also that we should NOT be divided (1 Corin 1:12-15) Jesus tells us to love one another as He loved us (John 13:34). And God, Himself, tells us not to fight with our brothers (2 Chron 11:4). We are all brothers in Christ. If we harbor disdain for those not of our particular denomination, our Lord knows and is displeased. What He would be very pleased with is more prayers from all of us!
