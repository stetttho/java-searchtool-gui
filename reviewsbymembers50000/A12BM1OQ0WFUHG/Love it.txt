 Frustrated with another service, I snapped up this phone just because it was free with activation through T-Mobile. It's got little lights on the side that I wasn't aware of. They went off when the phone was in silent mode on my desk. Handy! I'm always too worried "vibrate" will send it bouncing away. I also didn't know my new toy came with a camera. Instantly addicted I had to add the $2.99 for 20 images a month charge to my new service. Buyer beware. This is a fun little gizmo. As for the frustrated buyer who couldn't find the "send" button - read the instructions! The instruction book is simple to follow. Easy to understand. Helpful for making the most out of your "free" tools. Deadly when telling you about the fun tools which cost money.  It's a joy. I also love being able to put a photo in the open back window of the shell. What a wonderful idea!!
