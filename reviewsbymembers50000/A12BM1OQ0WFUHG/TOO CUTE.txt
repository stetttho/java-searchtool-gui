 While there are a few - one glaring - inaccuracies in this book, I found it utterly adorable. I will treasure it always and read it until the pages disintagrate. It is very reader friendly and obviously written with a very loving spirit. God bless the writers.  With regards to St. Christopher - they repeatedly state he was declared persona-non-grata. This is not the case. Vatican II in 1969 revised the Roman Calendar. That's all. They needed to omit a few "celebrations." In our faith, Solemnities take priority over Feasts. Feasts take priority over Memorials. The Memorial to St. Christopher entered the Roman Calendar in 1550. So the Memorial was removed from the calendar. NOT the Saint from Sainthood. St. Christopher is, was and always will be - a Saint.  Mary Magdalen was not a prostitute. Nor was she the Mary that was the sister of Martha and Lazarus. There were a number of Mary's that followed Jesus. The Eastern Church has a rich history of Mary Magdalen. All the Bible says about her was that Jesus cast 7 demons out of her and that she supported him in his ministry with her wealth.  Joan of Arc's armor wasn't white in color. White armor means unadorned.  Most importantly - Saul (later Paul) was NOT a pagan. He was a Jew. A member of the Sanhedrin  sent out to persecute the new faith. He had a major conversion.  I hope the sisters do a second book.
