 As much a history of the Antiquities Act of 1906 as the national monuments themselves, Preserving Different Pasts is overly concerned with turf battles, especially those of Frank Pinkley (1881-1940), superintendent of the southwestern national monuments.  The book does not attempt even an overview of the individual monuments, which are a grab bag of smaller NPS sites both natural and historical. The research is thorough and the writing is workmanlike if unexciting.
