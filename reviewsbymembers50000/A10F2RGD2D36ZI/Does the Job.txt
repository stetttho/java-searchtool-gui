 My employer asked me to read this book, and being a dutiful employee, I did.  Most of the advice Senske proffers is sound common sense: Do right by your customers, your employees, and your family, and doing good will result in your doing well.

Nevertheless, the Scripture he does use is handled sensibly and without guile.  I dropped the book one  star for not including an index.
