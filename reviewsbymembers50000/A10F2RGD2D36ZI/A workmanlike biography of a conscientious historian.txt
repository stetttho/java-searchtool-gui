 Leckie's biography of Angie Debo (1890-1987) is unusual in that it was to some degree inspired by a film instead of the other way around.  A fuller account of Debo's story is well worth the telling if for no other reason than that Leckie sands down the edges of some of the more extreme claims made on Debo's behalf in "Indians, Outlaws and Angie Debo," the 1988 PBS film produced by Barbara Abrash and Martha Sandlin.  (Debo herself had a hand in creating one serious inaccuracy in the film by implying that her beloved mentor, Edward Everett Dale, had prevented her best-known work, And Still the Waters Run, from being published by the University of Oklahoma Press.)    Leckie's biography is sympathetic without being uncritical, and the author notes how Debo's independent thinking may have hindered as well as advanced her career.  Debo was a life-long diary keeper, and Leckie makes good use of those many volumes in a biography that is sensibly, if not excitingly, written.  I would have preferred less about Debo's reactions to news events and foreign travels and more about Debo's religion, which is treated cursorily even though Debo both served as a Methodist lay pastor and opposed missionary activity on the reservation.
