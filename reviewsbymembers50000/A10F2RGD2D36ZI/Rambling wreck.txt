 Beck is a facile writer, and there are parts of her narrative that read well enough.  But more often her chapters are simply disjointed rambles and her comments about spirituality jejune.  I'm not a Mormon nor have ever been, but to me Beck's meanderings about visions, feelings, and emotional discoveries have a Mormon ring to them.  Further, in the Mormon tradition of redefining theological words, Beck has chosen to use the word "faith" to refer to its opposite.    Beck can't prove her central thesis: that her father, the LDS apologist Hugh Nibley, sexually abused her as a small child.  The chapters that treat their confrontation do nothing to strengthen her accusation and, besides being tendentious, reflect poorly on her judgment.  (What can one reasonably expect of a 91-year-old virtually held captive in a hotel room?)  I've read little enough of Nibley, and nothing I've seen has impressed me.  But that doesn't necessarily mean he molested one of his own children while she was sleeping in a room with her sibs.  That Nibley sold his intellect (and soul) to the Church is a much more creditable charge.   Perhaps becoming an apologist for falsehood did push Nibley over some mental edge, but Beck's own mental processes seem as at least as unusual.  Are we to believe that Beck never questioned the underpinnings of the Mormon faith while she was a doctoral student in sociology at Harvard?  Why would she pick as a counselor a woman who was not only rude but seemed to have mental problems of her own?  Why does Beck spend so much energy grousing about the Church's decision to fire BYU faculty members who doubt Mormon doctrine and refuse to accept its authority?  Beck does reflect on her being her father's daughter, and I'm perfectly willing to believe that this occasionally witty woman shares some loony genes with her dad.
