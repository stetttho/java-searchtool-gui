 1776 is not the story of a year--not even a year of the American Revolution--but is rather a military history of the Continental Army from late 1775 until early 1777 with an emphasis on the development of George Washington as an effective commander.  McCullough appropriately stresses Washington's indecisiveness during the disastrous campaign for New York City but then demonstrates how this failing only made Washington's victories at Trenton and Princeton all the more impressive.   As is typical for McCullough, his writing appears effortless--which, of course, only means that he has taken extraordinary care to marshal his sentences.  (I predict increasing jealousy among professional historians at McCullough's literary and financial success, especially because there is an increasingly limited audience for the arcane, awkward, and tendentious writing that currently receives accolades in graduate school seminars.)   1776 does not have the weight (either figuratively or literally) of the author's Truman or John Adams, but it is a fine book nonetheless, with a celebratory quality that will likewise irritate most American historians  (In their eyes, a few references to slavery and prostitution can never counterbalance the error of thinking well of Americans at war.)  Nevertheless, McCullough should have incorporated a series of simple maps throughout the text and abandoned the many longish block quotes from his fine primary sources.  Then too, McCullough might have discarded the first chapter on the political situation in England and replaced it with a short concluding chapter.  1776 is a fine history and a pleasure to read even if it is not up to the standard of some of the author's earlier books.
