 This work is a fine guide for any non-Mormon contemplating a foray into LDS history.  I've never yet read a bibliographical essay that read like a novel, but considering its genre, this is a nicely written series of essays full of valuable insights.  Since the authors are all Mormon scholars, it is hardly surprising that the book gently leans toward "faith promoting" works and includes occasional sentences like the one that describes anti-Mormon literature as "generally filled with distorting emotion and `facts' that are either faulty or lacking context." (261)  Nevertheless, an educated reader can easily triangulate around this genial bias and learn much about the history of the Latter-day Saints in the process.
