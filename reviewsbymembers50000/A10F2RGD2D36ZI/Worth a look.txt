 This is a short book helpful in small ways.  Lomask has a decent popular style, although he's overly enamored of the one-sentence paragraph and the rhetorical question.  Occasionally he gives questionable advice, such as when he suggests filling out a subject's early life with guesses concealed in the subjunctive (99).  Lomask is best at incorporating the advice of other biographers; in fact, the reader is often left with the impression that he could have done better by reading Leon Edel and Catherine Drinker Bowen in the first place.
