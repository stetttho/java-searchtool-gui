 The title of this book would lead a casual library browser astray.  Jan Shipps, perhaps the most influential non-Mormon historian of Mormonism, does not present a true autobiography here but instead anthologizes her unpublished essays, some of which go back to the 1960s.  As is often the case with collections of essays, their importance and quality varies widely, and everyone will have his own favorites and non-favorites.    Personally, I like Shipps' review of John Brooke's Refiner's Fire and her many autobiographical asides (Too bad she decided not to discuss the rearing of her son, the noted violinist Stephen Shipps.)  Also highly recommended for any student of Mormonism are the notes, which follow each chapter and were definitely written to be read.  On the other hand, I began wincing every time Shipps invoked the mantra of her Methodism--especially since John Wesley would have pronounced her a heretic out of hand.  For instance, Shipps' essay on "Is Mormonism Christian?" commences with mention of her Methodism and then runs on for twenty pages without defining either "Mormon" or "Christian."
