 Considering the academic accomplishments of Robert Remini, this short (and index-less) biography of Joseph Smith is a disappointment--unevenly written, uncritical, even nave.  Remini seems out of his element when discussing nineteenth-century religion, and his several attempts to relate Smith to his specialty, the Jacksonian era, are strained.  Laudable gestures of human kindness performed by a number of LDS scholars noted in the preface seem to have paid remarkable dividends in the tender treatment that the Mormon prophet received from the aging scholar.  A reader would not even learn that Smith's major grievance against the Nauvoo Expositor (which he had destroyed) was that it revealed his practice of polygamy-a practice he had publicly denied only a few days previous.
