 This memoir is simply great story telling, a Chinese Horatio Alger tale where pluck and luck win out in the end.  (Shen admits his admiration for Stendal's The Red and the Black and Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography, but it would be ungracious to push the analogies too closely.)  For some reason Chinese culture permits a more casual, even humorous, treatment of the inhumanity and stupidity of the man-centered ideological system profiled here.  If Shen's memoir doesn't have the moral weight of say, something by Solzhenitsyn, it's at least more enjoyable reading.  Hats off to Shen, who (like Jacob Riis at the beginning of the twentieth century) can write so vigorously in a second language!
