 Becoming a Tiger is really about animal behavior of all sorts, instinctual as well as learned, that of adult animals as well as of young.  The book is completely understandable picked up anywhere and with no knowledge of what came before or interest in what comes after.  What McCarthy has done is given us a series of short animal behavior stories taken from scientific literature but run through her considerable wit and sprightly--even sassy--literary style.  The author has a thesis of sorts, but the true message of this book is that anyone who believes animal behavior to be simplistic or consistent across species is ridiculously mistaken and that no one will ever go broke betting on the complexity of the natural world.
