 A fine introduction to historic preservation as well as to the byzantine workings of the National Park Service.  The early chapters (not including the first) are more interesting and less bogged down in nonessential detail.  Toward the end, the author has a tendency to bury the reader in bureaucratic wranglings and the comings and goings of NPS personnel.  Even so, the sections on the early interpretation of the site, the development of Franklin Court, and the epilogue--almost a summary--are well worth reading to anyone interested in historic preservation and interpretation.
