 Simon Worrall once more retells the remarkable story of master forger and sociopath Mark Hofmann.  A facile popular treatment--there is no index--the book also includes loosely connected chapters on Emily Dickinson, the history of forgery, and the questionable ethics of major auction houses.  Nevertheless, Worrall needs better editing.  Not only does he repeat himself, he also makes a number of small errors about Mormon history and practice.  If Worrall believes, as I do, that Joseph Smith was a fake, fraud, and sex addict, then he might have increased his credibility with more judicious language and more careful checking of his facts.     Furthermore, Worrall might better have tied Emily Dickinson's fist-shaking against God with Hofmann's using any number of quotes from the teenage Dickinson to draw parallels with Hofmann's rebellion against Mormonism during the same period of his life. (For instance, the fifteen-year-old Dickinson wrote, "The world allured me & in an unguarded moment I listened to her siren voice. From that moment I seemed to lose interest in heavenly things.... I felt my danger & was alarmed, but I had rambled too far to return & ever since my heart has been growing harder." Fortunately, Dickinson was not attracted to forgery or explosives.)    Finally, after hypothesizing that Hofmann was largely motivated to commit his crimes by his enmity against the LDS Church, Worrall should have examined the extent to which the Hofmann forgeries damaged Mormonism.  Such a conclusion would have been more satisfying than Worrall's retailing of self-serving statements by Hofmann's ex-wife or his attempt to turn Amherst curator Daniel Lombardo into the tale's hero.
