 There's little I can add to others' praise for this fine book.  McCullough is a great writer now, and he was a great writer in 1968 when he was only in his mid-thirties.  Perhaps if McCullough were redoing the book today, he would cite his sources and reduce the number of characters who are introduced at the beginning and then only brought back at the end when the reader has forgotten who they are.  Otherwise, Johnstown Flood is a model of grace, clarity and style.  Effortless reads like this book require the hand of a master craftsman, and McCullough is such a one.
