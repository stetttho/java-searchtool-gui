 As George Ellison's first-rate, 47-page introduction indicates, this book is "at once historical, sociological, and autobiographical," a book that reveals as much about the author and his humanistic philosophy as it does about the "Southern Highlander."    Kephart's insights about mountain culture are often fascinating and his prose well crafted.  But it should be noted that Kephart's isolated mountaineers were poorer and more prone to crime and violence than were the average residents of the Smokies at the turn of the twentieth century--certainly so in comparison with contemporary inhabitants of Cades Cove.  Kephart's belief that mountain speech descended from Chaucer and Shakespeare and that mountain culture was grounded in that of the Highland Scots is now, at best, disputed.  Finally, the author's romanticized treatment of moonshining should be read in light of his own bouts with alcoholism and his death in an automobile accident caused by a driver who had been drinking the stuff.
