 In opposition to Horace Kephart, Our Southern Highlanders (1913), Dunn correctly argues that leadership and a sense of community was strong in Cades Cove and that development there was not idiosyncratic but followed regional patterns.  The chaos that accompanied the Civil War proved to be the watershed that burned "diversity and innovation" (145) from the Cove.  Yet even so, family life at the turn of the century "was largely indistinguishable from that of other rural Tennesseans." (200)  Although the book is well researched and nicely written, the chapters seem to have been composed independently, which results in some repetition.  Also a better acquaintance with the history of American religion would have limited the author's surprise at progressivism and religious fundamentalism walking hand-in-hand.
