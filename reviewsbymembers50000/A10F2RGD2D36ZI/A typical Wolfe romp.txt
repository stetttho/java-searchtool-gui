 If you're already acquainted with Tom Wolfe's literary style and political opinions, you can pretty well guess where this brief skewering of modern architecture is going to go.  It's a typical Wolfe romp.  Although I find the author's writing style alternately amusing and irritating, the book is a decent introduction to the follies of modern architecture, with its soulless boxes that seem to esthetically satisfy few but their creators.
