 This is the sort of book that may provide amusement for an idle hour and then make you wish you had spent your time reading something with greater depth.  Evans is a clever writer, and his opinionated handling of fifteen stories doesn't bother me because I usually agree with him.  But his narrative treatment is (like many of his subjects) tawdry.  Furthermore, the reader should be wary of factual errors.  Some years ago I enjoyed reading Evan's short version of the Sacco-Vanzetti case in his Casebook of Forensic Detection (1996).  In my view he was absolutely correct about Sacco's guilt-but he also called Sacco's Colt automatic pistol a revolver.  The warning lights came up.  When you're hunting big game, your aim has to be dead on.
