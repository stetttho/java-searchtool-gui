 The Ostlings have provided a good, readable introduction to Mormonism, fulfilling the promise of their introduction to give readers a "candid but nonpolemical overview."  The historical chapters are especially laudable, and I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of the theological discussion near the end of the book.  Mormon America is journalism rather than scholarship, but it is sophisticated journalism nonetheless.  While educated readers will probably skim some chapters that have a news-magazine feel about them, on the whole, Mormon America has been carefully and thoughtfully crafted.
