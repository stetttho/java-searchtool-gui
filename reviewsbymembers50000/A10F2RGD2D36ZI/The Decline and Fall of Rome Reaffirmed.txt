 If this were an early nineteenth-century volume, it might have appeared with a long, explanatory title like "The Decline and Fall of Rome Reaffirmed: A Reply to Professor Brown and the `Late Antiquity' School, based on the waning of economic complexity and the gradual disappearance of familiar items of material culture, with apposite illustrations from archaeology, epigraphy, and the literary tradition."    This important book of measured judgments is rendered with wit and grace--although occasionally my eye was snared by a sentence that might have been profitably tinkered with.  The illustrations are also well chosen and well captioned.  (I'm still smiling about the drawing of a Frankish shield being used as "a fashion accessory.")  The book could be read profitably by any student of Roman history and culture-and especially by specialists in "Late Antiquity."
