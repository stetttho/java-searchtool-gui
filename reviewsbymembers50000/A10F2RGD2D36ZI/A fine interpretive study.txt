 His Excellency is the opposite of those "life and times" behemoths of the nineteenth century in which biography and history were presented together, often ponderously.  Ellis's brief volume offers more of a contemporary commentary on Washington's life rather than a typical nuts-and-bolts biography.  And that's all to the good so long as the reader knows what sort of book he's engaged.  His Excellency is a joy to read, and Ellis is a master storyteller (a gift that contributed to some recent academic unpleasantness).  Ellis's Washington makes sense to me: a colonial aristocrat who sought, like some ancient Roman, to achieve both material success and the approbation of posterity--and got them both.  Few men have been able to achieve such greatness and then also had greatness thrust upon them.
