 Copies in Seconds is fine account of the invention of the photocopier and, to a more limited extent, the story of how that invention changed the world.  Owen well communicates the seemingly impossible odds against which Chester Carlson struggled, especially a youth spent in grinding poverty.  Owen has an eye for detail that makes his characters live and an ear for words that rarely misses the mark.  He provides both a good introduction to copying before xerography and a stimulating essay on his sources.  The illustrations are well chosen, and full captions serve as an outline of his story.  Nevertheless, Owen's journalistic background sometimes works against him, as for instance, when he introduces an interview-demonstration straight into the text.  What would be perfectly appropriate for a New Yorker essay sounds strained here.  It would have been better to have replaced it with some David Macaulay-style graphics to aid the reader in understanding the technical aspects of early Xerox copiers.  Also, I should hope that other books of this quality do not omit citations as Owen's does.    These are quibbles.  Copies in Seconds is an excellent book, the sort that may tempt you to sneak away from your responsibilities to finish.
