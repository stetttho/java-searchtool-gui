 I'm the Teacher--the story of one semester's U.S. History survey course at Emory--is worth reading by any college teacher, rookie or veteran.  Rookies may here find classroom techniques worth implementing, and veterans will enjoy making comparisons with their own classrooms.    Allitt is a lively writer, and his unwillingness to embrace easy, politically correct interpretations of American history increases the reader's confidence in his classroom judgment. (But what does it say about the current state of the historical profession when a first-rate teacher refuses to assign a textbook even though many of his students are so obviously ignorant of basics?)  Clearly Professor Allitt is a good teacher, one who does much more than "turn the crank" on the survey course.  Nevertheless, he also makes plain the wearying aspects of his position, especially what he perceives to be necessary accommodation to the rudeness and irresponsibility of his overprivileged undergraduates.  For despite the truculent-sounding title, this book exudes a genial acquiescence to the trimming of academic sails.
