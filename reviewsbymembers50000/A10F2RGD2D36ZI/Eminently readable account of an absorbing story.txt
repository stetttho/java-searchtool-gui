 First, a caveat: ideally a review of a book about the Bounty (like books about the Little Bighorn or the Sacco-Vanzetti case) should be written by a buff who knows the literature, including the primary sources.  I'm not that person.  I read What Happened on the Bounty simply for pleasure and because it was available when I had the time to read it.    Having made this confession, I must say that I was impressed by Danielsson's lucid writing--all the more so because this book is a translation from Swedish.  Bengt Danielsson  (1921-1997), an anthropologist, was a member of Thor Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki expedition in 1947, and he eventually became a resident of Tahiti and a historian of Polynesia.  Danielsson is familiar with all the essential elements of his story, everything from the architecture of eighteenth-century sailing vessels to the proper preparation of breadfruit.    Danielsson's Bligh has a definite temper and is a bit deficient as a judge of men, but he is also capable, energetic, conscientious, a decent leader, and an extraordinary seaman.  The mutineers, on the other hand, are puerile, undisciplined and (eventually on Pitcairn) vicious and inhuman.  Although Danielsson's story wouldn't make a blockbuster film, to my mind, his judgments are sound.  The book includes two maps and a rough diagram of the Bounty but no index.
