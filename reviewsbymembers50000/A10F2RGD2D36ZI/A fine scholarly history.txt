 William McLoughlin (1922-1992) was for forty years a professor of history and religion at Brown, and this scholarly book is one of his best, carefully researched and written in a clear and logical style.  Not only does McLoughlin treat the complex subject of how Cherokees and missionaries interacted, he also deals with how both dealt with the contemporary culture, especially the removal crisis that led to the "Trail of Tears."  McLoughlin notes, for instance, that missionaries struggled with "rendering unto Caesar," especially when the identity of Caesar was in doubt.    McLoughlin delineates the strengths and weaknesses of the various denominational missionary efforts.  The Congregationalist/Presbyterians overemphasized education and the formalities of religion to the detriment of evangelism.  The Moravians were steady and apolitical, but their reliance on the lot and their determination to establish a farming community of converts retarded their work.  The Methodists' emotionalism and protracted meetings attracted the Indians (who had counterparts in their own religion), but their anti-intellectualism, low standards for conversion, and "sheep stealing" were negative traits.  My only criticisms of this long book (with fairly small print) are that McLoughlin sometimes goes beyond evidence in trying to reconstruct the nature of the anti-missionary reaction among the Cherokees and that he asserts mundane reasons for decisions that the missionaries more likely made on spiritual grounds.
