 As an academic and a long-time student of Roman history (though not a specialist in the field), I was leery of Rubicon.  I probably would never have read it had not been given to me as a gift.  Popularizations of ancient history usually annoy or amuse me, sometimes both simultaneously.  A book jacket advertising that parallels were to be made between the Roman Republic and the "imperial adventures" of the USA did not heighten my anticipation.    Then, when I finally picked up the book, I discovered that Holland enjoys using anachronisms, a practice he obviously deems a mark of smart writing.  For instance, Bibulus is called a "refusnik"(202), Crassus is described as "Macavity-like" (223), and Caesar becomes a "master of spin."(305)  (Holland also says--with some historical license-that Roman orators entertained jurors "with a comedy routine." [124])  But as I read on, Holland's graceful account of the fall of the Roman Republic began to grow on me.  The anachronisms seemed less annoying, and George W. Bush never made an appearance.  To me, Holland's judgments about the first century B.C. seem largely sound, although anyone who's read the primary sources will be tempted to quibble at regular intervals.  (Cicero would have done a little better in my telling, the triumvirs a bit worse.)  Holland has made it clear that although (counterintuitively) the late first century B.C. is the best documented period in all Roman history, "many statements of fact in this book could be plausibly be contradicted by an opposite interpretation." (xx)  Rubicon is good history.  Read and enjoy it.  Just remember that the paucity of surviving sources make many of Holland's assertions only well-informed guesses.
