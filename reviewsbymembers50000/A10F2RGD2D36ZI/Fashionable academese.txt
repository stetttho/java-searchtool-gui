 Domesticating History contains a lot of dubious, theoretical musings about the "cult of domesticity" and such written in fashionable academese.  The interstices provide worthwhile information about the creation of Mount Vernon, Orchard House (the home of Louisa May Alcott), Monticello, and the Booker T. Washington National Monument.  One problem with West's interpretation is that she isn't critical enough of her sources.  If they argue for something that's not politically correct today, she pounces on them and takes them literally.  Some of the author's own pronouncements follow this sort of literalistic logic: "The fact that `the most beloved house in America' was `falling to ruin' tapped into the fear that traditional home life itself was under siege."
