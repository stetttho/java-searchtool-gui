 Rose Wilder Lane (1886-1968) is perhaps best known as the daughter and collaborator of Laura Ingalls Wilder, but she also enjoyed her own modestly successful writing career.  Although Lane continued to produce non-fiction journalism and opinion pieces until her death, Free Land was her last published novel, written shortly after she had abandoned her youthful socialism for what became an increasingly strident libertarianism.    Free Land is one of those fictional pieces in which the author has undoubtedly walked the ground.  In fact, Lane's fine portrayal of time and place, sun and storm, only accentuates her limited plot and bland characterization.  Free Land is not a great novel, but it is certainly far better history than its contemporary, John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath.  Mining both her mother's homesteading stories and her own personal experience on the South Dakota plains, Lane recounts the struggles of the Great Plains pioneers, not sentimentally but with far more sympathy and far less "realism" than would be acceptable in a twenty-first century novel.  It should be noted, however, that when Lane herself decided to live a life of rural simplicity, she moved to Connecticut.
