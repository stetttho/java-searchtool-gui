 In Adventures of a Biographer, Catherine Drinker Bowen (1897-1973) provides a loosely connected series of essays about four biographies (and one false start), two of which became Book-of-the-Month Club selections.  The strength of the book lies in the author's command of her pen and her polished anecdotes.  The volume is neither a "how-to" book nor a true autobiography.  (For instance, there's not a hint that Mr. Bowen had been consigned to the author's past more than a decade previous.)    During the early twentieth century a woman of some means like Bowen could follow her literary enthusiasms through leisurely research and intuitive judgments; and on a number of occasions, this book drops into nostalgic antiquarianism and romantic ruminations about the importance of place. Not surprisingly, Bowen conducts a running argument with "the professors"-academic historians-that is half disparaging, half inferiority complex.    Adventures of a Biographer is a book still worth reading as an example of facile-even quotable-sentences, but in content the book exhibits little depth or mental toughness.
