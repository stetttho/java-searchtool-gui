 A good introduction to Carver, who was a man of charm and impracticality, intensity and feminine tenderness, humility and immense ego, and who was simultaneously devoted to Christian orthodoxy and an ideosyncratic strain of nature mysticism.  Kremer's introduction is nicely written and strikes a proper balance between hero-worship and debunking.  Despite the black scientist's unusual combination of personality traits, his virtues and faults remained largely constant throughout his career, so some of Kremer's examples seem repetitious.  That's no problem. In books like this one, you can skip and skim in good conscience.
