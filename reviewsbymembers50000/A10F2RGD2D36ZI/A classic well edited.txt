 Carla Kelly has done a fine job of editing this classic diary (first published by the Smithsonian in 1937) by highlighting Kurz's commentary on the Upper Missouri fur trade rather than his ruminations on art and thus making it feasible for a university press to issue an abridged version.    Kurz came to the Upper Missouri as romantic, a believer in the superiority of wilderness and the noble savage over Euro-American cities and civilization.  While Kurz never specifically repudiates this view, the notion fades from the journal during his comparatively brief stay in what today is western North Dakota.  Certainly there is no romanticism in Kurz's description of the fur traders and their Indian clients.  No modern author could publish with a university press such a meticulous portrait of native Americans as lazy, violent, thievish, superstitious, and abusers of their women and children.  That's one advantage of Kurz: you can avoid political correctness and read the account of someone who was there.  Kelly has also provided a useful index and 93 plates of Kurz's drawings.  Kurz was a careful observer but not a great artist.  In fact, if Kurz's Indian subjects--especially the women--were decked out in European clothing and hair styles, most of them would look right at home in his native Bern.
