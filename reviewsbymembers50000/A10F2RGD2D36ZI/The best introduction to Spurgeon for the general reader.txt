 Arnold Dallimore (1911-1998), a Baptist clergyman who pastored three Ontario churches, also wrote biographies of Whitefield, Wesley, and Edward Irving.  Like those biographies, this one of Spurgeon is intended to be both inspirational and historically accurate.  The difficulties of simultaneously attempting to promote the faith while providing a "warts-and-all" biography are obvious, but Dallimore handles the challenge well.   Dallimore, the Baptist pastor, emphasizes a Spurgeon who was a whirlwind of pastoral commitments, a hearty Calvinist who supervised a magnificent range of church-oriented social service activities.  (To an agnostic he once retorted, "The God who answereth by Orphanages, Let Him Be God.") No wonder that after spending nearly forty years in the pulpit, Spurgeon died before he was sixty.   Dallimore also properly stresses Spurgeon's principled withdrawal from the Baptist Union, with all the hurtful criticism that that decision engendered--as well as its prophetic anticipation of religious decline in the twentieth century.   Yet it is also heartening to read of Spurgeon's warm relationship with those other evangelical giants of the late nineteenth century, D. L. Moody and Hudson Taylor, who didn't always cross their "t's" the same way as the London Baptist.    I would have preferred a bit more on Spurgeon's theology, the historic setting in which his ministry developed, and the contrast between his periods of deep depression and his reputation as a "bubbling fountain of humor." Nevertheless, for the modern general reader, this life of Charles Haddon Spurgeon is perhaps the best introduction to the greatest of all nineteenth-century evangelical preachers .
