 This short book tells the story of Shiloh National Military Park from the aftermath of the battle until its transfer from the jurisdiction of the War Department to the National Park Service in 1933.  Smith's enthusiasm for the park shines through this revised dissertation, even though his prose is usually more serviceable than exciting.   Attempts to relate the early administrative history of the park to current discussions about historical interpretation--probably only the flotsam of the book's academic origins--are unnecessary because anachronistic.  But Smith hits his stride when he begins to discuss his protagonist, David W. Reed (1841-1916), the "Father of Shiloh National Military Park," to whose memory he dedicates the volume.    For those interested in the development of American military parks, there are three important lessons to be gleaned from Smith's book: 1. The federal government was, at least on occasion, capable of dealing prudently and fairly with private landowners when acquiring park property--although it must be admitted that the area around Pittsburg Landing was an economic backwater. (53) 2. Not surprisingly, the winners of a battle tend to be more enthusiastic about commemorating it than the losers. (78) 3. An intelligent and gifted administrator such as Reed, early on the scene, can shape interpretation in such a way as to make full revision almost impossible.  For instance, all Civil War buffs know something about the importance of Shiloh's "Hornets' Nest," "Sunken Road," and "Bloody Pond," but these iconic locations now seem to have been as much a creation of Reed's historical imagination as battle reality.
