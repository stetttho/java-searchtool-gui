 In this autobiography, Vermont Royster (1914-1996), late editor of the Wall Street Journal, notes that when he published personal thoughts about small matters they would bring in "far more letters than a more `significant' column on a major political issue."  That same hierarchy seems true of the book itself.  Royster's commentary on his childhood and youth is full of engaging detail, whereas his comments about the influential politicians he interviewed at the height of his career seem commonplace by comparison.  So the book draws the reader in with its careful prose and good humor and then eventually disappoints because the original tone can't be maintained.  A further problem is that Royster, a moderate conservative, has no religious, and few philosophical, anchors for his editorial positions-or at least few he cares to share with the reader.
