 White has done a fine job of introducing the doctrine of scriptural sufficiency to laymen.  Especially helpful are his "dialogues," which present idealized conversations between White's alter ego and (alternately) a Catholic, a Mormon, a humanist skeptic, and an unthinking evangelical who claims that God has told him to buy "the Deep Spirit Study Bible in teal and genuine leather."  (There's also a partial transcript of a real debate between White and a Muslim, which serves as a reminder that actual apologetics tends to be messier than the "dialogues.") Although Scripture Alone is directed to a popular audience, some of its chapters are more popular than others.  For instance, Chapter 5, a consideration of the canon, is probably pitched over the head of most of White's readers.
