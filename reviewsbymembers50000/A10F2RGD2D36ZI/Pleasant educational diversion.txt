 Brian Lamb here presents edited versions of seventy-two recent interviews on Booknotes-many being interviews of fellow journalists. It's a bit unsettling to read interviews in which the interviewer has edited himself out, but since the volume is Lamb's third in this format, the publisher must have believed he knew what would sell.  Obviously, some authors are more articulate than others, and the inarticulate ones come across as, well, more inarticulate than they probably would have liked.  If I can be forgiven an indelicacy, this is a perfect bathroom book.  The essays are informal and chatty and only about six or seven pages long-nothing too serious and nothing about which I had any desire to take notes.
