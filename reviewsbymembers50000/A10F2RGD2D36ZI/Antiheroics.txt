 Leonard Guttridge is a Welsh writer who has published several non-fiction books about nineteenth-century seafaring and exploration, of which Ghosts of Cape Sabine is his latest (and perhaps his last, since he was born in 1918).  Guttridge has done a fine job of assembling the scattered sources for a history of the Greely expedition--especially the diaries kept by expedition members--and he is a excellent writer.  Unfortunately, Guttridge's characters are almost uniformly antiheroic: torpid, irresponsible, irrational, immature and consumed by petty bickering. Adolphus Greely seems to have had a genuinely useful career both before and after the Arctic episode that made him famous.  But once the story reaches the ice, it's hard for the reader to decide whom he dislikes most: Greely, the pig-headed commander; his second-rate and nearly mutinous party; the inept and unlucky attempted rescuers; or the wooden-headed bureaucrats back in Washington D.C.  The book might have been tightened up a bit.  For instance, the posterior protection in which the bureaucrats seemed constantly engaged could have been presented more succinctly.  Also, there's a flatness to the characterization that, considering all the scribbling going on while the party starved to death, seems surprising.
