 John Whitehead has attempted to analyze the causes of American declension and has failed.  Certainly he is correct about the end result of statism.  He also provides a few thought provoking discussions, such as that concerning the "wall of separation" controversy, and some nuggets of wisdom--mostly quotations from other authors--among his mish-mash of information and misinformation.  Whitehead's confusion over the definitions of terms like "democracy" and "constitution" are only compounded by historical inaccuracies in his attempted explication of them.  The Separation Illusion can be recommended only as an example of a writing style that should be avoided.  The book seems to have been hurried into print by an author who had not completely digested his wide (though shallow) reading, and it is the reader who suffers indigestion.  Awkward phrases and mixed metaphors abound along with odd quotations from pop stars and rock songs.    Christians certainly need a clear explication of the roots of secularism in American society.  In his attempt to provide such a book, Whitehead has produced only a well-intentioned failure.
