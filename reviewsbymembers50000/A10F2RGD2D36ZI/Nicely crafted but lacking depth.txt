 Like the more gifted Bernard DeVoto (who might have been his teacher at Harvard had not the Depression intervened), Alvin Josephy (1915- ) mucked about in journalism and fiction writing for some years before finding his mtier doing history--in Josephy's case, the history of American Indians. Not surprisingly, Josephy writes gracefully, and parts of his memoir--the stories of his New York City childhood and his heroic World War II service, for instance--carry real emotional punch.  Nevertheless, Josephy easily slides over important subjects he doesn't care to discuss, such as the dissolution of his first marriage, the difficulties of writing history from oral tradition, and the decisions he made as editor of American Heritage.    Furthermore, although Josephy is proud of his New Deal liberalism, he pulls punches when describing the political personalities of his era. For instance, he describes Harry Bridges as "a tough Australian-born dockworker" and Howard Fast as a "successful author honored for his writings by the Soviet Union" without noting that both were Communists.  In other words, early on the reader begins to suspect that Josephy's political views were either more nave or a bit further to the left than he now cares to admit.  Also depressing is his glorification of all things Indian, including Native American superstition--as if rattles and medicine bundles were privileged in a way that the mumbo jumbo of Mexican Catholic priests was not.    Josephy worked at Time magazine a few years after Whittaker Chambers, the nemesis of Alger Hiss, had resigned.  Josephy's family was nurturing, Chambers' dysfunctional.  Josephy's autobiography is nicely structured, Chambers' Witness (1952), misshapen and overlong.  Nevertheless, in Chambers' autobiography we encounter a soul, here only the persona of a facile writer lucky enough to have chosen a topic popular in his own age.
