 Ever since Frederick Lewis Allen initiated the form with "Only Yesterday" in the 1930's, there has been a continuing audience for panoramic histories of decades, centuries and even millennia. Some have been more successful than others--one recalls Eric Goldman's "The Crucial Decade" with special fondness--but anyone familiar with Piers Brendon's previous titles would correctly suspect that he has done the genre justice. (His out-of-print biography of Churchill remains the best one-volume treatment of the Great Man and his "Eminent Edwardians" is a suitable, if more balanced complement to Strachey's acidic put-down of the Victorians). And so he has: sweeping through narratives of events in Germany, the Soviet Union, the United States, Japan, France, Great Britain, Italy and Spain, Brendon displays the same writing flair, skewering wit and learning worn lightly that informs his other books. This is a wonderful book of superbly condensed research and entertaining style for a popular audience interested in the "low, dishonest decade."
