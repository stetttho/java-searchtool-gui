 This selection of largely obscure Twenties swing band recordings from R. Crumb's legendary collection of "rare sides" is truly a desert island disc.  Even if you don't care for the genre--I suppose there are such benighted souls--you'll find yourself smiling and possessed by a toe-tapping frenzy from the very first track. An incredible collection of essential music, nicely mastered and showcased with the usual hilarious Crumb graphics and insightful notes.
