 Waller's vibrant social history is an entertaining introduction to life as it was lived by Londoners in the era of William & Mary. Divided into  topical and thematic chapters covering the stages of family life (Marriage,  Childbirth, Childhood, Death, etc.), the minutae of daily life (Fashion,  Food and Drink, Amusements, etc.) and period brutalities (Religion and  Superstition, Prostitution and Vice, Crime and Punishment, etc.), Waller's  smoothly-written chronicle is a lively tour of a fascinating, dynamic and  ghastly civilization. Although solidly based on primary resources, Waller  wears her learning lightly and     her book is a triumphant panorama of the  epoch it surveys. Not to mention being a fine antidote to any nostalgia for  the age of Defoe and Swift. It also serves as an excellent non-fiction  companion to David Liss' period novel "A Conspiracy of Paper."
