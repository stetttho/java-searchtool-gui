 Given the antiquity of the Sheppard case, the loss of physical evidence and the death of virtually all of its chief figures, it is unlikely that this baffling murder case will ever be solved beyond the shadow of a doubt.  But James Neff has come closer than anyone yet in penetrating to the core of this anguished puzzle. Well-researched and well-written, it demolishes many myths and misconceptions about the case and renders virtually every previous book on the case obsolete. Hard-core followers of the Sheppard phenomeon may be no more swayed by Neff's faith in the DNA evidence proffered in the 3rd Sheppard trial last year (the jurors weren't convinced)but he nonetheless makes a compelling argument for the guilt of Richard Eberling, a familiar and repugnant suspect to Sheppard buffs. True, Neff sidesteps the ludicrous implausabilities of Sheppard's "bushy-haired intruder" story but his evidence and arguments will be the starting place for any further controversy on this celebrated case. In a word, don't exhale until you've read this book.
