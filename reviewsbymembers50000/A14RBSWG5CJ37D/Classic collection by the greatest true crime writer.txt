 Simply put, William Roughead was and is the greatest true crime writer of them all. Combining a supple prose style with an inimitable, pawky sense of humor, he remains the best prose stylist chronicling human depravity since, well, the authors of the King James Bible. A Scot by birth, Roughead became  a Writer to the Signet, a privileged position which allowed him to attend  and write up the great murder trials of his era (1870-1952). His works are  shamefully out of print and are well worth searching out in used book  stores: both his commercial collections and his contributions to the  "Notable British Trials" series. Henry James was one of his many  devoted fans and even the briefest sample of his prose makes it obvious why  true-crime buffs consider him the master. "Classic Crimes"(which  includes chapters on Deacon Brodie, Burke and Hare, Madeleine Smith, Dr.  Pritchard, William Palmer, etc.) is the best collection of his work in  print and I would be remiss if I did not mention that I owe my introduction  to this peerless writer to Toni Morrison, who confessed her own idolatrous  admiration in a New York Times Book Review piece more than 20 years ago. If  you like his stuff you'll never be able to get enough of it. (Also worth  securing are the works of Roughead's friend, the American Edmund Pearson,  whose "Studies in Murder" was reprinted last last by the Ohio  State University Press.) As Roughead so eloquently put it: "Murder has  a magic of its own, its peculiar alchemy. Touched by that crimson wand,  things base and sordid, things ugly and of ill report, are transformed into  matters wondrous, weird and tragical. Dull streets become fraught with  mystery, commonplace dwellings assume sinister aspects, everyone concerned,  howsoever plain and ordinary, is invested with a new value and importance  as the red light falls upon each."
