 How many reference book can be read for pleasure? How many bibliographies would you include in your "desert island" list of indispensable titles? Astonishingly, Cleveland true-crime scholar/enthusiast Albert Borowitz has produced a magisteral volume that splendidly qualifies in both categories.      True crime aficionados take note: this is a book you cannot live without.  In almost five hundred pages of crisply perceptive text Borowitz provides a lovingly annotated list of the world's true-crime literature. And, while the bulk of his text is taken up with English language items, the multilingual Borowitz also surveys works from around the world, excepting only Africa.      Erudite, witty and flecked with a dry humor,Borowitz's 654 choice entries will henceforce comprise every crime connoisseur's library or bibliographic lust list. Not the least of the delights herein is Borowitz's 40-page introductory survey of true-crime literature, which is as good a pocket-history of the genre as you will find. It is an additional measure of Borowitz's standing in his field that "Blood and Ink" also boasts prefatory contributions by both Jacques Barzun and Jonathan Goodman. As Sam Spade himself might say, "A toast to Albert Borowitz--and success to crime!"
