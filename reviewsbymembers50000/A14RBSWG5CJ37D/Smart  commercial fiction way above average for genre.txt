 This is smart, ingratiating "whydunnit" fiction that deserves to find a large audience.  Mesce and Szilagyi's camera-ready dialogue is very effective, both in perfectly setting the period mood, revealing character and pushing the plot forward. It will make an excellent movie--but this compelling page-turner deserves an enormous reading audience of its own. There are lots of investigative thrillers and World War II-period pieces clotting up the literary marketplace but this is a standout by any criteria of writing skill or readerly pleasure.
