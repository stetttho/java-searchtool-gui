 Unlike murder, the disaster narrative genre rarely attracts first-rate chroniclers. More often than not, such accounts are turned out by local  antiquarians who bring more enthusiasm than literary skill to their  subjects.  So it is a double triumph that acclaimed novelist O'Nan has  turned his talents to one of the most poignant epics of American suffering:  the 1944 Hartford Circus fire. Better yet, he's also done a splendid job at  ferreting out the best human resources for his horrible tale and weaving  their words and shattered lives--and deaths--together in a spellbinding  narrative. Simply the best disaster book I've read.
