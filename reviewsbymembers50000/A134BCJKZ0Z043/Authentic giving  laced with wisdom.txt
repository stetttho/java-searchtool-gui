 Birrell's book is a beauty. He's gone in-depth, into the heart of prayer. I couldn't put this book down until I'd read it through the first time. So many people misunderstand prayer that, in the sessions I do with clients, I often begin by removing the coercive influence caused by outlining how another person "should" live. Having facilitated the clearing out of truckloads of this stuff, I'm wary of prayer professionals.  But Birrell has written a how-to about authentic giving, free of hooks and agendas.  Clearly this book was a labor of love. May it create ever more love for millions of book buyers and those they care about!
