 Joe Conason isn't just a superb writer. He's a deft political mechanic, and this big book of his helps to take apart a nasty machine. Professionally, I teach people to read life deeper, and Conason's book reminds me that if more people used deeper perception (face reading, aura reading, service to others as a skilled empath), the right-wing political machine wouldn't work so well. In case you're political without yet being metaphysical, auras are energy fields with databanks of information that anyone can read, including via photos. Integrity shows in three parts of an aura, and no amount of political spin can hide this. George W. and Dick Cheney, for instance, have auras that reveal integrity is extraordinarily distorted. This isn't to say that all the Democrats are perfect, either. Both talents and problems show in everyone. People are complicated.  Whether you're reading political records, faces, or auras, the point is that ideology can't stand alone. WHO speaks the words? WHO requests the spin? Of course it makes sense to check out the military service records of the Republican jingoists (LOL). When we Americans collectively keep our wits about us-i.e., actively using them-we'll find, and elect, politicians who have integrity, whether they're right wing, left wing or middle-of-the-wing. Speaking of integrity, using a technique for reading auras from photos from EMPOWERED BY EMPATHY, here's what Conason's aura shows about his communication: Talent for trumpeting out anything he'd choose to write or say. A detached, ironic, intellect. Meticulous concern for details. Passion behind his dry words. At the level of the soul, doing exactly what he came here to do. Go, Joe, on Salon, in book form!
