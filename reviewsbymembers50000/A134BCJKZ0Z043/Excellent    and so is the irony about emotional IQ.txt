 Goleman has done well at popularizing the concept of Emotional Intelligence, and he's right that it's essential for successful social functioning. From my perspective, however, the book is mostly worth reading (or re-reading) because of irony.  I work with empaths, people who directly experience what it is like to be other people. About 1 in 20 folks has a signficant, trainable gift. And, as described in "Empowered by Empathy," some empaths have emotional gifts, either personally feeling emotions that belong to other people and not recognizing the source (until becoming skilled as an empath) or being able to objectively identify another person's constellations of emotions--doing so with accuracy, rather than projection. Here's where the irony comes in. Emotional Intelligence has zero relationship to being an empath. Unskilled empaths pick up pain like crazy until they become skilled, and a high emotional IQ won't help. What does make a night-and-day difference is becoming skilled as an empath. Irony is compounded by the fact that some of the savviest identifiers of human emotion have no talent at all empathically. In fact, I suspect this is true of Goleman, having not only read this book of his but also having read his aura from his photograph.  Goleman wisely promotes the value of Emotional Intelligence. But don't stop at raising your emotional IQ. If you've seen results from the consciousness raising in this book, wait until you discover the difference it makes becoming skilled, if you're a natural empath.
