 If you have ever wondered about the great Vysotsky, here is the book for you. Tatyana has explored this poet from every angle, and her observations are fresh and fascinating. You can feel the inspiration pop off the page as if this were a fragrant loaf of bread she had just pulled out of the oven.  Wish I could read the Russian, too! But just reading the English portions of the book, it's a triumph.
