 What an extraordinary, clear, compassionate role model for anyone who does spiritual work! It's an understatement to say that I love this book. I've studied (and use) Healing Touch and Reiki, but Eden's techniques are at least as helpful, and they've filled in the gaps between my needs and the assistance provided by these other wonderful modalities. Professionally, I facilitate spiritual and emotional healing--rather than directly addressing the physical level--and so my standards are high for discussion about auras. And Eden's insights are just marvellous. For my next edition of "Aura Reading Through All Your Senses," I plan to put this great book in the bibliography along with high, high praise.
