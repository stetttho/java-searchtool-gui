 My homeopathic practitioner recommended this book, and it's been a treasured resource ever since--one of those books that has been so well used it has taken on the appearance of a much-loved stuffed animal. I listed this book in the bibliography to AURA READING THROUGH ALL YOUR SENSES, since deeper perception adds precision to the diagnostic effects of homeopathy. It's also a huge treat to check out what happens to your aura after you've taken a constitutional remedy.
