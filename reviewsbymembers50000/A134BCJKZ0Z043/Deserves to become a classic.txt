 Grab your highlighter pen before you sit down with this book.  If you're like me you'll need it.  Even though I don't have problems with faith, this book taught me so much that I highlighted an average of one quote per page-a lifetime record with any book.  If you know someone who agonizes over spiritual skepticism, do both of you a favor: give Miller's extraordinary book as a present.  And throw in a couple of highlighters. Miller is a brilliant writer, an original thinker who has distilled his life experience into practical wisdom.  He's never belonged to organized religion in any form.  Perhaps that has hurt the marketing of his books in the short run.  If he belonged to any mainstream denomination, his book would be stocked in its bookstores worldwide; it already could have become a mega-bestseller.  Still, this is a timeless book of wisdom. I believe it's destined to become a classic. Also see A Little Book of Forgiveness, another extraordinary book by D. Patrick Miller.
