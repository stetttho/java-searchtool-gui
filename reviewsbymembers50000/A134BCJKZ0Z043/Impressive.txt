 Sylvia poured her heart and soul into this book, along with her down-to-earth sense of humor. As a professional intuitive and spiritual teacher, I'm no pushover. But I became a fan. This title gave me good confirmation of things I knew, some information I didn't have before, and the fellowship of a woman with great courage and integrity.
