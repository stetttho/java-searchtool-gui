 I loved everything about this book. Considering what Franken had to say about these colossal liars, he said it with as much compassion, humility and humor as possible. Many parts of the book, especially those related to Senator Paul Wellstone, brought tears to my eyes. As I take my hat off to Team Franken, I also must note what a vindication this book is for me as an aura reader (I'm the author of AURA READING THROUGH ALL YOUR SENSES).  In case you're political without yet being metaphysical, auras are energy fields with databanks of information that anyone can read, including via photos. Integrity shows in three parts of an aura, and for years I've been noting problems with some of these liars. If enough people read auras, we'd have different folks on the radio and the bestseller list. And Al Franken, with his magnificent aura, would be even more appreciated than he is today.
