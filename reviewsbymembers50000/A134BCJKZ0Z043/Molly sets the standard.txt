 What a beguiling book! The visuals and words charm, with the sense of being authentically from the heart, then refined and presented as a true gift.  Give this book to celebrate your next anniversary in style, or as a wonderful keepsake for someone you love. And if you have no wedding of your own to celebrate, this book just might give you a share of bliss to enjoy on your own.
