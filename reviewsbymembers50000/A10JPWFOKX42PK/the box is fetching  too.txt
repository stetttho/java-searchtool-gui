 I bought this because I love Barbara Bonney and  I love Sumi Jo (I almost  died when I found out they were in my favorite opera together).  Sumi has a  beautiful voice and perfect technique but some may find it a bit too  beautiful for the Queen of the Night - I personally think the two arias  could do with a bit more raw vehemence.  However, compared to Lucia Popp  (who has the right kind of voice but, interestingly for a mom supposedly in  a towering rage, delivers "Der Holle Rache" at a leisurely and  lyrical pace) or Edita Gruberova (vehement and excitingly fast, but screws  things up when she loses control of the tempo in the high F's), I'll go  with Sumi any day.  Barbara Bonney is perfectly in character with Pamina,  and her rendition of "die Wahrheit, die Wahrheit" is so pure and  delicate, it breaks your heart to listen to this girl (while, for example,  Gundula Janowitz delivers the lines in a booming declaration of  righteousness - no fragile moment of courage or anything here, although her  voice is equally beautiful).   One great merit of this recording, which I  didn't know prior to purchase, was that the Three Boys were sung by real  boys (not female adult sopranos), so you're in for some  Vienna-Boys-Choir-bliss in their trios as well.  Was this Mozart's original  intention?  Do the majority of Die Zauberflote recordings follow this  practice?  I don't know, but it sounds heavenly, never mind the macho  lyrics exhorting one to "be a man"...
