 First, beware the cybershopper: this is an *extremely* slim volume.  The contents make up a scant 80 pages.  Thick, glossy paper quality, which showcases film stills extremely well, and a six-page interview with  Kieslowski at the end, but the writing is less than satisfying.  Andrew  tends to run to extremes - most of the time his "analysis"  consists of painstakingly assembled narrative details from the three films  (expounded at length over individual synopses of the three films), and when  he does take a shot at analysis, he tends to draw grand and general  conclusions for which the evidence is found wanting.  The author prefers to  rhapsodize about the role of chance and destiny in the Trilogy, when an  introductory discussion regarding the precise meaning of the *title* and  how it is expressed in the film might have seemed more proper.  In a sense  he can't be blamed for this, since this is his own take on the trilogy and  he is free to think whatever he thinks - in fact, he apologizes early on  that this tome represents a non-definitive (meaning personal) take on the  trilogy from the viewpoint of an "unrepentant admirer".  However,  in this sense each and every passionate viewer of Kieslowski could have  written his or her own book, with no more and no less merit for publication  than Andrew's.  In sum, if you are already initiated into Kieslowski, there  is nothing in this book that a good second (or third or fourth) viewing of  the films will not give you (but to be on par with this author be prepared  to hit the"pause" button every five minutes - gotta spot that  portrait of Van Den Budenmayer's on the judge's desk!), and if you are a  novice, this is not the book to start with.  Watch the films again,  carefully, and let your mind draw its own conclusions.
