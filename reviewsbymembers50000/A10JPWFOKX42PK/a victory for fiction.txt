 I can't add much more to what all the reviews below have already said - approach the book in a pristine state, don't want to give away any story developments, separate sections all well written in different styles.  It's a hell of a book, with a terrific heartache at the end.  That said, what impressed me most was how believably McEwan describes Briony's juvenile state of mind - every whim, every extraordinary turn of thought rendered so plausibly.  And in the final revelation (although some of the book's surprises can be guessed at, the last is the best, and truly impressive), he reminds us of how juvenile we all, and not only Briony, remain as fiction lovers, however sophisticated we claim to have become: we want our heroes to be handsome, our maidens beautiful and tragic, and we need them to sail away happily together into the sunset.  And that is what great fiction, and McEwan, does for us.
