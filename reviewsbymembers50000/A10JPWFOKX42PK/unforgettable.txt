 After I finished this book, I went online and ordered all the books of Mr.  Japrisot's from Amazon.  Some of the reviews cautioned against expecting  the same level of narrative in the other books, but who cares?  I'd try  anything by this author.  The other books haven't arrived yet and meanwhile  I am chewing over parts of this book, so wonderfully painful, uplifting and  chock-full of truths about "the ways of the world".
