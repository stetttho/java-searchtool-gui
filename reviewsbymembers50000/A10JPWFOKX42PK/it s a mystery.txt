 This is my second Iris Murdoch novel, after "The Sea, The Sea," and I'm still not sure if I've got the hang of her style.  Maybe I am too conscious of her reputation as a Major Writer And Philosopher; I  consciously look for any symbolic gesture, object or situation which might  help me catch the underlying message, but so far in vain.  I find her  novels limp both in narrative and ideas.  Her plot is often contrived, and  her characters thoroughly unnatural.  One wonders if the story is only  meant to serve as a vehicle for the Grand Idea (and therefore not to be  expected too much of! ), of which one catches a glimpse here and there -  for instance in Max's elaboration on the Greek concept of Ate, which seems  to be meant to apply to Hannah and the people surrounding her.  However,  the ideational component is too general, and the vessel (plot &  characters) too detached from it, for the reader to fully comprehend and  sympathize.  I came away with a vague sense of dissatisfaction, both with  the book and with myself.  If I'm the only dense one here, let me know.
