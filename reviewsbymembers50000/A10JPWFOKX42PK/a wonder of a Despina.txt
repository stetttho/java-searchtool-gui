 Reading the reviews below I was a little disappointed to find so few mentions of Graciela Oddone, who is the absolutely marvelous Despina here.  This was my first Cosi, and during the 3-hour marathon I found myself turning to stare at my CD-player whenever Graciela came on.  She goes to extraordinary lengths to express the character!  The cackle of the Despina-notary is nothing like the usual fare the conventional listener is used to (of course, when she is Despina proper she sings great, too, with just the right amount of sass).  Everything about this recording is wonderful, but it is Graciela above all who reminds you of the FUN!  Bravissima!!!
