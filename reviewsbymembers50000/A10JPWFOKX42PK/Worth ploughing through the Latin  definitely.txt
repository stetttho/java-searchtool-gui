 Before I say anything about the book - I think the Editorial Review and the first Synopsis that appears above should be deleted.  The Editorial gives the plot and the villain away and the Synopsis is just plain wrong -  it's not the Franciscans suspected of heresy that William is after!  Also,  he initially arrives to the Benedictine abbey on a diplomatic mission, and  gets involved only later in the investigation, and this of the murders, and  not the stray Franciscans!  Anyway, I first read The Name of the Rose in  college, in a well-annotated Korean edition, and at that time I thought it  was a great mystery but the historical/argumentative parts bogged it down a  bit.  Now I am reading it again in English, with a lot more appreciation  and interest in Middle Age civilization and politics, and I am savoring  every detail.  It helps to have The Key to the Name of the Rose at hand,  since the English edition doesn't offer any explanations on the Latin or  the numerous historical figures mentioned (but The Key isn't perfect either  - sometimes the glossary doesn't seem to offer enough pertinent  information).  I find myself laughing out loud at William's wickedly done  impersonations of Sherlock Holmes.  As Eco himself says, this is a story of  and for people who love books, with all the usual possessiveness, curiosity  and jealousy, and it is a really great read.
