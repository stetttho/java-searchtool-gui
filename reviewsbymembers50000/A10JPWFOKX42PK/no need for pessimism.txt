 it's surprising to see so many negative reviews here, since I remember GRAMOPHONE magazine gushing about the "sheer pleasure" of reviewing Gallardo-Domas' album, which made me risk the purchase despite a tired old song selection (NOT another "Sempre libera"! NOT another "Un bel di"!).  and I was converted.  the technical aspects aside (of which I don't know enough to discuss knowledgeably), her singing is so emotional, so heart-on-sleeve, it breathes life into age-old arias.  her Violetta is truly overwhelming, and even if one takes into account the differences in taste that might be prejudiced against a voice like hers, she deserves better.  I vote 5 stars.
