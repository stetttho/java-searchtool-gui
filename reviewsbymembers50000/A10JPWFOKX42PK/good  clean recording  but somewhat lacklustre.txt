 This is an interesting collection of Bach choral works, handsomely packaged, with magnetic names adorning its cover.  Unfortunately, for all that it doesn't make much of an impression on the listener.  One reason  could be the bass, who is distracting as hell - he has a bombastic,  Pavarotti-kind of voice more suited to opera, and manages to upset the  delicate balance of the chorus every time.  There's not much more to gripe  about, however.  All in all, a good, clean recording, but somehow lacking  that special something that makes one fall unconditionally in love with a  recording.  I bet there are better Magnificats.
