 I've actually read to only  2/3 of the book but I don't feel I need to finish in order to comment.  I, too, doubt the credibility of the National Book Award shortlisting.  I, too, feel that Johnson has only assigned the  characters  some convenient adjectives instead of attempting to seriously  fill them in.  I couldn't "visualize" the characters at all!  Her  liberal use of screenplay format only serves to annoy the reader, as well  as her tendency to start any paragraph she wants the reader to pay  attention to with "Then something strange happened..." or her  compulsive urge to end every chapter with "Little did I know..."   Reads like an English-major college kid's debut, shoulda been a travel  essay/guide (witness the success of "Toujours Provence").
