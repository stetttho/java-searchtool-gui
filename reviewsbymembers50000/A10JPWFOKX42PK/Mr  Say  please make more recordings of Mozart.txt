 I bought this CD because I wanted a sampling of Mozart's piano sonatas and  the reviews here were so glowing.  Well, there's a reason all three  recordings of Fazil Say on Amazon.com come with a solid five stars each!   His playing sounds so different from all the other pianists on offer - does  this guy have a better piano?  better sound engineers?   :) In any case,  this is a piano album which has the power to overwhelm the listener with  the sheer beauty of the sound of the instrument.   For those who find the  title "Ah, vous dirais-je, maman" intimidating - this is actually  the age-old melody of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star", and you  can bet when Mr. Say plays it it can break your heart and make it whole  again.
