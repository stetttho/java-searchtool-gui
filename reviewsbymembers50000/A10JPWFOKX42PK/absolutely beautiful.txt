 with all due respect to the reviewer who preferred anne-sophie mutter, let me offer an alternative opinion.  I tried out the mutter/NY phil CD first (... it for the Brahms), but it took hilary for me to fall in love with the piece.  I recently went back to anne-sophie after a full two weeks with hilary, and for me the differences are overwhelmingly in favor of hilary's recording.  the sound of her violin, and of the orchestra, is MUCH more beautiful, and her phrases are shaped so that they linger in the listener's mind (you can listen to a longer segment of the 2nd movement at her homepage, hilaryhahn.com).  in contrast, anne-sophie mutter's violin squeaks and creaks, and the orchestra sounds somewhat muffled.  if you prefer the violin to sound beautiful, and noble, I think you should go with hilary hahn.
