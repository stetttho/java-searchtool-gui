 Adam Zamoyski has done a wonderful job of putting together a story that is very well told.  Political and social movements are clearly outlined, while developments in the literature and fine arts are not forgotten either..  Judiciously chosen illustrations and maps accompany the text (a pity they're in black and white).  This is no book to fall asleep over!  I readily forgive him his at times insistent rhapsodizing about Zamosc, his ancestral home, and his aristocratic forebears.  Poland has been served very well with this tome and I hope more people will get to know about the trajectory of this very human nation.
