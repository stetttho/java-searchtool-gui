 It is a bumper season for Vermeer books. The book sketches in the provenance of a fictitious Vermeer painting, chapter by chapter, which work like brief glances into a Vermeer moment in our lives. Tracy Chevalier in her "Girl with a Pearl Earring" achieves a better result overall in terms of characterization and atmosphere - her Griet is flesh and blood, her Jan Vermeer convincingly elusive. However, notwithstanding her wooden prose, Susan Vreeland does manage to make a point: why are we drawn into Vermeer scenes? Why do we impart our own longing and solitude into his canvases, more than those of any other artist? Why do we care? The book is not only about a Dutch painter and his mystery, but about beautiful things we cherish, the moments that render an ordinary life memorable, the truth that all too often goes buried beneath the years.
