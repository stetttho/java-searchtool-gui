 For me the great merit of this recording has always been Margaret Price.   Her creamy, warm tones are perfect for the Countess, and she alone is  reason enough to own this recording.  The stars above all belong to her  (and if it was her and not the recording in question, it would be ten stars  instead of four).   It's a pity she doesn't seem to be as famous as the  other Countesses and her albums are relatively few.
