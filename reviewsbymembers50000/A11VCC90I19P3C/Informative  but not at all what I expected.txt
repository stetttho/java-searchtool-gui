 Growing up in the way-out country of Missouri, I spent a lot of time outside in the woods, getting to know the different plants and animals that live there.  This eventually gave rise to an interest in natural medicine, and in harvesting and preparing my own herbs from the property I lived on.  All the texts I could find, though, were based in the plants and knowledge indigenous to either Europe or Asia.  I was delighted to come on a copy of Alma Hutchens' _Indian Herbalogy of North America_ a couple years back, thinking it would be a catalog of the plants I found growing in my own back yard, and throughout the back roads of America that I love to explore.  However, the book has quite a bit of information about the herbal medicine of other cultures (Russia, Western Europe, and China, in particular), so much that it crowds the Indian lore out--which, of course, was what I really wanted.  It's not a bad book, in general terms, and would make a pretty solid kernel for a new collection of herbal medicine books, but I don't recommend this as a resource for people interested specifically in Native American treatment of disease or use of herbs for health maintenance.
