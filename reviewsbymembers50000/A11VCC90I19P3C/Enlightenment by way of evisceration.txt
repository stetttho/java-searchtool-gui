 What a wonderful resource for students of poetry--whether discovering Dickinson for the first time, completing an MFA, or holding a Ph.D in literature and a full professorship.  Snodgrass takes some of the most powerful poems in the English language, and eviscerates them.  We are often left with hilariously or shamefully dull, clunky verse, that shows by negative example just what made the original so great. This is not only a text for use in poetry classes, although the 101 "de/composed" poems are taken from Snodgrass's own work as a teacher.  There's plenty of knowledge available to the casual reader in comparing the two versions of each poem and reading the accompanying discussion.  That itself is a pleasure to read, direct, lucid, insightful, and often humorous.  A definite five stars!
