 I am not an exercise fanatic.  I'm not even an exerciser.  I don't like being sweaty, I don't like being worn out, and I don't like being around people who do like those things.  Plus, I am just not the most physically coordinated person on earth.  I remember a soccer game in gym class, my sophomore year in high school, in which I tripped over my own feet four times.  Part of that was probably nervousness, but even now, nearly ten years later, I occasionally stumble into a doorway as I'm walking through it, even alone in my own apartment.  I could fall down and somehow miss the floor, I'm so clumsy. You won't believe this--I can do Tae-Bo. The moves are easy.  I mean, E A S Y.  It's an incredibly efficient system of very basic punches and kicks that truly do work the entire body.  I've been doing the Basic workout now for just under a month, and I can see muscle pairs developing that I have never seen on myself.  Not only that, but I can do this workout, every day, in my living room, without tripping myself up.  Or knocking anything over.  Or even stepping on my cat. You will get tired, and sweaty, but after all that's the point of an aerobics workout.  I find Billy Blanks a lot less annoying than most the people on these kinds of tapes; he has a an engaging presence and takes the workout seriously, but not too seriously.  This is the first experience I've had with doing anything athletic where I felt real success, and I recommend it to people whenever the opportunity arises.  If you decide to try it, I suspect you will, too.
