 With all the bad press during the shooting of this big screen adaptation of the popular hair-tossing, 70s jiggle TV show, one might surmise that it's dud.  Not so.   Whatever the driving force (could it be the versatile, intuitive co-producer and co-star Drew Barrymore?) behind this rousing, hard-action comedy, the results are far superior to most other attempts at turning popular TV-series-into-movies (didja see "Mod Squad"?).  This terrific DVD diversion is packed with hours of entertaining extras.  Recommended. Action fluff.
