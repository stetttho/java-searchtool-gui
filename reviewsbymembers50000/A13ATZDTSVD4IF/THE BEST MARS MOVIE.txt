 A lot of people are confusing this very satisfying sci-fi action adventure with the laughably pretentious, boring, goofy, message-laden atrocity MISSION TO MARS! The two mars-themed films couldn't be further apart. It's the middle of the 21st century and a dying earth reaches out to colonize Mars as a last hope.  Val Kilmer, Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix), Benjamin Bratt, Tom Sizemore and Terrence Stamp represent all humankind in the first landing on the mysterious red planet.  Also on board is the extraordinary, multifunctional robo-assistant AMEE.   But, wouldn't you know it, a malfunction has forced her into a relentless killing-machine mode hell-bent on destroying the crew.  And that's not all the crew must deal with; barren Mars has breathable oxygen and -- other inhabitants.  Like the poster says: "They didn't find life on mars.  It found them."   This somewhat by-the-numbers adventure is saved because it's looks great (the sets, locations and props are always credible) and the action never lets up.  The striking Martian landscape is rendered vast and real and, yes, red.  Recommended. (Color, Widescreen, Dolby Surround, 107 Minutes, Rated PG-13)
