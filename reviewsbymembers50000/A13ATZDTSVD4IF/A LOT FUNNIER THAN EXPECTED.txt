 "LUCKY NUMBERS" didn't do big numbers in its theatrical release but is worth a look if you're in the mood for a rowdy, raunchy heist farce.   John Travolta is big fish TV weatherman in a small Pennsylvania pond. Beset with financial woes -- his snowmobile dealership is not doing well during an unpredictably warm winter -- so he teams up the Lisa Kudrow, the station's angry, sleep-around lottery girl, and with the help of wanna be gangster and strip bar owner Tim Roth, they devise a plan to rip off the state lottery.   Things quickly go very bad.  And get much worse.  Not quite up to the Coen brothers, but a lot funnier than most alleged comedies.  Nora Ephron directs an Adam Resnick screenplay supposedly based on a real incident.  Unexpectedly funny.  But Travolta will have to do many more little gems like this to make up for the pain and suffering his fans endured in "Battlefield Earth."
