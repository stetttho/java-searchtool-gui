 "ENDLESS NIGHT"    Is this the best Agatha Christie film?  Many of her hard-core fans think so.   Maybe it's because it's not so much a "who dunnit" but rather a "when's it gonna happen"? Christie herself is said to have disliked this film version because of the brief nudity. (Bloody murder didn't phase her.  How veddy British.) Hayley Mills, who may have been bulimic during her Disney years, looks stunning (borderline anorexic?) in the part of Ellie, a lovely, lonely and very wealthy heiress (is there any other kind?) who falls in love with a poor chauffeur.  Her marriage with someone far below her station is a cause of great apprehension to her family.  But we root for the vulnerable newlyweds, who move into a palatial country estate said to be cursed (is there any other kind?), because we know love conquers all.   As you might guess, there is a stunning plot twist at the climax that is truly shocking. It got me and I'm jaded!   George Sanders, Britt Ekland, Per Oscarsson and Lois Maxwell co-star in this dark tale with a 70's ambience.  The great music score is by legendary composer Bernard Herrmann.  Even though Hayley lip-syncs Shirley Jones' title song, I'm still not sure what "Endless Night" really means.  Sydney Gilliat wrote the screenplay and directed.
