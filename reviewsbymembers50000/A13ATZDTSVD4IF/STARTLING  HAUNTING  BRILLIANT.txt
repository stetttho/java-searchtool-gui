 Don't dismiss Icelandic sensation Bjork just because she wore what looked like a giant dead swan while singing her Best Song nomination at the Academy Awards. This riveting, heartbreaking film won the coveted Palm d'Or for Best Picture at the 2000 Cannes Festival. Bjork plays quiet, heroic Selma, a single-mom factory-worker secretly going blind and saving money so her son, who also has the inherited condition, can have an operation before he too is blind for life. Bjork, who won Best Female Performance at Cannes, composed the startling, poignant songs that illuminate the images and emotions of a woman who retreats into a fantasy world "where nothing dreadful ever happens" while her real life spirals out of control. What sounds sentimental and smarmy is anything but as written and directed by Lars von Trier ("Breaking The Waves").  This visually exquisite film that plays with the blurred borders of reality and fantasy co-stars Catherine Deneuve and Joel Gray.   A must see. Bonus material includes commentaries and  documentaries as well as song access. (New Line, Color, Widescreen, Dolby 5.1 Surround, 141 Minutes, Rated R, 2001)
