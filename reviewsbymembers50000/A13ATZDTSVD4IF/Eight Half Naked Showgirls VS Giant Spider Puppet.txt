 "HORRORS OF SPIDER ISLAND" Ever walk into a spider web in the dark?  Well, this movie's nothing like that.   New from Image Entertainment, is this black and white exploitation flick from 1960.  The late(?) great Fritz Bottger directs -- well, kind of -- eight sexy showgirls and their macho manager who survive a plane crash on a remote tropical island.  The practical gals are survivors!  Not only that, they represent a crss section of "female pulchritude" (as Hef used to say back in the 60's). So, lucky for us, they quickly adjust to the stifling heat and strip to their underwear.  Yippeeee!   (Hey, it's crucial to the, ahem, story).  Almost immediately they discover a dead scientist caught in a giant web. Uh oh.   Soon, their testosterone crazed manager is bitten by a giant spider and, get this, grows claws, fangs, and lots of facial hair.  Maybe he's on steroids as well 'cause he seems to be in a "roid" rage and becomes a pest in the worst way. I don't want to spoil the plot -- oops, did I say plot? -- so I won't give away any more lest I spoil it for first time viewers. The dubbing is atrocious but adds a weird, je ne sais quoi, patina to the ever increasing distortion of reality.  An authentic classic of its kind. Cinema merde?  Must be seen to be believed. Five blazing stars!  Like a nightmare you can't run from - but laugh at later.  Warning: Don't watch this in any kind of altered state -- you may never return to the reality we all attempt to share.  (Not Rated, Full Frame (wow!), Mono (not the disease), No Region Code (you can watch it anywhere in the world!), 76 fleshy minutes.)
