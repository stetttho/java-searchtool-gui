 A tough, tense, psychological thriller set in the bleak, frozen  wilds of Greenland. A young writer leaves Oslo and his girlfriend behind and joins a fur-trapping expedition that includes two mysterious men.  Cut off from civilization, the once naive youth must use all his wits to survive the elements and a savage human enemy. A rare, thoughtful adventure in an extreme setting starring the great Scandanavian actor Stellen Skarsgard. Directed by Hans Moland from a screenplay by Lars Lundholm. Visually stunning and mentally engaging.  Highly recommended.   One UK reviewer (Bernard in THE DAILY MAIL) said it was "a Norse version of 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly.'" Hard core Arctic adventure that goes all the way.   ZERO KELVIN delivers!
