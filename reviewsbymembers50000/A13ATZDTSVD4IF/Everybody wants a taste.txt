 This 60s mockery, certainly among the most-wanted of DVD titles, is finally available in a crisp, widescreen print from Anchor Bay Entertainment.  It's a feminine -- but definitely not feminist -- take on Voltaire's "Candide" as imagined through the dirty-old-man mode of screenwriter Buck Henry, and based on Terry Southern's once scandalous novel of the same name. Fate sends naive, voluptuous, high-schooler Candy Christian (Ewa Aulin) on a journey of sexual discovery.  Along the way, she encounters a surprising array of big name stars (Richard Burton, Walter Matthau, Marlon Brando, James Coburn, John Huston, Charles Aznavour among others), all of whom want to sample delicious, innocent Candy. This uneven burlesque is sometimes sweet, shocking, embarrassing, hysterical and yes, worth a look.  From the perspective of the 21st century, it's a living time capsule that mirrors elements of the distant sexual revolution and is a glossy attempt at what low budget video porn would later exploited in far more explicit, tedious, mind-numbing detail. Christian Marquand directs.  Music by Steppenwolf and The Byrds.  Whatever happened to the luscious Ewa Aulin? (Anchor Bay, Color, Widescreen, Dolby Mono, 124 minutes, rated R, 1969)
