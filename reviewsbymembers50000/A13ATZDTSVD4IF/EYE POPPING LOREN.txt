 Sophia Loren in a wet peasant blouse and battle scenes with 5000 extras.  What more could you ask for!  An amazing looking, bawdy movie with sultry Sophia at her best as a laundress who joins a group of prostitutes to find  her lost lover in Naplopeon's army. At least I think that's it.  Should be  put on widescreen DVD. Maybe ANCHOR BAY will do it.  Write  <J.Douglas@handleman.com> and demand it.
