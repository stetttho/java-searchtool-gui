 OK, just who's really America's Sweetheart?  Is it Julia Roberts or Sandra Bullock?  The real test is can she survive a movie misfire and still be lovable.  Sandra does just that in this slightly off-center attempt at a screwball comedy with a dramatic center. The premise almost works: A tom-boy FBI agent is forced to go get all girlie and go under cover as a beauty contestant to find a killer.  Unfortunately, Bullock's character is also made out to be a klutz.  Not only that, she has a mannish walk, talks with her mouth full, a snorts when she laughs and has unplucked eyebrows.   It's almost like the original premise was: The Butch and the Beauty but someone wimped out and watered down the core idea until it's a mish-mash of tired one-liners and a tacked on love story.   Listening to the audio commentary by self-absorbed writer Marc Lawrence and a plucky Bullock, one gets the idea that the failure of this valiant, too long, but still entertaining film is not enough passes in the screenplay and a creative producer (Bullock) who lost control of the basic concept.    Besides Lawrence, Katie Ford and Caryn Lucas are the other credited writers. The non-direction is by Donald Petrie. Beware of their names on a movie.
