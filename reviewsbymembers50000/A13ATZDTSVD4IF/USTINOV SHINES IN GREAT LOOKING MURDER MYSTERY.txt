 "DEATH ON THE NILE"  Yet another story of a murdered millionaire heiress, but this time, the movie has a much bigger budget (than "Endless Night"), a screenplay by Anthony Schaeffer, exotic Egyptian locations and a star-studded cast that includes Bette Davis, David Niven, Angelea Lansbury, Mia Farrow, Olivia Hussey and Lois Chiles. Peter Ustinov is droll, meticulous, Belgian master sleuth Hercule Poirot taking a cruise down the Nile on the S.S. Karnak. And, as is often the case when he goes on holiday, someone dies. Soon, all the rich passengers are suspects in the murder of Linnet Ridgeway.  Can he find the culprit before the boat docks?  Of course.  But you will be surprised at his revelation -- and the number of bodies that fall along the way! Director John Guillerman works hard to balance the Christie formula of character over plot. The movie works and is a delight. A highlight is Nino Rota's memorable score that cleverly riffs the chugging of the steam powered boat heading up river. Jack Cardiff's cinematography perfectly evokes 1932. (UK, Color, Widescreen, 140 Minutes, Rated PG, 1978)
