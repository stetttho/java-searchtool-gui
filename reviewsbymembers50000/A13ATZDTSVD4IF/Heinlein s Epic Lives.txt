 "THE PLUTO CAMPAIGN" Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles "10,000 troopers versus a million bugs.  Vegas odds."   Trooper Rico "How do we kill an enemy that has no soul?"   Trooper  Flores. Forty episodes of the spectacular "Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles" computer-animated series aired on TV, but had a limited following.  The original broadcasts were broken into eight, five-day-a-week chapters.  THE PLUTO CAMPAIGN, a five-episode story arc has been edited into a feature by combining the episodes and bridging the gaps with new narrative. The stories are true to author Robert Heinlien's great fascist parody.  The characters are surprisingly engaging and distinct.  There's combat crazy Rico, psychic Jenkins and sexy-tough Flores.   Their mission in "The Pluto Campaign" is to wipe out an infestation of the deadly arachnids on the ice planet.  But what they encounter is a full-blown invasion of the human hating monsters threatening to take over the galaxy. The action is hard and fast.  There's an extraordinary use of thematic color and lighting. Even the slightly stiff human movements give everything an otherworldy quality.  Wonderful stuff that can be enjoyed again and again.   My one complaint is in the sound of the weapons. A little more bass please, and more variety in the thwacks, booms and bangs. Other sound design is above par. For many, this is a totally unknown series.   This is definitely not a kiddie cartoon. It deserves to be discovered.  In fact, it could hold its own on the big screen! Bravo to Columbia TriStar for releasing it and to all the petitioners who made them do it.  A second release is planned for September.  I can't wait. Highly recommended.  Buy this DVD.
