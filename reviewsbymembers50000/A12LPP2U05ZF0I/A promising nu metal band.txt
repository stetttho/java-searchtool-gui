 First off, don't associate Ill Nino with Puya just because they both have Latin influences. Ill Nino is about 100 times better because the use the Latin style at times, not the whole CD. They are definitly one of the best nu-metal bands. Ill Nino, at times, can be hard enough to resemble Slipknot or Static-X and at others can be slow like a Latin Incubus. I have had this CD for awhile, and haven't stopped listening to it since. I could not rate any song below a 4. (see below) If you are a fan of any of the following bands, you will easily fall in love with Ill Nino: Slipknot, Tool, Static-X, Darwin's Waiting Room, Incubus (sound from SCIENCE) or dope.  Here is a track rating (1-5): God Save Us: 4.5 If You Still Hate Me: 5 Unreal: 5+++ Nothing's Clear: 4.5 What Comes Around: 5+++ Liar: 4 Rumba: 5 Predisposed: 4 I Am Loco: 4.5 No Murder: 5 Rip Out Your Eyes: 4 Revolution/Revolucion: 4.5 With You: 5
