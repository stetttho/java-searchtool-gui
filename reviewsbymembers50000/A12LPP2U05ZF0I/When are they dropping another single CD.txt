 I have had this album since September 2000, a few months before they blew up. Crazy Town is a great band that has great sound as well as lyrics. The whole CD is rapped out, but all the music is metal. Even after getting played out on MTV and the radio, I still am not sick of "Butterfly". However, they do need a new single before people completely forget about them. But if you happen to cop the album (or check it out somewhere) listen to Revolving Door, Toxic and Holywood Babylon. Please don't skip over this album if you're into the rapcore scene.
