 I just finished watching this piece on my all-time favorite rapper 2Pac. It's probably the best documentary I have ever seen except for the beginning. Once 2Pac's former bodyguard, Frank Alexander, begins his version of the year leading up to Pac's death, the whole thing is great. I didn't want to miss one word from this. I felt I had a lot to learn about Tupac's death, and I feel that I have learned quite a bit from "Before I Wake". Before seeing this, I was 100% positive that 2Pac had faked his death, but seeing this, I'm not so sure anymore. I also believed that Suge Knight had a part in the death of Pac, but everyone (from detectives to bodyguards to journalists) believe that Suge had no part in it. This was a great movie because it explains how Pac felt about things, and some of his responses to adversity (such as the rape charges he faced). Make sure to check this out and Frank Alexander's book "Got Your Back: Protecting Tupac In The World Of Gangsta Rap".
