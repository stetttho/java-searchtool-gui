 This is one of the greatest albums recorded in any language. Nawal El Zoghby is my all-time favorite, non-American singer. This is my favorite album by her (she has released 8 or 9). I am a person who totally hates cassettes, and this album made me record the CD to a tape so I can listen to it anywhere, no excuses. Also, it is rare to ...be interested in music in which they can't understand, as is the case here. I would reccomend this album to anyone who likes any music, for the tracks vary in sound. But make sure you hear this album, i guarantee you will NOT be disappointed.
