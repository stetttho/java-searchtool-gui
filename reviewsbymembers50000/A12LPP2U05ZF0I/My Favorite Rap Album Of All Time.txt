 This is without a doubt the best album found in hip-hop today. This is also the LP that inspired me to be a rapper. Some of the hardest and best metaphors can be found on this one CD. (I developed my style from this LP.) What I like about this CD is that every member of Wu has his well-deserved shine. All of these songs can be considered calssics. Wu-Tang has always been my favorite group. A group that has Method Man, GZA, RZA, Inspectah Deck & Ghostface Killah must be the greatest of all-time. A group that has these 5 lyricists AND produces hit after hit; hot album after hot album is definitly somewhat sacred. The top songs on this cut are C.R.E.A.M., Method Man, Can It All Be So Simple, Protect Ya Neck & Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthin Ta [Mess] Wit. If you don't have this LP, then your life just isnt complete. Below is my track rating (1-5): Track 1 - 5  Track 2 - 4.5 Track 3 - 5 Track 4 - 4.5 Track 5 - 5 Track 6 - 5 Track 7 - 5 Track 8 - 5+++ Track 9 - 5+++ Track 10 - 5+++ Track 11 - 5 Track 12 - 4.5
