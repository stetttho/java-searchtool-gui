 This is one of the best all-around CD's out now. From commercial songs (Izzo & Girls, Girls, Girls) to the underground-like diss (Takeover) to the thuggish songs, Jay-Z keeps it real and bangin throughout.  The beats are pretty good on this LP but I think he should have had more guest spots on this CD. He has no ROC artists featured on this. But one guest spot made me get this CD...Eminem's appearance on Renagade. Yeah, Slim outshines Jigga on this track, but who can honestly outshine Eminem?   The songs to check out are definitly Renagade, Jigga That N***a, Hola Hovito & Song Cry. The following is my track rating (1-5): 1. The Ruler's Back - 4 (decent for an intro) 2. Takeover - 4.5 (beat gets annoying...Jigga disses Nas & Mobb Deep here) 3. Izzo - 3 (it got played out) 4. Girls, Girls, Girls - 2 (this did too) 5. Jigga That N***a - 5 (the beat and hook keep it bangin) 6. U Don't Know - 4 (beat sounds like it's from a Jay-Z intro) 7. Hola Hovito - 5 (one of the best on here) 8. Heart Of The City - 4 9. Never Change - 3.5 10. Song Cry - 5 11. All I Need - 4.5 12. Renagade - 5+++ 13. Blueprint (+ 2 BONUS TRACKS) -  3
