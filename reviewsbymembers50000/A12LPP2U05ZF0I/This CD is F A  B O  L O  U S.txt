 I've been a Fabolous fan since I first heard him on DJ Clue's The Professional (Part 1). Since then, I have been trying to get all of his songs and freestyles. I was excited when I first heard that this album was droppin.  You just know that this CD would be good when you have a great lyricist (Fabolous), a well-known name (Ja Rule), one of the top R&B groups (Jagged Edge) & the man who has a ton of guest spots (Nate Dogg). And that is only the artists....producing you have The Neptunes, Timbaland, DJ Clue, Rockwilder, DJ Envy & Duro. This equals success already. Fabolous has tight lyrics on the album, and at times you gotta pause the CD to try to understand it. The beats are tight, and you can easly listen to the whole album in entirety. This is an interesting CD because the themes of the songs change from track to track, yet you gotta like em all. This CD has some of the best beats I've ever heard and the thing that maes them really good is that Fabolous doesn't seem to be fighting the music, he just flows perfectly with it. His voice is one that can be put to any beat and it still sounds good. Below is my track rating (1-5) Click & Spark: 4 Keepin It Gangsta: 4.5 Young'n: 5 Get Right: 4 Ride For This: 5++ One Day: 5 Trade It All: 4.5 Right Now & Later on: 3.5 Take You Home: 4 Get Smart: 5++ Can't Deny It: 5 Ma Be Easy: 4 We Don't Give A: 3.5 The Bad Guy: 4 Also included on this CD are 3 bonus tracks (one of which is 15 seconds of silence), the music video to Can't Deny It & Enhanced CD software.
