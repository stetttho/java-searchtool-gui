 I have never really been a JD fan, but I decided to give him another chance when I got this CD. And I still understand why I didn't like him from the beginning. His flow is too commercial for my liking and his verses are focused on materialistic things. One up side to the album, however is the beats. They are some really good beats, but too bad they are wasted on this trashy album. JD should stay away from rapping and stick to producing. There are only two really good songs on the album, Welcome To Atlanta & Hate Blood. And neither of these songs are good because of Dupri.  There are some really good people featured on the album, and that makes the CD twice as dissappointing. JD - you need to improve your rapping or just give up altogether.
