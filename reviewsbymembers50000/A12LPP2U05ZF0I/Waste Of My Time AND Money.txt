 I can't believe that a band that produced one of my favorite songs of 2001 (Blurry) could put together such a sh!tty album. I mean by the time most people decided to buy the album, they were already sick of "Control". "Blurry" and "Said" are the best songs on the album. Honestly, this album isn't worth the money put in to buy it. You're better off downloading the two singles and forgetting that this album even exists.
