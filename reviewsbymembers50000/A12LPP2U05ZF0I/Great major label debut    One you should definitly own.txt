 The subject matter on his songs are often times ludicrous and sometimes even disturbing...Every TRUE rap fan that I've spoken to about Eminem thinks he's one of the best lyricists to come along since Biggie was taken from us. When it comes down to deep content, Eminem can't come close to 2Pac, but I think that Eminem is still the better rhymer as far as lyrics go. This was his first major release and after it hit shelves, he blew up like a chain smoker in an oil refinery. Some saw the skills, some said he wouldn't last, and the others just didn't care enough to have an opinion. But after the Marshall Mathers LP was released, the word "controversy" became an understatement for this guy. Everyone had to hear what the big deal was, and because he recieved so much publicity, uptight yuppies and die hard rock fans handed his heart to him on a silver platter. But did it stop him from becoming a musical icon? Nope. The mere fact that you are reading this review solidifies that. I think Eminem has become better with each album he does as far as rhymes go (the Eminem Show will blow your mind), but this is still his best album. This was before the controversy, when he was just another underground rapper hungry for his 15 minutes. Dre saw the talent, produced a few songs on the album and BOOM. The rest is history. The best songs are Rock Bottom, Guilty Conscience, '97 Bonnie & Clyde, Brain Damage, If I Had and the best and most hilarious As The World turns.
