 Nothing but great things about this album. All of the songs I love, and continue to listen to. I mean, if this tells you anything, I even listen to the intro. I can't believe how perfect this album is. Slipknot changes the sound to every song, therfore it isn't easy to get sick of. My favorite tracks include (Sic), Wait & Bleed, Surfacing, No Life, Liberate and Spit It Out. Slipknot is one of the premier bands out there. All albums are great, and if you get the chance to see em live, don't miss out. (Also, if possible, backstage passes are worth it. The guys are mad cool, especially Corey & Shawn!)
