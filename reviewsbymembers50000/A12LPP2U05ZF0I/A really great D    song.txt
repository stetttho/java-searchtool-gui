 Fight Music is one of my favorite songs from 2001. I have actually fought after listening to it. This song can pump anyone up if you really focus on the lyrics. It helped me get pumped for basketball games also. But Fight Music is a song that can't be hated. Everyone rips it in the song, especially Eminem. Also included is the music video, a freestyle & Words Are Weapons (a song featured on Funk Flex's Mixtape [vol. 4]) Fight Music & the freestyle almost force me to give this single high marks.
