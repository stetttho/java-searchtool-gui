 I love Cormega's music, always have and always will. I've always been a big Nas fan also, and Cormega seems to want to settle the beef. In "Love In Love Out", a song directed towards Nas, isn't really a diss at all. It kinda explain why their beef began in the first place. Corey makes it seem like Nas didn't like him anymore. Like Nas just woke up wit hate for him, but I don't know. This song is one of my favorites on the CD.  On this CD, Cormega keeps it real for the streets yet again. Every track, excpet for Love In Love Out, talks about the streets. It's all about his status in the streets or street themes. Keepin it real, but short CD's are more commercial than anything else. And that's the ONLY downside to this album. In my opinion, you're better off downloadin it.
