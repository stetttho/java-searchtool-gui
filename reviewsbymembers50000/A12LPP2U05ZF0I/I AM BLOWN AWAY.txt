 This movie wasn't really even that well known when released into theaters. Blow was out of the limelight of Traffic, another drug movie which happens to be horrible.  Blow's script is much more realistic, something that cn be related to. It's all about a drug dealer's journey to wealth through the game. But I must say that this is one of the best, most interesting movies out there now. If you do any type of drug, you will be guaranteed to like this movie. If you don't, then you must be high!
