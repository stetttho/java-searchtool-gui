 This was my first freestyle CD and I am a newfan of this genre. I had never heard of Lil Suzy in my life until my friend brought the CD over. Then I listened, and immediatly asked him to borrow it. All of the freestyles have to do with love somehow, but I still think that this would be worth the buy for most people. I honestly don't know if all freestyle CD's are as good as this, but I WILL check some other ones out. Below is my track Rating (1-5): 01 - 5 02 - 3.5 03 - 4.5 04 - 5 05 - 4 06 - 3 07 - 4 08 - 4 09 - 5 10 - 4 11 - 4.5 12 - 4 13 - 4.5 14 - 4.5 15 - 3 16 - 4.5 17 - 4 18 - 3.5 19 - 5
