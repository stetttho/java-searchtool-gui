 This game is definitly one of the best RPG's to have ever been released for any system. This is a difficult game that you could honestly play all day and not get sick of it, but you will get frustrated at certain points.  This game has great graphics. The demons look realistic and the weapons can actually be told apart from each other, unlike older games. But then again, it could just be the PS2. This is one game that you wouldn't make you stupid if you constantly played it. You actually must think in order to play it.  There are many challenging areas to the game. Whether it's lighting candles to open a door, or using strategy to pull levers to raise jail-like bars, or even trying to beat a clock and put two crests together to save your partner.  Overall, this is a must buy for almost any owner of a PS2. You will NOT be sorry, believe me.
