 When I first listened to this CD, I was completely amazed. I bought this CD ... and it began as one of the best CD's I own. The begining of the album is one of the best in the business, the ending...well, that's the weakness. When I first heard the emotional song, "My Letter", I was amazed by the skill of this band. Although they sound nothing like Tool, I believe that their capabilities match the great band. Flaw is a band driven on pure anger, hurt and lonesome.  Almost the whole CD consists of the band basing a song on one of those 3 themes. If you are one of those people who must check a CD out before you buy it, start with "My Letter", "Payback" and "Whole" Those are, in my opinion, the best songs to be found here. Flaw is a great band with great ability. I believe that they sound like Darwin's Waiting Room (when DWR is singing, not rapping) or maybe even a more mellow KoRn (from their self-titled album). But no matter what, do not skip over this album, pick it up if you have a chance.
