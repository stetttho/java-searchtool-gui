 I watched this movie twice, once when I was high. For a movie that is supposed to be hilarious, I didn't find it that funny either time. My friends and I had to stop it halfway through each time because we were completely bored, although I found "Whatatah" somewhat funny. Other than that, this was one of THE dumbest movies out there to be watched. Stay away from this movie!
