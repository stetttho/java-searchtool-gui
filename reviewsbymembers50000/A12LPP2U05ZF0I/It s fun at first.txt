 This is the kinda game that you play at a friends house, but the kind you buy to play by yourself. The graphics and sound, however, are great on this game. You can hear your pit telling you when someone's trying to pass you, you can leave nice skid marks, do donuts in the grass, etc. I truly believe that EA Sports put out a great game here, but it's a little too easy to get bored with. That's the ONLY problem.  For all of you crash-fiends: You can crash nicely in this game and you can cause mischief for all. You could easily knock the person in 1st place, but it willl cost you too. Overall, a decent game. But you should rent it or borrow it or play it at a friends or something.
