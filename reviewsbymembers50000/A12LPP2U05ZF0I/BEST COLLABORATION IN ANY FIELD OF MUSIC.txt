 This CD is a great one. Two of my favorite DJ's producing one CD together? Bad Boy Bill is my favorite DJ of all time, no if's and's or but's. I can't it took me this long to get this album because it is probably my favorite that I own, other than Bangin The Box Vol 5. House Connection Vol. 1 was great also, but I would prefer this one over the first. I am a huge fan of hardcore techno, and this CD still remains in my CD player. One sentence can sum the greatness of this album. If you don't like this CD, you are not a true house fan.
