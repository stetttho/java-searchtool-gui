 SOiL isn't the greatest thing to be discovered, but their song "Halo" is. The rest of their CD is ok, the first two songs are probably the best. Their only chance to make it big would have to be "Halo". Their CD is solid, but doesn't get you excited like other bands, such as Darwin's Waiting Room, Flaw, Factory 81, etc. SOiL tries to sound a little different in certain songs, such as my own. The vocals sound computerized somewhat, but the chorus is loud. Their music itself is very good, but Ryan's voice doesn't blend well with some of their songs. The following is a track rating (1-5): Breaking Me Down: 5 Halo: 5++ Need To Feel: 4 Wide open: 3.5 (It grows on you toward the end) Understanding Me: 3 My Own: 4 Unreal: 3 Inside: 2.5 (The lyrics are good, but the voice is annoying.)  Two Skins: 3.5 The One: 5 (Sounds like a Creed kind of song) New Faith: 3 Why: 2 Black 7: 4.5
