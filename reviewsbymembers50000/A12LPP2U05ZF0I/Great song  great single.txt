 This song is one of my all-time favorite Jay-Z songs. And it's probably one of the best on The Blueprint. It's a pretty sad song, but its deep. It can hit home for some people. I can sit here and listen to this all day long. Below is my track rating (1-5): 1. LP Version - 5 2. Radio Edit - 5 3. Unplugged Version - 5 4. Music Video - 4.5
