 This is a pretty decent song actually. I wasn't too sure at first because I couldn't picture 3LW with Naughty By Nature. It turns out that 3LW's hook saves the song, just because the verses aren't as good as they used to be. It's kinda like a party type of song, and its pretty good. Make sure you check it out.
