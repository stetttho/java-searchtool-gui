 Many people have reccomended this CD to me, so I decided to check it out. I listened to the first few track in their entirety, and soon found myself skipping the second half of songs. I must admit that "Great Expectations" and "Lausd" are great songs, but I don't like the other 13 whatsoever. If you like Jurrassic 5, then you might like the album. But if you like the underground rap (where Jurrassic 5 originated) you will easily despise this album.
