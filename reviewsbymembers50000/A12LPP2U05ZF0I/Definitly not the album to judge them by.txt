 This is probably the worst Chemical Brothers album yet. I don't know what happened here but I wouldn't give up on them yet. The songs that are good are really good, and the ones that are bad, are pretty bad. There are only 2-3 songs that fall in between. Here is my track rating (1-5): #1: 4 #2: 5 #3: 1 #4: 3 #5: 2.5 #6: 4 #7: 2 #8: 5 #9: 3.5 #10: 1
