 I'm not gonna front and say Ja hasn't sold out since his debut, Venni Vetti Vecci. Yet, I still like all of his albums, and almost all of his songs. Pain Is Love is no different, a solid album throughout. I don't mind that Ja is selling out, although I don't really like commercial artists. He still is somewhat keepin it gangsta. Whatever he releases as his single are the sellout songs, but he's a true thug on the unreleased tracks.  This album is really good, but I believe that his previous two were better. The beats and lyrics were good on his last two LP's. If you are a true Ja fan, you won't mind that he is actually SINGING now (Rainy Days). You also won't mind that he is collaboratin wit J. Lo too much...
