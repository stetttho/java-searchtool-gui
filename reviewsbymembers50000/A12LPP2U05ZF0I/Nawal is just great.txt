 Although I am of Middle Eastern nationalities, I do not understand Arabic. However, I love Arabic music. Nawal is my favorite singer because she is gorgeous and you can ALWAYS count on her to produce solid efforts in her songs. I love this CD from track 1 to 9, except for #4. I can't stand that song, it just annoys me for no apparent reason I guess. But if you like this CD by Nawal make sure to check out "Malom", my favorite album by this gorgeous superstar.
