 This album has it all...the regular Eminem ...talkin disses, Eminem singin, Dr Dre, D-12 and great lyrics. Ever since I have had this CD, it hasn't stoped playing. I personally think that this album is better than his previous 2 solo LP's, the D-12 album and his underground albums also. Below is my track rating (1-5): Curtains Up (Skit): 1 (very short intro) White America: 5 (expresses Eminem's surprise because of how people feel the same as he does) Business: 5 (Great song) Cleanin Out My Closet: 4 Square Dance: 4.5 The Kiss (Skit): 2 Soldier: 5 Say Goodbye To Hollywood: 4.5 Drips: 4 Without Me: 5 (the single, great, like his others) Paul Rosenberg (Skit): 1 Sing For The Moment: 5 Superman: 5 Hailie's Song: 5++ (EMINEM SINGS!) Steve Berman (Skit): 1 When The Music Stops: 5 Say What You Say: 5 Till I Collapse: 5 My Dad's Gone Crazy: 5++ (features Hailie) Curtains Close (Skit): 1
