 Hybrid Theory is the greatest album ever released, and in my opinion even better than Nirvana's Nevermind. I would rate all songs a 5, except for #11 (all sampling by the DJ). I would give this track a 4. My friend hates rock altogether, but he loves the rapcore flow of this album. I have bought this CD on two occassions. (I lost it once LOL) This album is perfect for a person who has lots of drama in their life, cuz they can relate to the lyrics. Let me tell ya, I can understand where LP is coming from. My favorite tracks are Crawling, Pushing Me Away and With You. This CD only leaves my CD player when I am taking it somewhere else to play, wheter its a discman, a friend's house or the car. I can't leave home without this CD, except for whe I got basketball. LOL But I just hope that no one forgets to pick up this CD. What other album would be ranked #2 on the charts after it's been released for 60+ weeks?!
