 Sometimes it's hard to be impartial when reviewing a band/group/artist you really like. That is the case at hand, but I must admit that this is by far the weakest album by Wu-Tang. I couldn't wait to buy this as soon as it came out, but I heard the complete album before its release and wasnt too happy. Wu-Tang is known for their unique, dark beats, but this album is commercialized as far as beats go. Don't get me wrong though, the lyrics are tight, typical Wu style. The two people that make this album good, Method Man and Inspectah Deck. A suprise in this album is the improvement of the not-so-good Cappadonna. Ghostface is Ghostface, bringing the random, yet hot verses to this cut. U-God & Raekwon have seemed to decline lyrically over the past few years, but still do a decent job on the Iron Flag.  RZA & GZA both remain solid, and RZA has even improved lyrically. RZA's best work is still on Wu-Tang Forever. Masta Killa isn't on the album that often, which really isn't a good thing because he could have displayed his improvement. (For an example of this, check out Mortal Kombat by Afu-ra.) Below is the track rating (1-5): In The Hood: 5 Rules: 5+ Chrome Wheels: 3 Soul Power: 1 ( The beat is so annoying) Uzi: 4 One Of These Days: 3.5 Y'all Been Warned: 5 Babies: 3 Radioactive: 3.5 Back In The Game: 4.5 Iron Flag: 2 (40 seconds of sampling) Dashing: 4.5
