 This is by far my favorite Nas album to date. Yeah, Illmatic is certified as a "classic" and I believe it is too. and It Was Written is definitly one of the best follow-up albums in all of hip-hop. But I think that Stillmatic outshines the 4 previous solo cuts by Nasty Nas.  This CD was mainly produced as a diss album in response to Jay-Z's Blueprint. As you may recall, Jay-Z (or in Nas's words, Gay-Z) dissed Mobb Deep and Nas in "Takeover". However, "Ether" is Nas's response, and it is a much better song and really left Jay-Z speechless. (You would know this if you heard "Superugly".) Jay-Z isn't Nas's only target. Cormega is another main focus of one of the greatest lyricists/poets of all-time. In "Destroy & Rebuild", Nas talks about how he needs to get tha weak cats out of QB. He names Prodigy, Cormega & Nature in this song. Prodigy has no beef wit Nas, but Nature and Cormega have responded. Stillmatic is a hot album altogether. The other tracks have nothing to do with disses, but that makes this album more diverse.  You probably have heard two of the better songs Got Ur Self A... & One Mic. One Mic is one of the best songs ever made, explaining how Nas needs one mic to survive. This can be appreciated by true hip-hop heads. You know Nas ain't in this for the money. Rewind is a hot song with a new style. Nas literally "spits a story backwards, it starts at the ending." I have never heard a song like this one in my lifetime. The Flyest is a classic Nas & AZ collabo. It's probably my favorite track on the album. Braveheart Party is a party/club song that I personally like, but many dont. Here is my track rating (1-5): 1. Stillmatic (The Intro) - 3 2. Ether - 5++ 3. Got Ur Self A... - 5++ 4. Smokin' - 5 5. You're Da Man - 4 6. Rewind - 5++ 7. One Mic - 5++ 8. 2nd Childhood - 4.5 9. Destroy & Rebuild - 5  10. The Flyest - 5++ 11. Rule - 5 12. My Country - 5+ 13. What Goes Around - 4.5 14. Every Ghetto  - 4.5
