 ...P>This is a pretty hard CD for the most part, but a few songs (such as Innosense) are slower, but they are still good. They usually have a unique sound, but on "Sometimes it Happens Like This" the vocalist sounds like Fred Durst from Three Dollar Bill Y'all (aka from when he was really good). I like all of the songs, some more than others. You must listen to a song completely to really enjoy it. You can't listen to the 30 second sample that Amazon provides. I didn't think I was going to like quite a few songs on here until I listened to it in entirety. Since then, I haven't shut the CD off. "Feel So Stupid" is probably the best-known song off the album, but I don't believe that it is the best on here. I like quite a few more songs better than that one. If I were to reccomend a few songs, I would reccomend Another Way, Spent, Sometimes It Happens Like This and Innosense. Those in my opinion are the best to be found on the album.  But you MUST make sure you check this band out. If you don't you are missing a great band. They sound like Limp Bizkit (from their 1st CD), a softer Slipknot, Flaw (sort of) and Ill Nino. Here is a track review: Feel So Stupid: 4 Live For the Moment: 4.5 Sometimes It Happens Like This: 4.5 In To The Dark: 4 Another Way: 5+++ Spent: 5+++ DIYM: 2 Realize: 4 Innosense: 5+++ Transparent: 4.5 All I Have Is Me: 4 There is one down side to the album: It's only 41 minutes long. I wish it was longer.
