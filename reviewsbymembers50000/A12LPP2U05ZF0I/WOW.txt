 This CD is a regualr Tool CD. An album that makes you think, a sound party. Their music is probably some of the most technologically advanced in all fields of music. I mean you even have to think to get to the CD itself. But once you put that in your stereo and press play, my God you will be blown away.  This was my first Tool CD (and won't be the last) and I am completely blown away by this band. I have heard of them for a quite awhile, but first heard their music on MTV2 when they played Schism. That track is my personal favorite, but all others are good. Even the little intermissions between the 7-8 minute songs on Lateralus. They can get hard at times, but I believe that they are better when they are hard and break songs down. In these types of songs, they are part acoustic, and part metal. But don't sleep on this album, or any of theirs for that matter!
