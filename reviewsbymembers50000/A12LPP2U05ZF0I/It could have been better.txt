 Who ever decided to put certain tracks on this album did a good job, considering almost every Jigga classic is on this one CD. I just don't understand how they could leave out Jay-Z's collabo with his mentor Biggie on "Brooklyn's Finest". That is probably the best Jay-Z songs ever.  Also, another downside to the album is that almost half the songs are the radio-edit version. I'm sorry but edited tracks do not belong on a greatest hits compilation.  If you may have noticed, a lot of the songs are from Vol. 2...Hard Knock Life. That isn't necessarily a bad thing though. That is probably my 2nd favorite Jay-Z LP (behind Reasonable Doubt) If you ask me, you're better off leaving this one on the shelves, cuz it realy isn't worth the buy.
