 Let me get started by telling you why this CD ranks in the top 5 of my collection. Almost every song can be related to except for a few. Also, Adema has their own style, except for when Mark disguises his voice so it sounds like Jon Davis from Korn. But if you are going to download songs to see what this band's all about, get "Giving In", "Skin", "Speculum" or "Close Friends" first. My Track Ratings (1-5): Everyone: 5 Blow It Away: 5 Giving In: 4  Freaking Out: 4 The Way You Like It: 5 Close Friends: 5 Do What You Want To Do: 3 Skin: 5 Pain Inside: 4 Speculum: 5 Drowning: 2 Trust: 3
