 I am a newcomer to tha trnce scene, and I was on [line] trying to see what CD's were reccomended. This was the most common album found on any Listmania list or Guide. It also was rated very highly by reviewers. So I figured that ALL of these people couldn't be wrong. So I went out and got the CD and havent stopped listening to it since! Let me tell you this, I don't know much about Paul Oakenfold but I'll say that I will continue to support him as much as I can. I got Tranceport last week, and I have gone out and gotten two other CD's already. I'm an unemployed 16 year old on a limited budget, and me spending this much money on CD's in one week is rare. But I do not regret my decision yet. And I doubt that I will.
