 From beginning to end, this album just gets better and better. I really enjoy tracks 8-12 the most. That is when the CD really picks up, although the first 7 are solid songs too. A couple tracks can be found on Paul Oakenfold albums, such as El Nino (#2). Kimball does a great job mixing it up on this CD, and the flow changesa few times. This was my first trance album, and soon after I bought the equally impressive Tranceport by Oakenfold. I would rate both of these equally, but this album would be reccomended to just about anyone. Believe me, you won't be sorry!
