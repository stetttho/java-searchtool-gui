 Dr. Robert F. Mager may be the master of understatement.  When you read his precise recipe for creating successful instruction, you are left with the realization that your life could have been much simpler had you  encountered this wisdom earlier in your existence.  Dr. Mager is not  recounting some brand new theory or blinding discovery.  He is  communicating a logical and systematic process for defining what  instruction can do.  In the process, he helps you determine if instruction  is the solution for your performance problem.  He shows you how to set  goals, identify task objectives and task sequences, identify the skills and  characteristics of the persons you are teaching, and develop and refine  your instruction into an effective change agent.
