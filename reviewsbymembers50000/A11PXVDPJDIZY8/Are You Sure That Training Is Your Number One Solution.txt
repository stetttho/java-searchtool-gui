 Before you begin your discussion of performance problems by talking about training, you need to read this common sense book by Robert F. Mager and Peter Pipe.  Following a systematic algorithm, you will learn to identify  your performance problem, decide how critical the problem is, and identify  the underlying reasons for the existence of your problem.  Problems can be  a result of invisible expectations (you didn't tell me how) or what the  book calls "upside-down consequences" (doing it right is not as rewarding  as doing it wrong).   Using many common sense examples, this book  demonstrates that solutions other than training can solve your performance  problems.  In fact, you will discover that training may be a useless  solution that will not solve your problem.  Until you take apart the  expected performance, look at the component parts, and identify why the  performer chooses the wrong action, you cannot correct the performance  deficiency.   Training as a possible solution does not appear until the  middle of the book.  Training is needed because a person has never  performed as required and does not know how to perform as required.   Training can also help when skills have decayed over time and training is  needed to refresh them.   When you look at human performance, you need to  remember that people will usually follow the path of least resistance.   They do not choose wrong performance because they want to be wrong.  They  choose the wrong performance because it is the best solution for them.   Mager and Pipe uncover why people make these choices and offer you a way to  achieve the correct performance you seek.
