 There is nothing that is more devastating to good instruction than a failure to achieve the performance you expected from your learner.  No matter how carefully you craft an objective or present the material to  support the instruction to meet that objective, there is no guarantee that  the learner has mastered the objective unless you accurately measure the  learner performance.  Mager opens the book with his famous unicycle  example.  If someone has an objective to learn to ride a unicycle a set  distance without falling, you should not test the learner on their ability  to identify the parts of a unicycle.  It is especially important in this  age of technology-based instruction (TBT) that you carefully consider how  you are testing the objectives stated in your instruction.  Most computers  cannot simulate riding a unicycle so you may be tempted to ask questions  about the parts or the history of the unicycle.   In this programmed text,  Mager will help you refine your design skills so that you always know  whether your test item is actually measuring your objective.  Dr. Mager  uses a programmed text approach, so there will be pages for everyone to  read and pages that offer additional practice and assessment to help you  master the skills taught.  The real reason to adopt the skills Mager  presents is not so you can be a better designer, it is to make sure that  you are dealing fairly with the learner.  Learners do not trust instruction  that promises one thing and delivers another.  Successful completion of  this book, will better equip you to design and measure valid and successful  instruction every time.
