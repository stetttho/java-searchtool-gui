 Reading this work on the creation of effective learning is really a journey back in time to the classroom we all experienced.  Dr. Mager has uncovered and openly displayed every bad practice, subversive method, and  counterproductive initiative that teachers have inflicted on learners.  In  doing so, he is reminding us all that teaching has an impact on learners.   Dr. Mager states, " Unless students are changed in some way by the  instruction, the instruction cannot be regarded as successful." Dr. Mager  is pointing out that the initial purpose of instruction is to teach  students.  He demonstrates that many of the practices found in teaching are  used to control students and to manage classrooms rather than to positively  change behaviors and interest learners.  The influence teaching has on  behavior can be positive or negative, and the actions of the instructor  and/or the instruction determine which result occurs.  His book is another  common sense visit to the fundamental issues of instruction and a  refreshing reminder that it is not necessary to be fancy in order to be  successful.
