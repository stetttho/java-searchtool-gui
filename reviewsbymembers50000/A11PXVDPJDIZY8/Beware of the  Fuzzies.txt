 A journey of a thousand mile begins with a single step.  Certainly this is true.  However, a journey can only have length when you know where you are going and when you have arrived.  Setting goals is the subject addressed by  Dr. Mager in this book.  In fact, the book is about setting attainable  goals.  People can make lofty statements that sound very much like goals -  statements that impress but are often impossible to measure.  Instruction  may be one of several areas to consider when trying to achieve a measurable  goal.  Dr. Mager provides a prescription for identifying measurable goals  and considering all the factors that influence the attainment of a goal.   He also provides a set of strategies for finalizing attainable goals.  If  you suffer from the "fuzzies" and are unsure if your training is achieving  results, this is the book to guide you to valid and effective goal-oriented  solutions.
