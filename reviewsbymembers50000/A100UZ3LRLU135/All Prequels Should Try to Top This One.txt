 I generally think movies are far too overpriced so I generally wait for DVD, but I'm glad I didn't wait on this one.  This film is what the "Batman" series has been waiting for: a good solid foundation on which all of the crazies and the politics are based.  I've never really truly understood the plight of Bruce Wayne. Poor rich baby.  However, this film not only goes way back to show exactly what happened with his parents, but also chooses not to neglect the road he had to travel to become the caped crusader.  I thought the screenplay, the script, was excellent because it told the story as a novel would, fleshing out necessary characters and giving the audience their motivation as well.  I thought it was great to see where Comissioner Gordon started out and how Gotham became the center of all corruption.  I thought the movie did two things really well: get to the heart of the problem in Gotham through the hero/villain that Liam Neeson played with such expertise (he was trained well in Star Wars) AND cast Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne.  Finally a guy who can pull off the drama and the action and still maintain a somewhat "upper crust" feel that is so necessary to this character.  If the casting in this movie(minus Katie Holmes who was enthusiastically average as the do-gooder-slash-supposed-love-interest) had been present throughout all of the sadly misguided versions of Batman movies over the years, the sum would be classic.  As it is, they do make up for the horror of Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone as Robin and Batgirl.  And that's bringing us back a long, long way.  Kudos on this one.  I'm definitely buying it on DVD.
