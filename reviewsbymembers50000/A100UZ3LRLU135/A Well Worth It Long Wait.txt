 I make no pretenses about the fact that I love this series from beginning to end. I have loved watching Harry and his mates grow, learn, change, and become real people learning hard life lessons.  Having said that, this sixth installment is by far the most complex, dark, and real of all.  For me, it would have been hard to top the 4th book which has remained my favorite up until now.  However, this one is so much more emotionally vibrant without being over-stated that I applaud Rowling for her growing capacity to weave a wonderful story through characters who have been molded and crafted over time.  These are not just the "fun adventures of little kids dabbling in magic" anymore.  With the reappearance of Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters as a real force, not just a remembered one, Harry's destiny becomes much clearer; the reader is left to realize how dark this tale could end up.  I finished feeling a little scared for every non-Muggle in Harry's world and I loved that.  I liked everything about this book.  The others have been ultimately focused on the action in which the characters partake.  This, however, was much more about the emotion, which I think is the next dimension to understanding the greatest villain ever written.  This shift goes right along with the way Voldemort works: he scares people.  Sometimes he has to do it through action, but mostly it's just the thought of him that induces fear.  That is subtle and this entire books revolves around that subtlety. We learn his history as Harry does; the battle now becomes three-dimensional as intellect must be paired with the bravery that Harry has so embodied up to this point.  I can't wait for the last in this series, but honestly, I'm glad it will take awhile.  I need some time to recover...and, of course, to re-read.
