 As an true and devoted mystery novel addict, I have had a growing annoyance with recent books in this genre; many have become predictable, boring, uninventive and sometimes just crass.  Kate Atkinson has renewed my faith in the belief that a good mystery can be considered true literature as well as a real mental exercise.  I was especially impressed by two elements in this novel.  The first is simply the believability of her characters as full and faily regular people, most of whom carry emotional baggage not totally unlike the normal person.  All characters appear to be returning from a trauma that has changed them and, in the short journey the reader takes with each one, they share a journey to realize who they are apart from their residual grief.  The second source of ingenuity is Atkinson's gift for weaving a complex and compelling plot.  The action of this story is vibrant and insists the reader tackle just one more page to see what's around this next bend.  The grip of this story is immediate and intense enough to ensure that just the experience of reading becomes an active exercise of mind and heart rather than a passive, and sometimes frantic, turning of pages to get to the moment of revelation.  The shape of the plot causes you to begin to care for all the characters whether or not you like them.  All I know about myself is that I enjoy a great story.  Atkinson's latest made me savor every page, especially once I realized how special and rare this work is.  Just after I finished the last word I decided it wouldn't be a bad idea to flip to the first page and start over again.
