 When I opened the cover of this book which I read for my bookclub, I was nervous.  Not only was there a map of Northern Italy, but there was a list of several pages of characters whose names seemed vaguely similar.  I thought, "Oh, here we go. I never like when I need roadmaps to read a story..." Yet immediately I was plunged into a tale so tragic but joyful, complex and yet simple at the same time, I was hooked.  This is not what I would consider an easy read. I spent a good deal of time going back to read a page again because the pace of the novel is, at times, feverish.  But I am always a fan of the novel as an experience and this book gave that to me.  I emotionally reacted to the characters, at times I felt as out of breath as they were, sometimes I was confused.  But in the end, I grew to love them as people.  To me this is a testament to the fullness of their portraits drawn by a skillful, if at times ambitious, writer.  In the middle of reading this novel I had the pleasure of meeting Mary Doria Russell, so perhaps this skews my review positively, but that doesn't make me change it.  Based on my experience with her earlier work, this one makes me a full member of her fan club. MDR comes into her own through these clever people who knew such pain and terror but also love and life.  Usually, I base my rating of a book on whether I would actually sit down and read the entire thing a second time.  With this one, I emphatically would.  MDR deserves all the praises she gets for this intricately-woven story.
