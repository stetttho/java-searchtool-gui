 I'll admit that I am strictly an amateur philosopher and a sucker for anything related to the Harry Potter series and this book did not disappoint either of these sensibilities.  As a collection of essays using the Harry Potter characters and settings to illustrate classical themes and concepts in philosophy, this book makes every reader an intellectual. I especially like that the authors don't assume the reader is in kindergarten or has never heard of Aristotle or Plato before.  I thought every chapter was thorough but understandable to the lay person.  I walked away knowing a lot more about philosophy but also appreciating the depth and care of the Harry Potter series as well.  I wouldn't recommend this to a non-"Potter fan" as it would be annoying.  My one beef: there are some of the corniest references to Potter that could ever be written on a page.  I almost got the feeling, at some points, that these philosophy professionals were so excited people cared, they went over-board and tried a little too hard.  All in all, an excellent read.  One of the reviews on the cover said that this book made philosophy and intellectual discussion a daily dinner event.  I am happy to report I couldn't agree more.
