 I am a veteran of all types of workout videos and this one is by far my favorite.  Pilates itself is a challenging and worthwhile workout that also, when done correctly, can help relax and soothe as well as strenghten.  This workout is not complicated because Caban makes it easy and fun, but the moves are challenging.  I never feel cheated or clueless and, for a video instructor, Caban does a great job of teaching and motivating as well as demonstrating the moves.  Using this workout, it is possible to feel better immediately.
