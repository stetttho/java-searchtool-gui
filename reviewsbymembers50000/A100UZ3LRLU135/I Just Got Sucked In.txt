 This game is amazing!  I love CSI on TV, so when my brother handed me this game, I was pumped.  Soon, I realized the problem was going to be walking away from it.  As far as the story and scripts go, I felt like I was working in the lab along with the team.  I especially like the attitude the characters give you if you're headed in the wrong direction.  I also was completely surprised and pleased with the difficulty of some of the cases.  Though I did finish the entire game, I've still got to go back and re-solve one of them to get a higher rating.  I was most impressed with the crime lab tools available and the sense of reality the game has.  When I working with the microscope, it looks like I'm peering into a real microscope.  The only problem I had was that in 1 or 2 places, there was a slight hesitation or stall, but I have not had nearly the problems some other customers indicate.   Ultimately, I'm thanking and cursing my brother.  Thanking him because this is one of the greatest PC games I've played in awhile. Cursing him because now I'm hooked and eagerly awaiting the next installment!
