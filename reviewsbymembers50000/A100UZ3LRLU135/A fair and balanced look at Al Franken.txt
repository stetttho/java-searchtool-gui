 I don't consider myself to be the world's most enlightened political commentator or even partisan for that matter.  However, Franken's book was truly enjoyable from the first ad hominem insult hurled to the final quiz that leaves no reader behind.  I love the fact that he takes to task the people who are running the country and those who think they should be.  This is the literary equivalent of "pants-ing" George dub-ya, his cronies, and all his wannabes that enable him to lie and get away with it.  And I say good for Al!  Should it be read with a grain of salt?  SURE, every political commentary carries that warning, but should it be considered garbage because he brings to light the conservatives ugly dust-bunnies that have been shoved under the rug?  No.  The best thing about this book is that it forces the reader to ask, "Is this REALLY what's going on?"  It motivates the intelligent reader to become informed, to seek more information--which is what every voter in America should be doing anyway.  Congrats to Al and the members of Team Franken--you have made politics a dinner-table topic that's accessible to political apathetics like myself.  And you completely leveled Bill O'Reilly who has been asking for it ever since he hosted the highly acclaimed political juggernaut "Inside Edition."  Way to go Al!  I can't wait for the next installment.
