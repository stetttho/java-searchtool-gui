 I was excited to read this book, waited months reading reviews and gearing up for a real ride.  I was disappointed.  After finishing what was a seemingly endless story focusing on the four years of Midwestern Lee and prestigious and snotty Ault academy, I was not surprised this was Sittenfeld's first novel and I was shocked that the marketeers aligned it with Salinger's masterpiece.  I did quickly take to Lee's character and as a person who attended an all-girls school and is now a high school teacher, I could immediately see how dead-on the description of that first year was especially from the young woman's point of view.  My problem began when time started passing and Lee, so full of potential and possibility, became this static slug of a character, slogging through her life and not growing or learning much. In the beginning, I was led to believe that Lee went to Ault to change her life and realize things about herself she couldn't in her boring life in Indiana.  The last three years at Ault betrayed any of that hope.  In concept, the novel was good.  Teenage years are tumultuous, to the point that reality just does not seem real.  Because of that I thought there would be so many 3-dimensional characters, good and bad, to really make the fictional gauntlet of high school as interesting and heart-rending as it can be in reality.  This heroine, though, was boring and made me wish the book was about some of the other characters. Personally, I wanted to read more about Martha and that worried me a little.  Whenever secondary characters start stealing the heroine's thunder, there might be some problems brewing.  I started reading this really wanting to like it.  I ended up feeling that the best thing about it was the textured preppy belt cinching the cover.  High school is a colorful place to be. It's a shame I can only describe this novel as bland, flat, and prosaic.
