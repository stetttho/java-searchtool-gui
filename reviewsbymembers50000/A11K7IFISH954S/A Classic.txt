 The hardest thing about writing a review for this movie is figuring out where to start.  Say Anything...is one of my favorite movies, and one of the best overall films ever made.  Here we see John Cusack starring in another story that is entertaining on so many levels.  At times, Say Anything is funny, sad, serious, realistic, and bittersweet.  Cameron Crowe did an excellent job making the main characters believeable and interesting, making it very easy to get caught up in their emotions. This movie brings tears to my eyes every time I see it as it is extremely easy to relate to Cusack's character, especially if you have ever gone through anything similar to the events that transpire between Lloyd and Diane. Everyone always talks about the famous scene involving the Boom Box, but to me the most memorable part of this movie can be narrowed down to one line: "She Gave me a pen. I Gave her my heart and she gave me a pen". I recommend this movie to absolutely everyone, if you can't relate to it right now, you will someday.
