 Just looking at the song listing of this CD should be an indication of how good it is. First of all, the music has enough hooks to keep you interested until you learn the lyrics. Once you know what Jimmy Pop is saying though, you'll really start to see the genius that is The Bloodhound Gang. If you are offended, you really need to stop taking yourself, and your life way too seriously. The Bloodhounds don't take ANYTHING seriously, especially themselves, and thats what makes this album so good. The strange part is that Jimmy Pop actually has flow and the reason his lyrics are so amusing is because they are so clever.  Anyone who has a soft spot for the ...80's will really enjoy this album a lot.  I mean, how many albums can you name that mention Stryper, Crystal Pepsi (remember that horrible stuff?), Judas Priest, Hans Solo, and Emmanual Lewis in just the first 3 songs?  The music is an interesting blend of hard riff-rockers and obscure samples, a mix that matches the weird subject matters perfectly.  And can you go wrong with any album that has a guest appearance by Vanilla Ice? So buy this album and loosen up a bit.
