 Pearl Jam's consistency can be somewhat unnerving.  Despite expiremental  deluges in certain directions, they never seem to stray too far from a straightforward rock band lead by a bunch of talented, uncompromising songwriters.  Yield may possibly be the best example of PJ as a rock band, as the band covers so much "rock" ground that it is tough to pigenhole this album into any category.  Starting with the punky "Brain of J", Eddy Vedder shows that his voice is still ready to take on any challenges before easing into "Faithful", an emotional rocker that showcases Eddie's range both vocally and lyrically.  PJ then romps through "No Way" and "Given to Fly" effortlessly, despite the fact that both are melodic gems that should be featured on classic rock radio regularly.  "Wishlist" is the overplayed radio song on this album, but the lyrics are much deeper than they seem at first, and then the album kicks up the energy with the exciting concert favorite "Do the Evolution".  Yield winds down with the acoustic gem "Lowlight" and the classic anthem "In Hiding", more proof that PJ are truly the masters of modern rock.  Yield is the best example of all the areas Pearl Jam has covered.  The experiments with different types of music really mold well here and this is an album that will be listened to just as much now as it will 50 years from now. These guys just flat-out ROCK, and Yield is one of the best examples that proves just why.
