 I bought this album when it first came out and loved it from day one, but that was back when I was in high school.  The riffs are catchy and heavy, and Daniel Johns' voice is incredible, especially considering his age at the time it was recorded.  However, it took me a few years to really notice it, but the lyrics are extemely immature and cliched; not something that comes completely as a surprise when you take into account that this album was released at the height of Grunge's popularity.  The best example of that being the "I'm a depressed Gen-Xer" anthem "Suicidal Dream".  It is pretty easy to see that the record companies saw Silverchair as an "Another Bad Creation" of the Grunge scene.  But if you ignore that aspect of it, this is still a great album, filled with plenty of hooks and interesting melodies.  It may fall flat a few times ("Pure Massacre" and "Cicada" being the best examples of that), but the rest of the album is good enough to make it well worth your while.
