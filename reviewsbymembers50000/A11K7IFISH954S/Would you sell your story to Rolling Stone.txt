 The last installment in the "true" Floyd catalogue, The Final Cut works both as a grand finale of Pink Floyd's golden era, as well as a stepping stone for Roger Waters' solo career.  Just like The Pros & Cons of Hitchhiking, The Final Cut elaborates on some of the themes first presented in The Wall, in this case the death of Waters' father and its subsequent effect on his view of the world and his marraige.  The lyrics are extremely personal and often bitter, while the music, as usual, sets the perfect backdrop for the storyline.  In fact, David Gilmour's guitar work is so good, it tells just as much of the story as the lyrics do.  Like just about every Floyd album, The Final Cut has it maximum effect when heard start to finish, as each song is an important part of the overall theme.  If you enjoyed The Wall as a whole (as opposed to just liking some of the songs on it), The Final Cut will not dissapoint.
