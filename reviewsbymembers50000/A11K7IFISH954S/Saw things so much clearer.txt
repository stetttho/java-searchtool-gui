 I have to start off by saying that I am completely embarrased at how late I was at discovering Pearl Jam.  They kinda just passed under my radar throughout the 90's, and I am kicking myself for being so naive right now.  The reason I bring it up is that it was a single song on this album that changed my mind, and that is....of course, the incredible "Rearviewmirror".  RVM deserves a 5 star rating in and of itself.  Starting off with one of the coolest guitar riffs ever written, the song kicks into high gear with punky drums, and Eddie's incredible voice.  And its not just his singing, its the lyrics.  A liberating song about finally seeing the light and freeing yourself from an abusive (mentally/physically, it doesn't matter how you see it) relationship, there is something about the power in Eddie's words, as well as the conviction that he sings them with, that can be a complete catharsis.  And after a breakdown in the middle, almost as if the band is catching its breath, the grand finale "saw things so much clearer once you were in my rearviewmirror!!", all the ingredients for one of the greatest songs of the 90's if not ever.  As you read over the reviews of this album you will see that not too many people disagree with me. Thats not to overshadow the rest of the album though.  There are a good 6 or 7 other songs here that are radio staples, including "Dissident" (an anthemic song on the level of Springsteens "Born to Run"), and the introspective "Elderly Woman..."  It was almost as if PJ wanted to prove that Ten was no fluke, and the emotion and creativity just got out of hand (in a good way of course).  Hopefully you will take my advice and give this a shot, because this is the album that woke me up to how great this band is, and it should for you too.
