 With their third full length studio release, Pearl Jam continued their reign as the leaders of the modern rock (aka alternative) movement.  I think that all of Pearl Jam's albums are similar in their consistency and Vitalogy is no different.  What I mean is that all of thier albums are pretty similar in the sense that they can be broken down a bit like this: On average, each of their albums has around 14 tracks.  The results are usually as follows (with a few exceptions obviously): 4 Tracks = Instant classics.  In this case "Corduroy", "Nothingman", "Immortality", and "Betterman" 5 Tracks = Hidden Gems.  Here we have "Whipping", "Tremor Christ", "Satan's Bed", "Last Exit" and "Spin the Black Circle" 1 Track = The overplayed radio song. "Not For You" 4 Tracks = The experiments that missed the mark. "Bugs", "Pry, To", "Aye Davanita", & "Hey foxy..." Not a bad average overall.  Yes, there are some tracks here that will have you reaching for the skip button, but the rest easily make up for it.  PJ really hit their stride with Vs, and Vitalogy proved that they were here to stay.  Just another great album from a consistently great band. And to top it all off, they revive the somewhat lost art of the cool album sleeve.  CD's have caused album art to somewhat fall by the wayside, but in true classic rock form, Vitalogy's packaging & artwork are original, meaningful, & artsy.  These are the "little things" that seperate the good artists from the great ones, and this is where PJ started pulling away from the pack.
