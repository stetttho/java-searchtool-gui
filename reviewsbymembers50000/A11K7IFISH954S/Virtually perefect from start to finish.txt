 Although I had liked "The Bazaar" when it first came out in 1995, but for some reason I decided not to buy "The Edges of Twilight".  When "Temptation" came out 2 years later, I made sure I didn't make the same mistake twice and bought it immediately.  And as bad as it may sound, I count the purchasing of this album to be a major event in my life.  "Transmission" is what started my obsession with The Tea Party.  This album has everything a music fan could ask for;  Great songwriting, intelligent and emotional lyrics, stellar production, and a wide variety of sounds, a little bit for everybody.  First of all, "Psychopomp" alone is worth the price of this album.  In my opinion it is the most emotional song ever written, period.  The rest of the songs are just as good though, with the loud driving drums of "Temptation", "Army Ants", and "Gyroscope" perfectly mixing with the sombre melodies of "Alarum", "Release", "Aftermath", and "Emerald".  The title track shows all the eastern influences the band is so well known for, while "Babylon" is borderline techno.  If you haven't heard much by the Tea Party, this is the best place to start.
