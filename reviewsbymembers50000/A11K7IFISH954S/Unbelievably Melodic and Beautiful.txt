 It is really difficult to know where to start with my praise of this album.  After hearing Ours' promising debut "Distorted Lullabys", I knew that this band would be a force to be reckoned with for years to come, but never in my wildest dreams did I imagine them following up with something this good this quickly.  "Precious" is, quite simply, a masterpiece.  I am not the type of person who can listen to the same thing over and over again (I very rarely will even listen to the same album twice in a two day period), yet I find myself constantly reaching for this disc.  And even when I am not listening to the 12 incredible songs on this album, I find myself singing the tunes in my head.  There are so many catchy and interesting melodies here that the songs lodge themselves in your head for days.  Add to these melodies the hauntingly beautiful voice of Jimmy Gnecco, the tight instrumental interplay of the rest of the band, and the emotional, intelligent lyrics and what Ours has presented us with is pure genius.  To compare this album to any other out there right now, including "Distorted Lullabys", is just unfair to everyone else.  Ours has found something really special here, and I would reccommend this disc to absolutely everyone, regardless of taste.  And to think that this young band may not have even peaked yet is just plain exciting.  "Distorted Lullabys" was great, and this is at least twice as good.  If Ours continues to improve at this rate, us real music fans have finally found someone to save us from the uninspired drivel clogging up our radio dials.
