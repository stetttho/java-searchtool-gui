 Lets be honest, if you don't already own this CD you probably aren't a Skid Row fan and you are probably only interested because you want to add "18 and Life" and "I Remember You" to your collection (not that theres anything wrong with that).  However, what you probably don't know is that there is much more to this album than the songs that made it to radio.  Skid Row's self titled debut is a great collection of very catchy pop-metal tunes.  Skid sticks to a pretty short and simple verse, chorus, verse format and the melodies are so addicting that you'll find yourself singing along in no time.  This album does have the "typical" things that made the late 80's/early 90's hair metal so cheesy, but you have to understand that thats how debut albums by bands like Skid Row were produced.  Its the basic songwriting here that makes these songs great.  If you are able to look past the stereotypical hair-band stuff and just listen to the music, you will really be able to enjoy this album
