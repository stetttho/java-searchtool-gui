 Continuing in the experimental direction PJ started to travel with Vitalogy, No Code certainly takes a bit of getting used to.  There's nothing here as immediate as the straightforward rock of Ten or Vs, or even the strange but catchy stuff that Vitalogy had to offer (such as Betterman or Corduroy), but patience and continued listenings eventually reveal that this album rivals anything else PJ has done.  The band really expands their sonic palette here with a collection of songs that covers so much ground, first impressions of the album make it seem uneven and somewhat scattered.  However, as you learn the song structures (all of which are not your simple verse, chorus, verse format), not only do you realize how great they are, but the album gains a strange cohesiveness not apparent immediately.  Starting with the moody "Sometimes", then moving on to the hard rock of "Hail Hail", PJ tries a little bit of everything, and most of the time they pull it off successfully.  Different influences are shown throughout the album, from the world beat of "Who You Are" and "In My Tree", to the slow Neil Young-inspired raunch of "Smile"(where Jeff and Stone swap instruments), to the Lennon-esque "Off He Goes", to the punk scorchers "Habit" and "Lukin", to the bluesy "Red Mosquito"(great slide guitar solos by Mike).  Stone takes the mike on the appealingly strange rocker "Mankind" and the album ends with a beautiful lullaby "Around the Bend".  "Present Tense" and "I'm Open" miss the mark a bit, but certainly not enough to ruin the album.  The fact is, despite the genre-jumping, this still has that great Pearl Jam sound, its just been expanded.  These are some of PJ's best songs, and all catch even more fire when played live.  If you have this album and you don't "get it" yet, keep trying, its worth the effort.  And if you are just buying No Code now, be patient.  It takes some work, but this will become an album you can't live without.
