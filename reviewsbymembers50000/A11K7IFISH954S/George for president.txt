 First of all, I have one thing to say to all the people who have been offended by the material on You are All Diseased: Why are you listening to George Carlin in the first place?  George has always TRIED to offend people like you, the typical yuppie American sheep who will believe anything the media, government, and church tell you to.  If you don't like what he is saying, then cancel HBO and spend the rest of your time watching the Disney Channel and taking your kids to soccer practice.  George has never wanted or needed you to be part of his audience.  Carlin has always been a comic for people who like to think outside the box.  His entire career is based on counter-culture comedy and that is just what makes him such a genius.  Not only is this album side-splittingly funny, but George's ideas are so well thought out that you can't help but at least see his point of view, if not agree with him completely.  This album ranks right up there with Jammin' and Back in Town as his best material.  A hilarious, bitter old man venting his frustrations about society, just what us "thinking people" need in this culture of malls, political correctness, and soccer moms.
