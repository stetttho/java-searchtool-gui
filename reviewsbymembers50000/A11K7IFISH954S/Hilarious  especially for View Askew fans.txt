 I had been looking forward to this "New Jersey Trilogy" finale for a long time and I am happy to say that it was well worth the wait. Not only was this movie the funniest of all 5 of Smith's films, it was one of the funniest I have seen in a very long time. I'll be the first one to admit that (especially compared to its predecessors) the plot and main storyline are pretty thin, but it doesn't take long to realize that that is kinda the point. Its pretty obvious that after the first 4 films in the "trilogy", Smith finally had the freedom to do whatever he wanted when making this movie, and takes full advantage of it. Jason Mewes is at his best as the "in your face" Jay and his comments are made that much funnier when you are looking at Silent Bob's facial expressions & body language whenever Jay goes on one of his rants. I was a bit disappointed that Dante & Randall had such small parts, but at the same time, I can't imagine this movie being any funnier. And any movie with even a brief appearance by George Carlin is worth watching. George is the king of comedy, and his short part is one of the most hilarious parts of this movie.   One thing needs to be understood by people interested in this film (and really all of Smith's films).  Kevin Smith makes his movies for the movie fan, because that is what he is.  If you aren't the type of person who can watch the same flick over and over again, recite your favorite quotes, remember actors & actresses; there is a lot in this film (and other Smith films) that will go right over your head.  As one reviewer put it, Smith writes his dialogue in a way that lets us movie buffs feel like we are "in the know", and this is usually alienating for the viewer who could care less about any of that stuff.  So if you are wondering why the customer reviews for this movie tend to be extreme (a lot of 5 & 1 star ratings), there is your answer.
