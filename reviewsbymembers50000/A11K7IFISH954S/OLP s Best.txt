 After two cracks at developing their own sound, Our Lady Peace finally found its niche with "Happiness...".  If you listen to "Naveed" and "Clumsy", you can really hear the band gradually shaping itself into the OLP you hear here.  The melodies are infectious, the musicianship is incredible, and OLP's sound is finally one that is all its own.  Raine's ability to use his voice as an extra instrument was finally perfected for this album, and after a few listens you really start to get frustrated that you can't hit the same notes as him to sing along.  That is how catchy all of these songs are.  Jeremy Taggart's drumming is excellent as usual, but he uses it to better effect here than on any other OLP album.  Every song is excellent here and this album deserved a lot more credit from both the critics and the masses than it has gotten.  Those unfamiliar to the band should check out this disc first.  I guarantee that after a few listens you will be back on Amazon ordering "Clumsy" and "Spiritual Machines".  This is one of the better albums released in the late 90's and should be a staple in most music lover's collection.
