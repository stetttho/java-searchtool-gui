 One of the advantages to having a friend who works in a record store is that you get a chance to hear things you never would have come across otherwise, and this album was a great example of that for me.  My buddy threw it on the store stereo and before the first song was over I had my wallet out.  That was over 4 years ago and despite the fact that I now have over 500 albums to choose from, I still listen to this one at least once a week.  And that is really saying something since I am not a big fan of hardcore music, I usually listen to stuff closer to Pink Floyd & Radiohead.  The fact that Handsome was made up of members of Helmet, Quicksand, & others in the hardcore genre is extremely misleading.  This is a HARD ROCK album that hardcore and metal fans will like, not vice versa.  Jeremy Chatelain's voice is harsh enough to give the angst-driven lyrics the edge they need, but he actually sings instead of the usual hardcore screaming & growling.  The dual guitars compliment each other perfectly and Pete Hines lays down some of the coolest beats I've heard in a long time.  It's a shame that this is the first and last album they would make, but if they stayed together it would have been tough to improve on the material here.  Take a chance on this one, you will not regret it.
