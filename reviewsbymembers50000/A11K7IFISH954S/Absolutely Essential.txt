 Purple is one of those albums that everyone should have.  STP backed off a bit from the heavier sound that was featured on Core and came out with what became the first true alternative/grunge album to cross over to the mainstream (there was a time when you had a chance to hear "Big Empty" or "Interstate Love Song" on just about any radio station you turned to).  The songwriting on Purple is far and away STP's best as they perfectly mixed the distorted guitar riffs of Core with the more melodic vocals of Tiny Music.  The real highlights are "Vasoline", "Interstate Love Song", "Still Remains", "Silvergun Superman", and "Kitchenware & Candybars".  However There is nothing on Purple that even comes close to being a sub-par song, even the tongue-in-cheek secret tune at the end of the disc is a catchy fun melody.  Definitely one of the best albums of the 90's and a must for any music fan.
