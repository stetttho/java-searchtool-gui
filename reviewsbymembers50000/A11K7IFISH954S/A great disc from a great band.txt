 Are you the type of person who is sick of all the [stuff] that they call music nowadays?  Looking for a band that understands that emotion is the most important part of songwriting and performing?  Look no further because The Tea Party is here.  In this, their 2nd major label release, Jeff Martin, Stu Chatwood, & Jeff Burrows finally prove that true heart-felt rock and roll is not dead.  From the loud guitar & drums of "Fire in the Head" and "The Bazaar" to the sombre, tear-jerking affirmations of "Correspondences" (and those are just the first 3 tracks), The Edges of Twilight is a wonderful study in spirituality (lyrically), and a melting pot of world sounds and influences (musically) that gets better and better upon repeated plays.  Although The Tea Party has released better albums since, many of the songs off of Edges are among their best ever making this album well worth the while.
