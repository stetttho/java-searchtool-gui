 There I was, enjoying my day off, picking up a few CD's at a used record store, when the first few notes of "Sea Song" came on the store stereo. I was blown away. I marched up to the counter and bought it immediately, and I consider it one of the best albums in my collection. I have played this disc for just about everyone I know, and I can't remember one person who hasn't immediately fallen in love with it. "Lost Souls" is one of those rare discs that works well as both background music and as something to really concentrate on and sing along to. Doves combines so many different styles and sounds that 1.)You can't get sick of it, and 2.)Has a little of something for everyone, no matter where your preferences lie. The instrumental opener "Firesuite" sets the mood for the entire album with a relaxed spacey jam that makes you want to kick back and enjoy a frosty brew.  Don't get to comfortable though, because "Here it Comes" kicks up the tempo and really gets the album rolling, a perfect segue into the rest of the album.  The main guitar melody of "Sea Song" is one of the catchiest, most original progressions I have ever heard.  "Catch the Sun" is another upbeat tune that will keep your foot tapping while "The Cedar Room" and "The Man Who Told Everything" are beautifull ballads that rival each other as the highlights of the disc.  Even the bonus tracks (which some have said seem out of place, not something I agree with) blow away anything on about 99% of the albums released in the past 5 years.  This is a CD for everyone, regardless of age and/or taste.  Truly one of the best albums made in the past 20 years.  Lets hope Doves doesn't stop here.
