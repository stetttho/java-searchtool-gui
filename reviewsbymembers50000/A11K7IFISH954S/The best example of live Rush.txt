 Being a huge Rush fan who already owned all of their albums (live recordings included), it went without saying that I had to purchase this as soon as it came out, just because it was Rush.  Although their other live recordings are good, Different Stages blew me away from first listen, and continues to do so to this day.  This is the first live album I have ever heard that truly captures the energy and excitement of the band's live performances with the sound quality and accuracy of a studio recording.  These three men are such incredible musicians that it comes as no surprise that the songs are played accurately, but the perfect balance of reverb, crowd noise, and the band's instruments makes this the most accurate example of what its like to be at a Rush show, without actually being there.  The set list on all 3 discs is incredible and gives a almost-perfect collection of the band's extensive 20+ year (at the time) career.  I was lucky enough to attend the show at Great Woods where the version of "2112" was recorded, and whenever I listen to the song I can close my eyes and be transported back to that incredible night.  That is what a live disc should be able to do, and leave it to Alex, Geddy, and Neil to be the first to get it right.  Do yourself a favor and pay WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO to see Rush live.  But if that isn't possible, this is the closest alternative.  And for a 3 disc set that includes this much great music, the price is great.
