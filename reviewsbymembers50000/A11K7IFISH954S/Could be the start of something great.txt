 "Red" and "Powder Blue".  Even if this album just consisted of these two songs it would be worth the price of the disc.  Elbow's debut is a spacey, layered collection of songs and sounds that are poppier than most British progressive music, yet much more intricate and less immediate than many of thier Brit-pop counterparts.  The "typical" rock instruments intertwine with A variety of strange instruments (wine glasses, horns) to create, at times, delicately beautiful soundscapes that suddenly become interrupted with well placed harder guitar and drum excursions.  The first half of the album is not too far off from perfect, starting with the brooding "Any Day Now" (in which the vocals sound a little too much like Pink Floyd's "Astronomy Domine") which leads into the first masterpiece of the disc, the aformentioned "Red".  "Little Beast" takes it back down a level, sort of a rest before you reach the real highlight "Powder Blue".  A beautiful ballad lead by a pretty piano riff and ending with a sudden breaking of a glass, this song makes me think that there is tremendous potential for this band and pretty much guarantees that I will be looking out for thier next release.  "Bitten by the Tailfly" is a strange, climaxing journey that is even better in a live setting, and the disc peaks with the most immediate song on the disc "Newborn".  The second half leaves a lot to be desired, but there is ample proof here that this is a band you should keep your eyes on for a while.  Thier approach is similar to Doves, but the music has a different sound to it.  If you are a Brit-pop fan, this is definitely worth checking out.
