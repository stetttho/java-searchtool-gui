 Roger Waters first "true" solo album (other than the easily forgettable "Music from the Body") proves who the creative genius behind Pink Floyd really was.  "The Pros and Cons" is a brilliant concept album in which Waters uses a series of strange dreams as a storyline to vent on a number of personal issues, most importantly love and fidelity.  As is true with pretty much all Pink Floyd and Roger Waters albums, this album needs to be heard from start to finish to truly understand, but it is more than worth it as Roger's incredible ability to convey his emotions is so good it is overwhelming.  Roger is truly a master of using dynamic shifts within the music to give his lyrics that much more meaning.  If you were emotionally effected by the lyrical themes covered in "The Wall", then I STRONGLY suggest picking up both this album and "The Final Cut", as these are both albums that dig deeper into the personal turmoil that were the reasons that "Pink" (and that means Roger himself as well as the character in the movie) built the emotional "Wall".   Enough about the lyrical theme though, this is also a strong album musically.  Clapton is at his best, as is Sax player David Sanborn, while Michael Kamen's string arrangements are incredibly powerful.  If you have the patience to REALLY LISTEN to an album, start to finish, then "The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking" is definitely for you.
