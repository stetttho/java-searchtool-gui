 I just cannot get enough of this movie. I saw it in the theater on the night it first came out, and bought the DVD as soon as it was available, and I have watched it countless times since. High Fidelity has probably one of the most accurate portrayals of the typical male psyche that I have ever seen in a movie. John Cusack plays a late 20's/early 30's music buff record store owner who is on the outs with his girlfriend.  The break up eventually leads him to question his own self worth and what follows is some very funny soul searching.  Even if you cannot identify with the "Music Lover" part of Cusack's character, his actions and thoughts are things that have gone through every mans mind at one point or another, and that is part of what makes his strange reactions to the different parts of the film so funny, the old "funny because its so true" scenario.   Cusack's interaction with the camera (the narration) is witty and amusing and is really the perfect way to make this movie work.  Meanwhile, the rest of the cast is right on target. Jack Black in particular is absolutely hilarious, especially if you are a music fan since you will have a better idea what he is poking fun at.  It also helps that I think everyone knows someone like him, the over-opinionated loudmouth that thinks he's smarter than everyone else.  High Fidelity is one of those rare movies that is dark, funny, sensitive, silly, and clever all at the same time.  I watch this movie at least once a week and it never gets old. Its a great date movie and has an awesome soundtrack.
