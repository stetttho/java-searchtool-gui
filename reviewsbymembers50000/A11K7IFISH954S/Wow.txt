 Doves debut album "Lost Souls" was so brilliant I didn't think they would ever be able to improve on it.  Boy have these guys proved me wrong.  "The Last Broadcast" is very simply put, a masterpiece.  I think it is pretty safe to say that Doves are the future of modern music.  Their ability to blend so many sounds and styles into each song is amazing, and their mastery of modern recording techniques combine to make another album for any occasion.  The album as a whole has a definite cohesiveness that makes for one of the most enjoyable listening experiences since "Dark Side of the Moon" (and believe me, that is not a comparison that a die-hard Floyd fan like myself just throws around).  But even if you don't have time to sit and listen to the whole album, each song stands on its own.  This is an album you can listen to any time, any place.   The mood is slightly brighter than "Lost Souls", but the music is just as spacey, intricate, and relaxing with plenty of dynamic shifts and weird, but perfectly placed background noises and samples that made their debut so good.  "Broadcast" is by far the best album released this year and will be a classic for years to come.  50 years down the road people will still be listening to this album on a regular basis while most of the other stuff they are releasing nowadays will be collecting dust in your attic.  A must for any music fan, no matter where your tastes lie.
