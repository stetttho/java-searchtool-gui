 In this hastily thrown-together soundtrack to the rare French movie "La Vallee"  Pink Floyd stayed with the sound they finally perfected on Meddle and would later evolve into Dark Side of the Moon.  Without the lofty lyrical themes of their later albums, Obscured By Clouds is different than most Floyd albums in the sense that the sound is most definitely typical Floyd, but this is a disc that you can throw in your 5 disc player on shuffle without losing any effect.  Starting with two guitar filled instrumentals, the album then turns into a great example of Pink Floyd's ability to write a variety of different sounding songs.  The slow, piano tinged "Burning Bridges" and "Stay" are two of Rick Wright's finest moments, while the hard, driving guitars of "The Gold its in the..." is almost alternative-sounding.  The beautiful acoustic ballad "Wots..Uh the Deal" is probably the highlight of the disc while "Childhood's End" and the instrumental "Mudmen" shine the spotlight on David Gilmour's guitar.  "Free Four" is another highlight as Roger Waters takes a happy, upbeat chord progression and taints it with some pretty depressing lyrics about life and death, themes he would later elaborate on.  The strange thing is, it works, and gives a nice hint of the themes that would follow.  "Absolutely Curtains" is basically pointless, but I'm sure it makes more sense in the movie.  Overall, this is a great album that Floyd fans will love.  It is also probably the best album for the Floyd fan who can't follow the concepts of DSOTM, WYWH, Animals, and The Wall.  You won't hear any of these songs on the radio, but that doesn't mean this album isn't worth your time and money.  After all, it's Floyd!
