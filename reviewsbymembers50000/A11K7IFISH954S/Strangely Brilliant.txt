 Like many, I talked myself into buying this album because I just couldn't get enough of 'Float On', and this was the first I had ever heard of MM. After the first couple of listens, I found myself scratching my head, wondering if I was just going crazy or if this album was as addicting as it seemed. For those not familiar with Modest Mouse's sound, Isaac Brock has a very strange, dissonant voice, that upon first impressions sounds downright sloppy. However, it actually does grow on you, especially when you really start to get hooked on the rest of the music. This certainly isn't poppy by any standards, especially once you start to learn the incredibly weird but borderline-genius lyrics, which include such clever lines as 'If God gives life, he's an indian giver' and 'with every invention made, how much time did we save, were no farther along now than we were in the cave'. The more you listen, the more addicting the album gets, and now that I've moved on to hear some of their earlier stuff, I'm glad I heard 'Float On', because it has allowed me to discover an incredibly talented band that otherwise I would have missed. I wouldn't suggest this album to everyone, but if you are willing to give this an honest shot (about 2 months is what it took me), theres a good chance you'll be satisfied.
