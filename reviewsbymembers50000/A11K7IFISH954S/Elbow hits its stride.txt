 Elbow's 3rd release sees them taking a giant leap forward.  As I said in my review of "Asleep in the Back", you could sense that these guys had the potential to achieve great things, and after an impressive follow-up, they finally have put together their first masterpiece.    "Asleep" only hinted at this potential with a couple of brilliant stand-out songs, but the rest of the album was nothing more than mediocre and at times downright boring.  "Cast of Thousands" was much more consistent from start to finish, but really had only one 5 star song in the incredible "Fugitive Motel".  But on "Leaders of the Free World", they have taken all the good points of the first two albums, combined them, and taken them a step further.  "Leaders" is a bit less spacey than their  first two releases, but their approach remains the same, constructing their beautiful melodies in an orchestra fashion.  Layers of instruments all complement each other perfectly, and guarantee that each listen will reveal more detail than the last.  They rock out a bit more than in the past, especially on "Forget Myself", the title track, and "Mexican Standoff", but there are still plenty off the slow moody sounds that Guy Garvey's voice is perfectly suited for.  Garvey's lyrics are better than ever, both when waxing political as he does on the title track("passing the gun from father to feckless son, we're caught in a landslide where only the good die young"), and when sadly singing about a lost love in songs like "My Very Best" and "Great Expectations" (the latter of which is one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have heard in years).  Fans of Elbow's previous work will certainly enjoy this album, but the appeal of "Leaders" is sure to be more widespread than its little-known predecesors.  Even more exciting is the fact that there could be greater things to come from a band that seems to have finally put all the pieces together.  One of the best albums of 2005.
