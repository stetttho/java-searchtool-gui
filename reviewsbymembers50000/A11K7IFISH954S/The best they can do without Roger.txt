 As a follow-up effort to the extremely lackluster Momentary Lapse of Reason, I really didn't expect much from the Division Bell.  However, the remaining members of the band returned from thier 7+ year hiatus with a pretty good album.  The music is typical Floyd, spacey and intricate with plenty of great melodic ideas that would have fit in perfect somewhere between Meddle and Dark Side of the Moon.  The area where this album really misses the mark is in the lyrics (Read: Please come back Roger).  There is an overall theme throughout the album, but it seems extremely forced and a little fake.  It is almost like David Gilmour is trying to be as much like Waters as a lyricist, and the shoe just doesn't fit.  Lyrics have never been Dave's strong suit, and even with the help of outside collaborators (including Gilmour's wife) the bitterness and overall feeling in the lyrics fails to even come close to the worst stuff that Roger has ever done. Musically though, The Division Bell shows that the band hasn't lost the ability to write a great song.  Gilmour's guitar work is as good as it has ever been, especially on the instrumental "Marooned".  In fact, I think this album better serves as a vehicle for Gilmour's playing and probably would have worked better if they just had Dave solo over the entire thing.  Despite all of the negatives, this is still a great album.  It just pales in comparison to anything that Roger has been involved in (both as Pink Floyd and as a solo artist.)
