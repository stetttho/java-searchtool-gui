 To say that Dark Side of the Moon is a masterpiece is an unbelievable understatement.  There is a good reason this album has sold so many copies (and still continues to pop up on the record charts from time to time despite the fact that it was released 30 YEARS AGO).  From start to finish Dark Side is pure musical and lyrical genius.  Every sound on the album; whether its the heart beat to open and close the album, David Gilmour's incredible guitar work, or the screams of agony on "The Great Gig in the Sky", has a greater purpose and they all work together to create a compelling, thought provoking look at madness and the parts of everyday life that can lead one down that path.  The lyrics are intellegent, poetic, and emotional and blend perfectly with the music.  There is simply no album that, from start to finish, can even compare to the brilliance of DSOTM.  This album is a must-have for all music fans.  If you don't own it already, buy 2 because if you have any taste at all, you will wear the first one out.
