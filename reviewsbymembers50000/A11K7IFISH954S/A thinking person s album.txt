 First of all, my rating of this album is 4.5 stars, because it is definitely better than 4.  Although the mid 80's Rush albums have always taken their share of criticism from both fans and critics alike for the less powerful, "electronic" sound, what these people seem to misunderstand is that less powerful means more intricate.  That is the best way to describe "Power Windows".  This album, along with "Grace Under Pressure", offer undeniable proof that Alex Lifeson is the greatest all-around rock guitarist ever.  Nobody perfectly plays both rhythm and lead guitar at the same time better than Alex, and other than possibly David Gilmour, no guitarist is better at knowing when NOT to play.  This is often an overlooked aspect, especially when you consider that this album was released at a time when guitarists like Eddie Van Halen were turning the instrument into an extension of their "unit".  Thats why this great album still holds up today.  Alex's guitar works perfectly around Geddy's bass grooves and Neil's precise drumming to create a collection of excellent melodies.  To top it all off, the lyrics offer a thought provoking look into modern life and those who control it.  Neil's lyrics show that he is the master of using ingenious metaphors to get his point across.  This is one of 6 or 7 Rush albums where the band is at the top of their game in every aspect.  The precise, melodic instrumentation, excellent hooks, and meaningful lyrics all combine to form one of the band's best efforts.
