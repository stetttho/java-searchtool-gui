 Atom Heart Mother is the last in a string of Pink Floyd albums where the band was trying to find its niche.  Their experiments with sound effects, classical instruments, and lengthy jams reached their peak at this point and this album, although it has some very good songs and melodies, is more "interesting" than it is "good".  The opening track shows the band using everything INCLUDING the kitchen sink to create its soundscapes.  I mean, when is the last time you heard a lawn mower in the middle of a song.  But like most of Floyd's experiments, it works in a strange way.  The three middle songs are the best part of the album, especially Roger Waters acoustic piece "If", which really first shows Roger's obsession with madness and how it effects other people.  This is not an album for people new to Pink Floyd.  This is more for the die-hard fan looking for more steps in the band's development from pure psychedelia to art rock, and this album has plenty of examples of both.  If you own (and like)everything from Meddle to The Final Cut, you will probably enjoy this album, even if its just because you can hear the band in its embryotic stage.  Its kinda like looking at a picture of your kid when they are first born.  Its ugly, yet beautiful in its own way.
