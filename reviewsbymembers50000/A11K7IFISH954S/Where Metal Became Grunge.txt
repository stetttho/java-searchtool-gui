 Dirt is not only Alice in Chains' best album, it is also one of the five best albums of the entire alternative/grunge era (along with Nirvana's Nevermind, Pearl Jam's Ten, Soundgarden's Superunknown, and Smashing Pumpkins' Siamese Dream).  Throw in this disc and you are instantly kicked in the face with the super-heavy opening riff of "Them Bones", and the ride doesn't get any smoother from there.  After the equally heavy "Dam That River", the album takes a dark and twisted turn leading you through the dementia & self-loathing associated with drug abuse.  A big difference from the cheesy pop-metal that was filling the airwaves prior to the "alternative Movement".  Dirt is a loose concept album that doesn't brighten up at any time.  From the suicidal rants of the title track to the haunting riffs of "Angry Chair", this album is a study in depression and can be emotionally draining to listen to.  These are all the things that make Dirt (and Alice as a band) so great.  Each tune is extremely well written (especially the stellar "Would?") as Jerry Cantrell's strange, but melodic riffs and solos beautifully work around the thunderous rhythm section, and Cantrell & Staley's voices blend so well together it's tough to tell the difference between the two.  Dirt is one of the few masterpieces of the 90's and should be in any music lovers' collection.
