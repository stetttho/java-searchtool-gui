 Aside from the awesome "Plowed", there aren't too may people who have had the oppurtunity to experience just how good Sponge is.  It is truly a tragedy that these guys broke up because in my opinion they were right up there with Radiohead and The Tea Party as the best bands around.  New Pop Sunday is thier best album, a great collection of melodic, highly textured rockers that really work individually and as a whole.  There really isn't a bad song on this album, which is true for every sponge album, but these are some of Sponge's best compositions.  Polyana, Live Here Without You, 1000 Times, Radio Prayer Line, New Pop Sunday, and Lucky are all highlights both lyrically and musically.  In fact, Live Here Without You probably could have been a top 10 hit if it ever got any radio play.  Anyone who is currently, or ever has been, in a long-distance relationship will really be able to identify with all of the songs on the album, since that is really the overall theme lyrically.  Just a great album from a great, underrated, underappreciated rock band (and they put on one of the best live shows I've ever seen too).
