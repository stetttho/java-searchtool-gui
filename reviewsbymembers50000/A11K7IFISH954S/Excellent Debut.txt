 Sponge has been one of my favorite bands for a long time, and this was the disc that started it all.  First of all I think it is pretty safe to assume that just about everyone who listened to the radio during the "alternative" era has heard "Plowed" before.  Its one of those songs that not too many people know by name, but if they heard it randomly somewhere they would say "hey, I remember this song, this song rocks!"  It was all over the radio around 1995 and even is featured during the movie "Empire Records" (although sadly was left off the soundtrack).  I guess my point is, if you paid any attention to music in the mid-90's, you know "Plowed". The thing is, the rest of Rotting Pinata is just as good.  Sponge never got any recognition because they never stood out, they didn't have anything that set them apart from the literally hundreds of alternative bands that were crowding the airwaves at the time.  They are just a great post-punk rock band with incredible songwriting.  Although Sponge definitely got better with their later albums, Pinata is a great collection of songs ranging from upbeat punky tunes like the title track, "Plowed", and Miles to slower, quieter songs like "Giants", "Drownin", and "Fields".  There isn't a bad song on the album, and thats including the awesome secret tune at the end.  If you want to get into Sponge, I would start with thier latest album "New Pop Sunday", but this should be next on your list.
