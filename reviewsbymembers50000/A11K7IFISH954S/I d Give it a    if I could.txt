 I've been a fan of the Tea Party for quite a while and all I have to say to those who haven't discovered these guys yet is that you have no idea what you are missing.  The Tea Party could very well be the saviours of modern day rock and roll if they only got some recognition.  The boys from Windsor have returned with the same incredible songwriting and arrangements, filled with plenty of hooks and a touch of the far east, that have made their previous releases so good.  The thing is, they also hit you with something different every time to keep things interesting, while not losing touch with the emotion that is so important in all their songs.  Tracks like Cathartik, Lullaby, The Master & Margarita, & Must, Must rock out more than anything they have ever done while Soulbreaking, Angels, & Requiem show how they are just as good when they turn it down a notch.  I recommend this album for ANYONE who considers themselves a true music lover.  Otherwise pick up the latest Britney Spears CD and never talk about music again!
