 Recently I read this book and was moved by, not so much what the author says, but where he is "coming from" as he says these words. His metaphors have a brilliance that I find missing in many so-called teachers of Advaita.  Fortunately, Nathan's voice can be heard on a two-CD album from one of his his London meetings. When I listen, there is a deep resonance, a sense of a vast, warm, enveloping peace, and a sense that indeed, nothing is wrong and there never was anything "wrong."  This Space or Expanded Feeling of Well-Being is much more delicious that any dry words or dead concepts. The experience is Real. The story that obfuscates the experience is not the Real, yet Nathan's warmth and ease with ALL of what is INCLUDES this apparent falsehood as also the Oneness of What Is expressing as that apparent divisiion of subject and object.  I find this work to be invaluable, along with the pointers of Byron Katie and Joan Tollifson. This book and the CD's, perhaps along with other authentic expressions like Joan's, can bring about an end to the search. What have you got to lose, besides yourself?  with Love  charlie  (...)
