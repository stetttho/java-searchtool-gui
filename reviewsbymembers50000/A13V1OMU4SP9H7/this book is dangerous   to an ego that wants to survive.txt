 Why do I say that? Because this is, rather than a book for self improvement or oginazational betterment, a conversation that impacts the survival mechanisms of the 'personal me' that keep real effectiveness at bay. Hidden in the space the words arise from is a Clarity and Reality that can transform even the most  cynical and jaded among us.   What is this transformation? Simply this: An awakening into a new realm, a realm of pure impersonal awareness, in which a new possibility for Being arises: Being possibility itself, unbounded, unstructured, unlimited ... in short, free. And freedom is the Source of true power (NOT force.)  I have recommended this book to colleagues who simply are unable to take the time to participate in the Landmark Forum, the offshoot of Werner Erhard's est training that produced the initial body of work out of which the insights and processes in Tracy's book were generated ... from Nothing. (NO Thing.)  In addition the book draws distinctions from the Work of a practical philosopher, Dr. Fernando Flores, whose explorations in the Nothingness and Emptiness led to powerful insights into the power of created language ... committed speaking and listening ... a language of creation, of generation, of the carving out of a possibility and its manifestation in "reality" ... in the world.  This is a manual for transformation, possibility, creation and generation ... from the Emptiness from which all that is arises, this book offers the space to be, do and accomplish the impossible dreams that many of us have given up on.  Five stars is not enough. Read it, use it, transform the world you are. With best wishes and love for our human family, charlie hayes, www.theeternalstate.org
