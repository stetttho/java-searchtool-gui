  this book, when really absorbed not by mind but by the non-conceptual "I Am" can open your heart to the impossibly wide and infinite space of unabashed loving aliveness ... and then push you right over into That abyss. This I know from experience.  Stephen Wingate's review says it all. I add this coda because I cannot resist my love, gratitude and enthusiasm for this Self Expression called a book ... may all find true peace throught the wisdom of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj and those who teach from His pure Essence.
