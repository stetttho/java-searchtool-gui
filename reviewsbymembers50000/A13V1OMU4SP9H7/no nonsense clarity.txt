 John Wheeler is a clear voice in the spiritual wonderland. No mysticism, just a persistent and no holds barred pointing to what is real ... These writings (and John's talks and consulting) never fail to awaken a sense of presence here and I both hate and love the hard hitting style John displays. No nonsense. Just clear pointing, and no tolerance whatever for a stubborn ego.  Irreverent? Perhaps. Irrelevant? Absolutely not. Mostly, compassionate ... offers a sense that maybe - just maybe -  a destruction of the ignorance that keeps suffering repeating itself over and over is possible. If you want someone to buy into your victim story, this ain't the guy. But if you are interested in Truth, unvarnished and free of dogma, check it out, along with Chuck Hillig, Nathan Gill, Byron Katie, Tony Parsons, "Sailor" Bob Adamson and Joan Tollifson.
