 Tony has Nothing to say and he says it beautifully! After reading this little book as well as "As It Is" several times, the "i" that appeared to be reading began to blessedly, fade. It is glimpsed in this apparent person that All that Is, Is Love, is Freedom, is No Thing. And that is the emptiness of the full, the completeness of the void - That which loves to be and allows all that is to BE. Here. Now. Presently. Naked Awarness... Tony's pointing to the Real reminds me of Lao Tzu: The sage lets go of "that" and chooses THIS.  Tony answers questions that the mind is unaware of, leaving a sense of space and natural relaxation ... and this Space arises Now as all there is, as it is. The Space is One of Freedom, Power, Love ... but for NO one. Give it a shot. There is everything to lose and Nothing to gain! And in that Nothing, there IS Love.   Tony pokes and prods and pushes buttons for the ego-mind I call "me" ... especially when I have taken a teaching on board as "something True and Right." Tony loves to run over Dogma with his outrageous wit and carefree approach to all that is. So, I find no conflict here with J. Krishnamurti, or Alan Watts, or Eckhart Tolle ... all of whom I count among my 'teachers' also, inasmuch as ALL speak FROM the Stillness that IS at the core of all Life and Livingness. They all speak FROM the Love that we ARE. I find that here, when I Feel the resonance rather than figure out the words and compare to other words, then the seeing is clear. ~charlie
