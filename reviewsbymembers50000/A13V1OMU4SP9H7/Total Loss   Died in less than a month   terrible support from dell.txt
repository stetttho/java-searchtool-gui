 Don't waste your money ... I really liked this nice little device UNTIL it just up and DIED completely ... after less than a month. I spent an inordinate amount of time being shuffled around from one Dell rep to another, none of whom were the least bit helpful in getting this device replaced.   I give up, I am gonna get an Ipod or a Zen. Silly, how nice the dell people are AND how bloody incompetent ... I cannot tell you how frustrating Dell is these days. Having been a customer for over 10 years, I am appalled at the lack of competence that has emerged lately.  ZERO Stars.
