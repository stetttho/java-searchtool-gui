  "Sailor" Bob is, in a word, the Real Deal. Like his Teacher, Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj (whose Teachings were popularized in the book "I Am That" from Acorn Press), Bob points unwaveringly to what is Real ... "Are you Present and aware? Can you ever say you do not exist? You must be awareness itself to say 'I am not aware' ... " and at the same time Bob shows us what is NOT real. "Are you separate, an entity? Find it and show it to me." This approach is in the time tested tradition called "Advaita," yet Bob steadfastly refuses the title of Guru and eschews the whole idea of a Guru and a Disciple as ignorance and duality.   So what is a visitor or reader left with? A great and Wise FRIEND ... a Guide to the Reality ... beyond the dream of "me in a world."  The word Advaita means "Not Two," which is a rigoruous pointer to what Bob calls "One-Without-A-Second" or simply, THAT. All is That. That thou Art.  I spent a few days with Bob in September 2005, and he left 'me' with no Guru, no Teaching, nothing to remember, and nothing to do. (Who would do anything?) In other words, Bob leaves us without US or ME or OTHER ... just AS That which was sought since the dream of a separate person arrived at around age three. Abd that is That.  Get to Melbourne and see Bob if you can. He is a rare Treasure in a world of Half-Baked "Teachers of Oneness."  With Bob, in person, via DVD or CD, and in this book (as well his other book "Presence Awareness), you may find that the seeker gradually (or suddenly) fades away, and what is left is Loving Being Awakeness, just this, and nothing else.  That Thou Art ... Tat Tvam Asi! Love, 'charlie' www.theeternalstate.org
