 I knew Masten Gregory. He was one tof the most charming, articulate and intelligent men I have ever had the privilege of meeting. Witty and brilliant, his prowess in racing cars in an era of unforgiving machines and non-existent safety was beyond brave. It was transcendental. He was Miles Davis or Charlie Parker in a race car!  Masten was so completelty a racer that nothing else would do. I know that feeling. It is as Gergory's contemporary, Ferrari driver Alfonso DePortago, said: "If a man is awake andn alive he can live ten years in two hours on Sunday."  Masten and I would sit and play backgammon, and talk about nothing but racing for hours on end at Carl Haas' place in Chicago. He hated to lose, even at a board game. Me too. So our games were pure competition and pure joy.   Highly recommended. It is a way to touch a bright star in the motorsports firmament.  I loved the man.  Charlie Hayes www.GetSponsoredNow.com
