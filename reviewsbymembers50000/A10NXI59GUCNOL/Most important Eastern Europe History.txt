 This book should be in  e v e r y  classroom in Europe and USA. It is an absolute must-read for everyone trying to understand European and especially Eastern European peoples history. Together with "History of the Goths" and "Agricola and Germania -Tacitus/Mattinly" reading this book will clarify Eastern European History , which for too long has been falsified, ignored or outright silenced away by intimidation.
