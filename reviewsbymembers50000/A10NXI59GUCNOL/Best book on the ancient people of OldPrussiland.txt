 Karl Baumann managed to combine the written records and knowledge of the last 2000 years and earlier of this Baltic land and its people into one easy comprehensive book. Many hardships were brought by big power crusaders starting with soldiers of Boleslaw I Chrobry from the south/east in 997 AD . Until the massive expulsions under the communists and allies in the 20th century ,the people survived.  The unique sounding language in the mysterious land, cleansed of most of its native population 1945/49 is now only heard occasionally in scattered parts of the world. Strangers were moved in and took over the 800 year old Hansa cities with the E.T.A. Hoffmann Nutcracker charme . This book should be translated into English to give the large English Speaking public an inside glimpse of this enchanted land.
