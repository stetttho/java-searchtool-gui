 H. Wolfram and T. Dunlap deserve highest marks for the comprehensive most detailed account of Eastern European - East Germanic tribal history. I found many details of my Aesti-East Prussia West-Baltic history. With the Iron Curtain and earlier take-over of East Germanic lands we had many years where none of the history was made public in the English language. The genocide, sancioned by the Allied Control Council abolishion of Prussia in 1947 and the previous and ongoing ethnic cleansing by Stalin communists seems to have been in connection with the silence of the press on matters of any true East Germanic  History. Not even the fact that the legitimate Prussian government under Otto Braun was ousted by Military Coup by  Hitler July 20, 1932 is being published. Herwig Wolfram went to  a lot of searching and trouble to have the ancient history  recorded by Jordanis and earlier writers once again made known.  The ATTA UNSAR - Vater Unser- Lord's Prayer translated by Gothic  bishop Wulfilas is truly a guiding light for following East Germanic tribes from early beginnings to todays Europeans.
