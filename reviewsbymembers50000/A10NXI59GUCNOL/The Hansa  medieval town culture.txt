 Joh. Schildhauer and the translator captured the special flair of the Hanseatic Cities such as Cologne, Luebeck, Deventer, Bremen, Hamburg, Kiel, Brunswick, Erfurt, Goslar, Halle, Magdeburg, Berlin, Wismar, Rostock, Greifswald, Stettin, Breslau, Krakau, Kolberg, Danzig, Elbing, Thorn, Koenigsberg, Riga , Dorpat, Visby and the many affiliated Hansa stations. He describes life of the towns people,their Low German Language of the Hansa city self-government. Many illustrations of the unique architecture and art works accompany the book. Schildhauer shows sigillums of cities with the Hansa Kogge, coggs, the merchant  ships and shows how the independend city self governments relied on trade guilds furnishing their own self protection armies. A Rostock University Matriculation Register from 1419-1760 can be seen in the University Archives. A Luebeck 1494 bible- Dat boek- in Low German , from before Luther's times, is in the Stralsund Museum. All in all , a very beautiful book, which hopefully will be re-published again.
