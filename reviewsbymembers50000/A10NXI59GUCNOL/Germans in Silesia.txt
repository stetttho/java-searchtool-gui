 Several reviewers talk about Germans in Poland. This needs to be corrected. John Sack's book is about Germans living in Germany, in Silesia or Schlesien, which in the 20th century was turned into Poland. The majority of Silesians where imprisoned and/or killed during the expulsions of Germans (and ethnic Germans from other eastern European countries). The communist take-over of Eastern Germany and establishment of the Oder-Neisse line was done over several years (1945-1949) and repeatedly by military, para-military troops, thiefs and plunderers and nationalistic fanatics. This Oder-Neisse Line is the  military conquest line, which put all German Land east of these rivers into Communist Soviet Union and Polish administration with the Potsdam Agreement. Faced with this fait acompli and wanting to gain Stalin at any price for the war in the Pacific, the Western Allies went along. Decades later this act of expulsions and take-over of lands would be repeated in the Balkans.
