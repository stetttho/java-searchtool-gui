 This little booklet should be a must-read in every classroom. The Britons and the Germanic people are in detail described, many before the take-over or during the take-over of the Roman empire. My ancestors the West-Baltic Aesti-Prussi at the Mare Suebicum, Baltic Sea are described in detail. They are just like the  Suebi , but the language is described more as British. This means more Keltic. All of the Eastern Germanic tribes between the Elbe, Oder and Vistula river are collectively described as Suebi. Suebi, Suevi, Swebi, Schwaben, later were pushed further west by the for centuries ongoing attacks on Germania from people from the east .  The first time of recorded attacks on the Aesti-Prussi is in 997 AD when Boleslaw I Chrobry's soldiers came with Voitech St. Adalbert of Prague . The newly established Poles tried several more times to take over Old Prussiland, without success. 1920, 1945/49 Communist of Poland, Soviet Union and allies illegally took over the land of the original population and ousted them. For thousands of years the amber , or glaesum as recorded by Tacitus of the Aesti-Prussi was traded throughout the then known world. The Amber Trade Route connected as far as Egypt. Communist take-over greatly upset the natural balance on the Baltic Sea.
