 The author Bernd Laengin captured the history and the feeling of the homeland on the Baltic Sea. He shows one of the earliest portraits of the Prussians a 1000 years ago engraved at the archbishopric of Magdeburg .His exellent time table shows towns in copper etchings from the 1200's to the destruction in  1914 and 1945. Frauenburg ca 1270, where Prussias native son Nicolaus Copernicus, born in the Hanseatic city of Thorn, worked and perfected his world famous observations .Picturesque villages along the Baltic Sea, boats ,horses and Ostpreussische Elche, moose remind the world of this land that the native people today can only keep in their heart.  Since the communist take-over in 1947 it was a lost world. With the fall of the Iron Curtain this lost land can now be visited by the original inhabitants. The people that were also forcibly moved to this stolen land 50 years ago appreciate the elders coming home. People that aided the stealing are intimidatingly  opposed. I hope Bernd Laengin reprints this book and translates it also. I know the many descendends  of Eastprussians scattered all over the world , would appreciate having this book, as I do.
