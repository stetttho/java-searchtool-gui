 Most historians or the public in general do not have knowledge of this ethnic cleansing. How can this have been silenced away for so many years? 15 Million Germans were herded out of their homelands of eastern Germany and other parts of eastern Europe, that in earlier years were part of the German Empire. People act as if this never happened or dismiss it. Any attempt at making this expulsion known, was until now totally rejected by any mainstream publisher. Anyone daring to even hint at it, was and is immediately attacked. A. de Zayas has the courage to stand up against intimidation. This book is the tip of the iceberg of the actual records of the survivors. De Zayas made an event public, that by mere denial of the actively involved perpetrators for the last 50 years, led to many repeats such as Kosovo.
