 This book ,finally translated into English language, has for centuries been missing in the live of English speaking people. The knowledge other Europeans had for many centuries about their early history has been virtually missing from the English speaking world, particularly the United States. One has to wonder ,why ? In the 150's AD Claudius Ptolemy clearly shows the people of  Europe and the world.  Ptolemy shows Magna Germania at the Vistula river (Vistula being the Gothic name) and verifies the recorded history of Tacitus who in 98 AD recorded the Britons and the Germanic people in the Agricola and the Germania. Ptolemy Geography was not re-discovered until the mid 1500's. Nevertheless the original river and place names remained from original times throughout the centuries of attacks from the east on Germania, which brought in many new people.  It also gives great information on all parts of the then known world 1900 years ago . The map drawings , today so different, are a real challenge. But the original place names help to find the correct places. Ptolemy should be required study in every school class .
