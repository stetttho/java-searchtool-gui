 (Re-submitted) J. A. Michener's  book : Poland , paperback page 65 reads as follows: ...Teutonic Knights who crept out of Germany to occupy the Baltic seacoast- which should normally have been part of Poland - acted under the Pope...   Fact: Tacitus in 98 AD states in the Germania- that the Suebi - Goths - Aesti (Prussi) live at the Mare Suebicum in Germania. Fact: Before the birth of Christ and Ptolemy ca 150 AD described Magna Germania and the Goths at the Vistula river with the West Baltic Galinder and Sudauer Borussia-Prussi to the east(Aesti). Fact: 550 AD Jordanis describes the Aesti-Prussi as part of the Gothic empire under Theodoric the Great.  First record of the Polanen coming to this area was made mid 900's ,when Miezko I and son Boleslaw I Chrobry received land on loan from the German kings/emperors Otto I,II,III . For this they pledged allegiance to the emperors. The Polanen then went conquering to the north, east, west and south. 1920 and 1945-49 the communists and allies from the Soviet Union and Poland illegally removed the oiginal Prussia-German population.  Michener echoes this false 'original Polish land' fantasy.
