 If you listened to a friend's copy of 'Boys for Pele' and discovered that 'Caught a Lite Sneeze' is the one track you couldn't possibly live without, this single is an obvious choice for you. If you're just an obsessed Toriphile like me, then you'll have to buy this just because it's Tori and you NEED everything she's ever released. If you're on middle ground and already have 'Boys for Pele,' there's no reason to snatch this up. The 'Silly Songs' that pad this release are cute and sort of funny, but nothing even a Toriphile couldn't live without. It's up to you!
