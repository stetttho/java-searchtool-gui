 OK, does anyone else think 'Frog on My Toe' is simply wonderful? I've never quite figured out why I love this song so much. Perhaps it's because I laugh and smile a lot whenever I listen to it. The other B-sides are nice, but not distinctive. 'Talula' is a guilty pleasure, but most notable to me because Tori's song was featured in the blockbuster movie 'Twister.' Yup, she's on the soundtrack. Cool huh? Well, there you have it. You all know I love 'Frog on my Toe' now. Oh yeah...go ahead, laugh! That's what you'll be doing a lot of whenever you hear Tori sing the line "There's a frog on my toe. Maybe I'll call him Jethro" :)
