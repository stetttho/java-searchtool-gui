 This is one of those circumstances wherein the warnings from critics should actually be heeded.  This is one sprawling mess of a movie. Yes, there are some impressive scenes of carnage and spectacle and Vangelis provides a gorgeous and majestic score, but altogether, 'Alexander' is not the movie it could have been, not even close. I find this notion disconcerting, especially considering the talent involved. Stone is an astonishing and brilliant director, but this is the first film by Stone that felt uninspired and unfocused. There is no central story, just story threads. Despite the three hour running time, we never get the sense that we are seeing history unfold or that there is any specific insight into the mind of this great man. In all of Stone's great films i.e. JFK, Nixon, Born on the Fourth of July ect. the dramatic thrust and impeccable editing offer  movie narratives of enormous power and heft. However, 'Alexander' is like a tapesty of unfinished thoughts. There is a lot of detail in the historical narration, but very little excitement or awe is instilled as layers of history are, gulp, peeled away. Much of the story centers around Alexander's conquest over much of the known world, but the only way we the viewer really get a grasp on what is actually unraveling in front of us is by changes in scenery and ponderous narration via Anthony Hopkins. I'm always ready and able to forgive Stone any shortcomings because I think he's a phenomenal director, but Alexander gave me the impression that Stone showed up late for work everyday. His heart didn't appear to be invested in this one and that is quite unusual. OR, if his heart was there, he forgot to bring his brain. How disappointing! The Director's Cut is a supposedly superior version of this film, having been revamped from the theatrical cut. If this is so, I think we have our proof that two wrongs don't quite make a right!
