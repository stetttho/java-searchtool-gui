 Surprise! Justin Timberlake has a future as a slick Michael Jackson/Stevie Wonder hybrid. Clearly, this boyband wonder made a very intelligent choice deliberately straying away from Max Martin and his Swedish pop factory. For tangible proof, check out Nick Carter's fluffy rock/pop solo debut...dead in the water! Yes, with two great lead singles on the front of this album along with two accompanying videos in very heavy rotation on MTV, J.T. may soon realize rejoining N'Sync for another recording project could effectively stall the rise of his solo star. After Michael Jackson's hugely successful solo outing 'Off the Wall,' the Jackson 5 was simply novelty.  The music on 'Justified' is lean, slick, and fairly cohesive, but it's also quite de-sexed and anonymous. After multiple spins in the player, most of the album holds up well. Timberlake is best when he stays clear of ballads. You'll hear Timberlake make numerous references to the sky in several songs. This is his failed attempt to be poetic and romantic. OK, so much of the lyrical content is clunky, but the guy is young and nieve. There is too much promise in this debut to dismiss it, especially with the presense of Timbaland and The Neptunes, today's hottest producers. 'Justified' is recommended!
