 Sissel's classically trained voice is wasted on this set of bargain basement songs. Hailing from Norway, Sissel is best known for those ubiquitous "oohs" and "ahhs" in the blockbuster movie 'Titanic's' score. On this, her stateside debut, various Scandanavian songwriters provided a whole album full of just about every lyrical cliche and banality in existence. "When your fingers touch my skin." "I'm all alone in the rainfall."  The production is so flat and charmless that you might be left wondering whether you're actually listening to a collection of hastily assembled demos. Sissel has obvious talent and beauty, but is urgently in need of some fresher, more melodic material and a much more competent producer. Avoid this one!
