 Most certainly, 'Amadeus' discovers the accolades it receives. It is a true classic and ingenious fusion of music, spectacle, intrigue, performance, and directorial vision. Please note that the new director's cut has about 30 mins. of added footage. Some of this footage includes a scene containing sex/nudity. For this, the timid souls of the MPAA served up a new 'R rating.' The original theatrical version was rated 'PG.' The added footage is a great highlight and does not diminish this phenomenal film, rather it enhances key plot points. 'Amadeus,' just like Mozart's music, is masterful and unique. See it, then see it again.
