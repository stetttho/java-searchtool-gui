 I truly believe that this is the only LP by Tori Amos that will ever fade into obscurity. If you're curious and want a complete Tori collection, get it. If you're watching your wallet, avoid this all-covers album. The most significant downfall of this album is NOT that it is an all-covers album. On the contrary, Tori has done some fantastic covers in the past. I expected a lot from Tori tackling a concept like this. Unfortunately, this LP is sporadic and rather frustrating, where 'Boy For Pele' was sporadic, yet fascinating. Most of the songs reveal nothing about the female perspective Tori had in mind. Instead, many amount to lazy renditions in dire need of momentum such as 'Enjoy the Silence' and 'I'm not in love.' Dare I say, Tori is actually boring in spots. Yikes! 'Heart of Gold' is a complete misfire. It's loud, dissonant, and even annoying. There are certainly redeeming qualities on this most recent addition to Tori's repertoire. '97 Bonnie & Clyde' is nearly as chilling as 'Me and a Gun,' though Eminem stills shines through because I found myself laughing when I shouldn't have been. 'Rattlesnakes,' 'Time,' 'I Don't Like Mondays' and 'Real Men' are all decent and tolerable, but not really memorable. 'Strange Little Girls' is the obvious highlight and is likely the clearest choice for a single Tori has ever had to make on an LP. As a whole, the album is worthy based on the fact that someone like Tori attempted it. However, I am most definitely eager for original material and have only to wait until October 29 when 'Scarlet's Walk' hits the street.
