 This is, simply put, a wonderful film. It's funny, nostalgic, and beautifully photographed. The three leads fill their roles nicely and add a young exuberant sexiness to the story. Film fans are sure to have fun picking out all of the nods to other famous and more obscure movies that Bertolucci has sprinkled throughout his film. History buffs will enjoy the impeccable feel for time and place that was Paris, France in the 1960's. Bertolucci necessarily assumes that the viewer is atleast moderately acquainted with the historic revolutionary events that surround and threaten to swallow up the main characters as they become consumed with their own increasingly isolated activities. If you're not one of those people, there is a thorough survey of this history in a comprehensive documentary contained on the DVD. As with some of Bertolucci's other patently adult films, this one contains an ample amount of full frontal nudity, but it's never shown on screen simply to be exploitative or controversial. It just is what it is. The nudity and sex are refreshingly honest and add a truly elevated sense of abandon that inhabits each of these characters as they become increasingly consumed with their own paranoia and desires. I'll offer no spoilers here except to say that a brick thrown through a window is the beginning and the end. You'll understand what I mean after seeing this film. One final note: You may find one character's bathroom behavior particularly odd and inexplicable. Let's just say, I'll never again think of a bathroom sink in quite the same way. Enjoy!
