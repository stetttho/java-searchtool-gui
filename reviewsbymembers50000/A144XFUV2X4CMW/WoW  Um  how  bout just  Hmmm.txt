 For the seventh consecutive year, Wow offers a collection of highlights from the contemporary Christian music genre. As a whole, there's a nice mix of styles and artists here. The strongest tracks come from seasoned performers in this genre such as Steven Curtis Chapman, Michael W. Smith, Amy Grant, Jars of Clay, and Newsboys. All five of these artists have featured prominently in the Wow series, and will likely continue to do so. Jennifer Knapp, Selah, Rebecca St. James,  and Audio Adrenaline also make a strong showing. Ironically, two of the best tracks on this collection come as bonus features, Chris Tomlin's 'Enough and Paul Colman Trio's 'Turn.' Unfortunately, not everything is golden here. Some of the younger artists like Zoegirl, Jump5, and Stacie Orrico have much to learn from their more mature peers in the industry. In a genre vulnerable to saccharine overload and lyrical cliches, this collection suffers from Christian music's inherent weakness, the difficulty of offering a fresh, meaningful perspective on life as a child of God in a musically inventive or original way.
