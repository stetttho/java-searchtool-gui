 Let's make this short and to the point. 'From the Choirgirl Hotel' is a great album that spawned three amazing music videos. From the cinematic theater of 'Spark,' to the melancholy B&W of Tori's wedding gown ride in the back seat of 'Jackie's Strength,' to the ultra hip underground dance party and food fight of 'Raspberry Swirl,' this is what it is all about. Tori's first serious attempt at electronica and meatier production is a delight from beginning to end. Things start off with her best rock song ever, 'Spark,' and spin right through a collection of ballads (Jackie's Strength, Northern Lad, Playboy Mommy) and kinetic, more controversial fare (Raspberry Swirl, iieee, Hotel) Tori displays a remarkable adaptive spirit and is effectively able to evolve as an artist and still manage to stay true to her spirit and musical center.
