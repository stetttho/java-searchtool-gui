 You'll buy this maxi-single because you adore Tori and couldn't possibly dream of not having ALL her songs, including those quirky little B-sides she includes on many of her singles. Right? What you may not be prepared for is the song 'Honey.' It's a B-side, but most definitely far superior to most of her A-sides. Why is it missing from the LP then? Well, Tori had every intention of including it on the 'Under the Pink' LP, but complications caused it to be dropped during mastering. 'Cornflake Girl' is a wonderful single and the other B-sides are nice additions to a Tori collection, but 'Honey' is what makes this extended play single a 'must own.'
