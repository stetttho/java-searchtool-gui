 Grab a pint of icecream and the biggest spoon in the drawer, or sulk in the corner hugging your favorite teddy bear. Um, better yet, just pop in 'Sea Change,' Beck's downbeat meditation on disappointment and loss. Beck returns to the introspective days of 'Mutations,' but this time, he's not simply pensive, this guy is downright despondent. However, he never sounds whiny, and one never gets the impression that he's simply feigning some pretentious and trendy concept. What gives this album it's focus, depth, and undeniable power is Beck's ability to convey a true and inexorable sense of sincerity and self-therapy. He allows consistency to build a strong case. For example, Beck never strays from the quiet simmer that opens on 'The Golden Age' and drifts on to more obviously dreary songs like 'Lonesome Tears,' 'Lost Cause,' and 'Already Dead.' Melancholy orchestral moments fade in and out. Hushed and reverent guitars, wurlitzer, percussion, and synth follow Beck along through his desolate journey. At times, his tone and manner recalls the curiously attractive, self imposed loathsomeness of E and his band, 'Eels.' Beck sounds as though he is consenting to a life overrun with misery. In a time when we're all a little world weary, this is some self-therapy we could all afford to get in on. Initially, a listener may find this new set depressing, but assuredly, Beck's confident and effusive lyrics coupled with his genuine and affecting grace, style, and audacity lend themselves well to one of this year's best new albums. How timely and appropriate for an extraordinarily talented artist such as Beck to offer us 'Sea Change,' a quiet stunner and a new American classic.
