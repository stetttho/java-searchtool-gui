 Joy Electric? Should a name be so telling? I first heard this album rotating at a used CD store and just had to ask what it was. Since my curiosity always renders me with an empty wallet, the album ended up coming home with me that day.  Why? Hmmm, I suppose I found this music too cute to resist. I also enjoyed listening to the various electronic flourishes in each song and the 'spaceboy' vocals. Realistically, this kind of style may be unique to Christian music, but it most certainly is not revolutionary when other musical genres are considered. The name 'Erasure' came to mind several times while listening to this two disk set. 'Erasure' offers a similar, gleefully shallow approach. In both cases, lyrical prowess is virtually absent. This music would fit nicely into a kind of 'cotton candy' genre. It's sweet and tastes pretty good, but it melts away on contact. What keeps me listening is not nuance, inventiveness, subtlety, or lyrical content. I listen because this music has a whimsical sense of fun, certainly its strongest quality. The artists behind 'Joy Electric' infuse this music with something close to joy by maintaining a brisk tempo and relying heavily upon the techo-lite methods of their mainstream brethren. Oh yes, and in another world, I would have no doubt that a nightclub catering to... Christians would play this music. Yeah, it's kind of like that!
