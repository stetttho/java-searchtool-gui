 Kelly Clarkson has a strong confident voice that is sure to blossom in time, but her first single is a trivial, extraordinarily banal mess. The lyrics, penned by the ubiquitous Diane Warren, sound as though they were pulled from a new NBC soap opera theme song. I may forgive all this superficiality and melodrama if there were atleast a catchy hook, a pleasant melody, um...something to give this song some much needed resilience and substance. Unfortunately, Kelly Clarkson's first outing is extremely weak and undistinguished, an utter disappointment.  'American Idol' set out to catapult one lucky contestant to stardom, but this most certainly is not the  vehicle that will make that happen for Ms. Clarkson. Yikes!
