 This maxi-single is an absolute 'must have.' Here's what you get.  #1. Hey Jupiter (The Dakota Version)- One of the two greatest songs Tori has ever done, second only to her supreme achievement...the live version of 'Cooling.' (Check out the video too. It's one of her best!) #2. Sugar (Live)- This is a song that never deserved B-side status. Tori knew that and so she beefed it up into a dynamite rock song and included it in her '98 tour and on the live side of 'To Venus and Back.' #3. Honey (Live)- No other song recorded by Tori could possibly be this inexplicably absent from an LP.  The masterful studio version is available on the 'Cornflake Girl' maxi-single. Buy it today. It's easily one of her top 5 and as she suggests, was her personal favorite from the 'Under the Pink' sessions. #4. Professional Widow (Live)- It's great to have a live recording of a piece from 'Boys for Pele.' (Note: It's quite different from the studio version, a very risky venture to be sure...Tori really goes out on a limb. She admits as much!). The video recording of her NY concert contains some memorable performances of various songs from the 'Pele' sessions if you're curious as well. #5. Somewhere over the Rainbow (Live)- This ain't Judy Garland! Tori really makes this song her own in this bittersweet and very intimate rendition. The recording is close, but suits her style most beautifully. For what you get, and for this price...it's a steal! (P.S. Tori is positively flaky and, at times, hilarious on her pre-song banter too) Wow!
