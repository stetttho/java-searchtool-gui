 Put away that dusty copy of the 1971 film 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,' for Tim Burton's deliciously strange and outrageous film version of the famous novel is dare I say, better, a feast for the eyes and the ears. While some fans of the first film treatment will undoubtedly and stubbornly resist what Tim Burton has done here or trivialize Johnny Depp's weird and slightly maniacal performance, most others will be absolutely delighted. Burton's take is funnier, livelier, wittier, and all together more consistently entertaining than Mel Stuart's earlier film. The film is awash in color and bold and deleriously twisted set pieces. An enormous budget was spent creating this film and this fact is abundantly clear in every frame of the picture. However, the special effects and elaborate sets are always at the service of this fairy tale nightmare. Willy Wonka is given a history and motivation. Charlie is given more resonance and balance in relation to Willy Wonka and the other kids. The sinister and mischievous Oompas are funnier and are given some of the most over-the-top theatrical moments this side of Broadway. Overall, Burton's film version is truer to the spirit of the book and I do think the first film in Burton's career after his masterpiece 'Ed Wood,' that really stays true to the eccentric and amusingly bizarre character of Tim Burton himself. 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is NOT just a kid's film. Parents and other adults who still have imagination will find much to enjoy and see with this one. Certainly, one of Burton's best films. Not to be missed!
