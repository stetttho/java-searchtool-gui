 'News,' the new album by 80's icon Prince is "a new direction in music" as the brief linear notes indicate. Firstly, it may be 'news' to even observant music fans that Prince is currently  releasing new music. Secondly, the new direction spoken of may be somewhat fresher territory for Prince, but the creative output on his new LP isn't particularly new or original in any sense. Four langourous and meandering fully instrumental tracks sample elements of funk, jazz, soul, and lounge, similar to work done on Prince's previous album, 'The Rainbow Children,' but far less cohesive, thematically satisfying, or tuneful. The sense is that this LP was to be a dynamic improvised rush of sound and vision, a collaborative effort that yielded music with an air of spontaneity and coolness. Unfortunately, nothing on 'News' reveals much depth or inspiration. The musicians obviously enjoyed working together...joyful abandon is a noteworthy quality felt in this music. On the whole, however, while these lite jams are pleasant enough, they lack the raw energy and searing passion one might hope to find in a new Prince LP. None of the four tracks are particularly memorable. 'The Rainbow Children' hinted at something quite special indeed, a new and curious direction for Prince, but 'News,' fails to follow through.
