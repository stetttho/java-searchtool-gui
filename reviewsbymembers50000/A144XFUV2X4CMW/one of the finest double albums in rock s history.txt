 This album boggles my mind. The band has inspiration to spare, and they have never sounded as good as they do here. There isn't one single dud in this collection of 28 songs. 'Stadium Arcadium' is loaded with great tunes and should, if there is any justice in the music world, catapult the band into the stratosphere. Yeah, it's that good! Most double albums are bloated with filler tracks. Not so here! Pick up this album now! A MASTERPIECE!
