 'A Rush of Blood to the Head' is a bonafide great album. It deserves to be included among the best of the year, in the same breath as Bruce Springsteen's 'The Rising,' and the jaw dropping Doves release 'The Last Broadcast.' Their Grammy award winning debut 'Parachutes' delivered a lot of anticipation for a sophomore release. It too was a strong, gorgeous set. Coldplay's new release easily meets and exceeds expectations. In a day when rock albums have become collections of tired riffs and recycled melodies ready for FM radio consumption, Coldplay has developed a melancholy, yet shimmering and warm set blending consistency and vitality.  Attempting to address highlights on this album is simply lipservice. However, 'In My Place,' 'The Scientist,' and 'Warning Sign' are ideal check points throughout this album. Altogether, plaintive piano chords meld with pensive guitar licks and Chris Martin's heavenly falsetto. Curious? You should be! This is one of the 'must own' albums of 2002!
