 I have probably 5,000 albums (no kidding) and '1000 Kisses' is the one I cherish most. No matter the countless times I've listened to these sublime and overwhelmingingly powerful songs, the album never loses its impact. Instead, it grows more and more personal and meaningful with each and every listen. Patty Griffin never falters once on this collection. There's never a false moment, never a dull lyric or melody. Why mince words, it's the closest to perfection any musical artist has ever gone. All of Patty Griffin's albums are superb, but this one is extra special. Even in it's many quiet moments, it's still spine-tingling and harrowing. To know Griffin's music is to taste heaven on earth. If you're intrigued, you should be. You'll know exactly what I mean when you hear this album for the first time or the 500th. This one gets my vote for the greatest single album ever made. Yeah, move over 'The Beatles.'
