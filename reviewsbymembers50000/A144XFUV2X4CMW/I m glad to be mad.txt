 This is a beautiful album full of gorgeous orchestral arrangements and Taylor's rich operatic tenor. Um, wait! Can we start this over? Ah hem, this is a pulverizing, lascerating, mind bending, thirteen inch rusty nails in a coffin album full of death, destruction, screaming, and apocalyptic heresy. Contrary to their debut album, this one doesn't simply maul you, beat you to a bloody pulp, and then drop you off somewhere in Satan's lair. Indeed, 'Iowa' expands into a murderous fusion of raging riffs, ear splitting percussion, and lyrical content you can effectively scream at people you really hate. It's the kind of record that would likely be struck down by the hand of the almighty God if he did that sort of thing. Um, does he? Anyway, I love this behemoth. 'Iowa' goes in the player whenever I need something to drown my own lamentations and wailing. I especially love all the creepy dissonance and the mid album 'time-out' called 'Gently. Wow! Beat those drums, beat those drums! Grrrr!
