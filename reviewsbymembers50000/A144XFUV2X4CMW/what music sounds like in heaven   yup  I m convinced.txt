 First, I noticed that amazon.com offers the option of selecting both 'Dive' and 'Eden' to purchase together. Do this immediately! What a brilliant combo. This album is so richly rewarding and meticulously crafted. I've read many reviews suggesting that the lyrics are silly and even pretentious. Frankly, if someone mentions the lyrics in any kind of rhetoric about this album, they have completely missed what makes this album so powerful and masterful. I've listened to this album so many times, and have yet to put any stake on the lyrics when the musical soundscape is so incredible. I could care less about animal rights, "wet black leather on my skin," or the like.  In actuality, this is one album that can be listened to and appreciated by anyone in the world regardless of what language they speak. The music is universal. When I listen to 'Dive,' I am always transported to a place that I really love being. With each consecutive listen, I realize just how significant an achievement this album really is. Not once have I became bored with 'Dive.' Instead, everytime I pop it in, it's like heaven all over again. I absolutely adore this album with all my heart. It will always be in a lofty position among my thousands of CDs. So, turn the lights down now, ease into the sofa, cradle that tea cup, and experience the eternally enchanting music of 'Dive.' Oh, and don't forget to pick up 'Eden,' her other masterpiece.
