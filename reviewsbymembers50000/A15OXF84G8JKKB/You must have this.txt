 My review of the first volume pretty much applies here as well.  How many *calculus* texts have an introduction to complex variables, and the theory of analytic functions?  This is the only one I've ever seen, and I don't think anyone else could make it more enriching than Courant.  Useful material on vector calculus, the theory of matrices, and even introductory material on the *calculus of variations* (something we usually don't see at *all* in the undergrad curriculum) is included.  It is refreshing to have an instructor like Courant, who doesn't assume we can't follow higher mathematical roads, but also doesn't sit at the other end of the spectrum, just waving a wand and "poof, here is the result". Courant also published a standard reference work (also two volumes, I believe) on Mathematical Physics.  While the level of mathematics required is post-grad, I was still able to read sizeable sections of it without getting lost.   We can only hope Dover decides to publish Courant's works one day, to make them a little more affordable.  But still, you can buy both volumes of Courant's intro to calculus for about the same price as a modern calculus text that waters down the material, and on top of that, provides inadequate explanation for the material it does cover.
