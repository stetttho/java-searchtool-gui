 Actually, I got my copy at Best Buy for $5, but $10 is hardly excessive here.  "Night of the Living Dead" by George Romero needs no introduction.  It spawned an entire new genre of horror all by itself.  Vincent Price in the original "House on Haunted Hill" is fantastic.  While it may not have the CGI imagery of the remake (which is grossly overdone), it remains a genuinely creepy movie that unnerves me every time I watch it.  Deciding for yourself what things in the house are the creation of Price's character and which aren't is one of the fun parts of the film.  Also, never quite figured out if the housekeepers were ghosts.  I lean towards yes!  A final note on the third movie, "The Terror".  A *lovely* movie, which showcases an aged Boris Karloff as the "Baron" (he died a couple of years after this film) and a youthful Jack Nicholson as a young officer in Napoleon's army.  Nicholson had not yet evolved into the intense, brooding figure we saw later in "The Shining", but it is still clear that his star was rising.  He gives a respectable performance as a bewildered bystander to the mysterious events in the castle by the sea.  I remember seeing this movie on TV as a child and being transfixed by the climax of the movie, especially the last scene in the graveyard when he finds out his new girlfriend quickly loses her charm when her face melts.  Directed and produced by the legendary Roger Corman, this film is an overlooked gem of the genre.  Highly recommended for any true fan of classic horror, especially since it only seems to appear in this DVD collection.  Overall, I must say this DVD is a steal, buy it!
