 I have not much to add to the other reviews, just wanting to support with five stars. This book is about pilots, herostuff, the dawning of the space age and is very well researched: if you want to know about fighter pilots lives, their training, the first space modules etc, this is one to buy. And above all, it has an amazingly smart style, combining humor, facts, drama and tragedy to one big true! comedy about...the right stuff. You will laugh and learn at the same time! One of the best books I have read so far.
