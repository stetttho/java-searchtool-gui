 This book hosts almost all there is to know and is known, about the worlds favorite transcendental constant. ALso many proofs of the nature on pi. e.g. the one by Hilbert and Lindemann. As well as the proof of the irrationality of zeta(3).  Definitely worth the money, and this book should be famous but it isnt!  Mostly for the advanced math person though, but lots of articles for the layman!  Enjoy!
