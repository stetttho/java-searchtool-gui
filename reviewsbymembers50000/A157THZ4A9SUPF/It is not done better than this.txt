 I am a enthousiastic collector, and have almost all the Time Life rock n roll stuff, as well as Eric Records cds of this era. Although they are essential to any 50s 60s collection, nothing can top ACE series. I could comment like this on all the 50s remasters of this fabulous record label, not only these issues, but especially the Golden Age of American Rock n roll. I can not add anything to the positive reviews than simply summing up my personal view: 28 tracks per cd, and sometimes 30! (Time life is also excellent, but you get 15 per cd!) excellent booklets with background info (not surpassed by any label). not the same old songs over again, but many rare and still excellent tracks! last but not least amazing sound quality. So although you might have some songs there on other collections, it is for above mentioned points alone worth it to always have an ACE copy as well.
