 I have loads of cds of her, but this one almost has them all, and in the best soundquality.  I do not have anything to add to the info of the editorial reviews, but if you want a boxset of her, go for this one. The other one of EMI which has 3 cds is also good, but this one is better, more complete. It hosts e.g. the painfully beautiful Just A gigolo, so enjoy!
