 I am a enthousiastic collector, and have almost all the Time Life rock n roll stuff, as well as ACE cds of this era.  I could comment like this like I have on ACE editions, or the Eric Records HArd to Find 45s series. Excellent, and must have! A few points why: 20 tracks per cd (Time life is also excellent, but you get 15 per cd!) excellent booklets with background info not the same old songs over again, but many rare and still excellent tracks! last but not least amazing sound quality. So although you might have some songs there on other collections like ACE, it is for above mentioned points alone worth it to always have an Eric copy as well.
