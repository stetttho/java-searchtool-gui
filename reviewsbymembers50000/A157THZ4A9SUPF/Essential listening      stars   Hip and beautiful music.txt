 I agree with the reviews stating that the Audrey version should have been included. But just as Being Myself of Lena horne, this kind of CD gets better and better, the more often I play it. This really is the smooth and hip early 60ies style, with a big S for style. Moonriver is breathtaking, and many other songs are really nice as well.  And can anyone please tell me why beautiful movies and soundtracks like this are not made anymore???
