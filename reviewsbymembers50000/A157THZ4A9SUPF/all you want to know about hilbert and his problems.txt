 When I first heard of the hilbert problems, and how important they seemd to be for all of maths that evolved after that, since 1900 until present, I wanted to know more. This book is a very pleasant read for several reasons: It is easy to read and well explained, even if you dont grasp the full maths, still there is a story around every of the 23 problems that lets you understand the implication, and the full drama of its solution.  It is a nice biography of Hilbert the man, intertwined with the 23 problems, so it does not get boring like some biographies do with endless lists of calendar-facts. There is even a full translation of the original speech he gave in Paris in 1900, which otherwise would be impossible to find. The problems itself are well explained, as well in the timeframe of 1900, when first posed, as later in our time when maths was ready to solve them. The author did a good job also telling which of the problems really were important, really gave mahts further problems to think about, and which problems didnt give rise to new mathematical areas, and therefore became more or less curiosities after solution. Reading this book gave me a feeling of how beautiful maths can be, how unexpectedly some problems can and cannot be solved, and evokes some of the drama of the worlds biggest minds at work. If you are interested in maths and/oir in science and great minds: this is an excellent read!
