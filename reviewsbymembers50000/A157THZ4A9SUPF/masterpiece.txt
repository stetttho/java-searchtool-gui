 No doubt that big names like the Beatles, the Stones, Zeppelin, Queen and Hendrix might have had a bigger impact on pop history, but this is just one of those rare brilliant songs that is timeless in its own way. I compare it  with great ones like Mickey, Amoureux solitaires, Clouds across the Moon  and Everybody's got to learn sometimes, hits that gave popmusic its colour,  songs that we will take with us in this new century. Only the best music  can be played over and over again, without loosing its quality. This is one  of those songs. Buy it!
