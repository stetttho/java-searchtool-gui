 I have a very extensive music collection, and was looking for something missing: that beautiful but haunted and lonely sound of Ennio Morricone's music: spaghetti westerns! I was simply looking for all the soundtracks from those countless obscure Italian Westerns that where made in the 60s and 70s. But how to find them, or worse, the titles? This collection, as well as Part 2, 3, and 4, hosts them probably all. It also has an extensive booklet with very good info on the music, as well as the movies that made them, or is it the other way around? This set is simply the best Italian Western music money can buy, and should be famous and sold-out! I recommend to buy all 4 sets!
