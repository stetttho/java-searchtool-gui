 This writer poses a sort of computerprogram, with which our of nothing, something has to be. It intertwines with general theories about the nature of the universe, and big bang yes or no.  It is a very compact book, but very interesting and original in explaining a possible way to start a universe, just like the inflationary theorie does. Read it with Einstein and the expanding universe of Amir D. Aczel.
