 Well, of course in every Greatest hits compilation, there are songs not on this cd. To start positively: almost all the songs you are looking for are included, as well as some interesting bee gees remakes of originals, of songs written by them, but were sung by other artists. The only song I think is really missing is Paying the price of love, but nevertheless, its a great cd, that includes much more than the Very best of, which was only 1 cd.
