 Admittedly, the British showed the most beautiful and charming TV series ever with the breathtaking Brideshead Revisited, but the American answer to this was this knock-out series that saved the 80s: Miami Vice. The British might be the specialists in charm, but Miami Vice invented the word and meaning of 'cool'. Sonny and Crockett, a perfect duo, in ridiculously expensive and fashionable clothes and vehicles, the GREAT music, the action, the mysterious chief, the fantastic filming technique used by Michael Mann that also made Manhunter such a great classic: I will never get over that horrible last episode with the shaking of hands and the driving off of Sonny in his stolen Ferrari...But thank God this is the first part of this series that set the standard for all good looking and slick films, series and music videos to come.
