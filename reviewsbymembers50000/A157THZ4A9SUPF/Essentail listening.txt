 To be short: I agree with all the 5 stars recommendations, and if you are looking for some of the greatest music of all time, this is the compilation! I recommend this double cd more than the one cd Very best of, just e.g. because the song Stardust is included in this one. But its not the only breathtaking song.  I never listened to him so much before, but now I am a fan. Very very higly recommended!
