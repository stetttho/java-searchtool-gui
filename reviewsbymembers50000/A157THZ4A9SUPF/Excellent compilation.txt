 I have a lot of surfmusic from the 60s, and I loved the Tell Em I'm surfin song. There a quite a few more that almost touch on this one on this cd, so well worth it! This group perhaps should have been more famous, but they were doing a lot behind the screen, working for guys like e.g. Jan And Dean. But for the surf-fans they will live on, and for this kind of listeners this cd has to be in your collection! Excellent sound, good cd, recommended!
