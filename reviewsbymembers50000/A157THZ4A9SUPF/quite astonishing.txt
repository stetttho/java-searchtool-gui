 Quite astonishing, wrote one critic, and this, often very dreamy, book of 1915!!! is exactly this. I am not a movie critic, just a reader and this book was a delight to read. It deals about the era of the silent movies, around 1915 when there were no Rambos or Terminators running across the screen with Qsound and computerised warping effects. It was the time when everything had to be expressed in gestures, like a moving picture book, because of the lack of sound. The author therefore comes with a lot of interesting theories and opinions of how a story could and should be elegantly communicated in a moving picture. He even comes up with a theory of why California is as crazy as Hollywood seems to most of us now. This work has to be a classic of movie pictures, just like The Art of War for the military, or Keynes for economics, and for people that are, like me, just interested readers of all kind of subjects, also highly recommended.
