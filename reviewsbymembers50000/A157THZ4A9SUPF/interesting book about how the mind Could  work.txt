 I dont have much to add to the other reviews, only that if you want to know something about our brain, our mind, about how unique life is etc, this book is one to read, just like Chance and Necessity is, or the Anthropic Cosmological Principle, to give some examples. His style of writing is, as a review put is, as scientific writing should be: witty, erudite, and clear. the facts, and his conclusion about them are good reading, and at the end it leaves enough space to make up your mind yourself. You will be sure not to agree with all in it, but you will definitely read some facts about human nature you never thought of like that before: and you keep them for the rest of your life, not bad for a few dollars!
