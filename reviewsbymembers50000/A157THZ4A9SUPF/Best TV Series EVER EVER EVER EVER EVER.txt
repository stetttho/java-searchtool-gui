 As the cover said, this is the TV series that still stands as the benchmark for others. Knock-out performances by the incomparable Laurence Olivier, Jeremy Irons and last but not least in my opnion the best character ever put down on film: Sebastian by Anthony Andrews.  Well, all will know this story about romantic yearning, friendship, loss and mostly the English charm of it. In a concluding scene with Charles Ryder he was told by an old studentfriend that that charm (of Sebastian) was dangerous, and that it almost took the best of him.  And that might be true in a general sense: once seen it is hard to come to terms with it, first that this series is finite, and second the tragic fate of indeed the most charming person on screen yet, Sebastian, that sort of friend that we are all looking for, but who is so hard to find!
