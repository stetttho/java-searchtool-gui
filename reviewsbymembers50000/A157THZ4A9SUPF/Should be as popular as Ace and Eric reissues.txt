 I am a enthousiastic collector, and have almost all the Time Life rock n roll stuff, as well as ACE and Eric records cds of this era.  Honestly, if you go for 50s 60s songs, Ace and Eric records are unsurpassed, in their song selection and booklets info. But this is a highly forgotten collection that still hosts amazingly enough some songs that are no where else to be found. Ok some of them esp. of the 70s and 80s do not belong there, but that still leaves you with enough gemms I would say. So this whole series is excellent, and must have! A few points why: 20 tracks per cd (Time life is also excellent, but you get 15 per cd!) not the same old songs over again, but many rare and still excellent tracks! last but not least good sound quality.
