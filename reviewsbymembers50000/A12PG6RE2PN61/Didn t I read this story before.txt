 If I didn't know this was by an author that I've never read before, I could swear I've read this book before.  Thin plot?  You bet.  This one's been done over and over, from Cinderella on.  The only saving grace is that the characters are well developed.  Other than that, I skipped major pages and didn't miss a thing. Do yourself a favor.  If you want to try this one, buy it used.  It's been done.
