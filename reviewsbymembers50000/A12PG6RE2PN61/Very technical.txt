 I love Elizabeth Lowell, but her books are getting a little too much technical details for me. I started to get bogged down in the technical aspects of 12th century illuminated manuscripts, thereby missing the plot. The basic story and the romantic suspense are great, but I don't think that the level of detail that she's been putting into her books is meant for the average, intelligent reader. I found this to be the case with other of her more recent works also. If you can overlook all of the technical details of illuminated manuscripts and just concentrate on the plot, this is a good book.  If you want to know everything about 12th century illuminated manuscripts this is a great book for you.
