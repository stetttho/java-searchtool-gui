 Based on the other reviews, my expectations were high.  I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed.  The first part where Miranda is "ruined" is truly unbelievable.  When Miranda and the Duke meet again five years later, there seems to be a lot of missing information.  I thought there was a chapter missing.  Then, the rest of the action is either predictable or far-fetched.  I've read Romance for 30+ years, and I could barely finish this book. I'm sorry to say this, since I always am on the lookout for a new author and a new plot twist.
