 It was a pleasure to revisit the Donovan family, and watch Faith finally meet her match.  With each book in this series, I've learned something about the international jewel trade too.  I'd love for this series to  continue, maybe with the youngest boys story next?  Please Ms. Lowell?   It's so much fun to check in the Donovans that I just hate for it to each  book to end.
