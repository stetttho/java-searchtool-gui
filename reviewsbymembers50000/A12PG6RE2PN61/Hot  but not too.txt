 Sam (short for Samantha) has been an accountant for the local bank. On her way to do an appraisal of a property that the bank is planning to foreclose on, she finds out that she's lost her job due to a corporate merger.  She's led a very boring, predictable life.  Now, with nothing to lose, she strikes a deal with the owner of the property -she'll give him her financial advise if he'll give a week of hot sex - no stings attached! Although the premise is far-fetched, the characters are totally lovable.  Sam and Ryder have that great instant sexual attraction, and then you can actually watch them falling in love.  The threat of financial ruin makes Ryder act a litte like a jerk, but these two find there way without too many misunderstandings.  The thing I like best is that Sam is so straightforward.  She confronts issues head on, and doesn't run or try to hide from them. This is a most enjoyable read.
