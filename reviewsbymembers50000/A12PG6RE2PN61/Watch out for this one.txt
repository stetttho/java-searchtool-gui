 I've been reading romance forever, and there's nothing I love better than discovering a new author.  Cherry Adair is a wonderful find.  The action in this book is non-stop, I couldn't put it down either.  Marnie and Jake make a beautiful couple.  With the exception of the last few pages, nothing about their relationship is predictable.  I also liked the strong sense of family in this book.  I can't wait for her next novel.  Cherry, you've made a new fan!
