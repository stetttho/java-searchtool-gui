 I had to stay up late to finish this book in one sitting!  The story line was fun and not too complex.  The passion between Emma and Edison was explosive, and unpredictable.  Having read Romance for a long time, I was  still taken by surprise when these two came together!  I think the story  stretched the imaginable a bit.  The "Strategies of..." were a  bit far-fetched, as was the ease with which Edison managed to go outside  the circle,  but all in all it was a FUN book to read, with great  characters and a plot that moved along nicely.
