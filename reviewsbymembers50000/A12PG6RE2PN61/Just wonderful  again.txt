 Julia Quinn has done it again.  She's created wonderful characters that you just have to love.  But the thing I loved the most about this book is how both of these characters love and respect their family.  With such a beautiful younger step-sister, Kate could have been bitter.  And although you'd love to dislike Anthony, you always know by the way he treats his family he's just a good guy at heart.  The tension between these two is apparent from the first, and it only gets better. I highly recommend this book as another "winner" from a wonderful author.
