 Did you ever read a romance novel that was so predictable it was difficult to keep going?  This isn't one of those.  When you think that the plot is going to go the typical direction, it doesn't.  I love that!  It saves a lot of unnecessary heartache. This is a wonderful book.  There's plot, sexual tension and true love.  Although I did anticipate what would turn out to be the heroine's major dilemma early on, that too did not go the predictable way. If you like a romance that has a story line that's a little out of the ordinary, and if you like them HOT, buy this book!
