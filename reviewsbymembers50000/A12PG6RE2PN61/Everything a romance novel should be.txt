 I couldn't stop reading this one, even though it was past 11 pm, and I had to work the next day!  The hero was a rugged Texan, wounded in the past.  The heroine is sweet and compassionate.  The story is just wonderful.  This book has everything that romance fans read romance for.  I highly recommend this book to anyone.
