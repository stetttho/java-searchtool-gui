 I've read every Catherine Coulter book since the first romance series which I believe was about 20 years ago.  Having read her and hundreds of other "romance" novelists through the years, I find that I absolutely love the direction she and other so-called romance novelists are going in.  After all, how many times can the Cinderella story be told?  So, the addition of mystery and intrigue to her plots is great. Is the romance there?  Of course! And its the enduring kind.  Some of the best characters reappear from previous works. Was the romance between the new characters resolved?  Not really, but does it have to be?  Keep up the great work Ms. Coulter, and I'll keep buying your books forever.
