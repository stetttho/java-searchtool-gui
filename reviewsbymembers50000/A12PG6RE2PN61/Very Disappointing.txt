 If you like romance with a touch of the erotic, you're going to be very disappointed by this one.  The first two stories are awful, even though they are by some of my favorite authors.  The third story is ok, but not erotic by any stretch. Only the last story lives up to its advertising.  It's HOT. So my recommendation is skip this one entirely, unless you don't mind losing money on 3 out of 4.
