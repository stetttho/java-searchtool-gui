 This one really kept me wondering (and up until midnight guessing!)  I could not figure out who the Femme Fatale was, who the stalker was, or even if they were the same person.  The romance was a little sudden with the  amount of distrust between Carlie and Rio, and some of the book was a  little choppy, but overall, a VERY good read.
