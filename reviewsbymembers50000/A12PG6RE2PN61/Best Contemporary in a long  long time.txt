 I simply loved this book.  It had it all - mystery, suspense, romance - and it's HOT!  Believe me, the heat is not just because it takes place in a tropical rain forest.  The two main characters steam things up from the first page. I read a lot of contemporary writers, but I have to say that this is the best I've read in quite a long time.  I just hope Ms. Adair is working on another book.
