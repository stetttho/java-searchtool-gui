 Before adding this to your cart or wish list, I have to warn you that some may be very unsatisfied with this collection of Christmas episodes. In other words, I rented this, and I just couldn't enjoy it. Christmas specials were never a strong suit for South Park. "Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics" is probably the WORST South Park episode ever to air. Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo hosts a Christmas show with parody songs and scenes with the regular South Park Characters. That's about it. Hankey is annoying as ever, the songs and musical scenes are TERRIBLE., the episode is pointless, and if not for the second one on the DVD, "Merry Christmas Charlie Manson", this collection would be nothing more than a worthless piece of cr*p more so than Hankey himself. Fortunately though, this does include "Merry Christmas Charlie Manson" which will mildly amuse some South Park viewers whether or not they've seen it. The episode Chinpokomon which makes fun of the infamous franchise is just annoying. You might like it the first time around, but if you buy it, it'll just get more and more mindless and stupid. I know this from my own experience. These episodes do NOT satisfy. If you STILL get a kick out of this show after all these years, that's fine. This one isn't worth it, but you've seen good reviews here too, so buy at your own risk.
