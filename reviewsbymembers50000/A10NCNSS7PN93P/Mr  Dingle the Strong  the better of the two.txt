 A decent volume of the Twilight Zone Collection. I wasn't too crazy about the second episode, "Two", but I loved the first one, "Mr. Dingle the Strong". This is a humorous story of a meek, constantly beat-on vaccuum cleaner salesman named Luther Dingle (played by the great Burgess Meredith) who happens to be the lucky test subject of a two-headed alien who, without Dingle knowing what's happening, gives him super-human strength. The humor in this episode lies in how Meredith shows off his new power. Don Rickles guest stars in this episode as a rough man named Bragg. This is the one worth watching. Enjoy!
