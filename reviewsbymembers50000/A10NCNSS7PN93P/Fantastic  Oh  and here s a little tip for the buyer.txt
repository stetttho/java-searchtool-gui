 This movie is Excellent (That's right... with a capital "E"). However, before I start praising this movie, may I send the shoppers my strong recommendation.... If you're going to buy this movie, buy the Italian version with English SUBTITLES. This way, you'll be able to enjoy the true talents of Roberto Benigni and the rest of the All-Star Italian cast. THE ENGLISH DUBBED VOICES ARE NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD. It may be hard for some to get used to the subtitles and reading and listening to Italian while at the same time trying to follow the movie visually, but that's only for the first 15 minutes of the movie. After that, you'll be so used to them, sometimes the chracters will seem to be speaking English (Well figuratively speaking anyway). With that out of the way, ... The movie itself comes highly recommended for a good laugh and/or cry. Why this film wasn't the winner of "Best Picture" is beyond my comprehension. The story, the script and the humorous and outstanding acting make this movie a must-see to anyone. But you don't have to take my word for it. Buy this movie (Remember... the subtitled version) with full speed.
