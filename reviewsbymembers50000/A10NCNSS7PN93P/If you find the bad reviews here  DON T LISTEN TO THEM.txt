 Anyone who badly rated this game should be flattened. Maybe someone could pound them with a Super Hammer to set them straight.  Seriously, as to what I think, this game is excellent. True, it may not be 3-D, or it may not be like the origonal Super Mario RPG, but it's full of highly addictive game play. Once you start, you won't be able to stop. Not only that, but this game is not, by any means, hard. Any kid can pick up on this game and master gameplay in minutes, or seconds. Ok, here's the lowdown. Mario is at a party at Princess Peach's castle. Everything's going well until you find that Bowser has stolen the Star Rod, an ancient, wish and power granting tresure from Star Haven, and he's captured the Star Spirits, the guardians of the Haven. He's used the Star Rod to make himself practically invincible. Suddenly the Castle rises in the air, lifted by Bowser's new fortress. Bowser has taken over the castle and defeats Mario with his new powers. Upon reviving, Mario knows he must save the Princess, and he soon learns about the overall importance of his quest, to save the Star Spirits, to defeat Bowser, to save Princess Toadstool, and indeed Mario's World. Buy this game, and prepare for a journey with battles, new allies, new enemies, puzzles, surprises, and a whole lot more. However, you don't have to take my word for it. If you're a Mario or Nintendo fan, or if you're just seeking a nice, fun, humorous, and action packed adventure game, then you have to buy, or at least rent, Paper Mario. Trust me. It's worth it.
