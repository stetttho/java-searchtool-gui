 The best TZ edition I've ever seen. I got the 2-video set just before they went out of stock. This set includes some of the hugest masterpieces in the history of the Twilight Zone.  In volume 1, we see a very interesting film in which Serling himself introduces the Twilight Zone to potential sponsors followed by the pilot episode, "Where is Everybody?" (starring Earl Holliman). Then, the controversial, kind of ho-hum episode involving an ex WWII mariner (Neville Brand) and a Japanese-American(George Takei), "The Encounter", and the best one on the tape, "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge". Volume 2 has probably the best TZ episodes ever made: "Eye of the Beholder", "The Masks", and "The Howling Man". To top it off, a vintage edition of the Mike Wallace Interview with Rod Serling about his career and about censorship in television. If only they hadn't stopped making this in video form. It's much cheaper than buying both DVDs, and it comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
