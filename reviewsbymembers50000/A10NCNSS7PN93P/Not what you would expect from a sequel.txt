 This is a surprisingly good follow up to the Hitchcock classic. Anthony Perkins is back as Norman Bates as he is found sane and released from an asylum. He moves back to the house at the Bates Motel. As part of his parole, he is hired to work at a diner where he meets Mary, a waitress who has fallen out of a relationship. Norman sympathetically takes her to stay at the Bates Motel. Immediately following this, Norman sees and hears his "Mother". As murders take place one by one, Norman finds himself in a psychological battle with himself. There are some great suspense scenes in this movie, but towards the end it leans more toward graphic, gratuitous violence. Anyway this will pass most expectations and can be recommended for fans or viewers of the original Psycho.  It kind of goes without saying that this is nowhere near as good as its predecessor (very few movies are). Without Hitchcock, it's missing a bit of the favorable filming style of course. Still, worth watching. Beware of the other sequels though.
