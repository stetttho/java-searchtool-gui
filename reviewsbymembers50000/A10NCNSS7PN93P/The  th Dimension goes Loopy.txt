 This volume includes my favorite episode, "Once Upon A Time", A crazy episode that takes place in the year 1890, in a little town of Harmony, NY. Silent Film star Buster Keaton stars as a Woodrow Mulligan, a disgruntled janitor of a scientist who invents a time helmet that accidentally transports Mulligan into the year 1962. The craziest thing about this episode is that in the scenes of Harmony in 1890, you see the episode in silent film formant with piano music, captions, and sped up filming. Then in the scenes of Harmony in 1962, the episode goes to origonal TZ format with dialogue and sound. Anyway, the episode is hilarious. A must-see for TZ viewers, and just about everyone else.
