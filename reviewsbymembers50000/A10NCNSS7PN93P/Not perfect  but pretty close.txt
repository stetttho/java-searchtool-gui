 This album is a bit different in style from the origonal Pure Moods. The first half of the album supplies the best songs. "The Mummer's Dance" and "Montezuma" are among the most lifting songs on the whole CD. And most of the other songs are simply stunning and beautiful. I don't think "Chariots of Fire" qualifies as a relaxing New Age song, but it's always nice to listen to. Unfortunately, The CD does get boring after a while. Not every song here is 100% easy to enjoy. While most of the songs are very good, the "pure mood" kind of wears off toward the end. Although this isn't as good as the first Pure Moods, it's definitely a good one. Anyone being introduced to the Pure Moods series or have bought or heard the first album, should give this one a try.
