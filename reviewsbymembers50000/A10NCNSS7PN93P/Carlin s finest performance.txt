 George is at his best in the now classic performance at Carnegie Hall. It starts off with his one liner about abortion, then moves on through hilarious routines about food, dogs, cats, and much more. It includes several outrageous observations, and the grand finale about dirty words will have audiences clutching their sides and falling off their chairs. The hilight of the show is when Carlin performs a headline news skit. This is highly recommended for all Carlin fans.
