 I think this IS one of Carlin's finer shows. The beginning is outrageous as Carlin explains the language he will not be using for the show, and the routine that follows ("Life's Little Moments") had me in stitches for weeks especially when he describes shaking hands with someone who's missing a few fingers. Carlin goes on to one of his many routines about dogs, expresses his thoughts on cancer, talks about stupid people, the humorous side of rape, feminists, blowjobs, prostitution, his good ideas (Including the Sony S***man), things we never see or hear, things we don't want to hear, organ donor programs, comatose, and ends with a tight discussion on words and euphemisms. All the while making his traditional goofy faces and voices which just add to the laughs. This is a very entertaining special and comes recommended.
