 I thought this was an excellent episode, one of the better episodes of Deep Space Nine. Quark accidently kills a drunk klingon, and as a result the Klingon's wife comes looking for revenge, and kidnaps Quark, and takes  him back to the Klingon Homeworld. Where the widowed klingon has to fight  for her family's honor, and Quark after marrying her helps, by looking at  the finances of the house, and helps her keep the family's honor.
