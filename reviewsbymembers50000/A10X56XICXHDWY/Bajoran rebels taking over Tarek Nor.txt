 This was a very good episode. Jake Sisko and Chief O'brien are doing work in a seldom used part of the station, Commander Sisko comes in and checks on them.  Jake and Miles while trying to decode some hidden Cardassian  computer codes trigger off a defense warning trapping them in that part of  the station, and putting the whole station on alert. Apparently Dukat had  a computer program installed in case the Bajorans tried to take over the  station during the occupation. Dukat noticing some problems, beams in and  finds Dax, Kira, Bashir, and Garak trapped by a laser beam from the food  replicator that is designed for everyone except Cardassians. But when Dukat  is finally convinced by Kira to deactivate the defense systems, his  over-confidence is shattered when his father secretly over-rides Dukats  codes, so that Dukat can't be a coward, and escape the destruction of the  station. Meanwhile Jake, Ben, and Miles are trying to escape through  ducts, because a poisonous gas is being released. Jake is able to fit  through a small hole in the duct and open a door so that the other two can  get out.  The commander and Miles go through a firey tunnel to get to the  main computer system, and deactivate the self-destruct sequence before the  station is destroyed. O'Brien is overcome by the gas half-way down the  tunnel, and Jake pulls him out in time.  Commander Sisko makes it to the  main computer and deactivates the self-destruct sequence, just seconds  before the station is  destroyed.
