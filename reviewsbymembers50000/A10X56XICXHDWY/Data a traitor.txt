 Part I left off with Picard, Geordi, and Troi surrounded by the Borg, and they find out that Lore is involved, and so is Data.  Data is being controled by Data.  Data takes Geordi's visor away from him, and later  Commander Data does some experiments on him. we find out that these  particular Borgs' are separted from the collective, and we see Hue is  there. (Hue was once rescued by the Enterprise crew, and the crew instead  of sending him back to the collective with self-destruct computer codes to  destroy the Borg, Picard and the crew are sympathetic and send him back,  with computer program on indivduality.) This disorients the Borg, and have  turned to Lore who will be their leader, and bring order to them. Picard,  Troi, and LaForge, escape and break the control Lore and on Data. Once free  from Lore's control, Data fights with Lore, and defeats him. Data is forced  to destroy Lore. Hue and the rest of the Borg on that planet try and find  order with their lives.
