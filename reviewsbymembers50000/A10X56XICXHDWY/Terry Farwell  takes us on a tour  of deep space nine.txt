 I thought this was very good, they showed the model of Deep Space Nine.  They explained a little about how they did the sound effects, for instance, how they put in the laser beam effect after they fire a phaser. It was very  interesting how they explained how they made Odo's shapeshifting scene's  look real. and each of the actors explained a little about their parts, but  I was surprised that avery brooks did not make an appearance on this video.  Terry did a very good job on this tour.
