 Worf has resigned from starfleet to go and help prevent a klingon war from erupting. The Duros sisters are trying to take over the empire with the help of the Romulans.  Picard, meanwhile, pursuades Star Fleet to help in  the Civil war indirectly. Picard takes charge of a fleet of ships, and sets  of blockcade at the Klingon-Romulan border, with tachyon beams suspended  between each of the starships, and puts Data and Riker each in command of a  starship, If a cloaked ship passes through the tachyon's, that ship will  show up on sensors. As the Captain orders the fleet to move away, Data  saves the day, by disobeying a direct order, and fires energy beams,  uncovering Romulan Warbirds entering klingon space. Once discovered, the  Romomulans retreat back to their space, deserting the Duross sisters. Once  the sisters find they are abandoned they escape, and Worf helps Chancellor  Gawron stay in power. Worf returns to duty on the Enterprise.
