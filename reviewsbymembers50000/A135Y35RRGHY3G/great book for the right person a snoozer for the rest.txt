 I wanted to like this book. Great title,enticing blurbs,a respected author.And,if I was  into a very detailed read on the chemistry of our brains,the nature of human thought,and the mechanics of how we perceive,then I would have loved it.And if those topics are of interest to you, buy this book.But don't get this book if you are looking for practical, hands on advice on marketing you or your services. The book's best chapter is "Memory,Metaphor,and Stories" and it has some useful concepts that you can put into practice,but no where near as useful as books like the Story Factor by Annette Simmons.
