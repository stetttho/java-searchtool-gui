           Somewhere  along the way, Vowell got a false rap---gentle funny, a real Will Rogers type, the girl next door. Not really. While her latest is like a long talk with a long lost friend--- random, meandering, informative(she quotes the journal of the guy who did the autopsy on President Lincoln to great effect and tells us that they  passed around the spine of President Garfield at the trial of his assassin)---it is also much more: a sharp rebuke to racisim, an unbridled attack on those who wage "optional wars"(what a great phrase), and a lament of life( telling us that although historical flukes are fun and give us meaning " life is still pretty meaningless and death is the only true democracy."). Tough talk for a girl next door. I'll take my Vowell straight.
