       Next time you're at the airport, drop by the book kiosk and pick this book up. I did, and I am the better for it. You'll finish by the time you land. And here is what you'll know that you did not before you took off: it's ok to be yourself when you communicate at work---just because you are standing behind a podium, you don't need to sound like the smartest person in the room, or do ten minutes of throat clearing, or use fifty cent words to make a five cent point. No, be authentic, be yourself, be liberated.       Fugere and company take you through how to find your voice---eschew the general and focus on the concrete,  dump the jargon that hides the truth and simply tell it, understand that email makes cowards of us all and start talking  face to face. Lots of examples are given from NASA lingo leading to space shuttle crashes to Orwell like pronouncements from Enron leading to economic collapse.       And there is a bonus. End the book and you'll start to realize that  poor communication, miscommunication, and no communication lead to unethical decisions.         How you say something is just as important as why you say. Know that, and communication liberation is yours.
