      Not a bad song or rendition on this CD. The take on the great Phil Ochs song,"I Ain't Marching Anymore" is worth the price---it's a brassy, bold, and in your face cover, the way I imagine Ochs would have liked it. A few of the words have been changed but it only adds to the power of his signature song. The lead off, Simon's "Bleeker Street" is very effecting, Brooke's vocals are coffee house pitch perfect. A great effort.
