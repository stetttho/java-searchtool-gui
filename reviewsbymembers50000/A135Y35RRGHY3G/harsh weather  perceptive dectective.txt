     The weather is a character ---harsh, relentless, cold---in this small gem.  The plot lines are multiple, thoughtful, and are at first like peering into an Icelandic storm. Hard to see but they emerge bit by bit: the consequences of rapes from 25 years ago; the abuse of a daughter; the separation of the protagonist from his own child; the facing of evil but not slipping into it. The best passage---the unearthing of a body, in both senses of the word. No easy resolutions, no simple answers. What more can a lover of dectective fiction want?
