 Why did Enron go bad? A good question and the answer is as old as time and one relearned again and again---greed,arrogance,and ignorance,with the weak exploited and the strong rewarded(at least for a time). Recall the passage in the Bible:  "he who makes haste to be wealthy shall not be innocent." Bulls eye. Bryce looks at Skilling(a very smart guy who latched onto mark to market accounting where inflated revenues were booked,but no cash came in,but why care since Skilling's bonus was a percentage of revenue); Lay who ordered that his sister's travel agency be given all the travel booking from enron and who used several company planes for whatever struck his fancy;Fastow(who most surely will end up in jail)who dreamed up the off balance sheet partnerships that allowed Enron to take debt off its balance sheet while making him tens of millions: and the clueless Board of Directors who voted to suspend the ethics code to let Andy do it. Bryce explains it all---clearly,without jargon,and with a sense of muted outrage.And ask yourself---would I become seduced by its go go culture,its aura, the money?At the end of the day,Bryce concludes that a company goes bad when the top does not care and shows it.
