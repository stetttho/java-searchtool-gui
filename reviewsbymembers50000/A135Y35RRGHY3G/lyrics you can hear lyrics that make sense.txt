 Buy this CD. The first three songs alone are worth it.First up,"Mexican Wine" a zen like story on sorrow and life and why you should get up in the AM; second,"Bright Future in Sales",a funny and all too true look at work and drinking,and why one leads to the other;and in third,"Stacy's Mom" which speaks to every teen boys fantasy of his friend's mom. The entire CD is infused with a good natured look at people---foibles,warts,and all.Like their other albums,they look at the work world, how we make a living and what it does to us.And unlike a lot of CDs you can make out the words that are being sung;it does not come out like so much mariachi music,evertything sounding like one long incomprehensible song. Take a listen;you won't be disapppointed.
