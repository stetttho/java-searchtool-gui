 Here is the book's big idea:advertising can't buy you a brand identity,and if you try to spend your way to it,you will just be throwing your money away.The book explains why and along the way you pick up how to build a brand,what advertising is designed for,and learn a lot about ad agencies and how they believe that their job begins and ends at being "creative" without regard to whether the ad agency's product makes the client money. A user friendly writing style and interesting ideas.
