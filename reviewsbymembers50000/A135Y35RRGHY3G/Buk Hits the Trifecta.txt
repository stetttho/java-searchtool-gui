       In the latest from the archive  of his poetry comes a luminous(he would have hated the word but understood its  truth) book, written near the end of his life. The old themes are there: finding out that  tragedy is getting what you want, as he observes in "the waitress at the yogurt shop", the boys drooling around her, fixated on her body and oblivious to the harsh and hissing voice and pities the future husband listening to its "horrible reality." Yet there is more of the domestic, an old mans' happiness on learning to type poems---more and more---on a computer,"going,going,gone") and   a bravdo, both real,"the last good night/is not yet here" from "taking the 8 count", and false ,as in "hello there", "when death comes with its last cold kiss/ i'll be ready;just another whore come to shake me down." And the final poem,"mind and heart"  a graceful good bye to life.It is Bukowski at his best---knowing that for every hard truth there is a saving grace.
