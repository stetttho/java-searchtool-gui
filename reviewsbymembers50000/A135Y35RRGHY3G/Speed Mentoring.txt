      Recall Gladwell's description in Blink about speed dating? Well, this is speed mentoring---33 idea bursts about getting better,and getting better faster. Some of the Big Ideas: consensus kills; make mistakes but learn from them---otherwise it is just something that happened to you;  know there is value from seeing what's both on the surface and  what's beneath it. And the killer lesson, running through each: it's when you think you are safe that you are most likely in danger.  Useful, easy to digest, well worth a second and third read.
