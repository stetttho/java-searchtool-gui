      Like Columbus, I was looking for one thing and found another---namely, Tom Russell. Never heard of the guy. Now that I have, I plan on filling out my collection of his stuff. This is not one weak song on this album. Starts off with a strong, I am in the fight now and forever number,"the Pugulist at 59". Got some regret numbers, like "All the fine young woman" and the "sound of one heart breaking" and a few of redemption and of the it will be all right variety, like "It Goes Away." The songs are, in fact all, about Love and Fear. But they are pivot songs, written by someone who has learned a few(well, more than a few) lessons but still has time to put the lessons to use. Like the writer said, life can only be understood looking backwards, but lived going forward. Russell gets that and we are all the better for it.
