       Roth has written a novel that strikes at what we all  know but few face---that we will die, that it will be hard work(for most), and that we go it alone. And it is a viewpoint told from a man's perspective, a man who is unnamed and an average man---not in the sense of worth but in the sense of math---3 marriages, a couple of affairs, three kids(one who loves him and the others indifferent), a good career. His average man faces the inevitable, unprepared as we all are, and learns hard lessons, as he tells his daughter," There's no remaking reality. Just take it as it comes. Hold your ground and take it as it comes." He learns, perhaps too late, that a woman's value is often inside; that nothing is without risk; that, yes, he would do it all again. It's  the lesson of empathy that Roth weaves in and out---for the unamned everyman and for us. And, contrary to the black cover, it is, finally a book about the impulse to life, perhaps not always wisely lived, but lived nonetheless. The writing, as always, is lyrical.
