      Reading Auster is a little like looking at an expensive wedding dress---it's elegant and well put together but you wear it once, and never again. Same with his latest novel---it has the same powerful narrative pace, and assortment of vivid characters as his others,but you never go back to it, you never underline the passages to read again.  He is a one note writer---odd things happen in life, life is random, we do A expecting B, but get X instead.This time he imposes his framework on a group in Brooklyn who randomly and by accident coalasce into a family, some by blood, some not, one of whom is a female impersonater and one of whom is a con man. (The actions of the first at the funeral of the second makes for a powerful passage.) It is a Valentine of sorts to the power of "family"( I notice that the book is dedicated to his young daughter) which is a theme he has never really taken up. He tacks on a truncated theme at the end---all lives have value, the ordinary in life is often extraordinary just waiting to be noticed. And that fits him well---there is an extraordinary book in him, made up of the daily, that needs to get out. This one just isn't it.
