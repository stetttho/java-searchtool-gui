      Carhart asks a provocative question: why would Lee throw 13,000 troops at the main federal line when he had 50,000? His answer is that Lee, following some classic battles, had some columns trying to get to the federal rear but they were stopped by a brave, determined, and very out numbered George Armstrong Custer. A great idea for an article but a bad one for a book. If you buy it, skip over the long , tedious  and very basic background chapters, and go to chapter 15, which describes Custer's brave fight. If a military history buff, buy the book(although wait for the paperback). If not, move on.
