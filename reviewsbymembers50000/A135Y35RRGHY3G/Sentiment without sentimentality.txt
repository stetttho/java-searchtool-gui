       Sobule threads the needle, yet again---her songs take an unflinching view of life but never lapse into bitterness, corrode the soul, or dilute the spirit. The last track---it was put there for a reason--- 'Thank Misery"  lets you know that she has taken a different road, one often full of pain, but hey, without it she never would have found her way to us, and blessed us with her talent. "If I hadn't always been depressed/I'd have climbed that  golden ladder of success/and ,if I hadn't been so blue/thanks misery for bringing me to you."     She keeps to her format---there are whimsy songs("Jetpack" where she glides high above the city), the nerd prevails song("Underdog Victorious" which is sung with such joy that the meadering lyrics don't really matter) and the painful growing up number("Strawberry Gloss" where a gangly girl dreams of  a happier future). All good, all classic Sobule.      There is also one surprise, a turning of her talent ,"Tel Aviv" where a young prostitute, an immigrant, dreams of home as a customer picks her  and takes her. It is a spare number, no frills, just raw emotion---make all the rawer---with Sobule's understated lyrics. An achievment.      Oh by the way the liner notes come with a crossword puzzle, a homage to her hobby of solving crossword puzzles in her spare time. And the puzzle, like her work, is accessible.
