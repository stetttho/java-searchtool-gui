 I'm not going to fault Atwood on style or structure.  She has within this novel all the ingredients for literary greatness.  The story within a story strategy is intriguing and the tale of the muted virgin maidens fated for death reads like a macabre fable you would tell on a dark windy night.  The deployment of such strategies fills this novel with an impending sense of doom for the protagonist, Iris Chase.  As Atwood intends, I assume.   The problem I have with this novel is that it is not entertaining or engaging, especially if you are a reader like me who has a low tolerance for novels situated in remote and emotionally isolated places, and protagonists that reflect these places.  You never get a sense of Iris and at most, she is unlikeable and even austere.  It is hard to imagine that this woman had to suppress passionate love or suffered tremendous grief as Atwood would like us to believe.  Laura Chase also seems caricaturist as the unstable and spoilt little sister who is driven to suicide.  The mystery was never much of a mystery to me and the twist in the end seemed very apparent through most of the novel. I'm not suggesting that Atwood has not written a fantastic novel because, as you will see from the reviews, many have found The Blind Assasin to be moving and engaging.  I am suggesting that by the second chapter, if you feel that this novel does not contain much entertainment value to you, that you are struggling like I was, put it down because you won't be rewarded.  Atwood isn't for everyone.
