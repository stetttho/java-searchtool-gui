 I read this novel five years ago in high school. At first, I found it incredibly difficult because I was use to the ease of modern paperback fiction. One of the drawbacks of this novel is that it takes concentration and a passion for unusual styles of writing. Ondaatje is situated somewhere between poetry and prose. The effort is well-rewarded because it will open your eyes to the best kind of literature. It does not underestimate the reader's intelligence and it invites you to open your mind's eye to the symbols that recur throughout the book. It is well-researched and thorough with wonderful insights into Canadian history. The novel essentially explores identity and industrialism. It asks reader to consider the importance of narrative and history.  The plot (loosely but wonderfully held together by a nonlinear structure and well captured by other reviews already so I won't rehash it) is an addendum because it is the moments interpolated between that counts. Through all this, if you persevere, you will find that Ondaatje will awaken you to the beauty of ordinary events and exchanges between people, partly through his lyricism but mostly through his metaphors.  Someone once said that a great novel is one that lingers with you and creates its own language so that you are filled with a different world for which, you are glad to have lived in for awhile. I can only think of three authors who have accomplished this: Salinger, Arundhati Roy... but the master for me is certainly Michael Ondaatje.
