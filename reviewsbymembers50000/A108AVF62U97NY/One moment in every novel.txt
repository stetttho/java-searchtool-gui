 I wish to write a lengthier review and rehash the plot but I have forgotten a large part of this novel.  This brings me to an important point - there are some novels whose main plots recedes, and even to some degree, so do the characters, but the novel lingers in your head because of one moment where the images created by the author is burnt into your memory.  This makes for a powerful reading experience.  I am going to recommend Anil's Ghost on this basis. In The Skin of a Lion (also by Ondaatje), someone mentioned that the novel should be read because it has the most amazing love-making scene (that person was correct).  It fused passion, lust, and poetry into one.  In Sophie's Choice (William Styron), it was the image of post-war, post-choice Sophie sitting under the stars at an amphitheatre with music resounding in her head.  I hope that everyone perusing this review would have had one of those moments in their reading experience.   Michael Ondaatje created the most powerful and poignant image in Anil's Ghost that I still dream about and recall at odd moments.  It is at the very end where a restoration takes place.  I am reluctant to say anything more. (I'm sorry if it seems like a "bad" description - and a "bad" review, to say anything more would diminish it)   I hardly ever recommend books on the basis of one particular moment in a novel.  However, I have always walked away from a novel with a satisfied mind if it moved me in the least.   This scene - it has to be imagined, to be lived, and to be read so that you know what it means to possess a fragment of a writer's soul, and to understand the persistence of hope for any country ravaged by brutality and violence.
