 When I finished this novel, I let out a blissful sigh.  It had all the ingredients of an enjoyable novel for me - animal psychology and behaviour (I'm a behavioural neuroscientist, my everyday colleagues are rats), questioning of ethics in animal welfare, and an exploration of religion (I'm an atheist).  The manner in which Martel propels us through this fable is reminiscent of Saint-Exupery's The Little Prince.  This fantastic tale is essentially a tragedy but like Saint-Exupery, Martel manages to intrigue and charm us into staying for the explosive finale of Pi's unusual journey.   This novel is refreshing because of its subtle and well-executed humour that is neither showy or foreseen.  Pi's perception of the world at the beginning, and his discussions of animal psychology (territoriality, survival) and religion lays a wonderful foundation for the final exposition about humanity.   Pi's mental wrestle with Richard Parker and the interactions between the surviving animals after the storm is fascinating in the initial reading and even more intriguing in retrospect after you have completed this novel.   I wish there were two ratings.  For Enjoyability, I would give Martel 5 stars.  This novel is entertaining and endearing from start to finish.  I burst out laughing several times throughout the novel.  Its charm makes Pi's heartbreaking journey more profound at the end.  As for Complexity and Memorability, I have only given Martel 3 stars.  The metaphors in this novel felt heavy-handed at times and Pi was never a believable character.  There were times when I felt moved by his journey but the premise never felt entirely real.   However, I recommend it on the basis that 1) Martel makes reading fun; and 2) writing a charming novel that is also well received by the critical circles takes more skill than you think and Life of Pi is a refreshing change from tedious but critically-acclaimed novels.
