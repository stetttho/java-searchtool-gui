 This novel's impact is in its ending, which is a thought-provoking spin on the idea of 'Atonement'.   Briony, the imaginative youngest child of the family, is an avid writer of childish plays and melodramatic stories.  She witnesses an ordinary event - an exchange between her sister Cecilia and a family friend, Robbie, by the fountain.  From this, Briony cultivates the seed of her imagination that will culminate in a tragedy that changes the lives of everyone she loves (Do I sound like the book jacket?  That's because that was a fantastic summary anyway. You don't need any more than that).   The beauty of this book is the irony of Briony's 'atonement', which the reader will see is an act directed at relieving her conscience rather than to make up for what she has done.  She uses the very tool (her imagination) that caused all this heartache to atone for her sins but by this very act, diminishes and denies the true impact of her transgression.  McEwan separates this book into primarily four sections, making leaps of several years in between to show that sorrow can persist and ferment with great tragedy, consequences linger for a lifetime, and sometimes, foolishness lasts beyond childhood and into old age.   Several people will have different opinions of Briony, I'm sure, which is why this book is a great read because it sparks divided views about how McEwan wanted to portray this complex and hopelessly flawed character. The ending will generate a maze of thoughts about what it is to 'atone', whether Briony accomplishes this, and how do people live with their mistakes and tragedies?  On the other hand, the book is slow in some sections, encompassing depressing passages on war.  It is however, a rewarding journey for the reader.
