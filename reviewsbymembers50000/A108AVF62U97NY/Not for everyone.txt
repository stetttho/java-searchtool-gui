 William Styron creates some impressively tragic and melancholic situations for his fatally flawed characters.  Their lives have a way of permeating your dreams after you enter Styron's world.  A fine example of this is Sophie's Choice. The problem I had with Lie Down in Darkness is that the situation is overly dramatic.  While I can understand Sophie, I cannot accept Peyton's insanity.  Styron attempts to attribute Peyton's descent into madness to her childhood, and her experiences with her mother, which albeit unhappy, cannot plausibly be used as an explanation for the tragedy that ensues.  The style is sophisticated, and the imagery and symbolism of birds as death omens create a forbodding presence throughout the novel.   While the style is sophisticated, I didn't find the journey enjoyable because there were parts that felt tedious and long-winded.  Mostly, it is just a depressing novel, with every familial milestone that should be joyous - such as a wedding, or Christmas celebrations - marred by a doomsday feel.  You know that Helen will find some way to quarrel with her husband or Peyton and that the repercussions will resound throughout the entire novel, which feels like a lifetime.  Novels about sorrow and lost can be enlightening and enjoyable.  However, this novel requires stamina because it is very long.  You sink into a stiffling world for the duration of the novel and you won't necessarily come out of it feeling rewarded.
