 I marvel at Okri's writing and most of all, the planning involved in The Famished Road's creation.  Here, we have a novel that is so completely infused with magical realism that the world created by Okri becomes almost like a dream.  This story of a spirit-child who chooses to remain in the world rather than surrender to a peaceful afterlife is a marvellous allegory for the brutality and also, the beauty of life.  So my criticism and my rating is not about Okri's ability as a writer or the literary quality of this novel, which is brilliant.  I don't believe that this novel however, is for everyone.  As another reviewer has mentioned, this novel appears to cater for literary academics rather than the average reader (like me).  The Famished Road is on a rarified plain in the literary world.  I admire anyone who has persevered and really UNDERSTOOD this novel, for it remains much of a mystery to me.   For me, it was somewhat laborious, because I found the recurring symbolism hard to grasp.  The extreme magical aspects of this book became progressively confusing and the overall purpose of spirit-child's journey was lost on me.   I would recommend however, that if you enjoy plot (linear or non-linear), realistic and sympathetic characters, and if you prefer realism in your novels (for there is already plenty of magic in the real world...) - I would suggest you give this novel a miss.
