 I am afraid to write a review for this novel because I fear I will not do it justice.  Therefore, I'm going to avoid rehashing the plot because it has been so well described by other readers already.    This novel ranks among the top two contemporary novels I've read in the past five years.  It is fearless in its epic scope that travels across time with great audacity and perhaps, a smack of well-deserved arrogance.  I mention 'arrogance' because Mitchell displays a flexibility and stylistic quality  across the genres that I've never witnessed in a writer.  What is quite astounding is that Mitchell does not lose sight of the novel's defining core whilst showing-off his skills (I say this with great affection).  The six stories in Cloud Atlas are united fundamentally by its exploration of what civilisation entails and the humanity that is lost in its pursuit.  Each of the six stories contain a character that is exploited and a character that is the abuser - Mitchell raises the question of who the 'victim' may be as we hurdle through time in the quest for a more 'civilised' society.  Perhaps, Mitchell suggest, it is the abuser as well as the exploited.        I apologise for not going into detail regarding each character and the sextuplet of stories - I am terribly sorry for being vague. But I truly believe that this novel has to be discovered by the individual reader.  Each section is amazingly well-written, split and book-ended on either side of Zachry's story, which is the only section that begins and ends in a single unit.  Zachry's story is placed in the middle of the novel because it is central to the novel's theme, and perhaps the most explicit when conveying the issues raised.  I know many readers have said that this is their least favourite section but it was certainly my favourite for its profundity, and for Mitchell finally getting serious - the violence and exploitation seen in the sections prior to Zachry's story were largely light-hearted or so embedded in the genre (e.g. Louisa Rey's detective-thriller story) that the characters seemed almost like caricatures.  Zachry's story is the turning point for all the sections.  You begin to care about these characters, and start to take their lives and the world in which they live in seriously.    So read it - because it is entertaining, because it makes you question your beliefs about humanity, because you will learn something new about novel-writing, and about how you view history.  Moreover, it's a novel that I hope, you will want to share with everyone and discuss it - that is certainly what a good novel should make you do.  I would share it but I can't bear to part with it for now.  :)
