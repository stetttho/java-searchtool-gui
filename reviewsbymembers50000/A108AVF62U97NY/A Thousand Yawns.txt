 I wanted to love this book.  A woman taking on Shakespeare, in the same manner that Jean Rhys took on Charlotte Bronte by injecting a voice for the dispossessed women in Jane Eyre and King Lear respectively.  A daunting task for which, Jean Rhys succeeds and Jane Smiley fails dismally.   The problem I have with the novel is not with the premise, which is brilliantly conceived and researched, but with the style that Smiley employs.  This story of women wounded by their father who now seek to claim what belongs to them rightfully had so much potential.  However, the prose is so arid that it scorches.  It is relentless in the way every detail of farm life is revealed and the riches as well as the poison the land holds.  You don't come away from this novel feeling enriched, as though the women of King Lear have been redeemed, but polluted by the toxic wasteland that Smiley has created.  You end with a sense of hopelessness. This is in contrast with something like Jean Rhys novel 'The Wide Sargasso Sea', which concludes tragically as well with Bertha dispossessed of her freedom as well as her origins.  Yet you leave with a sense of redemption, that Bertha fought to maintain her identity despite the insolence and cruelty of her cowardly husband and by doing so, is given a raging passionate voice that resonates.  Smiley does not provide Ginny and Rose with the same sort of moral centre, so that you end up despising the book because everything in it is despicable.    It is a harsh review but reading it was like wading through swamp land.  I won't deny that it raises profound issues but it did not succeed in enticing me to read more of Smiley's novels.
