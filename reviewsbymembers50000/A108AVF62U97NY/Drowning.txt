 I will not dispute Iris Murdoch's talent as a writer.  She is brilliant because she is able to sketch an intricate psychological portrait of a deeply flawed and frankly, despicable character.  Some readers (most) will be thoroughly engaged with the narrator Charles Arrowby, a retired theatre director, who is writing an autobiography.  What is remarkable about this novel is that the reader is always privy to the character's self-deception - his excuses, his motives, and his questionable actions although Charles is often oblivious to them.   My contention with this novel is with its entertainment value.  My admiration of Murdoch's style increased as my dislike for Charles built.  Only a truly talented writer could created and persist with a character as loathsome as Charles Arrowby.  His encounters with characters from his past illuminated just what a monster he is and reminded me of people I knew in my own life.   So it was an ironic situation where in the end, I had to abandon the book at pg 148 because I no longer wanted to keep company with Charles.  I found him too intolerable.  My criticism is a double-edged sword - on one hand, it demonstrates the power of Murdoch's writing.  She is able to infuse the character with so much life that I couldn't stand him anymore.  On the other hand, it made me stop reading.  It's a strange situation. I would not recommend this novel to those who have never read any of Murdoch's novels at all.
