 This novel is not as it appears to be.  English teachers may praise it, your girlfriends may gush over Rochester, and others "critically acclaim" it but I have studied it as a piece of literature as well as an entertaining classic.  It is not as fabulous as they say.   The protagonist is a quivering (and excuse the term but I am at a lost for another word at the moment) nitwit who yearns to be loved.  Jane is an orphan who feels as if she would die if nobody loved her and yes, it sounds simplistic but this is exactly what she says.  She comes under the employment of Rochester and becomes a governess to a little girl. Meanwhile, she dreams of flaming beds and hears strange noises from the floor above.  The splitting of the oak tree during Jane's engagement to Rochester is just rubbish as a symbol of separation and tragedy.  The real tragedy though, is the secret that Rochester keeps and for which, Jane accepts.   I am amused by how several people believe that Jane Eyre is a feminist novel.  I found Jane to be very comfortable lodged in traditional ideals although she makes an attempt to strike out with her own will.  It was a struggle to finish the novel (had to, or I would fail my English exam) and to pretend to my enthusiastic teacher that I loved it.  If you want real feminism without archaic English, read Carol Shield's 'Unless'.  If you want melodramatic romance with just a hint of literature, read 'Wuthering Heights'.  If you think that Jane is a misguided feminist, you certainly have to read Jean Rhy's 'Wide Sargasso Sea' who portrays Rochester's secret as a terrible colonial crime.   I can understand that some people love this kind of stuff but there are types of people who hate 'Jane Eyre' - they're usually into contemporary novels, ask for their heroes or heroine to yearn for something more than love and for somebody to love them, and need metaphors that are more subtle that freakin' splittin' oak trees.
