 Lee and Colan hit their stride with the free-wheeling DD in these early issues (quite different than the later Frank Miller incarnation). Gene Colan probably looked best with Frank Giacoia inking, and this run includes the best of both. This volume also includes annual #1 where DD encounters a string of villains, similar to Spiderman's Sinister Six. Some unfamiliar with these particular issues will probably be surprised by the Mike Murdock sequence--I think it misfired and Lee realized it--that's why he "killed" Mike later on. However, it is an interesting digression in DD's history.  Overall, another nice volume in the Masterwork series recommended for DD fans.
