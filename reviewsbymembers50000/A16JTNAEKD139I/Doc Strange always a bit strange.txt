 Lee and Kirby's Dr. Strange was an unusual title in the Marvel lineup. Doc doesn't interact much with others nor on diverse levels. He often talks either to himself (half of his monologue being "By the all-seeing eye, etc. etc.) or he praises the Ancient One who either comes up with some help at the end or is too weak to do much. So when the title worked, it was because Doc had Clea around or he was tearing around some really weird dimensions. This volume is probably the best because it has Ditko's phenomenal settings and includes the multi-issue battle with Dormammu. The second volume, though Lee and other writers work with great artists, never captures the humanity we saw when Doc was running for his life.
