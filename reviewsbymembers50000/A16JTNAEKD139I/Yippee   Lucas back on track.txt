 After lowering our expectations for the Star Wars series with the two previous movies, Lucas nails some scenes cleanly in this film. The climactic double duel (won't give it away) is tightly edited. The double death/birth/re-birth finale is also nicely conceived and done. What could have been a disaster of a movie became an intriguing link to the original Star Wars trilogy (still the best because of characters, special effects, and tight editing).  Where Lucas mostly fails is the quick turn from Anakin as a conflicted, whining, selfish action hero into a murderous, gullible, and selfish villain. In the space of a few seconds he kneels before a Sith Lord, vowing his allegiance and proceeding to do some very ugly and nasty stuff. Sorry, no matter how much I try to see it from Anakin's perspective, I just don't buy it. We have this Force-blessed, inventive genius but he can't tell when he is being blatantly manipulated? I also don't buy the convenient death at the end. Come on, that person has everything to live for--new lives as well (supposedly) believing that there is some "good" in Anakin.  Where Lucas succeeds is placing the center of the story onto Obi-Wan's shoulders. He's the hero of the piece whose heart is truly broken. That we believe.
