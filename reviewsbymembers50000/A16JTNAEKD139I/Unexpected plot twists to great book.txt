 Dune is the SF "everything including the kitchen sink" classic. It is the rise of the hero. In "Messiah" we get the Greek tragic hero's fall.  Once again, Herbert dealt with complex themes with far-reaching implications. Will a man detroy himself rather than become something which he is not? Will a hero allow himself to become a focal point for great evil? Great concept.   Many who have read this book are disappointed--they wanted another sprawling space melodrama. Instead, we get a morality play. But every time I've read this novel, my opinion of it has gone up. Read it. Think about it. Herbert said he had this book in his head when he wrote Dune.  Ask yourself what he's saying. Your opinion of it will improve too.
