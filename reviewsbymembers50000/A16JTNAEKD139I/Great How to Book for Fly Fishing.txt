 This is one of the best books for introducing anyone to the sport of fly fishing, whether the angler wants to shop for equipment at Orvis or Wal-Mart. The information is clearly explained without going into tedious details that novices (and experienced anglers) don't want. Everything is covered here--from rod types to fly lines to casting basics. The excellent graphics are helpful--especially of the knots. Some books have knot instructions that are impossible to follow--"knot" so here! For someone who wants to start fly fishing, this book would make a great start. My only complaint is that the book came out almost 20 years ago; it's time for a new edition. . . . I just read that there's a new edition coming out in a few months. Maybe you want to pre-order that edition. And while you're waiting for that, pick up the "L.L.Bean's Handbook to Fly-Fishing" (color illustrations) and Schreiber's novel, "Life on the Fly."
