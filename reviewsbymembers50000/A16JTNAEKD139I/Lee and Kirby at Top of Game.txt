 Lee and Kirby at the top of their collaborative game continue to churn out FF stories that mix slug-fests and humorous bickering between characters. Reed is as stiff as ever, the Torch is maturing, Sue is pregnant (you'll have to overlook the quaint 60s view of pregnancy), and the Thing is, as always, the Thing.  Kirby's stylized art always looked best with Joe Sinnott's inking, and Lee's text flows with their combined plotting. You get the Silver Surfer (Kirby's invention) developing as a character and the ground-breaking birth of Franklin.  Marvel at the top in the 60s. 'Nuff said. However, if you can only buy one Masterwork FF title, get the earlier volume with the Galactus trilogy.
