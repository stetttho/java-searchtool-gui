 The reprints here have put 2005 production values onto 1970 comics--resulting in clear lines and vibrant (perhaps too much) color. If you never read these back in the 1970s, you're in for a treat--you'll see the development of Barry Smith as an artist--comparable only to Jim Steranko on S.H.I.E.L.D. or Frank Miller on Daredevil. My only real criticism is that they didn't reprint the great Smith covers. If they don't want to promote Marvel, they could've covered the logo. The covers alone were worth the 15 cents we originally paid.
