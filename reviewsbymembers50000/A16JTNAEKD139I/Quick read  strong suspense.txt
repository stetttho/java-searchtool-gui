 Not quite as strong as Peretti's other works, as some of the other readers have noted. His prose moves smoothly but doesn't stand out in any way. I found this book after I read "Tales from 2 a.m." and maybe that colors my view. If you're looking for a fine collection of suspense/horror fiction with a Christian spin and a lot of intriguing angles, check that one out instead.  Overall, "Monster" is good, just not as good.
