 The artwork is early Ditko and Stan Lee hasn't hit his full stride yet, but this is classic early Marvel. Simply put: it was nothing like anything else in the drug store on the comic shelf. We all knew what to expect from a DC comic, but Stan Lee and Company surprised us issue after issue. DC comics all looked alike, but Marvel titles all had individual looks based on the artist--Kirby and Ditko and Heck and Wood and (later) Romita. Great stuff to look forward to each month. The colors reproduced here aren't the same, but today we wouldn't tolerate the crude printing we had then--rarely did colors stay within the "lines." If you want to see early comics at their best, pick this up.
