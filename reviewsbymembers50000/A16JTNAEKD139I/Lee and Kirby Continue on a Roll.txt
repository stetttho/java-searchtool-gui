 Following their classic Galactus trilogy, Lee and Kirby continue to produce the best comics of their careers. There are a few trite "Leeisms" in the issues (See the ending of "This Man, This Monster") but remember that it was Lee himself who made these trite because he first created, then overused them; however, the combination of Kirby and Lee worked magic that's rarely been matched. Joe Sinnott continues as inker which makes Kirby's art sparkle. If you can only pick one FF Masterwork, pick up #5, but the whole run is excellent. Also, if you want a real bargain, check out the "44 Years of FF" where you get all these issues and more on DVD.
