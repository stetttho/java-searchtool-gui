 Now Lee and Kirby start to hit their proper stride with these issues. They've started to find the right approach to Thor. (The Tales of Asgard episodes were maybe testing the waters?) The grandeur with the Hercules/Pluto issues shows what the Thor comic is capable of becoming. Still later will come the Living Planet and Him, but that will have to wait for another volume.  Also, an important addition to the team is inker Vince Coletta. He gives the proper look to Kirby's pencils for Thor--sort of a Hal Foster "Prince Valient" feel. Compare these issues to earlier ones and you'll see what I mean.
