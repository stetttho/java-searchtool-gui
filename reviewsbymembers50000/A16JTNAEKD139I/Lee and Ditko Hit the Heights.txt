 Spiderman was never so good as Ditko (sometimes getting plot credit) and Lee presented him here. The collaborators are in complete control of Spider-man and the great cast of bad guys--especially the Green Goblin. The ironies of Peter Parkers life are poignant, and each issue seems to develop both Peter's life and the supporting cast. This and the next volume are probably the best collections: the next volume includes the great "Man on a Rampage" trilogy and the switch to John Romita.
