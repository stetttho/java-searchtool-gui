 You can read the other reviews for a plot summary. Let me add that I've read this great novel many times and do not see it as an allegory. From Lewis's other works and letters, I think it's clear that he meant this to be a "what if?" series. What if space travel is possible--what will we find out there? His answer is that earth (the Silent Planet) is separated from the rest of the universe by sin. What if someone from earth goes to Venus, a planet that knows no sin? What if Satan (the bent angel) tries to achieve what he achieved on earth--the seduction of the planet's residents? How would this all play out?  If Lewis had wanted to write an allegory, he could've done that: see "The Pilgrim's Regress". Instead he wrote an engaging, exciting story of good vs. evil--happening all over again.
