 First of all. Read the books starting with "Lion." This not only provides the initial "Wonderland" experience of Narnia, it also shows Lewis's brilliance in writing the "prequel" of the "Magician's Nephew." Secondly, recognize that Lewis didn't design this as an allegory. He said that the Christian elements just came along with the writing. Yes, the Narnia books provide an understanding of Christianity, but in a true allegory, all events, characters, and settings represent something else. Even though Aslan represents Christ, other characters aren't symbolic of other things in heaven and earth.   Overall I gave this a four star because as strong as "Lion" is, having Father Christmas pop in for a visit doesn't work. I'm assuming they'll take that out of the film because in the book it strikes the reader like an bad note in a moving song. Another weak spot in the series is the "Horse and the Boy." It's okay, but not as strong as the rest. However, "Magician's Nephew" and "The Last Battle" are wonderful evocations of creation and the yet-to-come new creation.  Overall, highly recommended, and some of the books are definite 5's, but overall a 4.
