 Lewis brings his space trilogy back to the planet Earth for this final installment. Since Ransom is back on earth, the tone of the book loses the "fantastic" nature of the previous two novels. However, Lewis's main theme is still the same: good in its battle against evil. Here evil initially takes more recognizable forms before growing into more extreme forms (I don't want to give anything away). He warns against many forms of evil that were then just beginning to appear but have now reached fruition. Though Lewis obviously has a passionate agenda (what great writer doesn't?), he doesn't lose the narrative. It is again an original novel and a horrifying vision of what evil is capable of and how good must find the courage to oppose evil.
