 You'll note that the price for these just dropped! That makes these an even better buy; however, the DVD version of Spider-man will be coming out soon, so you may want to wait. (Will the new set include annuals??).   But, for those of you who love a sale and don't need the set on DVD, these CDs collect all Spider-man issues, but, unlike the FF set, they do not include annuals. The company has scanned in all the pages (including ads, Bullpen page, letter pages, and back cover) from actual issues. Often some of the pages are scanned in slightly crooked--what's the matter, don't you have time to line things up? (The FF version does a better job).   I thought it might be difficult reading the comics on a computer screen, but after a few pages I liked turning a page with the push of a button. If you have a bright monitor or laptop, the colors should look nice.   Make sure that you upgrade to Acrobat Reader 6 (included on the disk) so that the Marvel watermarks don't show on your screen. If you try to print a page the watermarks will (I believe) appear.   Overall, a wonderful addition for those who have the original issues but can't read them because of their value, for those who don't want to buy a bunch of the Masterworks titles, for those who want to see the comics with the original colors and printing quality, and for those who want to read all the issues in color. The cost of the total collection may seem high, but think about buying over 500 comics. That's less than a dime an issue--more than I paid years ago!   As Marvel does more of these (X-Men is out; an Avengers set is coming), they may "crash" the back issue market. People who have the comics may decide to buy these CDs and/or DVDs and sell their back issues.   Highly recommended.
