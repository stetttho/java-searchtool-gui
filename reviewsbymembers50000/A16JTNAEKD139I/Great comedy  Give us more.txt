 This CD includes some of the classic Smothers Brothers "songs." What's sad is that no one is releasing more of their great collaborations. Their comedy relies on so many elements lacking in today's "comedy" which tries to get laughs by being crude and lewd. Yes, the Brothers sometimes were a little risque, but most of those jokes went over children's heads and there was always plenty for everyone of all ages to find funny. Get this CD and encourage whatever powers control these things to release their other albums on CD.
