 Finally the DVD has been released of Johnny Cash's musical expression of his faith. Get this and see what was only hinted at in "Walk the Line." If you want to know what gave Johnny Cash the strength for his comeback, this is the movie to watch. Produced by him and released in 1973, it was, according to accounts of the time, a labor of love.   Various musicians were weighing in with their interpretations of Jesus: Rice and Webber with "Jesus Christ Superstar"  and Schwartz's "Godspell"--it was appropriate that the reigning royalty of country music should do the same. See what Johnny Cash, June Carter, and Kris Kristofferson came up with--you won't be disappointed.
