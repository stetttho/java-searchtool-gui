 I first read this novel some years ago and became a Hassler fan before finishing it. In many ways I think it's one of his strongest books. The characters are engaging and the town believeable. "Staggerford," "Grand Opening" (also by Hassler), and "Passing through Paradise" by Schreiber make a great trio of Minnesota novels.
