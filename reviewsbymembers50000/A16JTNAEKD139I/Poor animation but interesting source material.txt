 When I saw these as a kid I knew that being a Marvel comic reader (as opposed to DC) was now officially okay. I recognized instantly (you will too) that the animation was lousy. However, even lousy animation with Marvel stories was better than the cheesy Batman TV show. Looking back at these (I have some of these on video), my opinion hasn't changed. The transition from comic book to cartoon is rough (Thor's melodramatic speeches, for example) don't translate well. However, when we get Kirby artwork on the TV screen, now THAT counts for something, even if the "animators" just move a still shot across the screen.  Who would like this? Those of us who still enjoy a nostalgic trip down memory lane and collectors of Silver Age comics. Young children who have not become jaded by modern animation techniques might be enthralled by the stories themselves. Marvel has recently tried to recapture the younger crowd with its Marvel Age line of comics--good luck to them. It would be nice to see young people reading again. It's become a lost skill in our video-driven age.  As others have said about this coming release--please do it right!
