 I started this novel some time ago and then put it down, thinking I knew where it was going. I went back to the book later and found myself more than pleasantly surprised by the plot twists I didn't expect (though some of the story was fairly predictable). In short: once I got about a third of the way into the novel, I was hooked. A very good read. My only real criticism is that the central character is a bit too good to be true. Overall, it's a nice coming-of-age novel and fits in nicely with other books set in Minnesota such as "Grand Opening" and "Hillcrest Journal."
