 From the book's description (and other reviews), you know the basic characters and conflicts. Let me just add that this book isn't easily categorized. It's lyrical at times, suspenseful at times, and nostalgic at others. If you don't believe in the power of God (and the ability of individuals to access that power), you will want to read this as a fantasy; yet be warned: Enger builds in so many references to real persons and places that it's impossible to do so. Ultimately the book succeeds on his characters--yes, the main characters are all  too intelligent and too articulate, but Enger is so consistent (and insistent) in the portrayals that we buy it nevertheless. If you're looking for an engaging novel that is extremely well-written (and if you don't fear a steady moral compass), read this book.
