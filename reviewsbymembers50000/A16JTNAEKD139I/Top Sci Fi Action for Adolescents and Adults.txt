 As with all my reviews, I don't bother with plot summary--you get that with the publisher's info. Let me just tell you that this is a great novel. Yes, it is magnificently plotted with several climaxes that build in intensity throughout the book, but it also has, unlike many best-selling thrillers, believable and engaging characters that adolescents (and adults) can relate to and learn from. The military codes throughout the book seem authentic and the ethical dilemma presented at the end is excellent.   Most problems in life--whether between friends and spouses or countries--goes back to a problem in communicating. Card has hit this on the head in a "mythic" way that only SF can do. This rates as one of the best SF novels of all time.  I hear there's a movie coming out. Do yourself a favor and read the novel first.
