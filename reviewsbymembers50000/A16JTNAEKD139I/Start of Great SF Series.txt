 You've already read the publisher's summary for yourself, so let me just add that this is THE classic SF trilogy. Book one, "Foundation," creates the future world, its declining culture, and how a group of strong-minded individuals don't want to see knowledge die. How they do that drives this novel. In book two, Asimov introduces the mystery of the mule, and in book three Asimov pulls a rabbit out the hat called the Second Foundation.  If you enjoy books that entertain, books that offer good mysteries, and books that make you think about bigger things in life, than this series is for you. It's too bad our political leaders don't read novels like this. Maybe we'd avoid the continual messes they get countries in.
