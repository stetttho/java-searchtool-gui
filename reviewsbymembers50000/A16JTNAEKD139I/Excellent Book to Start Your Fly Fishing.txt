 Whitlock's book is one of the best (the other being Rosenbauer's Orvis book) introductions to the sport of fly fishing. The Whitlock illustrations are always great, and the information is top-notch. You will find out everything you need from fly lines to fly rods to knots to basic flies. Don't be fooled by the "L.L.Bean" title--it nowhere promotes their products. An excellent book overall. As an added note, the L.L. Bean Fly-Fishing Bass Handbook is mostly a rehash of this book.
