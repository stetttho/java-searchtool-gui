 This is a story of the human spirit--both those enduring a hell-on-earth and those seeking to rescue their brothers in pain. It is also a story of two different cultures--American and Phillipino--working together against a common enemy. You don't need to be a military buff to learn from, appreciate, and be moved by this book. Highly recommended. This is a nice companion piece to Brickhill's "The Great Escape."
