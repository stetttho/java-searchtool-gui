 This is where Ditko (who must have been the driving force in much of the early series) and Lee really hit their stride. Yes, the colors are brighter than when originally printed on cheap comic paper, but you can see great storytelling and great art combined. Any of these comics, if produced today, would span numerous issues because the art would dominate. Not so here in the mid-60's Marvels. It's a beautiful blend.
