 I read these when they first came out and they were my instant favorites--the issues featured some of Lee's best writing and art by Buscema (always great). What more could one want? You can read some of the other reviews for summaries, but issue #5 won the "Academy Award" for best comic that year and it holds up well over time.   As I re-read these issues, I was still impressed by everything, but I can also see why the series didn't last. For most comic readers of the time (perhaps today as well), the Surfer is sometimes overly preachy and the conflicts (inner and outer) are very serious with none of the humorour banter that shows up in the FF or the wise-cracking Spiderman. Though originally created by Jack Kirby, the Surfer as taken over by Lee and Buscema becomes more like the early Ditko Spiderman who can't ever get a break. However, Marvel was reaching for an older audience (hence the "expensive" 25 cent larger size), and, unfortunately, it didn't work well enough. The last few issues (in the second volume) are a disappointment as Lee drops back to a smaller comic size and lower price and introduces guest-star battles. Even so, these Surfer issues remain one of Marvel's (and Stan Lee's) brightest accomplishments.
