 This DVD collects all FF issues including annuals. The company has scanned in all the pages (including ads, Bullpen page, letter pages, and back cover) from actual issues. A few of the pages are scanned in slightly crooked, but this could also be the printing on the originals.  I thought it might be difficult reading the comics on a computer screen, but after a few pages I liked turning a page with the push of a button. If you have a bright monitor or laptop, the colors should look nice.  Make sure that you upgrade to Acrobat Reader 6 (included on the disk) so that the Marvel watermarks don't show on your screen. If you try to print a page the watermarks will (I believe) appear.  Overall, a wonderful addition for those who have the original issues (as I do) but can't read them because of their value, for those who don't want to buy a bunch of the Masterworks titles, for those who want to see the comics with the original colors and printing quality, and for those who want to read all the issues in color. The cost of the total collection may seem high, but think about buying over 550 comics. That's less than a dime an issue--more than I paid years ago!  As Marvel does more of these, they may "crash" the back issue market. People who have the comics may decide to buy these DVDs and sell their back issues.  Highly recommended.
