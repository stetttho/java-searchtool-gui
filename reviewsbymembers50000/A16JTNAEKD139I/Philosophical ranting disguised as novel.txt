 After the incredibly entertaining and thought-provoking first three novels, Herbert put together this philosophical treatise (Yeah, we get it. We got it after Dune.) and draped a lot of dialogue around it. The problem with the novel is that nothing particularly interesting happens. If you really liked the three Dune novels, you probably need to read this to see what happens to Leto, but skim it quickly. The ending is significant to the trilogy, but little else before that.
