 My local library categorizes this as a young adult novel, but I'm beyond that age range and I found this a cleverly written novel that is poignant and powerful. It reminded me of all the things adolescents deal with--maybe we always deal with. The style started out simply and grew along with the narrator. There is an overall Christian worldview that comes through, but it never overpowered the narrative; rather, it seemed to grow out of the characters themselves. This would be a great gift for a young person you know, or for yourself.
