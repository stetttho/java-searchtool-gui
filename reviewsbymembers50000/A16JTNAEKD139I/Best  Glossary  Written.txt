 This book has been THE reference book to use for years. I used to consult Foster's earlier edition (before the Silmarillion was published), then replaced that edition with this one. It remains the only book you'll need (in addition to Tolkien's works, of course.)  The only minor detail I have ever found is that Foster says that "half orc" isn't used in LOTR's. It is. I'll let you close readers find it for yourself.
