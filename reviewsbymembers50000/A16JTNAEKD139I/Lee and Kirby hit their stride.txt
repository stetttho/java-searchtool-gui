 It's interesting to hear when people think the FF truly became the "World's Greatest Comic." That title will always be open to dispute; however, it's clear that Lee and Kirby start creatively hitting their stride in these issues. The Thing/Hulk fight that stretched over two issues is a classic, along with the "Yancy Street" visit soon after. In another year or two, Lee and Kirby will be creating the Frightful Four, the Inhumans, Galactus, and the Silver Surfer. Surely this period is one of the most creative for any comic book collaborators in the history of the medium.
