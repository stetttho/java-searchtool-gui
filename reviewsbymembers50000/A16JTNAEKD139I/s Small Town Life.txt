 I first read this novel some years ago after "Staggerford" and it made me a true-blue Hassler fan. Its rich cast of characters keep this novel moving along. Though a few of the characters are merely great window-dressing (for example, I wanted to see more done with grandfather), most are fully developed and integral to the plot. Overall, the theme of redemption thorugh action is clear, and, sadly, many negative elements of small town life haven't changed in the 21st century.   "Staggerford," "Grand Opening" (also by Hassler), and "Passing through Paradise" by Schreiber make a great trio of Minnesota novels. All are highly recommended.
