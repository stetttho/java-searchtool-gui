 The variety of stories surprised me (very different from Schreiber's novels), but kept me reading: horror, science fiction, and realistic. In tone they varied too. Even a little humor tossed in. Schreiber seemed to arrange them to bounce between more experimental styles and more traditional styles. There's also a sort of chronological order to them--but I don't want to give any surprises away.  This is the perfect book to buy for someone who likes great writing and interesting stories. I don't know what else to compare it to because it's so original. All I can say is that it would make a great gift for Halloween, Christmas, or Easter. It fits all three.  The stories tend to build on each other--darker stories seem to be in the beginning and more encouraging ones toward the end. Highly recommended!  Breakdown of stories: "Me and Josh and Gideon' -- vampire story told with several twists and use of vampires as metaphors ; "Of Ghosts" -- MN ghost story on the Mississippi; "to-ate" -- sad tale of genetic engineering; "Monsters in Paradise" was an enjoyable, lighter adventure story; "Three Blind Mice" -- stream of consciousness/sci-fi/adventure mix; the three Methuselah Brown stories--great page-turners; "Maiden Rock" a prequel to novel "Passing Through Paradise" (and look into a dark marriage); "On the Banks of Babylon" -- morality fantasy. The play at the end was a nice addition.
