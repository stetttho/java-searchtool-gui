 Harry and Co. keep us entertained in yet another installment. Some have said the novel continues the slide toward "darker" Potter novels. I wouldn't say that this is any darker than the rest--it's just not leavened by as much humor as the earliest novels.   Overall, I found the plot fairly predictable--all along I believed that I knew who the logical Prince would be (I won't give it away) and then assumed that it wouldn't be that obvious. But, yeah, it was.  Also, I'm hoping that there's a surprise waiting for us in the last novel regarding that "Prince" so that the series doesn't degenerate into complete melodrama.  Overall, if you've enjoyed the earlier Harry novels, this won't disappoint you--except that the ending is like "The Empire Strikes Back"--everything is setting up the next novel. We're also left wondering if the "phoenix" will rise out of its ashes.
