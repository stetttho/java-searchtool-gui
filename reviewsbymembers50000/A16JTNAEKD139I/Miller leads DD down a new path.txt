 Frank Miller's work for Marvel up to this time was usual fare. But when he started on DD, he developed a greater cinematic style not seen in comics before. If you get this volume and the next two, you'll see Miller take over the writing chores and then the blend of words and layouts really shines. The gritty look that Klaus Jansen gives Miller's art works well. If you actually study the panels, the art is crude at times--look at the proportions of feet and hands to heads, for example; yet the cinematic layouts make it work. Overall, this was a milestone in the history of comics that true fans shouldn't miss.
