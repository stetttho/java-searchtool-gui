 I don't know why the novel often seems to go out of print. I've always thought this was Manfred's best. The characters are well-defined (as in all his novels) and the narrative itself is compelling. Some subject matter is not for the squeamish, but it certainly reads as believeable and authoritative.   Though this is thought of as a "western" novel, it's not really about range wars or Indian battles; it's about betrayal, the desire for revenge (perhaps the positive side of it?), and forgiveness. It's about how deep a person has to dig within himself in order to survive.  You won't regret reading this novel, even if you don't like novels in the "western" genre.
