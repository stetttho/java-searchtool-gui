 These early Thor stories aren't nearly as good as what will be coming later in the series. The beginning is certainly fine, though the stone-men villains are lame (pun intended, Dr. Blake). I enjoyed reading these because I had read them eons ago; however, the comics don't hold up as well because the plot lines aren't that strong. When Lee and Kirby bring in Hercules in later issues, the series will take off and start to achieve its full potential. When these great collaborators finally dump Jane Foster, they will make one of their best decisions ever.   If you can only afford one Thor volume, wait for #4. That's when the fun begins.
