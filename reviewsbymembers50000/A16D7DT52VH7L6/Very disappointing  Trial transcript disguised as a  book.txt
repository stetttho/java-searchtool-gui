 I have been an avid true crime reader for years, and never have I found a book any more disappointing than this one.  It truly is almost as if the author retyped the trial transcripts word-for-word and renamed as a "book."  I got no real insight into any of the characters, which is the most important part of what makes a true crime account so fascinating.  There was also a lot of skipping around, with a less than smooth effort to present the sequence of events in a manner the reader can follow easily.  Hopefully, this was a "first book" for this author, and future efforts will improve.  Otherwise, I think I will stick with known authors in the genre that I can count on to deliver.
