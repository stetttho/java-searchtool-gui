 Rest assured, the Gods smiled on us when Tool entered the music scene!  This band manages to "have it all"--distinctive sound in a style all its own, awesome vocals, thought-provoking lyrics, rhythm that builds up to a thrilling crescendo amidst a pounding drumbeat--and you only have to listen once to find yourself "hooked."  Almost like you've been driving a beater car for years and suddenly find yourself racing corners in the sweetest luxury car on earth!   Maynard James Keenan is a superb singer (I could listen to him mesmerize me all day!), Danny Carey exudes raw, heart thumping power on drums, and the talent in this band overall is simply phenomenal.  There isn't a "bad" song on this entire CD, a rarity to be sure when so many bands out there produce one or two decent tracks on an entire disk. Thanks, Tool, for taking the progressive, alternative, heavy metal categories, adding your own special spice to the mix, elevating the lyrics, and then kicking it up a notch! You rock my world!
