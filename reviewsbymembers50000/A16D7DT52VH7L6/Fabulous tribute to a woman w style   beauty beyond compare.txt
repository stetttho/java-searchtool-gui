 As an avid admirer of Audrey Hepburn, I have long been aware that she was not just exceptionally beautiful, but genuinely kind and generous as well.  This book serves as not only a tribute to a personal grace, beauty, and  stylishness beyond compare, but manages to also capture her history as a  great humanitarian. I was enthralled by the elegant photographs and the  insightful prose accompanying them.  Like Audrey, this book is the epitome  of grace, beauty, style, warmth, and substance.  Exceptional subject AND  exceptional author, indeed!  I will return to this volume again and again  for many years to come.  It deserves 5+ stars!!
