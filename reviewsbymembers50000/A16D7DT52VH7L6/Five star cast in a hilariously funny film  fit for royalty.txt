 Coming to America is truly the creme de la creme of the comedic genre.  I have watched this movie many times, and never can resist throwing my head back and laughing out loud in total glee. Sometimes I even admit to falling right off the couch in fits of laughter! Murphy's principal role in the movie is that of Prince Akeem, with Arsenio Hall as his sidekick and personal servant Semi (though both play numerous other minor roles with the help of elaborate makeup to disguise the fact).  Promised in marriage to a beautiful woman raised from birth to please him, Akeem finds himself dissatisfied with the very idea of an arranged marriage.  He wants to select a wife with a mind of her own who loves him for himself.   Hence Akeem's decision to leave the kingdom of Zamunda to travel to America.  Unaware of his son's true purpose for the trip, King Jaffre Jafur decrees that Akeem simply needs to take a trip to "sow his royal oats."  James Earl Jones as the King, and Madge Sinclair as the Queen are hilarious in their roles as Akeem's parents. Akeem and Semi leave their luxurious lifestyle in the palace behind and end up in Queens, NY, posing as "average Americn students."  They secure jobs at a knockoff of McDonald's, owned by Mr. McDowell (engagingly portrayed to hilarious effect by John Amos) and his daughters Lisa and Patrice.  Falling hard for the eldest daughter Lisa (Shari Headley), Akeem competes with her boyfriend, Darrell(Eric LaSalle), the arrogant, smooth talking heir to the "Soul Glo" hair product fortune, for her affections.  The numerous conflicts and silly situations that stem from this will keep you in stitches. Blessed with an EXCELLENT cast who each make the utmost of their roles (those mentioned previously, plus Samuel L.Jackson, Louie Anderson, Don Ameche and others), truly funny material, witty dialogue, and a delightful feel-good ending, Coming to America is a movie not to be missed.  I hope you enjoy this frothy funfilled comedy as much as I did!
