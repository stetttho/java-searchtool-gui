 I have been a metal fan since my high school days in the 80's, and vow that I will remain one always (they better get used to it in the rest home someday!).  Even so, there are some songs that stand above the rest for their originality, intensity, and raw power to rock you--this is definitely one of them.  It transcends time and place for me, and the beat never fails to stir the ravenous "heavy metal beast" inside this now middle aged Mom.  If you forgot how great this track is, check it out again--I guarantee it will still have the power to fuse itself into your soul and rock the ^$*^*&^ out of you!
