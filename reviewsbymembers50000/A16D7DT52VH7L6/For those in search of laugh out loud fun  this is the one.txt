 Not every movie has to take itself seriously to be highly entertaining--and this is one at the top of that category.  I dare anyone to watch it and not find plenty of amusing scenes to laugh out loud over.     As expected from an actress of her talent, Meryl Streep is wonderful in her role as "Mary Fisher," queen of the romance novel writing genre.  Opposite her, Roseanne Barr does a great job in her staring role as the clutzy, unappreciated wife, Ruth, who loses her husband to Ms. Fisher's charms, yet manages to get the last laugh by movie's end.  Indeed, all the players in this hilarious tale add their part to make this one of my favorite comedies ever.  I've watched it more than a few times, and can't help but howl with laughter. My favorite cast member is A Martinez, who turns a splendid comic turn as the butler, Garcia.  In one scene, he buzzes up in a golf cart to deliver bottles of Yoohoo on a silver tray at tea time, thoroughly embarassing Meryl Streep's haughty character right during an interview for a magazine.  With every nuance, pose, and facial expression he injects something special and really makes the most of his role.  Truly, every scene in which he appears is purely delightful. If you find yourself in need of laughter on an otherwise ho hum day, watch this movie!  I highly recommend it!!
