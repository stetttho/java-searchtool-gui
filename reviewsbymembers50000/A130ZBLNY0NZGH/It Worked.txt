 My wife and are were committed against the "Cry it out" philosophy.  I'm sure it works fine, but we simply didn't feel like that was the way to teach our son to fall asleep.  We'd spent plenty of time trying to make the "baby whisperer" work -- but the pick-up, put-down mechanism recommended just seemed to agitate both us and our son and leave him exhausted and hoarse and us frustrated.  This book has a very simple philosophy that's easy to follow and that generated results for us after we returned from an overseas trip to see the grandparents back in the US. Within a few days he was able to put himself to sleep and within the 2-3 week timeframe we could plonk him down in his crib and reliably leave him to put himself asleep without us in the room.  Now, during the night, he still will fuss on occasion -- but most of the time he's able to sort it out himself and get back to sleep (this from a dedicated 2-3 times a night waker).    While no baby book will work for everyone, these one helped us achieve sanity in our lives.  Our son is a radically different (and better!) sleeper for this purchase.
