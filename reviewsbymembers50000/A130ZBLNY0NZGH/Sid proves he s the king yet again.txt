 Every year, it seems like turn-based strategy is given it's Last Rites.  Sid Meier comes through yet again with a clear winner.  For anyone who is a fan of Civilization or Civ II stop reading this review and buy the game  now. Alpha Centauri is a solid game -- there's a lot of detail to the  game and in the classic case of Civilization it is extremely replayable: at  different difficulty levels or as a member of one of the 7 factions. This  game adds features that: makes the game easier to manage (especially in  later stages), add depth to some of the options (i.e. government types) and  overall enhances the game play. A word about multiplayer: It's  operational, but the update routines on a turn-by-turn basis run extremely  slow over TCP/IP with the version of the game that comes out of the box.   As a result, multiplayer games become unplayable after about an hour just  due to the game-induced lag. Despite lackluster multiplayer performance,  this game still has what it takes to be a classic.
