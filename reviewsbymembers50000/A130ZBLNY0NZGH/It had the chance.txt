 Birth of the Federation seemed like a reasonable purchase at the time -- but it's long since migrated off of my hard drive. Microprose has a solid history with Masters of Orion behind it, but they just didn't do justice to  that game and Star Trek at the same time.   The game continues along a  similar vein to MOO2 complete with a pretty reasonable combat environment.   Like MOO2, though, it becomes a lot of micromanagement for not a whole lot  of return and the computer just doesn't seem up to the task of truly  defeating you. If you're a Star Trek fanatic, you likely "have"  to own this game and will enjoy it simply because of the universe (be  warned though: it's all Next Generation due to licensing).  If you're a  turn-based strategy fanatic my suggestion is to stick with MOO2 or look  elsewhere. If you do purchase the game -- make sure to download the  update from Microprose.
