 How often have you gotten an "expansion pack" only to be rewarded with lackluster efforts from a development team that has simply moved on from the title? Brood War delivers almost an entirely new game for  less than the original cost.  As expansion packs go, this one is about as  close to perfect as I've seen. In addition to ~30 new missions (with each  of the three familiar races from StarCraft), you get more multiplayer maps  and new units to explore and enjoy (roughly 2 per race).  In addition to  new units, many existing units have had their abilities enchanced or  changed. Like StarCraft, you can jump into multiplayer on Battle.net and  play with up to 8 humans/players.  You can only use Brood War against other  players who have Brood War (sorry! no mixing versions) -- so make sure your  friends pick up a copy as well. If you liked StarCraft, there's simply no  excuse not to own this.
