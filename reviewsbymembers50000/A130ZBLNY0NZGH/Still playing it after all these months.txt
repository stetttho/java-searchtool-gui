 StarCraft is a true Blizzard game.  From a company known to produce an excellent product, they didn't let the consumer down despite delaying the product repeatedly. StarCraft has three separate races that you can play  -- each with its own flavor (and set of 10 missions in the campaign) that  makes the game a different experience and forces you to adopt different  strategies based upon what you're playing and what your playing against.   The single-player game has a great storyline that feels important and  enjoyable all at once.  Campaign missions aren't just for training you in  how to use units anymore. When you've completed the campaign, hop online  with Battle.net and let the carnage begin!  StarCraft lets you play with up  to 8 human/computer players via the Internet.  Cooperative play with humans  is an adventure if you give the computer AI the benefit of numbers (i.e. 5  on 3). This is a well-balanced real time strategy title with a great  story and enough replayability that it remains installed on my computer  nearly a year later.
