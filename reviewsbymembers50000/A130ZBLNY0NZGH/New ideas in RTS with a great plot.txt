 I'm not an RTS (real time strategy) fanatic by any stretch of the imagination -- but I was eager for this game.  This game plays extremely well as a single player game -- complete with new twists to the real-time  genre: no buildings, you keep your fleet with you from scenario to  scenario, full 3D space (with intuitive controls). Homeworld takes the  basic tenants of a real time strategy and slows the pace down a bit to  provide fleet action that reminds you of scenes from your favorite sci-fi  movies and TV shows. The story is extremely well done with scripted  in-game sequences and good storyboard artwork that makes the story  compelling and interesting rather than "fluff" added at the  end. It's a solid multiplayer game - but only against other humans.  Much  like Total Annhilation, the AI simply isn't up to the task of taking on  multiple, allied humans, even if you give it the benefit of  numbers. Overall - it's a great game. If the multiplayer AI were more  vicious you'd see 5 stars from me.
