 Ok, maybe not despair. Total Annihilation was one of the first Real Time Strategy (RTS) games to use a true 3D environment.  It looks and plays wonderfully!  There's a lot of variety to units and the game can be truly  engrossing.  The strength to TA, however, is in multiplayer in human vs.  human combat.   The single player campaign in the game is adequate but  not compelling -- the story line is just enough to make playing the game  seem worthwhile without really getting you to buy into it and suspend your  disbelief.  Unfortunately this lackluster storyline is hampered by an  Artificial Intelligence (AI) that's really none too bright.  Once you learn  how to use a couple key units and buildings the computer simply has no  ability to be a serious threat.  Heaven forbid you should try multiplayer  cooperative against the AI... you'll be disappointed. Overall, it's a  decent game but if you're not the type of person to match witch against  other people, then you may want to consider another RTS title with a  stronger AI.
