 I grew up placing my head into the "sight" for Battlezone at the arcades.  Shooting my happy little green enemies with my little green  bullets.  So, naturally, I was interested in the souped up 90s version of  Battlezone.  I wasn't disappointed. Activision took the Battlezone  franchise and created the first successful hyrbid of Real Time Strategy  (RTS) and a First Person Shooter (FPS).  You've got all the excitement of a  good simulation/shooter in the game plus a good depth of  strategy. Despite being a '98 game, it still looks pretty.  It's also  plenty challenging.  I did get to a point, however, where I was tired of  fighting the same old Bad Guy ships, so eventually I weaned myself from the  game.  I've heard the the game shines in multiplayer (death match). If  you're looking for an inexpensive, but good 3D title.  This is a definite  win.
