 CELTIC SINGER/SONGWRITER/FOLK SINGER, LOREENA MCKENNITT IS ASOLUTELY AMAZONG. EVERY SONG ON THIS ALBUM IS BRILLAINT. THE BEST SONGS ARE BASED MAINLY ON HER IRISH/CELTIC HERITAGE. HER VOICE IS ANGELIC AND HER HARP IS DIVINE. I LISTEN TO EACH OF HER ALBUMS IN THE CAR EVERY NIGHT TO CALM ROAD RAGE!!!! SHE MAKES THE LISTENER FEEL IN TOUCH WITH NATURE AND HUMANITY.
