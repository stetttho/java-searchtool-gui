 THOMAS FATS WALLER RULES! NO DOUBT ABOUT IT! THE MUSICIAN, A PIANIST AND VOCALIST, POSSESSES THE CHARISMA OF CAB CALAWAY, THE INNOVATIVE BRILLIANCE OF LOUIS ARMSTRONG AND THE DOWN AND DIRTY, NEW ORLEANS SWANKINESS OF THELONIOUS MONK. SON OF A SOUTHERN BAPTIST MINISTER & A FEMALE PIANIST, VOCALIST AND ORGANIST, WALLER WAS OBVIOUSLY BORN INTO THE MUSICAL LIFE. FOR A MAN OF OVER 300 POUNDS, HE SURE KNEW HOW TO SWING. AND THE GUY WROTE OVER 400 SONGS, MANY MANY OF THEM HUGE HITS. HE JUST MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD, DAMMIT! IN MY HUMBLE OPINION, WALLER'S GREATEST EFFORTS INCLUDE: YOUR FEETS TOO BIG, THIS JOINT IS JUMPIN', AIN'T MISBEHAVIN' AND CRAZY 'BOUT MY BABY.
