 The last time I read this book was in undergraduate school--too young at age 17 (I was a univeristy student of English Literature.). At the time, it made very little sense to me; I simply did not have the necessary life experience to appreciate it. I think I understood, on some level, that Nothing/Death/Emptiness/the possibility of Fate was the basic gist of it all, but now I see a whole lot more here.  Now I think that Albert Camus' THE STRANGER is a book more about anonymity, destiny and the absurdity of human life. (Scary) Now I do understand. (I think.) I fancy myself an Existentialist, but this is difficult reading despite the straight-forward langage, plot and character-development. I do recommend this book, but probably to people in atleast their late teens--someone who is not afraid to think about the nothingness that may lie beyond death. I will not be reading this book again. It reminds me too much THE UNDERGROUND MAN (DISTURBING AND ALL ALONE!)
