 I OWN SEVERAL GOTHIC/DARKWAVE CDs, AND THIS ONE IS VERY MUCH LIKE THE REST--DARK AND ENJOYABLE FOR DEPRESSIVE TYPES LIKE MYSELF. BUT THERE ARE A FEW LESSER KNOWN GROUPS/SINGERS ON THIS COMPILATION THAT REALLY APPEAL TO ME, EVEN AFTER ONLY HEARING THEM TWICE! (THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE TO GROW ON YOU; THEY'RE JUST THAT GOOD!) THE MOST NOTABLE ARE THE FIRST TWO SONGS ON THE CD, BY AUDRA "WHAT YOUR EYES HAD SEEN" & VOLTAIRE "WHEN YOU'RE EVIL," RESPECTIVELY. BOTH SOUND VERY MUCH LIKE OLD BAUHAUS. BOTH SINGERS' VOICES ARE VERY PETER MURPHY-ESQUE. (I LIKE THAT A LOT, PERSONALLY). DEEP, RICH, MASCULINE VOICES THAT SEEM TO DRAG YOU SEDUCTIVELY INTO THEIR UNDERWORLD ECSTASY. (I'M NOT SURE, BUT I THINK THE VOLTAIRE SONG IS SUPPOSED TO BE SATIRICAL--NOT CERTAIN. EITHER WAY, I LOVE THE SONG, ESPECIALLY THE VOCALS.) THE CD ALSO CONTAINS MANY OF MY OLD FAVORITES FROM THOSE GOTH DAYS OF MINE IN THE 90'S: THANATOS, BLACK TAPE FOR A BLUE GIRL, ATTRITION AND LYCIA. ATTRITION DOES MY FAVORITE OF ALL THEIR SONGS; ITS ENTITLED "A GIRL CALLED HARMONY." THEY USED TO PLAY A CLUB MIX OF THAT SONG VERY FREQUENTLY AT THE GOTH CLUBS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND NEW ORLENAS. OVERALL, I RECOMMEND THIS CD, ESPECIALLY FOR THE NEW WAVE OF GOTHS. IT WILL IMMEDIATELY BECOME ONE OF THEIR FAVORITES!
