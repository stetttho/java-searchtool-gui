 While this is not as good as Swinburne's earlist work, "Songs Before Sunrise" is brilliant. I have found it VERY inspirational during certain tough times in my life. This book actually made me visit England to see where he stood while writing these poems. Best poems: On the Downs, Eurydice, Mater Dolorosa, and To Walt Whitman in America. Again, the poems of his later years were not his best, but true Romantic fans NEED to get a hold of this.
