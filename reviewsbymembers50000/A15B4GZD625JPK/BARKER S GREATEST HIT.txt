 BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF MY TOP 20 BOOKS OF ALL TIME, I DON'T WANT TO GIVE TOO MUCH AWAY. HOWEVER, I WILL SAY QUITE SIMPLY THAT "WEAVEWORLD" IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE BEST FANTASY BOOK I HAVE EVER READ, AT LEAST IN THE PAST 10 YEARS!  "WEAVEWORLD" IS BARKER AT HIS VERY BEST AND MOST BIZARRELY IMAGINATIVE, WHICH IS SAYING QUITE A LOT!!!! HIS PROTAGONIST IS LIKABLE, HUMAN, REAL; ONE CARES ABOUT THE DISENCHANTED MA'S PLIGHT AND HIS ADVENTURES. THE VILLAIN, A REAL MAGICAL MEANY, IS JUST AS THOROUGHLY DEPICTED BY THE AUTHOR, AND HE'S JUST AS TOTALLY ENTERTAINING.  WITH SOME BOOKS, WHEN THERE ARE 2 OR 3 PLOTS GOING ON AT ONCE, ONE OF THEM IS MORE FUN TO FOLLOW THAN THE OTHERS. THIS IS NOT THE CASE HERE. I, PERSONALLY, WAS/AM INTERESTED IN EVERYBODY AND THEIR THOUGHTS AND ADVENTURES. IF YOU DON'T READ THIS BOOK, YOU WILL DEFINITELY BE MISSING ONE OF THE BEST!
