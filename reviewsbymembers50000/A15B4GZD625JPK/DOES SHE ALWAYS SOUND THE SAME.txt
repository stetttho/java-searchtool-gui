 I LOVE PIA. DON'T GET ME WRONG. SHE IS ONE OF THE BEST VOICES IN NEW AGE POP TODAY. I LOVE HER! BUT PACIFICA IS NOT UNIQUE, IN MY OPINION. HER FIRST 2 ALBUMS SORT OF STAYED WITH "SAFE SONGS," BUT BEAUTIFUL ONES. nOW SHE'S PLAYING ENYA AND GETTING BORING. mORE LIKE BACKGROUND MUSIC THAN ANYTHING ELSE. I HOPE SHE FINDS SOME BETTER SONGS NESXT TIME, IF THERE IS A NEXT TIME.
