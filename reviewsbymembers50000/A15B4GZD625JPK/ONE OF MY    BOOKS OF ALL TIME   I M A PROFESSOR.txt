 THIS BOOK IS THE BEST OF JACK KEROUAC AND , BY FAR, THE BEST OF THE "ROAD BOOKS" EVER WRITTEN (THE BEST IF YOU ASK ME). THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL VIVIDLY DEPICTED, THE ATMNOSPHERE TO ALIVE. IT HAS A LOT TO SAY ABOUT FREEDOM AND LONLINESS AND  AND SO THEY TRAVEL TO FIND THEMSELVES, WHETHER THEY KNOW IT  OR NOT. KEROUAC AND HIS FRIENDS/CHARACTERS DRAG US THROUGH EVERY EMOTION, sadness, lonliness, hopefulness and JUST PLAIN MAD! I won't tell you too much or I'll ruin your experience. And that's what it is, an internal and external experience of being human now and then. THIS IS A BRILLIANT BOOK. IT IS A MUST READ!
