 ALTHOUGH I KNOW THAT MOST CURE FANS WILL DISAGREE, "WISH" IS PROBABLY ONE OF MY FAVORITE CURE CDs. OK, SO "FRIDAY I'M IN LOVE" IS A LITTLE TOO COMMERCIAL FOR MY TASTE; IT IS FUNNY! AND I, FOR ONE, CAN USE THE COMIC RELIEF WITHIN THIS STRANGE AND DARK JOURNEY THROUGH ROBERT SMITH'S MANIC-DEPRESSIVE MIND. THIS IS MOSTLY A VERY DARK CD (BUT AREN'T THEY ALL, REALLY?)--LONLINESS, LOSS, DESPAIR, "FORCED" DRUNKENNESS, HATRED.... SMITH EXPRESSES DESPAIR AT WHAT HIS LIFE (AS AN MUSICICAN/POET) HAS BECOME, REMORISE AT HOW HE MUST BEHAVE IN ORDER TO MAKE OTHERS HAPPY (LOVERS, MANAGERS, FANS, ETC.).  BUT MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE ALBUM IS "LETTER TO ELISE." IT IS SO SAD, SWEET AND DELICATE, LIKE A VICTORIAN-ROMANTIC POEM OF LOST/UNREQUITED LOVE. IN FACT, IT REMINDS ME, UNCANNILY, OF MY FAVORITE POET, CHARLES ALGERNON SWINBURNE'S POEM "FELISE?" COINCIDENCE? I DON'T THINK SO...EITHER WAY, "LETTER TO ELISE" IS BITTER-SWEET, TEAR-INSPIRING, SADLY PERMENANT....  I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED ROBERT SMITH TO BE A MUSICAL AND POETIC GENIUS, AND THIS ALBUM PROVES IT, ONE MORE TIME, AS SURELY AS "DISINTEGRATION" AND "FAITH."
