 This is probably my favorite Dean Koontz novel, which is saying a lot since I read almost everything he has ever done. This is definitely a very scary book, but it's more like a psychic mystery suspense novel.  The Face, a rich movie star with a son whom he basically ignores, is being stalked by a bizarre, Clive Barker-type, freak serial killer who sends his "idol" the most insane "gifts" I can imagine (apples filled with human eyes, etc.) I won't give away the ending, but it is a cool twist. I think the son, Fric, a magical, intelligent child, is really the most interesting character. I'm not sure that was Koontz's intention, but for me, Fric was the protagonist. The villain, Corey, is second. The Face himself is, for me, very underdeveloped. Perhaps that was intentional, but I don't think so.
