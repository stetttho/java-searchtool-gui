 WHO POSSIBLY COULD DISLIKE JAMES TAYLOR'S GREATEST HITS? WITH SONGS LIKE "YOU GOT A FRIEND," "CAROLINA ON MY MIND" AND "SWEET BABY JAMES," THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITES. I'VE BEEN THROUGH 2 TAPES AND 2 CDs ALREADY IN SEVERAL YEARS. HIS VOICE IS SO GENTLE, SWEET AND MELODIC, IT TAKES YOU AWAY TO A PEACEFUL PLACE (UP ON THE ROOF)WHERE TROUBLES ARE SO EASILY FORGOTTEN. IN MY HUKBLE OPINION, THERE IS NO MAN ALIVE WITH A BETTER SINGING VOICE AND A BETTER REPETOIRE OF SONGS!
