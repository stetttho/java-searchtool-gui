 THIS MOVIE WAS HAILED AS "....THE BEST SCARY MOVIE SINCE 'THE SIXTH SENSE'." (I DISAGREE! I ENJOYED "THE SIXTH SENSE," TOO, ON SOME LEVELS, BUT I DID NOT FIND IT TRULY SCARY--CALL ME CRAZY!!! I THOUGHT IT WAS AN INTELLECTUAL THRILLER!!!!)) AND IN THE END, IT WAS TOO PREDICTABLE (ATLEAST FOR US MOVIE BUFFS WHO SEE EVERYTHING :)) AND ANYWAY, PLOT TWISTS IN THE ENDS OF MOVIES ARE BECOMING CLICHE'. YOU SPEND 2 HOURS TRYING TO "FIGURE IT ALL OUT." FORGET IT. JUST ENJOY THE $9.00 FLICK!!!! THE PREMISE FOR "THE RING" WAS GREAT; THERE WAS SOOOOOOO MUCH POTENTIAL THERE--A KILLER VIDEO CIRCULATING THE WORLD; THOSE WHO WATCH THE MOVIE DIE IN 7 DAYS--MYSTERIOUS PHONE CALLS FROM EERIE LITTLE CHILDREN'S VOICES, MURDERED TEENAGERS, CREEPY CAMPS/LODGES THAT JUST HAPPEN TO POSSESS A VIDEO LIBRARY WITH THIS "KILLER VIDEO" IN IT. HECK, THERE WERE EVEN INSANE HORSES JUMPING OFF BOATS AND FREAKY LITTLE CHILDREN LIVING IN PADDED CELLS, BARN LOFTS AND AT THE BOTTOMS OF WELLS. THE ONLY REALLY CREEPY PART CAME NEAR THE END WHEN THE LITTLE GIRL CRAWLS OUT OF THE TELEVISION AND INTO THAT GUY'S LIVING ROOM. (OOPS! DID I GIVE TOO MUCH AWAY?)  ANOTHER URBAN LEGEND. GREAT! I LOVE URBAN LEGENDS! BUT THIS ONE WAS JUST NOT UP TO PAR. THE ACTING WAS BAD, THE ENDING WORSE. AND WHAT WAS THE DEAL WITH THE VIOLENT OLD MAN AND THE BATHROOM? PURE "SHOCK FACTOR" (HAHA)--SENSATIONALISM AT ITS WORST! I THINK THE DIRECTOR ONLY ACHIEVED ABOUT HALF OF WHAT HE HAD PLANNED TO DO. HE MADE US JUMP, BUT HE CHEATED US IN THE END, BUILT US UP AND THEN DROPPED SUCH A PREDICTABLE ENDING IN OUR COLLECTIVE LAPS. BUT I WON'T TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW IT ENDS. IT'S OUT ON RENTAL ALREADY! GO SEE FOR YOURSELF.
