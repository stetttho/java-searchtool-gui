 PIA HAS AN AMAZING, HYPNOTIC, NEARLY ANGELIC VOICE. I SAW HER IN CONCERT IN ENGLAND 3 TIMES, AND I WEPT WITH THE SHEER PURITY & BEAUTY IN HER VOICE. LIVE, SHE TOUCHES THE HEART AND THE SOUL SO DEEPLY, WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS . SHE IS PHENOMNINAL! BENEDICTION MOON IS HER BEST EFFORT SO FAR. ON THE ALBUM, SHE IS GREAT BUT THE VOCALS DO NOT HAVE THE SAME EFFECT FOR ME.PERHAPS IT IS HER SONG CHOICES. tHE BEST ARE RHADE AND ANGELUS CANTUS. (STILL, IT'S GLORIOUS!) I RECOMMEND ALL 3 OF HER CDs.
