 I LOVE THESE CRAZY GUYS, THEIR (PIPED IN) AIR GUITARS AND THE FUTURISTIC RELIGION THEY UNWITTINGLY ESTABLISH AS A RESULT OF THE MUSIC OF THEIR (VERY UNTALENTED) BAND-- THE WYLD STALLYNS!!!  IT REALLY DOESN'T GET ANY FUNNIER THAN THIS!  UNDER PRESSURE OF FAILING HISTORY CLASS, AND HAVING TO ATTEND A MILITARY ACADEMY, BILL AND TED RUN HEADLONG INTO A GUARDIAN ANGEL FROM THE FUTURE, WHILE HANGING OUT AT THE LOCAL CIRCLE K, TRYING TO DECIDE HOW TO PASS THEIR CLASS. FROM THERE, THEY GO ON A MISSION IN A TIME-TRAVELING TELEPHONE BOOTH, WHICH TAKES THEM ALL THROUGH AN AMAZING VARIETY OF "HISTORICAL" TIMES AND PLACES, MEETING UP WITH SOME AWESOME "MEDIEVAL BABES" ALONG THE WAY. (THE "HISTORICAL BABES" END UP BECOMING THE NEXT TWO MEMBERS OF THE BAND WYLD STALLYNS IN THE END!!! HAHAHHA) ON THEIR EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, THEY PICK UP NAPOLEAN, JOAN OF ARC, SOCRATES (THEY PRONOUCE IT "SO-KRATES"), BEETHOVEN, BILLY THE KID AND A FEW OTHER HILARIOUSLY UNSTUNNED HISTORICAL FIGURES, ALL OF WHOM TAKE THE JOURNEY AS THOUGH IT WAS NOTHING TOO OUT OF THE ORDINARY. (THIS, IN ITSELF, IS FUNNY!) I WON'T GIVE AWAY THE ENDING, WHICH IS VERY FUN AND MAKES FOR A GREAT SHOW FOR BILL AND TED'S FELLOW-STUDENTS AND TEACHERS, WITH ALL OF THE HISTORICAL CHARACTERS ACTING OUT THEIR PARTS IN AN  "A-WINNING" SCHOOL PRESENTATION. BUT THE REAL FUNNY PART IS THE ADVENTURE ITSELF!!! GOTTA SEEE THIS ONE!!!
