 AFTER HAVING READ THE THREE MERVYN PEAKE NOVELS ON WHICH THIS FILM IS BASED, WITH ALL PEAKE'S COLORFUL (UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE YEAR), BIZARRE EVENTS AND SURREALISTIC SETTINGS, I WAS EXPECTING THIS DVD TO BE SUPERB.  UNFORTUNATELY IT WASN'T, IN MY OPINION AND THAT OF MY FRIENDS (ALSO FANS OF PEAKE & GORMENGHAST). THE CASTING WAS TERRIBLE (EXCEPT MAYBE IN THE CASES OF THE TWINS AND SPEARPIKE). THE BRITISH MOVIE-MAKERS SKIPPED SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SCENES IN THE TRILOGY OF BOOKS, AND I FOUND MYSELF BORED AFTER THE FIRST INSTALLMENT OF THREE MINI-SERIES-LIKE EPISODES ON THE DVD. I WISH SO DEEPLY THAT I COULD SAY MORE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS POTENTIAL MASTERPIECE, BUT I MUST BE HONEST. I SOLD MY COPY OF THE DVD AFTER ONLY ONE VIEWING. :(
