 I GOT THIS CD IN THE MAIL TWO DAYS AGO AND HAVE LISTENED TO NOTHING ELSE SINCE THEN! IT'S GREAT. KIND OF A BLEND OF SWITCHBLADE SYMPHONY, EVANESSENCE AND DEPECHE MODE. MY FAVORITE SONG IS PROBABLY "BLUE DRESS," A DEPECHE MODE COVER WRITTEN BY MARTIN GORE. (I AM LISTENING TO IT NOW!!!!) ALL OF THE OTHER SONGS ON THE ALBUM ARE BRILLIANT AS WELL! (YOU DON'T HAVE TO SKIP PAST A SINGLE ONE!)  THE FEMALE VOICE OF THE BAND IS BOTH ETHEREAL AND STRONG/PASSIONATE. AT TIMES, SHE SPEAKS MORE THAN SINGS, AS THOUGH SHE IS RECITING POETRY. THE SONG TOPICS ARE DARK: DEATH, LOSS, SUFFERING, LONLINESS.... (EXPERIENCES ALMOST ALL OF US CAN RELATE TO). BUT IF YOU LIKE THAT KIND OF STUFF (LIKE ME), YOU WILL ADORE THIS CD. I WILL BE GIVING IT AS GIFTS TO ALL OF MY FRIENDS. I PREDICT THIS GROUP WILL BE A BIG HIT IN THE GOTH/INDUSTRIAL/DARKWAVE SCENES.
