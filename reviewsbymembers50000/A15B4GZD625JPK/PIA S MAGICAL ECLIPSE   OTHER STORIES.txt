 THIS IS MY OPINION PIA'S SECOND BEST EFFORT (AFTER "BENEDICTION MOON). AS A FRIEND OF PIA AND HER FATHER JOHN RICHARDSON, I HAVE SEEN HER IN CONCERT A FEW TIMES IN ENGLOAND. SHE IS A STUNNING SINGER, MOVED ME TO TEARS. THE BEST SONG ON THIS CD IS "BEAUTIFUL," THE REST SOUND PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS "BENEDICTION MOON" AND "PACIFICA." i DO LIK EIT VERY MUCH THOUG, ESPECIALLY AS BACKGROUND MUSIC OR IF I NEED A GOOD CRY!
