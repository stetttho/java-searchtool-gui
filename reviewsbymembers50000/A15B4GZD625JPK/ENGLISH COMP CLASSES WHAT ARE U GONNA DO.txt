 I HAVE USED PROBABLY 30 DIFFERENT FRESHMEN COMP. CLASSES AND DEVELOPMENTAL WRITING. UNTIL I DISCOVERED THIS BOOK ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO, MY CLASSES ARE MUCH MORE LIVELY, AND QUIET STUDENTS SYDDENLY SPEAK OUT ABOUT SECTIONS OF THE TEXT THAT THEY DON'T AGREE WITH. GREAT DIVERSE SECTIONS TO COVER IN CLASSROOM TALKS.  IF INTERESTED, I CAN SEND COLLEGE ENGLISH TEACHERS MY COURSE SYLLABI USING "SHORT TAKES."
