 THIS BOOK BLEW ME AWAY THE FIRST TIME I READ IT, SO I READ IT AGAIN. AND AGAIN. FOUR TIMES IN ALL!!! I FOUND IT AS GOOD OR BETTER AS "THE CIPHER," "BAD BRAINS" AND "SKIN." THE ATMOSPHERE IS EXTREMELY SURREAL, MAGICAL, NOT AT ALL REALITY. (I LOST MYSELF IN KOJA'S WORLD COMPLETELY.) THAT'S PROBABLY THE PART I LIKE BEST ABOUT THE BOOK, IT CAPTURE'S ONE'S IMAGINATION/ATTENTION THROUGHOUT AND COMPLETELY). IT MAKES ME, A WRITER MYSELF, WANT TO WRITE SOMETHING A STRANGE AS THIS! FURTHERMORE, THE READER FEELS SO INTIMATE WITH EVERY CHARACTER IN "STARNGE ANGELS." THE CHARACTERS ARE SO VERY WELL-DEVELOPED, AS WITH ALL OF KOJA'S CHARACTERS IN ALL OF HER BOOKS. THE DOWNFALL OF THE NARRATOR AND HIS (SCHIZOPHRENIC? MANIC-DEPRESSIVE? OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE? SPIRITUALLY "HIGHER"?) "ANGEL" ROOMATE, AND THEIR GIRLFRIEND IS STUNNINGLY TERRIFYING, TERRIFYINGLY "PERMENANT." A MUST READ BOOK FOR ALL HORROR/THRILLER FANS AND THOSE OTHER READERS WHO JUST LIKE AN INTRGUING PSYCHOLOGICAL CONUNDRUM !
