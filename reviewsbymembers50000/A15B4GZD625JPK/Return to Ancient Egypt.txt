 PHIL THORNTON AND HOSSAM RAMZY HAVE DONE IT AGAIN! ALL OF THE MAGICAL, SEDUCTIVE MYSTICISM OF "IMMORTAL EGYPT" IS BACK IN FULL-FORCE. TRACKS LIKE "ISIS UNVEILED," "SHIMMERS IN THE SAND" AND "THE LAND OF THE PHARAOHS" ARE THROBBINGLY HYPNOTIC AND CAPTIVATING, LURING ONE INTO ANCIENT EGYPT'S DEEPEST, DARKEST MYSTERIES WITH THEIR FLUTES, DRUMS, VOCODER AND TIBETAN SINGING BOWELS.  OTHER SONGS LIKE "THE COBRA'S DANCE" AND "DESERT RHYTHM" ARE ACTUALLY BASED ON TRADITIONAL EGYPTIAN MUSICAL SOUNDS/RYTHMS. MY GUESS IS THAT THE REST OF THE SONGS ARE AS WELL.  THE BEST THREE WORDS FOR THIS CD ARE: HYPNOTIC, EXOTIC AND VISIONARY.
