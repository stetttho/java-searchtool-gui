 IF YOU LIKED THE HELLRAISER FILM SERIES, YOU MAY BE A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED, BUT JUST A LITTLE. tHE BOOK IS VERY SHORT AND GRAPHIC, BUT THE CHARACTERS ARE VERY UNDERDEVELOPED. I AM BARKER'S BIGGEST FAN, SO IT PAINS ME TO SAY THAT I WOULDN'T PAY A WHOLE LOT FOR THE BOOK. TRY WEAVEWORLD AND THE DAMNATION GAME INSTEAD. THOSE CANNOT BE BEAT BY ANY LIVING HORROR WRITER!
