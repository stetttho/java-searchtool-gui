 MOST OF THE POEMS IN "FATAL WOMEN" ARE NAMED AFTER WOMEN IN THE POET'S MANIC-DEPRESSIVE, SAD, LONELY LIFE. (THESE ARE, MORE OR LESS, HIS OWN WORDS FROM A LECTURE.) HOWEVER, THE VERSES I TEND TO FOCUS ON ARE TAKEN FROM HISTORICAL, MYTHOLOGICAL AND LITERARY SOURCES, POEMS SUCH AS "OPHELIA" AND "ORPHEUS." THIS MAN HAS EVEN SUCCESSFULLY "COMPLETED" SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE'S "KUBLA KHAN."  BOTTOM LINE: THIS IS A MUST HAVE BOOK! ALL OF THE VERSES ARE PHENOMENAL!!!
