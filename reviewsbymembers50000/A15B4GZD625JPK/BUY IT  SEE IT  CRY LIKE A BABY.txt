 I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THAT "I AM SAM" IS A CHICK FLICK. BUT I'M A MAN, AND I LOVED IT. (SO DID MY GIRLFRIEND!) THE ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK IS SUPERB. I BOUGHT IT THE DAY AFTER SEEING THE FILM, AND I LISTEN TO IT FREQUENTLY. IT'S ENTIRELY ORIGINAL MUSIC, NO COVERS. I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE PLOT AWAY, BUT "I AM SAM" INVOLVES A VERY YOUNG GIRL WHOSE FATHER IS RETARDED, AND SHE BEGINS TO LOSE TOUCH WITH HIM AS SHE SURPASSES HIS INTELLIGENCE AT ABOUT AGE 8. THE PLOT PROGRESSES WITH THEIR LIVES APART AND TOGETHER, THEIR COURT BATTLE (VERY HEART-RENCHING) AND THE CHANGING BELIEFS OF SAM'S LAWYER, WHO BELIEVES, AT FIRST, THAT HE IS UNABLE TO FATHER THE GIRL; THEN SHE REALIZES THAT HE NEEDS TO BE A PART OF HER LIFE...EVEN IF A COMPROMISE IS NECESSARY. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANT A GOOD CRY.
