 I JUST FINISHED READING "SUMMER OF NIGHT" TODAY, AND I MUST SAY THAT IT IS THE MOST WELL-WRITTEN HORROR NOVEL I HAVE EVER READ. THE LANGUAGE IS EXQUISITE, CHARACTERS WELL-DEVELOPED AND THE ATMOSPHERE IS PERFECT. tHE MAIN CHARACTERS ARE SIX 11 YEAR OLD BOYS ON THEIR SUMMER VACATION. iN THIS WAY, IT REMINDS ONE OF STEPHEN KING'S NOVELLA "THE BODY" (OR THE FILM "STAND BY ME.") I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN, AND I WILL NEVER SELL MY COPY. IT'S ONE OF THOSE RARE BOOKS YOU CAN'T BELIEVE YOU NEVER READ BEFORE AS IT WAS WRITTEN IN 19911!!!   GET A HOLD OF IT, AND CHERISH IT. IT WILL BRING BACK SO MANY CHILDHOOD MEMORIES THAT YOU CAN FEEL THE SUMMER BREEZE IN YOUR HAIR AS YOU RIDE BIKES THROUGH TREE-LADEN SMALL TOWNS. SUPERB!
