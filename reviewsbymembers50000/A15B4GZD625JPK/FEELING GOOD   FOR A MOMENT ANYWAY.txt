 THIS IS A VERY BRIEF BOOK WRITTEN PRIMARILY FOR CHILDREN--UNHAPPY, DEPRESSED, "ABNORMAL" CHILDREN. THE GIST OF THE THING IS TO INSTILL IN THE KIDS THAT IT IS "OK" TO BE DIFFERENT. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY "ARE" DIFFERENT, BUT THAT'S ok. oUR OUTWARD & INWARD DIFFERENCES ARE TO BE "CELEBRATED."  I AGREE, BUT... DO YOU SEE ANYTHING WEIRD ABOUT THIS? IT'S SUCH A PARADOX, A CONUNDRUM OF THE BACK AGAINST THE WALL, WHAT CAN I DO TO FIT IN WITH THESE ADULTS AND OTHER CHILDREN VARIETY. I CAN'T GET MY MIND AROUND THIS CONCEPT (OR ACCEPT IT), SO HOW CAN ANYONE EXPECT "ABNORMAL CHILDREN" TO COMPREHEND WHAT IS BEING IMPLIED? THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH LIFE EXPERIENCE! THE INTELLIGENT CHILDREN (AND MOST "WEIRD" KIDS ARE INTELLIGENT FOR SOME REASON) ARE LEFT TO INFER THAT FEELING GOOD HAPPENS WHEN YOU BEHAVE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. THE BOOK DOES WORK ON ONE LEVEL AT LEAST; HOWEVER, AND THAT IS THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE HAPPY, IF FOR JUST A MINUTE OCCASSIONALLY, THIS WORKBOOK-TYPE TOME IS FULL OF FUN ACTIVITIES TO KEEP THEIR "STRANGE, UNHAPPY" LITTLE MINDS OCCUPIED.
