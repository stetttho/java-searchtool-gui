 THIS BOOK OF SHORT STORIES (IF YOU CAN CALL THEM THAT?) BY JAMES HAVOC IS ABOUT AS GRAPHIC, PERVERSE, SEXUAL AND OBSCENE AS A COLLECTION OF SHORT TALES CAN GET. I LOVE IT, PERSONALLY, BUT ONLY IN A VERY WEIRD, SHOCKED AT MYSELF, SORT OF WAY. IT'S A LITTLE SCARY TO ADMIT, BUT THIS COLLECTION OF "STORIES" HAS INSPIRED SOME SHORT STORIES AND POEMS OF MY OWN. AND NOT A FEW FANTASIES. :) HOWEVER, BUYER BEWARE! MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE SHOCKED AND DUMB-FOUNDED AT THE GRAPHIC DEFECATION, ANAL SEX, DEMON-SEX, CHILDREN HAVING ORAL SEX, ETC. THIS IS NOT FOR ANYONE UNDER 18, REALLY.
