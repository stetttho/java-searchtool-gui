 You know, I wanted to like this book. Everyone seems to believe that Neil Gaiman is the next Clive Barker. But I have to disagree. I have been trying to read this book for over 3 years, and I just keep getting bored. Why? I don't know. The premise is good; the characters are well-developed and the story definitely has "that" atmosphere I always love in "Wonderland-type tales." But for some reason, when I finally finished it, I thought, "Hmmm, what's all the fuss about?" It's well-crafted and very dark (which I like), but it doesn't have that something extra that makes one want everyone they know to read the book. AFTER READING "NEVERWHERE" A SECOND TIME, I LIKED IT BETTER AND RAISED MY OVERALL RATING FROM 3 TO 4 STARS. STILL, SOMETHING FEELS LIKE IT'S MISSING SOMEWHERE.
