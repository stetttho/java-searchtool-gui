 WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS SHORT, LITTLE BOOK IS THAt it it contains all the best poe poems in the literary canon. this makes it great for college teachers like me who need an inexpensive, thorough Poe survey. Best poems include: Alone, Annabel Lee, The Raven, The Sleeper & Dream within a dream. Students tend to love these, as does every poet and prof. I know!
