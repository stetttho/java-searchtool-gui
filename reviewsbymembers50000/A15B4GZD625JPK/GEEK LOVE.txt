 KATHERINE DUNN'S NOVEL "GEEK LOVE" IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER HAD THE PLEASEURE OF READING. AND IT STANDS THE TEST OF TIME. I READ IT FIRST BACK IN 1996 AND AGAIN IN 2004. IT WAS JUST AS WONDERFUL THE SECOND TIME AROUND, IF NOT MORE SO. I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN, LIKE A VOYEUR I WAS RIVETED TO THE SPOT, WATCHING THE BIZARRE PARADE OF CARNIVAL CHARACTERS MOVE BY IN THEIR OWN SECRET AND SAFE WORLD OF THE CARNIVAL MIDWAYS OF AMERICA, THEIR THOUGHTS ON EERILY "NORMAL" SUBJECTS, THEIR DESIRES TOO "HUMAN" TO BELIEVE. "GEEK LOVE" IS A NOVEL FULL OF "SIDESHOW FREAKS." LIKE THE CARNIVAL-GOERS, WE WATCH THEM WITH BOTH FASCINATION AND FEAR. THE LOBSTER BOY, THE SIAMESE TWINS,THE ALBINO MIDGET (OUR NARRATOR), ETC. ALL SURPRISE US IN THEIR BIZARRENESS AS WELL AS IN THEIR "NORMALNESS." THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE US, BUT THEY ARE US. THEY WANT WHAT WE WANT. THEY FEEL WHAT WE FEEL. AND SOMEHOW THIS IS VERY MOVING. SOMEHOW, BY THE END OF THE BOOK, WE HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A HUMAN BEING. I LOVE THIS BOOK AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYBODY.
