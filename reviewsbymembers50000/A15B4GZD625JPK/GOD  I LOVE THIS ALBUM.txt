 I HEARD THIS COMPACT DISC FIRST IN UNDERGRADUATE SCHOOL, ABOUT AGE 18, AND I IMMEDIATELY FELL IN LOVE WITH IT, TAPING IT FOR EVERYONE I KNEW. AND THEY ALL LOVED IT TOO. THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT THE SINGER'S VOICE, BOTH IN CONCERT AND ON THE CD/CASSETTE. IT IS SWEET, MATERNAL, SOMEHOW PERFECT IN ITS SEDUCTIVE CLARITY AND SUREALISTIC QUALITY. AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING CLICHE', HER VOICE IS LIKE A BEAUTIFUL GUARDIAN ANGEL. WHEN SHE SAYS, "HUSH, CLOSE YOUR EYES. I'LL KEEP YOU SAFE." AND I TRUST HER. I LOVE EVERY SONG ON EVERY CD THEY EVER MADE. MAYBE SOMETIME I WILL HAVE TIME TO REVIEW THEM ALL. BUT IT WOULD BE REDUNDANT, REALLY. THEY ALL BRING TEARS AND SMILES..."SONGS BOTH SAD AND SWEET," AS POET, KEVIN N. ROBERTS, WOULD SAY. SO GO OUT RIGHT NOW, AND BUY ALL OF THEIR ALBUMS. THEY ARE ALL AMAZING. I CANNOT SEE HOW ANYONE, ESPECIALLY A WOMAN OR A SENSITIVE/POETIC MAN, COULD NOT FALL IN LOVE WITH THESE UNIQUE, INNOVATIVE MUSICIANS.
