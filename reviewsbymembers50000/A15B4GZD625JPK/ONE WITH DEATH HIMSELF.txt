 THIS IS THE COOLEST BOOK IF YOU ARE INTO ALL THINGS GOTHIC & DARK, THINKING ABOUT DEATH, LEARNING ABOUT THE CRAFT...AND NECROPHILIA.  THE AUTHOR BELIEVES HERSELF TO BE "ONE WITH DEATH." QUITE BIZARRE, BUT A FANTASTIC, UNIQUE AND TRULY PROFOUND READ. INSPIRES INTRIGUING THOUGHTS, THOUGHTS THAT ONLY LEILAH WENDELL COULD INSPIRE. I MET HER IN NEW ORLEANS ONCE, AND SHE IS A REALLY DOWN TO EARTH PERSON, BUT THERE IS SOMETHING "SPECIAL" ABOUT HER. PERHAPS SHE REALLY IS A NECROMANCER OF THE HIGHEST ORDER?!?!?!
