 I CAN SAY NOTHING ABOUT THIS CHARMINGLY MYSTICAL BOOK EXCEPT THAT I WILL NEVER WRITE POETRY CRITICISM AGAIN AFTER SEEING WHAT THIS MAN IS CAPABLE OF. "QUEST FOR THE BELOVED" IS FILLED WITH DISCUSSIONS OF THE POETRY OF CARMEN AND OTHER ROMANTICS, BUT ROBERTS'S ANALYSES ARE LIKE POETRY IN THEMSELVES, THE FIRST LITERARY CRITICISM I HAVE ACTUALLY ENJOYED READING, LOOKING FORWARD TO PERUSING IT EVERY EVENING BEFORE BED UNTIL FINISHING IT.  THEN I SOUGHT OUT HIS OTHER TITLES. THAT'S WHEN I FOUND THE UNBELIEVABLY BRILLIANT "FATAL WOMEN" COLLECTION. (THERE IS ALSO HIS CD "HOW SWEET THE NIGHT," AVAILABLE FROM THE POETIC JOURNAL "ROMANTICS QUARTERLY" AND SOON "WILD MOOD SWINGS: POEMS OF A MANIC-DEPRESSIVE ROMANTIC POET" AVAILABLE LATER THIS YEAR!) HAVING SAID THIS, I RECOMMEND "FATAL WOMEN," ONE OF  KEVIN N. ROBERTS'S POETRY COLLECTIONS, EVEN OVER "QUEST FOR THE BELOVED." (ACTUALLY, "QUEST" MAKES A GREAT COMPANION TO  "FATAL WOMEN.") THIS POETRY COLLECTION,"FW," MADE ME GIVE UP ON WRITING POWETRY. FOR WHO COULD SURPASS IT? SURELY NOT I.  MANY OF THE "FATAL WOMEN" IN ROBERTS'S BOLD AND BEAUTIFUL VERSES ARE LITERARY FIGURES LIKE OPHELIA AND ASTROLOGIA (AND ORPHEUS, WHO WAS A MYTHOLOGICAL MAN WHO LOST HIS LIFE FOR HIS FATAL WOMAN). OTHERS ARE WOMEN FROM HIS OWN "LONELY, SAD-SWEET,  MANIC-DEPRESSIVE LIFE" (HIS OWN WORDS AT A COLLEGE LECTURE I ATTENDED IN 2002.) I HIGHLY RECOMMEND "QUEST FOR THE BELOVED" TO SERIOUS STUDENTS OF POETRY," BUT I THINK EVERYONE NEEDS A DOSE OF ROBERTS'S SPIRITUAL, VICTORIAN-STYLE FORMAL VERSE. "FATAL WOMEN" IS MY FIRST CHOICE. (TRUST ME ON THIS ONE, PLEASE! HIS BOOK IS NOT AS POPULAR IN THE USA AS IT WAS OVERSEAS, AS IT WAS PUBLISHED AND ADVERTISED IN THE UK, BUT IT CAN BE ACQUIRED AT MANY BOOK STORES AND LIBRARIES, AND OF COURSE, AT AMAZON.COM. OR YOU CAN READ A FEW OF HIS VERSES AND ORDER A SIGNED COPY OF ANY OR ALL OF THIS TITLES FROM: HTTP://HOMETOWN.AOL.COM/FEMMEFATALE300 TO READ A FEW OF HIS POEMS, GO TO: WWW.THEHYPERTEXTS.COM
