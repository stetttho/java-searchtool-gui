 THIS BOOK BY KAY REDFIELD-JAMISON MADE ME REALIZE THAT MY ARTISTIC AND POETIC TALENTS ARE PROBABLY PRODUCTS OF MY MANIC-DEPRESSION, THAT I AM NOT TOTALLY MAD!!!! SHE ALSO PROVIDES A VERY LENGTHY LIST OF ALL THE TRULY GREAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED WITH AND DIED BECAUSE OF BIPOLAR DISORDER. THE NUMBER OF POETS, ARTISTS, WRITERS, COMPOSERS, ETC. IS ASTOUNDING. HERE I AM THINKING THAT I AM A POET/ARTIST WITH AN EMOTIONAL PROBLEM, WHEN ACTUALLY I AM AN EXCELLENT POET/ARTIST BECAUSE OF MY (DISABILITY) MANIC-DEPRESSION. THIS SITUATION GIVES NEW MEANING TO THE WORDS "ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT." THE LIST OF BIPOLAR/MANIC-DEPRESSIVE PEOPLE (WITH SUPERIOR ARTISTIC ABILITIES) ALONE IS WORTH THE COST OF THE BOOK.
