 I SAW THIS MOVIE THE FIRST DAY IT WAS OUT IN THEATRES. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GREAT BASED ON THE TRAILERS. BOY, WAS I WRONG. ADVERTISED AS "SHEER TERROR...THE MOST SCARY, STYLISH HORROR MOVIE...IN YEARS."  I figured, foolishly as it turned out, "HOW COULD THIS GO WRONG?" CLIVE BARKER (MY BRITISH HORROR IDOL) ACTUALLY WROTE THAT REVIEW!!! (WEEP, CRY, SCREECH!!!)HOW COULD HE? ANYWAY, THE ONLY THING SCARY ABOUT THE MOVIE IS ITS ELUSIVE, DARK, SHAPELESS MONSTER THAT REMINDED ME OF THE WITHER CHARACTER IN THE GREAT HORROR NOVELS "WITHER" & "WITHER'S RAIN." I ADMIT, IT MOVED AROUND THE WALLS AND CEILINGS VERY QUICKLY, AND THAT WAS SOMEHOW EXTREMELY FRIGHTENING FOR ME. ALSO, A BIG ROOM FULL OF BONES FOUND BY THE CHARACTERS WAS INTERESTINGLY GROTESQUE. BUT THAT WAS AS FAR AS THE TERROR GOT FOR ME AND MY COMRADES. OTHERWISE, THE CHARATERS WERE BORING, THE ACTORS TERRIBLE AND THE PLOT PRETTY PREDICTABLE. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND WAIT FOR THE RENTAL.
