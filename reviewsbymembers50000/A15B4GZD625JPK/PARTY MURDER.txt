 THERE ARE MANY THINGS I LIKE ABOUT THIS MOVIE AND SEVERAL THINGS I DON'T LIKE. FIRST OFF, THE ACTING (BY BOTH SETH GREEN AND MACK CULKIN) WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS. THEY LOOKED GREAT, JUST LIKE THE CHARACTERS THEY PORTRAYED (AS SEEN IN THE FILM "PARTY MONSTER: THE SHOCKUMENTARY"), BUT THEY JUST COULDN'T PULL OFF THAT ELUSIVE "SOMETHING" THAT MADE THE CLUB KIDS INTO "STARS." THE ACTORS WERE STIFF AND AWKWARD. EVEN MARILYN MANSON'S ACTING, WHO MADE A SOMEWHAT LONG CAMEO APPEARANCE AS CHRISTINA, A DRUG-ADDLED DRAG QUEEN, WAS BETTER THAN THE MAIN CHARACTERS'. CULKIN, AS MICHAEL ALIG, THE SELF-CONFESSED MURDERER OF HIS DRUG DEALER, ANGEL, WAS FUN TO WATCH--HIS COSTUMES, HIS GORY PARTIES, HIS STRANGE, SEEMINGLY BISEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH HIS "FRIENDS"..... BUT IN THE END, AFTER HE COMMITS THE MURDER, APPARENTLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MIND-ALTERING DRUGS, HE IS JUST PLAIN SCARY. THERE ARE SOME PRETTY GORY SCENES IN THE FILM, PARTICULARLY THE MURDER ITSELF, WITH MICHAEL'S ROOMMATE BASHING ANGEL'S HEAD IN WITH A HAMMER SEVERAL TIMES. AND THEN, FOR A HANDFUL OF DRUGS, MICHAEL ALIG AGREES TO CUT THE BODY UP INTO LITTLE PIECES AND DISPOSE OF IT. IT WAS REALLY VERY GROSS AND DISTURBING TO WATCH AND TO THINK ABOUT AFTERWARDS. FORTUNATELY, THEY KEPT THE DISMEMBERMENT MINIMAL. OVERALL, I ENJOYED WATCHING THIS MOVIE. FOR SOME REASON, IT IS FRIGHTENINGLY FUN TO WATCH BEAUTIFUL, "FABULOUS," DRUG ADDICTS/DRAG QUEENS COMMIT MURDERS AND THEN JOKE ABOUT IT. (AND THEN THEY TURN AROUND AND MAKE MONEY OFF THE MOVIE, THE DOCUMENTARY AND THE BOOKS.)
