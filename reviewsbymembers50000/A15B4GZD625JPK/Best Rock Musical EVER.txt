 I cannot say enough about this movie/play. I have seen the play 3 times and own the DVD and VHS. I listen to the CD all day everyday at work. The music cannot be better...so moving. While the film/play is a mix of dark comedy, hilarious scenes and what some people might find downright outrageous, I am more inclined to call this a kind of Greek Tragedy, Hedwig being the protagonist...her fatal flaw (a botched sex change among other things) is both her downfall (miserable life) and her triumph. I won;t say more. Excelt, do yourself a huge favor ans see both the film and the play.
