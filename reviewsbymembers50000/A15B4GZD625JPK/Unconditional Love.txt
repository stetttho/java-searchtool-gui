 This book is touted as "reflections of the Christ mind." (Very heavy stuff.) It actually reads like a modern Bible, at times using archaic language and seeming to be a series of messages  sent to the author telepathically, from the mind of some sort of Christ consciousness--I'm not too clear on that. The author seems to believe himself to be a kind of modern-day Prophet spreading the message of compassion and unconditional love for all humanity. (And who am I to deny this?)  While I find this difficult to believe, that he is telepathically in tune with the mind of Christ, I still enjoyed the book very much. Whoever actually "said" these words, they are moral, common sense truth. The overall message is one of love, tolerance and compassion. It is really quite a beautiful book to read for Christians and Non-Christians alike. I recommend it highly, especially for those in need of renewed faith in the "Word."
