 Don't expect Ercic Clapton "guitar god" on this one. Pick up "From The Cradle", "Journeyman" etc. if you're looking for that Eric....The Eric on "Back Home" returns to the classic "laid back" feel displayed on "461 Ocean Blvd.", "Slowhand" etc. This is a catharthic experience for Clapton, and his "soul cleansing" comes through in an honest and soulful way. Listen to "Say What You Will" and "Run Home To Me", and you'll hear it first hand. There are also some excellent covers of "Love Comes To Everyone" (G. Harrison) and "Love Don't Love Nobody" (Spinners)....Pick this one up and sit back and enjoy your visit to E.C.'s "home". You might not want to leave.
