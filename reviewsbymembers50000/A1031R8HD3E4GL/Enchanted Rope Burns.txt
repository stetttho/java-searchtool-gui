 Having been an Enchant fan for the past few years, I am dissapointed to say that this one falls short of what I expected. The excellent musicianship is still there, it jsut lacks the great melodies that Enchant is known for. Some exceptions are "Living in a Movie", "Long Way Down", and "Comatose"..There is also a great instramental appropriately named "Progtology"...New fans might enjoy, I just expected MORE....This CD was produced in less than 1 year, and it sounds rushed (no pun intended!).
