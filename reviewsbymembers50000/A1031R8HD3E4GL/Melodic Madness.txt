 "The 7th Song" is a fantastic collection of Steve Vai's guitar ballads (the 7th track on his CD's). This offering is chock full of intensely emotional guitar ballads. For listeners who love early Joe Satriani (Vai's ex guitar teacher, ala "Surfing With The Alien")this will blow you away! Vai has as uncanny knack for delivering highly technical guitar elements in the guise of beautiful melody...Standout tracks include "For The Love Of God",  "Windows To The Soul", "Tender Surrender", "Hand On The Heart" and the NEW "Melissa's Garden". This is a great "taste of Vai" for newcomers.
