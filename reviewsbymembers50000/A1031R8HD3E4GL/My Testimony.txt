 First, I will start off by saying I've been a huge Beard fan since "The Light" (their first CD). Neal Morse has always been an inspiration to me , as a prolific songwriter and musician. He has created, IMHO, some of the best prog work in recent times with "Day For Night", "Kindness of Strangers" and "V". I was dissapointed with "Snow", in terms of lyrical content and song structure...I found the "2 hour format" as sounding forced at times. Neal's solo effort "Testimony" , continues along this path. Only now, Neil's new found Christianity, is his central theme.This disk needs to establish an identity- it struggles at times between brilliant prog and light Christian music, but does not really do justice to either.....I think Neal should deliver his messages of faith in a Christian Music focused product and still produce creative prog pieces ala "Healing Colors of Sound", "Flow", "Stranger in Your Soul" etc....Not sure Neal's new "Testimony" is clear to all of us.
