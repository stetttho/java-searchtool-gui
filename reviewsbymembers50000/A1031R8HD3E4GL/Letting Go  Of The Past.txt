 Folks, we need to "let go". Spock's Beard is NOT the same band it was with Neal Morse. They are NO LONGER a PROG band (lengthy,complex compositions,unique counterpoints etc.). The NEW Beard is a rock band with intelligent writing, great musicians, and at times, interesting melodies. IMHO, they are still light years ahead of what is on the musical scene today! Lots of great bands experienced dramatic "changes" in their sound when key members departed (Genesis, Pink Floyd, Yes, etc.)  The Beard "is what they is" (As Frank Zappa once said... )Like 'em or leave 'em. Octane, their 8th release, contains some solid compositions- "A Flash Before My Eyes", "I Wouldn't Let It Go", "Of The Beauty Of It All", "The Planet's Hum"...Don't buy this expecting to hear OLD Beard. You'll be dissapointed. Look at them as a NEW band, and a pretty good one at that. If we're able to LET GO , we can appreciate the BEAUTY OF IT ALL.
