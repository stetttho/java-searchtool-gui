 Having been a long time Spocks Beard, Dream Theater, Flower Kings fan, I truly appreciate "Bridge Across Forever"...This CD displays a "tempered" Neal Morse and more of his bandmates "input" than on the debut Transatlantic CD. BAF is a masterfully crafted musical journey. All four tracks blend and create the "perfect" product. "Duel With The Devil" kicks things off, with a cello lead ala Spcks Beard V...."Suite Charlotte Pike" is a Beatlesque "Abbey Road" side 2 type of piece.."Bridge Across Forever" is a poignant Neal Morse piece that is soothing, in light of what's happening in our world today...And finally, the greatest track of all, "Stranger In Your Soul" takes in the prior "journey's" and completes the "bridge". This track is a true masterpiece, containing all the melody, virtuouso mucianship, and composing associated with all the members of this great band. This is a MUST for all progressive fans!
