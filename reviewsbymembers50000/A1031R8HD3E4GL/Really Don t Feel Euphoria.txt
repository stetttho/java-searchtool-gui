 This is the NEW Spock's Beard. Sought of like the Beatles without John Lennon. The creative force of the band -Neal Morse is sorely missed! I have been a Beard fan since their first release (The Light).....Gone are the melodies, thoughtful lyrics, and ingenious arrangements of Neal....Drummer Nick D'Virgillio steps up and does a credible job, but this falls far short of what we've come to expect from previous SB efforts ("V", "Kindness of Strangers", "Day For Night" etc.)Neal Morse was a TRUE musical genious. His shoes will never be filled....This CD does NOT leave you with a feeling of Euphoria, but rather with an empty hole which may never be filled...............
