 Excellent debut effort from Evan Olson. A rare find these days, in terms of musical ability vs. image. Evan wrote, produced and played all instruments on "One Room".... If you are into positive, uplifting pop-rock, this one's for you. Standout tracks include "Falling", "So Much Better", "Don't Break My Fall" and "A Million Things". The future looks bright for Evan Olson.
