 First off, I am a Christian. "?" is NOT the best solo offering that Neal has put out in terms of a "complete offering" (Melodies,Mucianship,Messages). It is filled with , IMHO, way too much Bible references. At times, I felt like I was reading from the scriptures and not one man's perspective. This is by far  Neal's most religious offering yet. Their needs to be a fine line between preaching his beliefs and just "preaching". On the positive side, "?" contains the best prog music he has produced since the "Beard".....He has an all-star lineup contributing on this one- Mike Portnoy, Roine Stolt, Steve Hackett, Jordan Rudess etc. Key prog pieces include "In The Fire", "12", "Solid As The Sun". Neal Morse fans won't be dissapointed, just possibly overwhelmed with the Good Book. To be, or Not to be all encompassed in Christianity...That is the question.
