 First off , I am a HUGE Neal Morse fan. Have followed Spock's Beard since "The Light". This is not vintage Neal. I think it's time to head back into the "pre Snow" era.  This religious themed music is starting to wear thin. Music themes on this one seem "rehashed" and the lyrics are very simplistic. Musically, there are , as always, some great moments. But by and large, "One" falls short of what NM is capable of delivering. Boy do I miss "old" Bearded Neal......
