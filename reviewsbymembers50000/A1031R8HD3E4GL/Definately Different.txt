 After waiting with great anticipation for this new SB release simply  entitled "V", I have to say I'm very dissapointed. This is  definately my least favorite Spock's Beard effort. It seems that Neal Morse  abandoned his sense of "melodic adventure" for a heavier more  "technical" sound. As a result, "V" contains very few  memorable moments. The first cut "At The End Of The Day" starts  off promising, but rapidly deteriorates into a plodding piece. The next  four cuts contain sparse melodies, certainly nothing in the usual  "Beard tradition". The final track "The Great Nothing"  should be the title cut. This track is the best on this CD, but again falls  way short of classic SB.
