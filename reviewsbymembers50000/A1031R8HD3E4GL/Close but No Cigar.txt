 First the good news. This is the best Todd effort since "The Tortured Artist Effect". Now the bad news. It is NOT vintage Todd. Traces of melody surface throughout, surrounded by thought provoking lyrics...The problem here is the lack of "real life playing". The genius of Todd is largely due to his ability to play a multitude of instruments (guitar,piano, bass, sax etc...) ."Liars" is filled with drum machines, tape sampling etc. As a result, the "classic" Todd feeling/emotion is replaced by a synthetic sound. With this said, there are still some "gems" on this effort , such as "Wondering", "Past", "Sweet" and "Stoodup". Although this is not Todd's best work, it is still FAR better than what is being put out on today's music scene.
