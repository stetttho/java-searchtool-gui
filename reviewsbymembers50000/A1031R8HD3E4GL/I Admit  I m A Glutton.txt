 First off, I am not a big fan of "live" CD's (fan noise, poor production quality, etc.) This is the EXCEPTION. Excellent production combined with great performances by the Beard make this an essential buy! Both NEW Beard fans an the loyal "old timers" will be pleased by the selections performed. The entire "Flash Before My Eyes" suite opens disc 1 in GRAND fashion, not straying too far from the Octane version. Alan , Ryo, Dave, Nick and tour drummer Jimmy Keegan are all in great form! Most of the Octane CD matterial is performed on GFP to please the NEW fans. For the old, the Beard play such jewels as "Harm's Way", "The Light" and "At The End Of The Day" and pull them off quite well despite Neal's absence. The highlight of this CD is definately Jimmy Keegan's BRILLIANT drum work on "NWC". His solo contains the perfect mix of taste, flash, and passion. Jimmy is the perfect compliment to the rest of the crew...Nick D stepping up front does a fine job as the lead vocalist. Please don't be a "glutton for punishment"- buy this CD. At the end of the day, you'll be "fine".....
