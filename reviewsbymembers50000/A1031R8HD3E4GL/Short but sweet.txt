 First things first, this CD is a TEASE-just 28 minutes long.... However, the short songs that are on the "green album" are pop gems!! This is the most melodicly infectious Weezer CD yet. True, this is not as "complex" as Pinkerton or "quirky" as their debut CD, the green album rocks! This is a fun CD in the vein of Squeeze meets the Beatles....Standout tracks- "Island in the Sun", "Simple Pages", "Glorious Day" and "Knock-Down Drag-Out".  This is a great "driving" CD.
