 Enchant's latest release, once again, shows traces of its influences (Rush,Kansas,Dream Theater) but leaves its own distinct stamp. Excellent vocals, strong songwriting and first rate musicianship are displayed throughout this effort. Standout tracks include- "Paint The Picture", "Rough Draft", Juggeling Knives", and "Broken Wave". This is a must for all Prog Rock fans.
