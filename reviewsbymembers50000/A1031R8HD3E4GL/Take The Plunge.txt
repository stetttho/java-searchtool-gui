 OK, This is not 1970's Deep Purple. No Ritchie Blackmore. No Jon Lord. It is 2005. Everything changes. Life, love and war.....Considering the reality of it all, this is a DAMN GOOD CD!. I can't think of too many bands that manage to produce quality music after four decades. Don Airy and Steve Morse are great musicians who perfectly compliment the PURPLE FOUNDATION (Gillan,Paice,Glover). Standout tracks include the Procol Harumish "Clearly Quite Absurd", "Wrong Man", Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye", "Rapture of The Deep". If you went ape over "Bananas", take the plunge for "Rapture of The Deep".
