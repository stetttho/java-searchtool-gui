 LLB's self named debut is a refreshing showcase of musical ablity, melody and emotion. The lyrics are a bit "campy", but that will develop with maturity. Henry Garza's latin fused guitarwork is searing and is wonderfully complemented by the rythym section of his brothers (JoJo and Ringo) on bass and drums. Throw in SRV keyboard whiz Reese Wynans and this band really shines. Three part harmony's, reminisent of the Everly Brothers, add a beautiful texture to melodies that remain in your head. This young family (ages 19-23) are just starting what looks to be a long, successful musical carreer. Buy this.
