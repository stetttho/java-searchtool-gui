 If you are depressed or uncertain about your "role" in life, this may not do much to uplift you. This cd contains intraspective, highly intelligent lyrics that are numbing at times. The songs are beautifully crafted and written. Mr. Wade is definately a promising young songwriter. The music is reminiscent of Matchbox Twenty, Creed , Pearl Jam and even a little Vertical Horizon. Lifehouse maintains its own identity, however, and produces a solid product. Standout tracks include "Hanging By a Moment", "Sick Cycle Carousel", "Trying" and "Quasimodo". No Name Face has  a lot of mellow moments, that need close listening. These are NOT  the Backstreet Boys......
