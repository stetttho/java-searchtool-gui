 Neal Morse and the "Beard" have returned with an ambitious two CD set, which is concept based. It is about a "gifted" albino's difficult journey through life, and the struggles he encounters along the way. This could have been a brilliant CD if it was "shortened" to one rather than two CD's.......By the time the listener gets through the end of CD one, you feel like the story (and music) has already been told. Snow contains the usual consistent melodic themes that Neal Morse is known for, and the quality mucianship of the Beard..It is just TOO DAMN long, and CD 2 suffers as a result, with what appears to be "filler"....Another issue I have is the limited playing (solos) of guitarist Alan Morse. SB fan's will definately enjoy this, but I wish it had "Snowed" a little less.
