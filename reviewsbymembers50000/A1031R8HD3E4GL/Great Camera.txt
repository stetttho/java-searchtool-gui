 I looked at MANY point and shoot digital cameras and had the following criteria: -pocket size -take AA batteries -optical zoom at least 3X (this camera 4X) -video capture with sound -solid build quality -feels good in hands The Canon A510 met ALL of my requirements. This camera takes GREAT pictures and is very easy to operate (AUTO setting). For the more advanced users, this camera also offers many manual controls....AA's go rather quickly. Buy rechargeable NIMH AA's. Highly recommended.
