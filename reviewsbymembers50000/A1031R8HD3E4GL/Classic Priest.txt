 There is good news and bad news with this CD. First the good news. "Sad Wings Of Destiny" is an essential part of the collection for classic rock purists! This disk contains gems such as "Victim of Changes", "Dreamer Deceiver", "Tyrant", "Ripper" etc. Rob Halford's vocals are at his best!! Great trading of guitar licks by K.K. Downing and Glen Tipton...Now the bad news. The recording quality of the best song on the disk-"Victim of Changes" is HORRIBLE. Way too bass heavey. Some songs sound OK, others sound like a poor cassette....I would recommend buying an import version of this CD, but NOT the Koch distributed disk.
