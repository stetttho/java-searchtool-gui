 Tidewater Grain comes at you straight ahead with "no frills"  rock n' roll. Obviously influenced by the masters (Van Halen, Aerosmith, Ramones) with a twist of Faith No More, they present an interesting sound. Lead singer Kevin McNamara sounds at times uncanilly like David Lee Roth. The rhythm section keeps the "thick sound" going! Standout tracks include "Rocket Ship", "Here On The outside" and "Annie Helicopter". These guys are in for some BIG things to come.
