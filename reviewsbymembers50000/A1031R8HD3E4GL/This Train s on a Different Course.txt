 Having been a long time Dream Theater fan, and Prog fan, I was initially very turned off by TOT. The melodies, strange time changes, intricate keyboard parts etc. , have been replaced with DARK brooding metal....With that said, TOT is not a bad CD, it is just NOT Dream Theater. John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy show off their talents at "lightening" speed. The problem here is that other Metal bands have been doing this for years (Metallica,Anthrax,Iron Maiden etc..) There are some standout tracks on TOT such as "As I Am", "Vacant"/"Stream of Consciousness" and "In The Name of GOD".Unfortunately, what lies in between is a lot of NOISE......I hope the next "train" that arrives contains the "old" DT......
