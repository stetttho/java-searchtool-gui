 What a farewell outing this is! This is their strongest outing yet. Great songs from start to finish, topped with an excellent production from guitarist Wally Farkas. Fans of vintage Cowboys and Kings X circa "Gretchen Goes To Nebraska" will love this! This CD is chock full of soaring harmonies, great chord structures and excellent lyrics (check out "Disney's Spinnin'"). Standout tracks include: "A Different Way", "Life and Times", "Disney's Spinnin'", "Another Hill" and "Swimming In December". All GC fans and fans of melodic metal MUST buy this.
