 The Sign consists of Terry Brock (lead vocals), Mark Mangold (ex "Touch", keyboards), Randy Jackson (ex "Zebra", guitar), Billy Greer (ex "Kansas, bass) and Bobby Rondinelli (ex Rainbow, drums). This CD offers some great melodic pop-rock with excellent musicians, great "hooks" and fantastic vocals! Fans of Journey, Kansas and late 70's rock will love this.
