 I really like this CD. I didn't expect this to be the next "Dark Side Of The Moon". It is what it is-good compositionas with excellent guitarwork....As someone once said, Gilmour can make a banjo sound like a stratavarious...His guitar sings on "Blue" and "On an Island"... There are some heavier, blusey moments on "Take a Breath"..."Where We Start" could come off Division Bell...Excellent guest appearances by Graham Nash,David Crosby and Richard Wright. This is definately a great disc to bring with you "on an island"!
