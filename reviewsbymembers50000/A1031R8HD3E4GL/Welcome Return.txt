 Kings X took a break from their melodic side with their past few efforts...They are back to "old form" with Ogre Tones. This is not to say that I would rank this with "Gretchen Goes To Nebraska" or "Faith , Hope & Love" , but it is an excellent CD. Ty Tabor's beatlesque vocals once again comliment Doug Pinnick's funk/r&b rhythms...Standout tracks include "If", "Mudd","Sooner or Later" and "Alone"....I recommend fans of early Kings X to buy this one!
