 I'll start by saying I own the complete DT catalog. Big fan for years....Octavarium is not a bad CD, I just have to agree with many of the reviews here-it covers little NEW ground. The songs contain the excellent DT mucianship, however you are hardpressed to remember any one song , even after SEVERAL listens. The last song (epic)-Octavarium is IMHO the best DT track on this CD, but plods along for several minutes before it becomes a decent piece. LeBrie and Rudess are the main "features" on this one, and Myung, Portnoy and Petrucci are background "fixtures"....This effort appears to be DT's swansong, and if so, does not leave the listener with satisfaction.
