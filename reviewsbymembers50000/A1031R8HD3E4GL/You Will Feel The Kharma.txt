 The best AOR release to come out in a long time. This Swedish group have crafted some of the most melodic rock tunes to surface since Boston (in the mid 70's). Singer Edman Goran (Ex Yngwie Malmsteen, Streetalk) is in his best form ever, delivering strong vocals and soaring harmonies. Any fan of Journey, Boston, Queen, Styx and latter day Deep Purple will LOVE this. Excellent keyboard and lead guitar fills throughout! Standout tracks include "Wonderland", "Knowing You", "In Chains", "Ray of Sunshine", and "Spell On You". There is not a weak track on this.
