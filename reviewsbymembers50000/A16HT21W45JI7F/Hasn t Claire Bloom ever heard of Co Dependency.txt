 This book left me with a distressingly bad taste in my heart!  While the account of her early years makes for decent reading, Ms.Bloom's glaring lack of learning and GROWTH from her failed relationships with men is  disturbing, even angering to read. Despite a brief sentence or two of some  insight on how abandonment by her father led to her disasterous choices, a  few pages later she crushes any "hoorah-FINALLY" the reader might  feel when she again meets with the clearly disturbed misogynist Roth after  their terrible divorce, and allows him to abuse her yet again. One has to  wonder if Bloom even read over her own manuscript-she is either very brave,  or very obtuse!
