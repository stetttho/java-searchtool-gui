 I read this wonderful novel quite a few years ago and it has remained in my mind as the best novel I have ever read.  I read it slowly, the way one would approach a gourmet meal, savoring each turn of phrase in my mind much as one would hold the taste of finely prepared food on the palate-letting it linger to better let it absorb, as opposed to the way I usually read novels, gobbling them up quickly rather like fast food. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who appreciates fine writing, a good story, and depth of feeling.
