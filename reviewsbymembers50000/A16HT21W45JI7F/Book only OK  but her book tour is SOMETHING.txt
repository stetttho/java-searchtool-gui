 This is the first book by Debbie Macomber I have read.  In fact,until a month ago I had never heard of her.  Now I find she has a website and seems to be quite involved with her many fans.  In fact, for her book tour to promote this book she is doing signings at yarn shops and inviting her fans to knit a square while there to be joined together and assembled into blankets and donated to charities.  I was more impressed with THAT than the actual book! Not to say this isn't a decent story.  It was a fun, fast read.  I have been reading every book of knitting stories I can lay my hands on, and when I came across a novel on the topic, I thought I'd give it a try.  Since I live in the Pacific Northwest and am familiar with Seattle, it was easy to visualize a lot of the background presented in the story.  However, I thought the writing a little shallow and I kept wishing for a bit more depth of the characters as I read. I wanted more about the knitting and the goings on at the yarn shop than the outside lives of the three women who came to learn to knit.  Some threads got dropped like lost stitches off knitting needles! I do see there is room for a sequel to this book, as the yarn shop owner could become involved with a new group of knitting students and that could become an even better read than this one was. Now, having said all that, I still intend to go to the book signing event in mid-May to do my little part in completing a part of one of the blankets.  I absolutely LOVE the idea of this type of book tour.  I hope it sparks more authors to come up with fresh ideas to not only promote their books, meet their fans, create a little more community, AND do something good for local organizations.
