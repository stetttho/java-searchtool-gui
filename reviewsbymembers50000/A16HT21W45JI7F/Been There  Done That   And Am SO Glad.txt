 In 1973 I, as a re-entry woman, went to the community college portrayed in this book.  I took a class with Dorothy Bryant, and thus, I read this book.  It was almost me in those days, so of course I could relate to so much of it.  I sat in the same rooms, watched the same students, walked the same campus.  It is now decades later, and I am still thankful for that experience, this book, and especially for the talents, wisdom and kindness of its' author, Dorothy Bryant.  I am so glad to see it still in print.  READ IT!
