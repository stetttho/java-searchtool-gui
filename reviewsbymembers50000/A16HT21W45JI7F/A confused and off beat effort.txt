 I wanted SO much to like this book.  To the degree that I went out and bought a new hardback copy, which I hardly ever do.  So I made myself plunge onward, willing myself to read, then finish this confused work.  I ended up so disapointed and am wondering if I can get away with returning this book to get my money back!  For starters, I anticipated some sort of connection between Jane Austen's works  and the lives, or minds, of the book club members.  What I got was an odd writing style (Ok, fine), and a disjointed plot that never grabbed me, and certainly never held me, and almost nothing connecting their lives to Jane Austen or her characters, ether to compare or contrast.  Secondly, even at the meetings the book club members did not bring much of Jane Austen to the table.  There was little to no discussion of the book in question.  No real insight to each readers view of the writing style, the setting, the characters, et al.  I was left wondering why this group of people even wanted to form a Jane Austen book club!  I can say I finished this book, but I certainly can not say I didn't waste my time.  With every page I hoped I would be glad I kept at it.  But I closed the last page just as uninformed as I was when I began the first page.  For me, a good book about a group of people who form to read Jane Austen's works is still waiting to be written.
