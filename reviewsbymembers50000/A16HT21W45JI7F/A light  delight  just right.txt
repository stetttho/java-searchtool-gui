 This is a delightful book!  OK, it's not the best writing ever written, and it is not a fullblown cookbook (I cannot imagine why anyone would expect it to be, frankly), but it is a delight nonetheless.  I really enjoyed the detailed description of the town, the shops, the people who ran the shops and the ways of the French people Loomis came in contact with in her effort to become part of her chosen community.  I especially loved how Loomis described taking a centuries old convent and turning it, room by room, into a wonderful home. She and her husband certainly had to have a vision of what such a run down relic could be in order to even think of buying the place.  I was duly impressed!!  And-has anyone ever even dreamed of such pampered care and FOOD while in hospital to give birth!  (OK, there was a negative side too, but I loved this aspect of childbirth in France). I admit I found myself in a fantasy of living in that village, smelling the freshly baked breads, standing in line waiting for my turn to pay at Chez Clet, and before I was halfway through the book, I took to drinking my cafe' latte' from a bowl so I could dip my faux baguette into it!  Oh yes, I was THERE! That is the mark of a good read to me-to be transported to a new place and be so thouroughly a part of it that when the last page is turned I am somewhat startled to find myself in my "new" (built in 1966) house in Portland after all! I hope Ms. Loomis writes a sequel to this fun adventure of a book.  I will be on the lookout for it with anticipation.
