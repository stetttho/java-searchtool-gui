 I, for one, enjoyed these three tapes and plan to keep mine to watch again, along with all my other Jane Austen movies and DVD's about her life.  I am not sure what others expected, but I was not dissapointed in the least.  These were made in England, so naturally the narrator has an English accent.  DUH!!  Yes, they did show some of the same views over again, but I have seen this same technique used on many, many documentaries.  It is true they show Bath, and other places Jane lived or visited, as they are today, with people walking about and modern cars on the streets.  But as I said before, many documentaries use this technique and I was not put off by it. Because there was no film in Jane Austen's time to draw on, no photographs, and few paintings of these areas, I don't see how they could have done otherwise. Most of the buildings are still there-The Royal Cresent for example-the flavor of the towns and areas as they were in Austen's time shine thru despite modern traffic or clothing on the people.  Indeed, little has changed in Lyme Regis since Jane wrote of Anne Elliot's walking the Cobb with Capt. Wentworth and the others.    I found the film quality high, the color just lovely, and the narrative very imformative.  I would like to have seen more views of The Cobb itself,and the "granny's teeth", but overall I really enjoyed these three tapes, learned a lot more to add to my knowledge of all things Jane and to top it all off, I only paid $5- for my tapes!  A real treat all around!
