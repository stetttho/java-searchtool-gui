 There is no doubt there are beautiful photos in this book, and beautiful patterns, but.....the title says for knit AND crochet and by my count there are TWO crochet patterns in the entire book.  For a knitter this is great, but for us crocheters, we are shortchanged once again.  It is my constant gripe that almost all books that include the terms "knit and crochet" are knit with a token crochet pattern or two thrown in.  With the resurgence of crochet right along with knit, I certainly hope the editors of these lovely books will remedy this.  Other than that, I have no complaints.  The yarns are yummy, the designs hip and the layout of the book is very nice.  But, PLEEZE, balance out the crochet part when it is included in the title!
