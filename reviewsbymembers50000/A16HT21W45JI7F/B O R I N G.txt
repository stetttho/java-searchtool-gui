 I love good fiction, and I especially love good fiction about older women carving out a good life for themselves.  Unfortunately, this book is neither!  Admittedly, this is the first Margaret Drabble book I have ever read, but, if this one is any indication of her writing, I will not be back for more! I found this book incredibly dry, boring, and s-l-o-w!!  I forced myself to finish it (after all, I paid full price and for a hardback, something I rarely do now with such good resources for good used copies) hoping with every page that it would improve.  It never did.  When I diligently labored through it and finally turned that last page I felt as if I had been released from a very stale ordeal.  Quite different than when I so dread that upcoming last page and want more. Unless you are a really devoted Drabble fan, I'd skip this one!
