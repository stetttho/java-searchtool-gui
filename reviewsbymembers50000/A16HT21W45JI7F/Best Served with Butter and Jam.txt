 For a first effort, this is not a bad read at all.  Certainly, reading so much about baking bread made me want to: A) learn to bake really good French bread, or B) put the book down to go find some really good bread at once! However great the temptation for fresh, warm bread slathered with real butter and jam, I opted for C) finish the book, then order a book on bread baking. Aside from the whole bread aspect, and the great recipes tossed in here and there, the story line is not bad either:  Young woman gets dumped by doofus yuppie husband, holds on too long to false hope, but moves ever forward toward creating a new life utilizing old skills and talents and learning new ones such as living alone in a new city, dealing with an old friend who is even worse about men, and, that universal theme for women everywhere-dealing with mother. Overall, a fun read.  Nothing earth shattering, not the best writing ever, but nice to while away a summer evening!
