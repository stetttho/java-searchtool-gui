 I purchased this 20 volume set over a period of time, finally completing it a couple of years ago.  While the styles are dated, the how-to information is not.  It has really great step-by-step instructions, with great color photos, to help you learn to knit, crochet, sew and embroider, etc.,  As a crocheter, I refer to these volumes more often than I thought I would!  The stitches and techniques demonstrated do not go out of style, even tho the featured garments might have.  And, even having said that, some of the knit and crochet items are timeless styles as well.  I reccomend these volumes for anyone wishing to expand their needlework library, and for anyone wanting a nice way to learn to knit or crochet or even sew.
