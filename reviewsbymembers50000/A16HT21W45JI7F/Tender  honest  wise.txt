 As I was about halfway thru this book I learned that Ms. Lydon had died (July 15, 2005), which made reading the remainder of the book-mostly about her returning cancer-all the more poignant.  I had eagerly awaited this book after enjoying her book,The Knitting Sutra, a couple of years ago, and for the most part I was not dissapointed.  I was not as enamoured with the chapters about her unhealthy relationship with Billy, but that is probably because as a recovering co-dependent myself, they hit a nerve.  But I savored so much of everything else in this little jewel of a book, and I will certainly miss Ms. Lydon's voice.    It is not a perfect book, but it is a very good one. Her style is gentle, honest, insightful, and wise.  I made a lot of notes in my journal as I read this.  I am not a knitter, but the message is universal to me as a crochet person, as it would be to any type of crafter.  Writing about the connection of the outer effort to the inner self, craft as meditation, a centering tool, the journey not the destination-the core themes of this book-Ms. Lydon drew me in completely. I read it as a gift.  And, of course I could relate to the lure of yet more yarn, another project, unfinished ones still crammed in closets, or piled up on the chair a friend is trying to find a way it sit on!  This book does not teach us to knit, it shows us how knitting (crochet, quilting, scrapbooking, etc.,)connects us to parts of ourselves we may have lost, to parts we need to understand and heal, and to parts we need to nurture while we are in the middle of the harsh stuff life can slam in our faces (cancer, the loss of a parent, etc.)    This is a book I will keep and read again.  I am proud to own it, and it will sit on my shelf as one of my "paper teachers"-the books that taught me something and fed my soul as well as my mind.  Rest in deserved peace, Ms. Lydon.  You are already missed!
