 The blurb about this movie made it seem like something I wanted to see, even buy.  I rented it yesterday.  Thank goodness I did not buy it!  It is bizarre' to say the least, and lousy, to say the truth!  My husband is a former film maker and even he found nothing good to say about the technique, script, lighting, acting, et al.  The whole thing has almost nothing to do with Jane Austen-a lost piece of her work sold at auction to the leader of misguided would-be actors in New York under his spell.  He passes himself off as some sort of avant-garde coach, when he is actually creating some kind of cult in which he alone reaps any benefits.  He takes everyone's money, practically holds them prisioner, and puts on ridiculous scenes in the name of creating genius.  Only Anne Baxter added anything positive to this film as an actress who wants to put on a real production of the Jane Austen works, but even she can not pull this stinker out of the loo.  Save your money and your time.
