 Eagerly awaiting for this CD to hit the stores once I heard it was coming, I ran out and bought it the very first day it became available.  Gee, I shoulda waited for some reviews!  I have loved Linda and Emmylou forever,  and tho I think Emmylou's voice is not quite as good as it once was, the  SOUND of them on CD is not the problem, it's the choice of material.  To my  ear there is almost nothing on this compilation that really, really stands  out.  I like "1917" the best, and "This Is To Mother  You" next.  After that it just about all runs together for me.  I  don't choose music, it actually chooses me-when I get goosebumps listening  to a song, or when the combination of lyrics, voice and melody make my  heart sing, or my heart hurt (broken hearted melodies, etc.) I KNOW I have  spent my money well and will also spend my listening time well.  Sadly,  that is not the case with this endeaver.  Please try again Linda and  Emmylou.
