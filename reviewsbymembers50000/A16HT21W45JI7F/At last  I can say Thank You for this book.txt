 As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse by my father, I spent years in therapy dealing with ALL the other issues of growing up feeling defective, but I could not really discuss or deal with the abuse stuff.  ... Then one day, many years ago, I came across this book-The Courage to Heal.  I had finally found the tool to help me out of my personal hell.  What made this book different?  The FEELINGS, not the stories. How the women/girls managed to go on living.  The creative methods that became tools for survival.  The gently way it prodded me to become empowered in my quest to be a person instead of a victim.  I could read that kind of stuff.  AND I could take a tiny baby step toward healing. Because of this book I was able to finally begin my recovery.  It was not fast, and it was not easy, but it was a path, a start, a way out of hell. I have given copies of it away to others.  I have reccomended it to every woman who has ever confided to me that she was sexually abused. I am so grateful for the wonderful women who wrote this book, and now I am so very glad to be able to say THANK YOU!
