 Because this book is utter tripe. The lack of any substantiated facts, and atrocious grammar and writing made me glad I borrowed instead of buying it. It is seriously that bad. A co-worker recently informed me that the author used to be friends with George Lutz and completely believed in the Lutzes' version of the haunting; and only after a falling out with him did the author get on this hokey Defeo bandwagon. Futhermore, I read the reviews on here right after this book was published, and there were FAR more negative reviews than there are now. So, perhaps the real ghost/murder story here is how the author made them vanish/die???
