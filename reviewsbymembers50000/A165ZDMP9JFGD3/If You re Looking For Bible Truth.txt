 and/or intellectual stimulation, DO NOT buy this book. It's basically the same tired, old anti-Catholic propaganda, EXCEPT, this one is actually written by an ex-Catholic who never even bothered to learn his own faith (if you can imagine that). If you are sincerely seeking God's truth, and desire works written by someone with honesty and integrity, then please read "Born Fundamentalist, Born Again Catholic", by David B. Currie.
