 I just received this in the mail and had to put in a drawer so it wouldn't stink the whole room up! I guess I was expecting a cross between delicate and earthy, but the only way to describe this is loud! It is VERY "perfumy". Just read the ingredients and it does list essence of heather, however, fragrance (parfum) is listed first. It has a heavy unnatural scent, and to me, very unpleasant.
