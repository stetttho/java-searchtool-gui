 I just hope everyone reads this eye-opening book. Thank God, Ms. Bird, that you finally came to know the truth about your brother. And please, do not dare let the negative reviews get to you. The truth is never, ever wrong. I could only imagine the gratitude that Sharon Rocha feels towards you for your courageously coming forward and speaking out for Laci and Conner. Especially considering that Scott will probably never confess to this horrific crime that he committed. Always think of the peace you will have, by knowing that down the road there won't be any regrets that you never spoke out in truth for Laci and her unborn child. I pray that all the other doubting eyes will be opened to truth, as well, so healing can begin.   "But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God." -John 3:21
