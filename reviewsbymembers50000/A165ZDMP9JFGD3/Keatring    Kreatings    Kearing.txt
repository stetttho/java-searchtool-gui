 Hope the reviewer, "Giovanni", can read better than he can spell... not once, not twice but three times he misspelled Karl Keating's name.   I've been reading the Protestant's arguments to see if they've come up with anything new, because they just keep getting knocked down to the mat by the Catholic apologists. And it never fails to amaze me how much ignorance they can spew. After reading the review I commented on though, I'm starting to wonder if they're even literate. There just has to be some excuse for ignorance this widespread.
