 I came here to rant about this hand creme and see someone else has beat me to it. This is the first Philosophy product that has let me down and let me down in a big way. The creme is light and feels good, but it doesn't look or feel like it goes on or absorbs well at all. After it's applied it glistens, and I'm constantly noticing areas that lack that effect and looks dry, so I find myself constantly reapplying it. And now after a week and a half of daily use it's half gone. I didn't have this problem with L'Occitane so I guess I'll go back to that unless I find something better.
