 High Beam is a nice subtle highlighter. However, be sure to blend it very quickly and well or it will look unnatural in certain lighting (it'll look like you have pink nail polish on your face). It also has a tendency to emphasize pores. So only use it on areas of your face where you don't have any, like on the top of the cheek bone and under your eyebrows.
