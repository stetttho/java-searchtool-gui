 Perhaps I put too much hope in this product having read the other review, but I did not get the same results at all. To me there was just nothing exceptional about this lip balm. It did relieve the dryness and help some, but there are other balms with shea butter that cost less and have the same effect. My biggest problem with it, however, was that it didn't last long at all! I had to constantly reapply it throughout the day. The tinted color is natural looking yet alot more minimal than I expected with virtually no added "beautifying" effect.   Maybe my dryness is just more severe than the previous reviewers', but I won't be repurchasing. I plan to try Murad Soothing Lip Therapy next and see if I get better results.
