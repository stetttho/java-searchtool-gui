 I cannot rave enough about Philosophy Hope in a Jar for dry, sensitive skin. I have only been using it a little over a month and the improvement of my skin is amazing. I have sensitive, combination skin, but in the winter months (and since hitting 40) my dry patches have been getting dryer, so I decided to try the dry and sensitive formula and I am so glad I did. It not only got rid of all the dryness but has made my complexion so clear and smooth. AND, best of all, I decided to discontinue using my Lancome Renergie eye creme and try this instead and the difference is miraculous! It has not only drastically diminished the wrinkles under my eyes but the puffiness as well.   I do want to add that the very first time I used this I did experience some slight burning and redness, but my skin must have adjusted to it because I didn't have any problems with it after that.  This one is a keeper. Try it and use it morning and night and see for yourself.
