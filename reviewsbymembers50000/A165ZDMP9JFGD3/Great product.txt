 I just recently tried this and I liked the results. It left my hair very smooth and silky. It did weigh my hair down some but the exceptional finish made up for it. I plan to try the shampoo when I repurchase and see if that helps with the weighing-down issue.   For the record, I do NOT recommend B&B's Tonic shampoo! The clarifying effects were O.K. but not nearly as good as Neutrogena. Plus the smell is so medicinal it's nauseating.
