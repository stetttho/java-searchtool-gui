 I bought this printer very recently. I have not tested this printer to its full extent yet. Also, I have not read the instruction manual yet. 1) B&W prints came out fine. Color prints are great on plain paper as well as on the photo paper sample that came with the printer. 2) Color output was very bad when I tried the printer immediately after taking out of the box. After a couple of cleaning cycles and alignments, the output came out extremely well. I think the photo print is comparable to the quality of my favorite photo shop. 3) Installation was extremely easy. 4) Application user interface (on Windows) could be dramatically improved. For example, during cleaning cycle, a message pops up saying "don't do anything until this process completes", but they will never tell you when the process is completed. When printing the photo, it was not clear how the 4x6 paper should be fed. (Be prepared to waste some paper.) 5) In quiet mode, the printing is extremely quiet, but the paper feeder mechanism is equally noisy in all modes. So, I don't see a big advantage with the feature. 6) Printing speed surprised me pleasantly. Overall, I am very happy with the product and look forward to donating my previous Apollo printer.
