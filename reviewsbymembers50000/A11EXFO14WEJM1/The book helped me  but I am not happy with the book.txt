 I am an ABAPer, working on a BW project, and have access to BW system to carryout some self-study. I needed some reference to guide me through various aspects of BW technical tasks. Having read some reviews and browsing many of the BW books in the market, I felt that this book is the one I need. I didn't want the theory behind data warehousing. I needed to know what each of those BW objects are, how they are related, and how to create them. I am somewhat satisfied with the book as far as what I wanted to learn right now. However, I think much more could have been done. Surprisingly, I don't see any other book on BW that shows 'how to.' The CD that comes with the book is a joke. Completely worthless to me. If you have gone through BW training, this book may not be of much use to you. If you can find some other book that deals with fundamental technical aspects of BW, you might want to consider that. If you have nothing to refer to, you will be OK in purchasing this book.
