 I bought this at outpost.com a couple of months ago. It is very convenient and works as expected. If your USB ports are very close to each other, this will make adjacent USB ports unusable due to its size. However, it comes with a cable. If you use the cable, there is no issue with the space.  My router is D-Link and I have enabled WEP. This works fine with my current setup.  Sometimes when I restore my computer from standby or hybernate mode, the network is not recognized right away. Given enough time (few seconds to a minute), I suspect that it will work. I get restless and force the connection (via a few easy mouse clicks). I have absolutely no problem with that - but the expectations of my family members are higher than mine.  The distance between the router and this device is considerable in my setup (router stays upstairs in a room). It used to drop connections very often when used with one of my computers. I moved it to another computer now and it works very well. Both these computers are downstairs.  Over the time, I have come to like this product very much and it work well.
