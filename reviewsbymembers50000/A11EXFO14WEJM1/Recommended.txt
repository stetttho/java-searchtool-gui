 Firstly, before ordering online, please visit your local retailer and have a look/feel of the scope.  I bought this to replace a 60mm telescope which is very inconvenient to use and has given me more frustration than pleasure. Please, don't even consider buying smaller telescopes.  It took me about 2 hours to assemble the whole thing and I was being "helped" by children 3 year and 6 year old.  The base is made of wood. Weight-wise, it easy to carry, but shape-wise, it is hard and awkward. I have been carrying it without dismantling the tube/barrel.  In the beginning I was worried due to the lack of mechanism for fine adjustments. After I started using it, all my worries have disappeared - the movement is that smooth.  The scope looks big. XT6 appears to be reasonable in size for home use. I haven't compared the two looking at the sky, but XT6 is only ~4 pounds lighter. XT8 permits 2" eyepieces, XT6 doesn't. XT8 doesn't come with any 2" eyepieces, though.  Let me emphasize that it is very important for you to call Orion, find local retailers, call them to make sure that they have one on floor, visit them, and feel the scope.
