 I bought this camera to replace our 7 year old VHS-C camcorder. It had most of the features that I was looking for: MiniDV, Optical zoom greater than 10x, batterly life greater than 1 hour, LCD geater than 2.5", built-in light, and memory card for digital pictures. I returned it for one main reason- video quality is equal to that of my current camcorder. It gets worse under certain circumstances. (Disabling DIS didn't improve the picture quality.) Every feature that was attractive to me turned out to be inadequate. Large LCD screen, but the image is not pleasing. Built-in video light barely lights closeby objects. No facility (shoe) to place external light or flash. Still images are another big disappointment. I realize that I shouldn't expect great still pictures from a camcorder, but I don't think they should come out this blurry, dull, and hazy. Memory card slot can accept various different media (SD, memory stick, etc.) - I think this is a very neat feature. I was amazed by Nite Pix feature. Yes, you can record video in absolute darkness, but the objects have to be within close proximity (6 feet or so). Fading option (between footages) is extremely disappointing. You have to keep the fade button pushed until the image fades out, then push the standby button, and then release the fade button. You have to do the same when you start recording again. Completely manual operation.  We own many Samsung products and I am very satisfied with each one of them. This product is not going to change my opinion on Samsung.
