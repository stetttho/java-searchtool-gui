 Please read my one star rating as zero. We bought Bissell-3750 18 months ago after using a bag-type Hoover for 7-8 years. What a big mistake! Bissell worked well for about a year and then it started to suck ... nothing. Cleaning the filters is a BIG pain (see other reviews griping about it) and each HEPA filter is $12!! The motor went on high pitch with some burnt smell. We noticed the belt had worn off in one place. I searched 6-7 stores before I finally found Type 8 belt and HEPA filter. We put the new belt on, and the belt burnt out instantly. We will definitely go back to Hoover now.  I wanted to make sure I wrote this review so others don't waste their $$$ on this piece of sucking machine. I am guessing the people who wrote rave reviews have used it for less than few months. By the way I still use my Hoover to clean my van and I'm glad I have that as backup while I go shopping for another vac cleaner...  Updated on 1/26/2006 After destroying 3 belts, we found out that the real problem was with the brush (red cylindrical component at the bottom). It had somehow stuck to its axle and wasn't rotating at all. We ordered a brand new brush (hescoinc.com) and spare belts. Vacuum is now working fine - with the exception of filters getting clogged very quickly. You see, there are many filters in this machine. Two of them are porous (sponge-like) and washable. We are really not looking for extra work to clean these filters often.
