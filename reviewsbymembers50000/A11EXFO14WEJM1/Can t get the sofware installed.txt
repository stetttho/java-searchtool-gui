 I recently bought this cable/software kit so I can synchronize my data with the Motorola A630 mobile phone. I have had extremely hard time to get the driver and other software installed on my computer. I have already spent many days trying to get some basic stuff working. In the end, the whole process is a very frustrating and disappointing experience.  Firstly, I could not install the driver software on my desktop computer. This is a 2004 model computer with surplus memory, hard disk space, and with a high-end graphics card. It runs XP Home edition. After spending a couple of days trying to get the drivers installed, I just gave up.  Next, I tried to install the same on my laptop computer. It is a 2001 model computer with XP Professional edition. After some struggling, I got the drivers installed. Few more hours, and I could manage the installation of Handset Manager software. I could successfully download the pictures I had taken using the camera in the phone. I could also download my contact information from the phone. However, I didn't see anything to synchronize my Outlook information with the phone. Feature could be there in some other software, but I haven't seen it yet. Then, I tried to install necessary software so I can upload some games. After a VERY LONG process, I couldn't perform one of the steps and I am now stuck. So, I still can't install any games to my phone.  Their online helpdesk is open only during business hours. I can't take a day off from work just get this software working. I am giving two stars despite my woes because their support is easy to reach (no 800 number, though). BTW, emailing their support is worthless. On a second thought, I am reducing the rating to 1 star.  I have been working with computers for about 20 years and I consider myself profecient with computers.  If you choose to buy hardware/software kit from Mobile Action, my best wishes for you.
