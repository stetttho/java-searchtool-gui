 This product just didn't work with my two computers. Wasted a bunch of DVD media trying to burn data DVDs. I didn't even try capturing part yet. Also, a wasted USB 2.0 upgrade. Software installation was extremely annoying. It insisted that I should have enough space on my C: drive (where my OS resides) without even giving me an opportunity to specify a different drive. After making enough room in C: drive, it gave me an option to choose a drive to install. Whatever happened to software quality control? The product is really an internal DVD drive enclosed in a shell. It doesn't feel robust. The coating on the casing is not uniform and generally gave me a bad feeling. I encountered a lot of errors during data DVD burning process, but none of them are self explanatory. I had to guess the reasons. Bottomline, I could not burn even a single DVD succesfully, using this product.
