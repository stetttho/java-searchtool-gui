 Our son received this book as a present for his birthday. He is too young to read it now, but we are sure he will enjoy it when he is old enough to read. It has 18 tales in 383 pages. Every odd-numbered page has a full-page  color picture. I have read one tale so far and I am impressed. The quality  of the book is very high. This is one of those books you read, preserve,  and pass it on to next generations rather than throw/donate it away.
