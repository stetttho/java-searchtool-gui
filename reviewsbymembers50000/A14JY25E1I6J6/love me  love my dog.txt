 Mrs. Gellis has created another wonderful tale based upon Greek mythology.  This time the female protagonist is Hekate (you may remember her from Shakespeare's Macbeth), traditionally a mysterious goddes from the East who was the patron of witches and worshiped at crossroad.  We enter an alternate world were people are "gifted" with magical abilities that allow them to appear like gods to the native humans.  Hekate was the daughter of one such person, Perses.  A great sorceror, Perses drained Hekate's mother of her magical powers and is slowly draining Hekate as well.  Once Hekate realizes her father plans to use a spell to make her a mindless drone to help him gain the throne of Biblos, she escapes with help from her mother.  In her escape she travels to the caves of the dead where she meets a young man, Kabeiros who is bespelled so that if he leaves the caves he will change into a black dog.  The two quickly become friends and Hekate vows to help set him free.  This vow along with her earlier vows to protect the boy, Dionysos, and to gain revenge against her father is the meaning behind the title Thrice Bound.  In her quest to fulfill her vows she and Kabeiros travels the length and breadth of the ancient near east and along the way her power grows.  When she finally arrives in Olympus even Zeus is in awe of her power.  Hekate introduces the power of spells and sets Olympus on a new era of greater magical abilities.  Meanwhile her love for Kabeiros grows but is frustrated by the obvious fact that he is stuck in the body of a dog.  Readers of the series will get reacquinted with old favorites as well as have some of the loose ends from earlier novels tied up. Overall this book fits nicely to cement the series together and lets us get to know this rather mysterious "goddess".
