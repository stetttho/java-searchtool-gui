 I've read all of Mrs. Riley's books.  (except for the one that is not published in English)  I generally find her novels interesting in that they manage to take snippets from history and make it real through the  characters.  The Serpent Garden has a light humour that endears the main  character to me.  It wasn't easy for a "paintrix" to make a  living for herself and Susanna Dallet does it with a tongue in cheek sense  of humour and practicality that makes her more real than fiction.  The  angel Hadriel adds his own delightful opionions on the heavenly heirarchy  that makes the reader giggle guiltily. Anyone with a slight interest in the  time period before Oueen Elizabeth the First should read this, and those  without an interest should develope one.
