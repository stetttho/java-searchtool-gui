 Guy Gavriel Kay's novel based upon a fictional Byzantium under the rule of  Justinian and Theadora is an emotional journey for a reader. He creates in  Crispin a tempermental mosaicst who is noble, clever, and irresistible.   His struggle with the lose of his family and the need to find a reason to  live drives much of the novel as he travels toward Sarantium.  Yet the  other characters are as fleshed out as he is.  They are people that are  humble but not common.  But most memorable of them is the one that was  present only for a short while; the female soul residing in a mechanical  bird who guides Crispin's way.  Also waiting for Crispin in Sarantium is  the Emperor and Emperess.  Valerius and Alixana shares a complex  relationship but their love is a tangible force that humanizes what  otherwise would have been harsh, scheming characters.  The writing takes a  reader to the half-world where magic and gods are more real and the  emotions are amplified. Overall I would recommend that you rush out to  get this book and its excellent sequel Lord of Emperors.
