 It was a great surprise to find this CD at the store the other day. If you like the "real country blues", not the slick, overproduced Chicago stuff, then this is for you. The Fat Possom folks, Kimbrough, R.L., etc. are great. Interesting to have Tom Waits, Tom Verlaine and Steve Earle on this too. They do a great job too. Verlaine is moody and mystical and just great on the two instramentals.I dont know if the movie will be worth anything, but the sound track is certainly worth the price. Buy this and you will not be dissapointed if you are a blues fan, or a fan of real music.You may even want to do a little work and find out more about the great Jr. Kimbrough, R. L.Burnside, Asier Payton, or any of the other non-mainstream blues greats featured here. Well worth the effort.
