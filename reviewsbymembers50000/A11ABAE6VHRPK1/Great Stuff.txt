 This lady has real talent. I saw her tonight in concert in a small 200 seat place in Chattanooga. Christine has an easy and gentle raport with the crowd and is almost instantly likable. Then she sings, and, you are completely won over.When she wants to be funny, she is without being corny. When she wants to be serious or touching, she is able to draw the listener into her private world of emotions.Christine is a good singer and a good guitar player and an excellent song writer.This is a very good cd, but if you ever have the chance, go see her live. You will think she is singing to you.
