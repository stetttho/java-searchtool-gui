 If you are a true fan of Rock and Rool, or good music you need to get this cd. It is the forerunner of punk. It is the beginning of alt rock. It is true blues and boogie done in an original way. It is a Beat Poet doing his stuff musically.Sadly, most people have heard only "Tourt Mask Replica" from the good Captain. While a great, great cd, "...Replica" is not easily accesible to most music fans. "Safe as Milk" is just that; safe as milk for the listener. Anyone can and will enjoy ths cd.Little Steven should just play this one straight through on his little Sunday Night show.All the musicians and songwriters might learn something. After you hear this one and learn to love it, a whole new world will open to you. Your mind will expand. You will see and hear new things. All without the artificial effects of drugs.You will be on the way to being a complete person with the more Beefheart you hear. Next stop; Spotlight Kid/Clear Spot!
