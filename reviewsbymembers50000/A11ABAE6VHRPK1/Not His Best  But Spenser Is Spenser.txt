 While not Parker's best effort, "Hugger Mugger" is still very good. When I get a new Spenser book, it is like an old friend has come by for a visit. Friends that don't push you or expect much from you. They just show up and make you feel good and relaxed. You know what to expect from them and are not disapointed. Nothing new or inovative here, but a Spenser fan will not be let down. Spenser even quotes a little poetry again. But, he still isn't cooking again, yet. Maybe Parker is a little tired of Spenser and crew. And, maybe he does it so that he can have the funds to do other things more interesting to him. Whatever the reason, I'm glad that he still puts out a Spenser novel each year. Thanks Robert!
