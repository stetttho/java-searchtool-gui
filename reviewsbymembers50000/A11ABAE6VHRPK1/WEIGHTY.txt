 Once, when a teenager, a friend, 300lbs +, and I were wrestling. At one point he fell full weight on top of me. It was fun and exciting, but I was almost crushed and overcome by his mass. But, we wrestled again another day anyway becuase it was fun and the type of things teen boys do. This is what reading a Pat Conroy book is like. There is so much of it, you are almost overcome by its mass, yet you enjoy it. I am not always sure why everything is there, but I am always glad it is there. Growing up in South Carolina, it seems that we have the same background music of life. Yet, my family was good and loving and somewhat normal. But, as a human being we all experiance suffering, heartbreak, joy, love and death. Pat Conroy piles it all on us the readers and we cannot resist coming back for more. His prose are often like poetry. His stories within the story are akways done in a big way. Nothing is subtle, yet, somehow he most often remains very sensitive. Cry and laugh and enjoy. Pat Conroy's books are irresitable.
