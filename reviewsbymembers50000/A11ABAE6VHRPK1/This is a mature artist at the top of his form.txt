 This effort by Peter Green and the Splinter Group is excellent. Having listened to the Blues by the original artists for years, it is eveident that Green loves and knows well the material as well as what lies beyond  the surface of it. He is restrained and mature in his playing and his  vocals are deep and rich. Green realy makes this great music fresh and yet  true to tradition. Good support by the Splinter Group. A great album for  either Peter Green fans or for those unfamilar with him but great fans of  the blues. May God bless Peter with good healtha and keep him making good  music for years to come.
