 I first heard Canned Heat when they released their second album, "Boogie With the Canned Heat" and I was hooked for life. They were the best "white boys playing the blues and boogie" of all times. Alan Wilson was a great blues songwritter and guitar player. His singing was also very good. Larry Taylor was, and is the best bass player around. He never gets the recognition he deserves. He turns up everywhere, even on Tom Waites albums. Bob Hite was a great and underrated blues shouter and master of ceramonies. De La Para was as  solid as they come on drums, and still is. The real standout of the original lineup was Henry Vestine. A forgotten standout blues guitar player. Hendrix used to go see him play, and John Fayhe sings his praises to this day.Unfortunately these boys lived the blues and personal demons got the best of three of them. Wilson, Hite and Vestine have all departed this life, but they left behind some great blues and boogie for us.Canned Heat continues to this day, but to realy experiance them, you must hear the early band. This is a good sampler of that band. Due to drug and substance abuse problems, Harvey Mandell plays guitar in the band in place of Vestine on a number of songs. He is also a great, and forgotten, blues guitar player.Also, check out one of their early live albums for a feel of what they were all about. I hope that one day they receive their due. They have certainly paid their dues. In the words of Bob Hite, "Don't forget to boogie!"
