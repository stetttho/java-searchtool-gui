 In a good week, I read two books. So, over the past ten years, that makes...well you do the math. Out of all of them over the past 10 years, I have to rank "Flashman" among the top 10 if not the best outright. Fun, exciting, naughty and more. This was my first venture into the irreverent world of Flashman, but not the last. I am eager to read the entire series after this enjoyable initiation. During this literary rollercoaster ride, you might even learn a historical fact or two!
