 When you buy a new Pat Conroy book, regular readers know exactly what to expect. There are no surprises..except...Conroy can make the same stuff interesting and moving just like it was the first time you encountered him. His style is literate, fast moving and fun. Even if I start to think I could write the book for him because I am so familiar with the characters that he will parade before me, I still find a fascination with his work that makes it irrestable to read. When I start a Conroy book, I become obsesed with finishing it as few sittings as possible, and, then bemoan the fact that it has ended.This book is sad, funny, moving, informative and a plain good read. Conroy can make me laugh out loud or cry tears of great sadness and empathy.When it is all over, I feel like I went somewhere with freinds and returned, and am already missing their company.It is helpful to have read some of his other excellent books, but not necessary.You don't even have to be a basketball fan, player, or explayer to enjoy this book.
