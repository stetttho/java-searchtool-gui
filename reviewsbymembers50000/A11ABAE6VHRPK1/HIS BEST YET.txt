 Having read each of the Elvis Cole novels as they appeared, Ifeel that I can make a fair assesment of this entry. It is far aboveany of the other very well done works! Even though the love scenes area bit sappy, the story and character developement show a maturity inCrais that faithful readers witnessed developing over the past fewyears. At first Cole seemed no more than a pale Spencer clone. Now,Cole has claimed his own place in the private -eye genere. And, alofty place it is. Fun, fast moving plot, and characters you careabout are what you discover between these covers."L. A. Reqiuem" could possibly stand for Less AdroitRequiem, because it will be hard to settle for less after this.
