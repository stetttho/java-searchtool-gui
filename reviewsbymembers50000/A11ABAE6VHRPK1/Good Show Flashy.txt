 After reading the first book in this series, I was hesitent to read number two. Hesitent because I was afraid it would fall short of its excellent forerunner. But, it is just as good. Flashman is just as much of a  cowardly, weak-kneed, lilylivered, lying, braggart, womanizer as he was in the first book. Thankfuly, the good times and adventure roll! We even learn a little about German history. It is hard to imagine a series as well done as this. Braavo Flashy! A scoundrel for all seasons!
