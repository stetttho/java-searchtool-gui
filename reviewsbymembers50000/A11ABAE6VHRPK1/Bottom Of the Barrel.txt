 Here we have a story of bottom dwellers looking into the affairs of folks somehow even lower that they are. Not a pretty sight! But, what an enjoyable one. Crumly manages to potray men and women who find themselves in a world of chaos and filth, tainted with sex, booze, drugs and violence. Milo, Betty and friends are the closest to heros you will find lurking in these shadowy pages, but, you wont be able to resist them. I wonder if it is as much fun to write this stuff as it is to read it. If you are a die hard fan of hard boiled PIs, this is definitely your type of book.You will probably feel a lot better about your life after spending a little time with Milo and gang.
