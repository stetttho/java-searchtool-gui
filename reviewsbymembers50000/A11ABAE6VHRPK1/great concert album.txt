 Having grown up in the 60's and 70's I have seen and heard some of the great concert bands. Too much of what I hear today that is popular and called cutting edge is boring and bland. For a long time I resisted liking the DMB. But, after hearing this cd, I was won over. A good mix of jamming, rock and jazz. DMB is original and a cut way above most of the other stuff out there today. This cd is fun to listen to. The musicianship is great and Matthews voice is an instrament itself.I also liked "Remember Two Things" very much as well.Who knows, maybe next I'll go out and see these guys live myself. Couldn't hurt, might even have fun.
