 Yes, Eric Clapton is here, and he sounds great. But, (and this is a BIG BUT)the real treasure found here is the playing of Peter Green. Forgotten by most or not known by most here in the USA, Green was one of the greatest white blues guitar players ever. B. B. King once said the only white guitar player that made him sweat was Peter Green! Mayall brought many greats into the limelight and got their careers started. The greatest of these was Peter Green. If you like his supurb playing here, check out the early years of Fleetwood Mac (late 60's, early 70s). This album is great and should be a part of every blues/rock collectors collection.
