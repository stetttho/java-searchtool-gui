 This is a great album. Even without te bonus tracks, it stands up well to the test of time. The reviews previous to mine tell alot about this forgotten jewl. But, they fail to mention that guitarist Henry Vestine was one of the all-time best white blues guitar players. Jimmi Hendrix used to go see him play to learn something from his style.More of a boogie and blues style than blues purist Michael Bloomfield, but just as good. Young music fans and guitar players would do themselves well to become more than familiar with Vestine's fine work (Bloomfield is also a must).I have been listening to this album for over 30 years and I am still not tired of it.
