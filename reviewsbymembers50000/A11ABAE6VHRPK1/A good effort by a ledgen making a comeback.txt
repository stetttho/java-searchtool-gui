 I have loved Peter Green's work since I was a teen in the '60s. Living in South Carolina and Georgia, I missed all of his solo work in the early 70s and 80s. Hearing that he was back was very exciting. Green's voice has  great character and emotion in it. His guitar playing is good and it sounds  like he is really trying. The supporting band is solid and the choice of  songs is very good. On the live cuts, the only problem is that I wish  Green's vocals had been louder. But, I remember this same problem with live  recordings with Fleetwood Mac. This album is not Peter Green's best work,  but it is very good. If he stays healthy and recording, great things are to  come. Let's keep him in our prayers.
