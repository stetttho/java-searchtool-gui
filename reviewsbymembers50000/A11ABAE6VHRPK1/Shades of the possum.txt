 This is realy good stuff. For real blues fans ONLY> But, go and buy a Fat Possum sampler and hear the original artists play these songs. Kimbrough is fantastic. Belfour, Payton, and all of the Possum lineup are well worth the effort to find. You can see how important these previously forgotten bluesmen are when Buddy Guy takes such a big risk as covering their dark blue material. Hats off to Buddy for a fine album. Now, go out and search for the Poddum guys before its too late!
