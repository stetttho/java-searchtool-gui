 If for nothing else, buy this for the last couple of tracks which are Al "Blind Owl" Wilson's last recordings before his untimely death. Bob Hite and the others are also in fine form. Good, pure boogie and blues.  A  welcome relief from the slick, over produced schlock we hear dominating  the airwaves today.This cd is fun. Bob Hite, Henry Vestine, Alan Wilson, de  la Parra and Taylor, were/are talents that have received very little  rcognition. All were.are great in what they do/did. Hite was realy a joy to  listen to. He seemed to truly love what he was doing. But, so did the rest  of the boys. Too bad they couldn't have gotten their personal lives under  control and thus lived a little longer giving us the benefit of more of  their work. Get this one and have fun!
