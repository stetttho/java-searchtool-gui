 For many years I stayed away from Stephen King. One of my friends read him extensively and highly reccomended his work. But, I was never into the horror genre. Finally, I picked up a copy of "The Shining". I was hooked instantly! King can scare you, but he can also pull on your heartstrings and other emotions as well. What attracts me most is his developemnet of the characters. By the books end, you feel that in finishing the novel, new friends are leaving after a long visit. His insights into personalities of different people in different difficult situatioons is remakable. "Hearts In Atlantis" is exactly like this. While this is not the type of book you would expect from King, you are pleasantly surprise. Having grown up in the time frame of these stories, it was quite a sentimental journey for me. A long book which I read quickly. I hated to arrive at the end. Several short stories held together by a thread of characters common to all of them. Well written and capivating.
