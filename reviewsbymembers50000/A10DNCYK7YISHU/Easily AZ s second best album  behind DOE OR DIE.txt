 "[as] far as poetry, I'm Nas, Biggie, Jay, Mos Def / Rakim, Kool G. Rap, Kane, KRS / Pac, Common, and Kanye would say I'm blessed" (AZ - Still Alive)  AZ, perhaps, one of the most underrated lyricists to grace hip hop, returns back to the scene by dropping his new album entitled, A.W.O.L., on his new independent Quiet Money Records label.  AZ is probably best known for his now legendary guest appearance on Life's a Bitch from Nas's classic Illmatic album.  AZ has always released quality material, but he was never been able to really blow up in the music scene.  Was it industry politics?  Bad timing?  Whatever the case is, AZ has never allowed for his lack of notoriety to effect his ability in creating quality music.    With A.W.O.L., rather than following the watered-down movement that's plagued rap for the last few years, AZ stays consistent and refuses to change up his formula.  He still has that smooth flawless delivery that's been blessing listeners since the early to mid 90's.   He's still that wise street poet who somehow is able to construct verses in a nearly flawless manner.  Plus, to further compliment the lyrics, the production on this album is top notch including beats by DJ Premier, Buckwild, and others...  The only weak spot on this album may be Envious featuring Bounty Killer, but that's only due to a clash of styles.  Top tracks include:  The Come Up, Never Change, Still Alive, City Of Gods, and Magic Hour.    Guest appearances include Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Half-A-Mill (recently deceased), Begetz, Bounty Killer, and CL Smooth...
