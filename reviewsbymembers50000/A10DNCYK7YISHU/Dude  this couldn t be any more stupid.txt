 I'm a huge fan of comedies: "In The Army Now", "Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure", "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure", "Freaked", "National Lampoon Vacations", etc...  But in a movie of any genre I expect well crafted plot-lines and good acting.  I like humor that isn't incredibly obvious, the type of humor that's between the lines and you have to pick up by thinking for a second.  I found this movie to be a pathetic attempt at trying to look like a 'Bill And Ted Excellent Adventure' type of movie containing stupid humor like Scary Movie.  Except that the humor in this isn't really funny, it's immature like Nickelodeon 'All That / Kenan & Kel' style... But what saves this movie from being an embarrassment was how the other characters reacted with each other: the nerds, the jocks, the hot chicks, the German accent aliens.  And the plot was OK starting off, but eventually got worse as the movie went on...  It's funny that in a journey to just find the guy's car they get involved with an alien conflict to destroy or save the universe... This movie has more plot holes than swiss cheese being assaulted by a machine gun.  The 2 main characters act like Kenan & Kel and over half the time they're not funny in the slightest bit.  And I think this movie would be an embarrassment for any actor/actress to have on their resume... Overall this would only be worth watching for free and if you don't' mind wasting an hour and a half of your life.  Unless you really want to see this, go ahead.  I just didn't enjoy too much.
