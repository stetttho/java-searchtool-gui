 Eminem had to struggle in his life, I'll agree with that after viewing EMtv and other documentaries about him... and I like that he's expressing how he feels... However, this album, in my opinion, was overated terribly.  It is a decent album, but the hype surrounding it is trying to make this release seem like it was the best CD ever released in 50 years... ... The #1 reason to why I am not supporting eminem anymore is that he is out of ideas... he's out of ideas.... The good tracks on the cd were: "Stan" , "Whoever Knew" , "Real Slim Shady" (even though everyones sick of it) , "Marshall Mathers" , and "Kim" even though that is sadistic and morally no one should like that :-) but the rest of the cd is self centered topics or just any lyrics slopped together and made into a song... "I Am" , "B*tch Please part 2" , "Kill You" , and the rest of the cd... If eminem joined with Rawkus or another underground label...he wouldn't be as popular but he would be a better artist... ...  Eminem is one of the most talented MCs out today.  He can rap over practically any beat, speed it up or slow it down, whatever.  Listen to this album and you will realize he can lay down lyrics over anything and it will sound like they were meant to be together.  BUY THIS ALBUM, BUT DONT LET IT BABYSIT YOUR KIDS. nuff said. l realize he  can lay down lyrics over anything and it will sound like they were meant to  be together.
