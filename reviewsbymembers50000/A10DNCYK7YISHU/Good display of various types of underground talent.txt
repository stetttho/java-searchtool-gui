 I was unaware of this compilation's existence.  I was in my local Sam Goody store looking for something new to feed my car's speakers.  I came across the word UNDERGROUND and of course I picked up the CD and saw some names on the back that made me crack a smile: Guru, Esoteric, Talib Kweli, Inspectah Deck, Beatnuts, etc...  Then out of curiosity I peeked at the price for this 19 track CD ...  For [a small amount of money] ANY CD IS WORTH GETTING FOR THAT PRICE except for something in the likes of Puffy, Nelly, or Ja Rule...  Every song on here is butter except for a couple exceptions.  I'm not highly into thug underground hiphop so Infamous Mobb was a turn off and so was the track by 50 Cent....   Highlights:  OC - "King of New York" Inspectah Deck "Swordplay Remix) Cormega - "Get Out My Way" Guru & Masta Ace - "Conflict Remix" Non Phixion "Rock Stars" Beatnuts - Work That Pole Main Flow & Talib Kweli - Hiphop Worth Dying For 7L & Esoteric - Word Association... so overall... if you're already a fan of underground hiphop or if you want to satisfy your curiosity...   Pick up this CD!!!  even if its [more expensive].... I'm Out ... Mind Power!!!
