 One half of Blackstar, one of the best hiphop CDs ever released, has the follow up attempt...  Mos Def is 10000% pro-black, and he isn't hating on anyone, but does hate 'fake' musicians (rap, rock and roll) ... and he has his reasons.  They all lack ORIGINALLITY miserably... they don't deserve their status in the music industry and Mos Def isn't afraid to call out names... Mos Def is a true ARTIST who searches through his mind to write a song... "New World Water" he writes about water and eventually morphes into slaveships... "Love" he talks about how he was created and his love for music... "Ms Fat Booty" he disses the low-class women in society 'HOES'... "Hiphop" he tells about what has become of rap and how he hates it, similar scenario on "Rock And Roll"...  Not only is he a gifted lyricist but he is a talented vocalist also... "Umi Says", "Climb", even "Love"... Only problems I had on this CD is that Mos Def sounds greatest when he's with DJ Hitek, Talib Kweli's partner....but who cares lyrically this CD is a 5 star rating no doubt, so don't let it intimidate you.... Your supposed to like artists for their lyricism and ideas, not by how dope the beat is (Nelly, every Cash Money 'artist' (they don't deserve that termonology)... I'm Out ... Mind Power
