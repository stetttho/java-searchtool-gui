 The groups 3 previous releases, yes I will agree don't allow this LP to fit in their usual sound...but even though Tribe decided to leave their own separate universe and join Earth and rap about actual youth topics, it still deserves it's credit... this is also a more commercialized side of ATCQ, but they have the talent to make it sound good... Throw in some of Tip's hypnotical toned voice, some of Phife's new evolved battle rap ability, and Ali Shaheed's excellent music display and you have yet another great ATCQ album... highlights of this cd were ...  "Phony Rappers" , "Motivators" , "1nce Again" , "Mind Power" , "The Hop" , "Keeping It Moving" , "Word Play" , and "Stressed Out"... there aren't really any negative sides to the CD just except the part after Jam where Tip curses in every sentence...that's the only negative bitterness on the cd....other than that check it out if your a true hiphop head...
