 I'd actually consider this the third High & Mighty CD, just that there's a new member in the group, Cage.  Cage has gotta be one of the best lyricists I've ever heard in a while, white or black I don't care what color, I consider him dope as hell...   Anyway the theme set on this CD is pornography by sex crazed lyricists.  Usually with a theme like that I wouldn't even give a glance at the CD, but since it's not by an artist with empty perversion (Jay-Z, Nas, etc...), and that the album is off a record label that's previous products I've growth to love and cherish, I bought the CD and was satisfied... I'd actually give this CD somewhere between 4 and 5 stars.  It's not as good as 'Home Field Advantage' because of the lack of creativity in the lyrics and the less dope beats, but CAGE is definitely a pleasure to listen to.  He's one of the types of lyricists that'll make you rewind songs to hear his verse again.  Mr. Eon is also pretty good on this.  And Mighty Mi does a decent job too.  Beetlejuice ... well I just love that dude... Standout Tracks: "Talk Like Sex", "Botton Feeders", "That Smut", "54" I'm expecting more dope material off these guys, they're helping the unappreciated white rap community... I'm Out...
