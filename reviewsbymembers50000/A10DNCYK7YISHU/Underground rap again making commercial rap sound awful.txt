 This is an excellent compilation filled with lyrical masterminds, phenomenal production, and awesome DJs...  All over this CD Sway, King Tech & DJ Revolution are making a mockery out of commercialized hiphop and they do it in a very comical way (especially in the album cover and in the intro)... There's so much talent to see on this CD especially: Chino XL, Canibus, Eminem, Dirty Unit... Every single MC on this CD is repping hiphop to its fullest, there is NO filler material on this...  The production and scratching on this CD is excellent just the sudden plunge to the 'old school' era on the CD almost looked out of place and just replayed some previously made tracks over again, but they're all still dope... Do me a favor and buy this!  After hearing this CD I became heavily into CHINO XL and 'The King of Metaphors' is one of hiphop's best lyricists... I'm out...Mind Power!!!
