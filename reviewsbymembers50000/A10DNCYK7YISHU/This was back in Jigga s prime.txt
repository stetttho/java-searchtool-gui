 Back in 96 when I first heard "Dead Presidents" I had this programmed urge to go check out anything Jay-Z appeared on.  NOW... well that's a different story, at this time I have this urge to ignore anything that Mr. Carter appears on...anything after the humungously dissapointing overated Vol 2 CD, which shows the increasing commercialized, media dependant, money hungry route Jay's been traveling on lately... But this CD was back in Jay-Z's early days, back before he turned into a pimp/ho crazed topicless song writer... in this release he leaves his marks right away with "Ain't No Nigga" which is also on the 'Nutty Professor Soundtrack' , "Can't Knock The Hussle" an absolute banging track , "Dead Presidents Part II" which is just as good as the first part , "Feelin It" , "Brooklyn's Finest" with an unforgetable cameo from Notorious B.I.G. ... Those were all the songs I heard 'before' I went to check this cd out and I loved them all... some other good tracks "Politics As Usual" , "22 Twos" , "Coming Of Age" , "Bring It On" , and "Can I Live"... Even though I'm now into highly intelligent rap and bash thug wannabe, money crazed, sex crazed, drug addict rap 'artists' (excuse that term) this CD is an exception because Shawn Carter put in at least a decent effort on this release rather than just lettin his label market him.  and also Jay had to put in 100% because this was his debut album he and didn't have the fans yet to mindlessly purchase his material like he does now... Anything released 'after' "In My Lifetime Vol 1" you should avoid, with the exception of "It's Alright" and "Can I Get A..." If your on the quest for 'real' hiphop artists, check out: Common, The Roots, Talib Kweli, Mos Def, Canibus, Hieroglyphics... I'm Out...Mind Power!
