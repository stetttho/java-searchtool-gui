 This is one of ATCQ's more memorable tracks during what people called their 'downfall', but I don't think Tribe ever had a 'downfall' in their 10 year existence. The closest thing I'd label to their 'downfall' is when they broke up... (it disgusts me that excess commercialism in rap/hiphop destroyed some of hiphop's greatest members: Q-tip, Jay-Z, Nas, Eminem)... Anyway "Stressed Out" is one of my personal favorite ATCQ tracks, and one of my favorite musical tracks of all-time... The Baby Phife version was rather fast paced but they flow nicely over a smooth beat and it's very similar to the album version (Beats Rhymes and Life) just that the music's slightly different and Phife is in it which eliminates Consequence's 2nd verse... The Rafael Saadiq remix is very very very smooth with a funky bassline that'll have you groovin to the song as you hear it (lyrics exact same as Baby Phife Version)... Bjork's Married To The Mob mix, WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT SH**, I've given Bjork a lot of opportunities to attract me to her music but to me she absolutely ruins this Single from being memorable... Bjork's Dandelion remix is tolerable but in the middle of the song it gets very very sloppy and monotonous... Bjork's Say Dip remix is pretty much the same as the dandelion mix just that the beat is cleaned up ... I just do NOT understand Bjork's style, I feel that her appearance and influence ruined this single... What I would've done with this maxi-single is put the album version, baby phife version, raffael saadiq remix, and instrumentals on this... But buy this only if you consider it necessary to buy all of ATCQ's material, or if you just want to... It's still a good single, that would've been 5 stars but its only 4 because of the rather WACK Bjork mixes, and its some classic material from one of hiphop's all-time best groups... I'm Out... Mind Power!
