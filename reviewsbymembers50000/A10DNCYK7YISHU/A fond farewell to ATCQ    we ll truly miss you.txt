 After being blessed with a decade of Tribe projects, they decide to call it quits and part their separate ways...   Q-tip serves us with a disappointing release containing some dope material:  "Lets Ride", "Vivrant Thing", and the very best track "Do It See It Be It" which is a reflection of his entire career.  But he also has some just plain wack songs:  "All In", "Do It", "End Of Time"...   Phife Dawg serves us with a solo project 'Ventilation' where he's so fed up with the current place in hiphop he writes pretty much EVERY song about it.  That method actually hurt the CD because Phife sounds angry all over it.  But his project was better than Q-tip's, best tracks:  "Flawless" (has a diss to Tip), "Beats Rhymes And Phife", and "Melody Adonis".  Some sleeper songs:  "Lemme Find Out", "4 Horsemen", "The Club Hoppa"...  Ali Shaheed Mohammed started working with artists like Lucy Pearl by producing a bunch of her songs which still bring back the old ATCQ feel... Overall these guys sounded their best all together.  And a group so organic and refreshing like Tribe rightfully deserves a greatest hits CD.  Only thing that bugged me was 'These guys have so much dope material, Why isn't this a double CD?'...   Anthology contains some of Tribe's very best songs where every song except for "If The Papes Come" is already on their previous albums.  I'd recommend this CD as a starter CD to those who've never heard Tribe before but want to get into them.  For the die hard Tribe fans buy this if you feel its an absolute necessity to have all Tribe material, other than that if you have all their previous CDs buy this only if you want to support ATCQ.  Other than that you can save your cash... I'm Out... Mind Power!
