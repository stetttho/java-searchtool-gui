 It's a great loss to hiphop and to all of us to see that one of the most organic memorable groups called it quits... They went out with an average CD that was a more commercial approach by them (its funny how excess commercialism in rap/hiphop destroyed some of hiphop's greatest members: Q-tip, Nas, Jay-Z, Eminem)... Its even evident from Q-tip and Phife's lyrics and ideas in the album that they weren't exactly happy with the direction the group has been going: 'His Name Is Mutty Ranks' almost looked outta place and it seemed like Phife just wanted to finally be heard because this seemed like a Q-tip dominated CD. But anyway this CD is still worthy to be one of hiphop's more memorable albums... It represents ATCQ's love and dedication to hiphop itself and to everyone in general... This CD came out during what everyone labeled as ATCQ's 'downfall'. ATCQ never had a downfall during their entire 10-year existence in hiphop. The only thing I would label as their downfall is when they broke up and when Q-tip went commercial.... This CD is unfairly hated upon. Sure it's very different from their original style but in comparison with most of the other popular ... coming out at the time its decent... plus some tracks on here are very memorable: "Find A Way", "Steppin It Up", "Against The World", "Rock Rock Y'all" and the bonus tracks from their import version CDs of Midnight Marauders and Low End Theory... Just plain and to the point this is still a decent CD and I get disgusted when I hear other ATCQ fans label this CD as garbage... THIS IS A GOOD CD, but not the best ATCQ CD... but give it a shot, its from a group that tried to save hiphop but ended up dying along the way... I'm Out... Mind Power!!
