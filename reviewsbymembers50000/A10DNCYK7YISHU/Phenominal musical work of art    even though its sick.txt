 'Violent By Design' disgusted me with some of the lyrics, it was offensive, and it appeared to me as a verbal horror story... It has offensive lyrics to the catholic faith and a line insulting gays: ... (...)... This type of behavior is sick, BUT I LOVED EVERY SINGLE MINUTE OF IT...   Every aspect of this album has its own story to tell: the album pictures, the songs themselves, and even the skits... I believe the theme of the CD was visible in the intro "beware the beast man for he is the harvenger of death. He will kill his own brother to possess his brother's land. Shun him"... I believe the theme of the CD is showing you the beast in man, as Ikon, Jus Allah, Stoupe, and the many guests show... Production in this CD is phenomenal as I was listening to these tracks at night for the first time, I felt brought into the jungle where I was being attacked by people who murder for entertainment... Either the beats were scaring me or the lyrics were silencing me... I'm bein' serious if you pay a lot of attention to this CD, it'll scare you (literally)...  Some of the best beats: Death March, Heavenly Divine, The Dear Hunter, War Ensemble (track 22), Genghis Khan (felt very powerful and easy to hype you up for something)... Best lyrics: every song has them: if Ikon and Jus Allah were looking for shock value. THEY GOT IT!!! Every single track on this including the skits were excellent. They even use voice samples 2 of which I recognized. One was the Undertaker from WWF and the other was from the movie Antz... the only thing that felt incomplete was Ikon and Jus Allah's performance in 'The Dear Hunter' with Chief Kamachi, they had very very short verses in comparison with Chief Kamachi.... but that doesn't really hurt the CD at all. This group has a unique talent. I hope one day these guys finally get all the recognition they deserve... I'm Out...Mind Power!!
