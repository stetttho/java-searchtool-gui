 I actually heard of Nas for the first time from his 'It Was Written' album, and I loved that CD.  But, after exploring into 'Illmatic', his second album seemed rather monotonous and sub-par compared with his debut album...But it's unfair to compare an artist's earlier work with his later products, but this album is essential to listen to for the Nas fans who haven't explored into it yet... After 'It Was Written' dropped Nas adopted a thug-like personality dropping some street knowledge every now and then, but WHERE DID IT START?  On Illmatic... 'Illmatic' is a hiphop classic, with his storytelling quick delivery and production backed up by DJ Premiere, Pete Rock, Q-tip, Large Professor, and others.  Not only do you have an intelligent lyricist, but you have high credited beat makers.  Nas shines on each track and all them are memorable.  The ONLY downside to this CD is that it just ends too soon, you want to hear more... Buy this album whether you're a Nas fan or not! I'm out... Mind Power!
