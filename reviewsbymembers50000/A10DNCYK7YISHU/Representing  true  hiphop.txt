 Before I bought this CD I've only known about Black Eyed Peas from one of their previous tracks "Joints and Jams" I believe it was called... and it was a rather fun and goofy video just like an A Tribe Called Quest / De La Soul style and I enjoyed the track... and the next time I've heard of BEP was "Request Line" w/ Macy Gray but the rhymes turned me on to that track not the marge simpson style singing from Macy, but Macy has originality and works with good artists so I respect her. I'm just poking fun at her... Anyway, I enjoyed this CD from start to end... "BEP Empire" had a nice beat and good lyrics were ripped on the mic, "Weekends" was a nice fast jumpy fun track, "Hot" was well hot, "Bridgin The Gaps" a groovey laid back track, "Rap Song" was a good track about a comparison between a girl to how she's a rap song, "Request Line" is a fast paced song, and the bonus track "BEP Empire remix" was the absolute bomb without a doubt best track of the cd... !Another thing I appreciated on this cd is that instead of having a bunch of songs slopped together on an album BEP decides to have little guitar skits between songs which helped everything blend together on this cd... even though Black Eyed Peas are a good group that reps hiphop to the fullest there still were a couple tracks I wasn't crazy for: "Release" just didn't seem to mix that well with the rest of the cd, "Go Go" I hated the hook and it ruined the song, and "Tell Your Mama Come" i wasn't crazy for... Overall this LP isn't absolutely essencial to have, but give BEP a listen... they're another voice in hiphop trying to save rap (along with De La Soul, Phife Dawg, Common, Talib and Mos Def, etc...)
