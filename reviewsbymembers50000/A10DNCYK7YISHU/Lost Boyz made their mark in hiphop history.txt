 I consider LB as hiphop revolutionaries just like Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Common, etc...  They may not have had very complex lyrics but their simple lyrics carried a lot of knowledge.  They are AWAKE to the world especially with racism, depression, and violence... check out "Renee", "Channel Zero", "Lifestyles of the rich and famous" if you don't believe me.... Their lyrics are on point and the beats are real nice... some tracks almost have an ATCQ feel to them.  There's no guest appearances on here so you'll expect to hear Mr. Cheeks doing all the lyrics with Freaky Tah providing backround vocals.  But Tah gets his chance to shine on "1, 2, 3" and he's an OK lyricist not as good as Cheekz though... This is a very good debut CD for any group to come out with.  It's such a dissapointment that LB had to end their carreer due to the tragic loss of Freaky Tah... R.I.P...  and I heard now the Mr. Cheeks's latest solo attempt songs aren't up to his usual potential and it's sad to see one of hiphop's best groups vanish... Check out this CD... I'm Out .... Mind Power!
