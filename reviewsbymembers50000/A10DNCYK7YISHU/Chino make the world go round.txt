 Chino's back finally after what seemed to take forever for a sophomore release...  in 'I Told You So' Chino continues to bash people with his stomach twisting metaphors and he has better beats to rhyme over.  But sometimes it seems like Chino's a bit tentative to diss people, especially rappers in particular, and he almost makes himself look like a sex symbol in this CD, but that doesn't hurt the CD in the slightest.  Every Chino fan and there momma said that this CD isn't like his previous one and they are right, but Chino is still dope as hell and he serves us with new style.   Metro Records, You EFFED UP the tracklisting in this, here is the REAL listing:  1-Rude Awakening   2-What You Got  3-History 4-Nunca  5-A$$hole Intro?  6-A$$hole  7-That Would Be Me  8-Last Laugh  9-Let 'Em Live  10-Baby Momma  11-Sorry  12-Chino XL  13-Chinophone part 1  14-You Don't Want It  15-Chinophone part 2  16-I Told You So  17-Don't Say A Word  18-Chino Fans  19-It's My World  20-A$$ In An Instant  21-Chianardo DiCaprio  22-Skit  23-Bonus Track??  24-Be Here.... I Was VERY disappointed that "Water" wasn't on this CD, neither is "Beef"...but there's still a lot of good material on this CD to enjoy... personal favorite tracks:  "Sorry", "Chino XL", "I Told You So", "Nunca", "It's My World"... and everything else, but these i think had the best lyrics... I'm Out... Mind Power!!!
