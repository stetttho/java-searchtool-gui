 El-P has always had a unique talent in his lyrics and now in his production.  Even though with the loss of Mr. Len and Big Jus he still brings a style very similar to the Company Flow from 'Fun Crusher Plus' days... I knew what to expect from El-P so I got a first taste of Cannibal OX and I was blown away too.  Especially on the best track on the EP, "Iron Galaxy", which sounds futuristic with is music, but the lyrics really talk about harsh city and family life.  Again Cannibal OX drops more dope material with "Straight Off The D.I.C."... Aesop Rock hit me with a good track "Kill Em All" about slavery and dropping some nice lines in it 'I'd rather be the wisher/ instead of the penny inside the well'.  "Silver Fox" was a nice instrumental meant just to listen to not to rap over... Not a bad track on this CD.  Only problem I had with it was that I paid $13 for it when it was really worth an EP price of $8, but I'll get over it...  DOPE MATERIAL EXPECT MORE OFF DEF JUX LATER ON...
