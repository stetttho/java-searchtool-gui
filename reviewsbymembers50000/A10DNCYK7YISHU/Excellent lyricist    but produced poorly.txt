 Canibus is an excellent lyricist thats really impressive with his battle thyming ability, personally I belief he's better than Eminem...but this cd is not really that great... First off there are very noticable flaws on this cd...  #1 - any rap fan'll notice that Canibus is a battle lyricist that'll scare the crap outta you, but your not supposted to hear battle rhyming lyrics with a laid back groovy beat--"WYCLEF MISTAKE"--- so the mix between the words and music doesn't go together... #2 - having WYCLEF produce a cd is a flaw itself...  The tracks I liked on this cd were... "Patriots" , "Get Retarded" (crappy hook though) , "2nd Round KO" , "Hypenitis" (good lyrics--chorus sucks and is too frequent) , "I Honor U" , "Channel Zero" (has good lyrics but the beat and hook suck) , and "Buckingham Palace" are all excellent Canibus tracks.... Some tracks that really sucked miserably on this cd were "What's Goin' On" , "Niggamentary" , track 11 (forgot the name) , and Rip Rock (that track is one of the worst and most pathetic tracks i've ever heard...and that took me 25 seconds to realize when I started the track) B.C. 2000 is really good check that out...
