 I never really was heavily into De La, but I knew about them from Tribe Called Quest and the "Award Tour" chorus, but I've never really heard them rip the mic until "Gettin' Down At The Amphitheator" with Common and I was impressed cuz they outshined Com on that and they were highly enjoyable... but didn't hear from them again yet until this album came out and sinse Tribe broke up (real loss in hiphop, I'm still mourning it) I looked De La as Tribe's replacement so I got into them further... This release started off with a rather goofy intro, but it goes with the idea of the "Art Official Intelligence" as a computer...throughout the cd I was hit with clever rhymes...and finished up with Freddy Foxxx's diss to "fake-a$$ gangsta rappers", which kinda sounded out of place, cuz I pictured De La as a friendly / in their own universe group... Some great moments on the cd were the smooth as butter flow in "U Can Do Life" , the hell nice underground representation on "My Writes" , the dope sound of "Oohh" , the semi-diss to commercialed MCs on "Declaration" , the phat dance track "Art Of Getting Jumped" , and without a doubt ALL 3 GHOST WEED SKITS: Monch ripped it , Phife held it down on his own just fine , and Black Thought ripped it... However, and sadly this LP isn't perfect: on "I C Y'all" De La were very impresive but Busta ruined the track, Chaka Khan after a while began to nauisate me and eventually destroyed De La's excellent lyrical performance on "All Good?" , "Squat" was ruined with real weak Beastie Boys Rhymes...De La and Beastie have a good chemistry together but this track wasn't really as pleasing as I wanted , the unexpected monotonous sound from De La on "Foolin" which ended up as SKIP THIS TRACK material , and the previously mentioned track with Freddy Foxxx aka Bumpy Knuckles "You Don't Wanna BDS" In reality I'd give this CD around a 3.75 rating, but sinse I love TRUE hiphop from the heart... well u get it!! De La Soul keepin it real for over a decade and forever shining...
