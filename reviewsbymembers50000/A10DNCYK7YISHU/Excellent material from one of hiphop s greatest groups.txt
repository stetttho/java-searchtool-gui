 ATCQ is without a doubt one of hiphop's greatest groups.  Q-tip and Phife make a perfect pair on the mic and Ali Shaheed Mohammed always mixes some nice smooth as butter beats to rhyme over...  This is the group's 3rd CD and between the first 3 it's nearly impossible to decide which one is the best.  They all have a fresh sound and its refreshing to hear compared with the garbage that's contaminated the airwaves now... The 'tourguide' idea is a little corny after u hear it a million times, but I think it's a good idea especially for those trying to understand hiphop.  (for example: I learned what MC stood for after listening to this)  No songs on here promote any violence, all they do is support FUN on the mic.  That's what hiphop was and is always supposed to be... Best tracks: "Steve Biko", "Award Tour", "Electric Relaxation", "Oh My God", "The Chase Part II", "Lyrics To Go", "God Lives Through"... Actually every song is really dope on this, its hard to judge which are the dopest out of CD containing only good songs.  There's no SKIP MATERIAL on this entire CD and you can listen to it straight through repeatedly...  R.I.P. ATCQ maybe you guys will return to your roots, until then we can only hope... I'm Out... Mind Power!!!
