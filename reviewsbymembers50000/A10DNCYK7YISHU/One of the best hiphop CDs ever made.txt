 If your looking for relief from the 100% fake commercial rappers or are an underground head already and just want to hear some lesser known artists... this the the perfect treat for you. Rawkus really did a good job on this, its one of their landmark CDs along with both Soundbombing CDs.  Believe it or not but this is a double CD that's excellent on both discs! I can't decide which side is better!  De La Soul hosts the first disc, and Sir Menelik does the 2nd...highlights on both discs are: Cypher Complete's "Bring Hiphop Back" which is hauntingly exactly what we all need, Mos Def's smooth "Body Rock" , "Bathroom Cypher" lets us hear some no-name hungry mcs, the 10 minute track with Common - Black Thought - Pharoahe Monch - and newcomer Absolute freestyling , "Mayday" from Natural Elements , Talib Kweli's rules of hiphop on "Manifesto" , the dope a$$ flow from A.L. all over "Lyrics" , J5's fun wordplay on "Jayou", and Last Emperor's verse on "CIA"...    but don't think the rest of the tracks don't live up to the mentioned ones, their all excellent too... I'm just stating which one really really impressive... Another essencial album for your collection...skip over Vol 2 that was a very dissapointing sequel..
