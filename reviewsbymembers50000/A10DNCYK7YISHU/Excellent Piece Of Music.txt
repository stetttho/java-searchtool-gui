 I was lucky to have the liberty of hearing about Talib Kweli before the release of this recording... CHAOS and ON MISSION on the Soundbombing Vol. 2 CD... and I already was impressed with Talib's clever word play and knowledge.  The day the CD came out I bought it and again I was shocked by how excellent Talib and Hi-Tek sounded on this... even better. Basically every track on Train Of Thought flows into one another.  It starts off with an introduction kinda allowing u into the world of Reflection Eternal and their previous efforts...then gets u all rowdy with "Move Something" and "Some Kind Of Wonderful"...then to the relaxed "The Blast" to the BLACKSTAR reunited track "This Means You"...then drifts to the spiritual "Too Late" to "Memories Live" and "Africa Dream"...hypes u up again "Down For The Count" , "Name Of The Game" , "Ghetto Afterlife"...relaxes u again with "Love Language"... then hits u with his HIP-HOP representing tracks "Soul Rebels" and "Eternalists"...then to the dance track "Touch You" then to 2 spirtual tracks "Good Mourning" and "4 Women"... Overall....  there is not 1 bad track on this entire CD... Some other lyricists that deserve a listen are Common, Black Thought (The Roots), Guru (Gangstarr), Pharoahe Monch, Mos Def...
