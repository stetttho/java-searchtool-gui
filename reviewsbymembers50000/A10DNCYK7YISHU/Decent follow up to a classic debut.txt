 This was the first CD I've heard by Nas (I heard it around the time The Firm was in existence).  I thought this was a great CD with some nice beats and memorable lyrics.  Then later on I explored into Nas's debut album 'Illmatic' and my opinion on 'It Was Written' slowly changed... After hearing Nasty Nas rippin' the mic fascinating us with his street tales on 'Illmatic', where is he going to go from there?  He goes even more into street life and adopts a thug-like persona on 'It Was Written'.  That change doesn't really hurt the release too much, but the absence of Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q-tip, and Premier beats was noticed by me.  Well actually Primo did produce ONE track and it was one of the shiners.  Nas seemed to go from an ill street smart emcee to a street repping thug... Now I don't hate thug rap, but at the time there was so much violence in rap and Nas seemed to get sucked into it... But nasty Nas still had some nice shiners on this LP: "The Meaning", "Street Dreams", "I Gave You Power", "Affirmative Action", "Black Girl Lost", and the '96 classic "If I Ruled The World"... which all helped this CD be an essential release for the average Nas fan... It's nearly impossible to follow up a CLASSIC debut album, but 'It Was Written' is a good enough attempt.  Some production on it is very similar to 'Illmatic' and you have Nas experimenting with other beatmakers like Dr. Dre...  Overall this is a GOOD album some people are really backlashing it saying it's garbage because its not 'Illmatic part 2', but it is no where near garbage... just give it a quick listen... I'm Out...Mind Power!
