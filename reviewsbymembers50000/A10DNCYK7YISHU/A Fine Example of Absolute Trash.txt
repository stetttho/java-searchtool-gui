 Here's Jermaine Dupri's attempt to attract non-rap fans into contributing money to SO SO DEF records...he's doing a very good job at showcasing what he thinks is 'the best artist' of his record label is a 10 year old kid that doesn't even write his own lyrics... This is pop music at its worst.  Technically all pop music is pretty much watered down, so this would be an even crappier part of it... I won't totally hate on Lil Bow Wow, his lyrics are at least better than Ca$h Money's...but not better than the Burger King rap commercials... All you fake rap fans may hate on me all you like, but I'll refuse to not speak my mind...RAP LIKE THIS IS PATHETIC AND WILL EVENTUALLY SLOWLY DESTROY DECADES OF HARDWORKING HIPHOP... For those of you who are still on the quest for decent artists, here are a few: Common, Talib Kweli, Canibus, Pharoahe Monch, The Roots, Hieroglyphics, etc....  this little puppy is in the music industry without a clue and should just give up his rattle/microphone and go CRAWL back up inside the womb, where he left 2 weeks prior to this release.
