 Jurassic 5 truly represents what hiphop is supposed to be like: creative music making (not stealing samples) , and fun hearted non-hating lyrics... First off some beats mixed by Cut Chemist and DJ-NuMark are just plain to describe it absolutely amazing... on "Monkey Bars" they create a harmony with pots and pans banging in the backround, on "Swing Set" they create a 1930s style music, "Quality Control" they make a nice old school style beat...and the other beats are just as good... Even J5's lyrics are pretty good...they have an odd sounding yet good harmony, their flow is absolutely perfect from one lyricist to the other.  Clearly Chali-2NA and Akil are the best wordsmiths but Zaakir and Marc7 follow closely behind.  They all have creative topics that they rap about such as: "Lausd" where they rap about people on the route to fame, "W.O.E." where they define what entertainment is supposed to be, "Contribution" (the only track i'm not that crazy about, but it's still good) where they rap about 3 family situations that all end up with the same conclusion, and on "The Game" where they creatively rhyme about playing basketball... Overall this is a great cd that truly represents hiphop...the only downside is that there's only 11 songs, but there all good enuf to make this cd a 5-star rating...
