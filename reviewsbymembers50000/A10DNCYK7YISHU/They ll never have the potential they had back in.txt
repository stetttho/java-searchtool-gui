 Highly Anticipated, yet highly dissapointing CD off Mobb Deep.  If Havoc and Prodigy continue their careers like this they'll never again reach the potential they had back on their The Infamous album... At the time I bought this CD I was slowly converting to underground and intelligent rap, so this CD didn't impress me that much... A lot of lyrics and quotes through out this whole CD sounded indentical, but there were a couple tracks that impressed me: "Streets Raised Me" , "Quiet Storm" , "Where Ya Heart At" , "It's Mine" , "USA" ... But other than those tracks mentioned the rest of the CD has tracks that are either mediocre or not so good... Clearly Prodigy is the better lyricist of the group...but slowly Mobb's gonna become a sell out and go from talking about killin' to bein' rich.  Neither of the 2 topics impress me, but 4-5 years ago Mobb had a nice feel to it, they made the topics sound decent... As of right now, there's no such thing as a good thug lyricist...MCs don't exist in a musical genre like this... this CD needed more "Where Ya Heart At" type of tracks then it would've been an essencial cd....
