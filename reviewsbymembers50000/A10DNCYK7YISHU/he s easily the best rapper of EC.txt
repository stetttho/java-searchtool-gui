 I received my first dosage of Copywrite off the Smut Peddler's "Porn Again" album where he outshined Cage & Eon easily.  Copywrite has a lot of great qualities for an MC: he has very good easy-to-follow flow, he has a decent voice, and he is a great lyricist.  He excels very well at battling and he'll hit you with a barrage of metaphors and punchlines.  The only rapper who he's not better than with punchlines is Chino XL.  However, Copy's only flaw is that he is TOO battle oriented.  "June" is his ONLY conceptual song.... Anyway about 'The High Exhaulted'...  Copy hits you with an all out lyrical assault on each track.  Even though he is mostly an egotistical battle mc he still shows some versatility with his lyrics & delivery.  There's a track where he talks about sex the whole time, there's one track where he speeds up his flow, but probably the best song is the depressing track "June".  RJD2 displays his talents and makes a beautiful multi-layered beat with Copywrite spitting depressing rhymes about the hiphop industry and about his father's passing...  its a really beautiful song.  Just that song alone is worth the purchase... "I'll leave in the middle of 'nowhere' like the letter H" "My notebooks more amazing than the one Guinness made" "had to drop the phat sh**, sorry about the weight" "if you don't believe in God, then you're calling me a fraud" --- that's some of what to expect on this cd Copy is an ill mc, don't sleep on him!!! I'm Out... Mind Power!!!
