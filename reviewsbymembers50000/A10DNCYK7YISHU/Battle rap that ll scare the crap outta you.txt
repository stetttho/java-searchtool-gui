 Canibus very well expresses a talent that was God-given to him...and 2000 B.C. shows his dark, evil, sadistic, and lovable to hiphop heads, personality...The angriness probably centered towards Wyclef for messing up Can-I-Bus with awful instrumentals and LL Cool J, just for being who he is: overated and sold out... Lyrically and beat-wise this would be Canibus's better cd definatly, with no questions... It opens up with "The C-Quel" which right away blasts his best rhymes: which could've been a mistake because the rest of the song is average compared to them...and ends with "Chaos" which starts off accapella then eventually joined with music which was intersting... Every song will impress you lyrically, especially: C-Quel, Life Liquid, I'll Bust Em You Punish Them, Lost @ C (best track), Horsementality, and 100 Bars (5 minutes of freestyle) However, if you compare this CD with Canibus's previous CD you'll realize that it lacks creativity...CAN-I-BUS has LL diss, a track about aliens, his fetal bond with his mother...while BC 2000 is either battling, or killing people stuff... even though he says "thousand" alot in it... I still think he's a thousand times better than Eminem as of right now...because he chose to be smart and stay underground and not sell out to get money...Canibus raps for respect and he definately has gained mine
