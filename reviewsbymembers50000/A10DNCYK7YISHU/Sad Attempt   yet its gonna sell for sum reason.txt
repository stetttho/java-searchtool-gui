 SONG FOR SONG RATING... 1.  The intro has nothing really special so its average... 2.  Gangsta Love -impressive track from warren, the lyrics are  decent and beat is nice... and Kurupt only says "nigga" 8 times   this time... 3.  Why Oh Why - the beat is kinda sloppy with rubbish  lyrics 4.  Dollars make Sense - lyrics are real stupid but beat is  OK 5.  I Want It All - lyrics are decent yet can be improved, beat is  nice 6.  Havin' Things - lyrics are stupid beat is average, with a played  out topic...Nate Dogg was the only good part of the track 7.  You Never  Know - lyrics are average, beat is decent 8.  My Momma - oh my god warren  did a track by himself, beat ok, lyrics could have been better 9.  G-Spot  - beat ok, lyrics dumb 10.  We Got That - OK where's warren in this?  ...  ruff rydas are played out... however the lyrics are ok...beat is dumb 11.   Dope Beat - lyrics are decent, beat is nice (good name for song :-)  12.   World Wide Ryders - too drawn out beat and lyrics are bad 13.  Game  Don't Wait - stupid track with stupid beat and lyrics... 14.  If We Give  U A Chance - beat is nice, slick comes nice but the rest of track is  bad 15.  I Want It All remix- good beat good lyrics... 16.  outro -  dumb All in all, this cd shows that Warren's raps are of a 6th grade  vocabulary...but warren does mix ok beats...Nate Dogg like always comes off  nice with Warren...Nate Dogg's LP was much much better than this, i suggest  buying that (Warren is in 2 tracks in that)... overall rating -  4 lyrics - 3 beats - 6 originality - 3
