 For those of you that are scratching your head wondering who CRU is here's my 4-1-1.  Personally i think they sound somewhere between the Lost Boyz and A Tribe Called Quest.  They came out in 1997 and their reppin' the Bronx.  They came out with a bang with their tracks "Pronto", "Just Another Case", and "Bubblin'".  Hot 97 (NYC hiphop station) promoted this group in 'Battle of the Beats' CRU sang the opening theme for it... Dirty 30 came out and this group dissapeared unnoticed and that is very very SAD. Other than this album the ONLY other CRU appearances were on "Relax & Party remix" by Ivory.  Violator Volume 1 had "Ohh Wee" by CRU, which was a fun jumpy party track.  I peeped a couple MP3 sites for CRU songs and came across "What Cru is number one" and "Odd Couple".. but other than the mentioned songs I've yet to hear from these guys... and its sad to see a good hiphop group vanish because dormant hiphop heads... The rhythm blunt CRU had potential. anyway about Dirty 30, I think there's enough tracks in this CD to have your neighbors complaining about the noise.  Practically every track has a nice beat to bump and Yogi and Chadeeo sound nice together over the mic.  The 3 members had a great chemistry together and there's alot of shiners throughout the whole CD.....only downside to this whole CD is that some rhymes are very simplistic...but it doesn't really hurt the CD at all... On a side note though... even though they had a lot of playful songs, "Armageddon" seems a bit foreshadowing.  The approach in that particular song is also playful, but it's talking about the 'DESTRUCTION OF HIPHOP'.  I dunno what they were up to at the time, but check out all that garbage contaminating the radio waves now....  it kinda got me wondering... anyways just peep this CD if you listen to CRU or not.  You'll probably be satisfied either way... I'm Out... Mind Power!
