 This is the 2nd Soundbombing CD by Rawkus and comparing it with the very well organized first Soundbombing...this one is even better, actually it's one of the best compilations I've ever heard... With an all-star hiphop cast including: Common, Talib Kweli & Hitek, Pharoahe Monch, Eminem, and Mos Def.  It even has some lesser known artists a chance to shine too... The production, MCing, and DJing through out this whole CD is excellent and yet again shows us WHAT RAP IS SUPPOSED TO BE...not showin off your cash or rappin about how many drugs/hoes you've gone thru in a day...   Pharoahe Monch, Company Flow, and Common are what captured me most on this CD: Monch's explosive "WWIII" and good story on "Mayor" , Comp Flow's EL-P tells a very evil yet true story about the U.S.'s policies on "Patriotism" , and Com's hypnotizing "1-9-9-9"...  PRETTY MUCH EVERY TRACK ON THIS RELEASE WAS EXCELLENT... with a couple exceptions: RA Rugged Man's "Stanley Kubrick" just plain sucked, even though I like Dilated Peoples they just didn't sound good this time on their track "Soundbombing" , Thirstin Howl III had a nice verse but the rest of his track was nausiating "Brooklyn Hard Rock" , and Diamond D "When It Pours It Rains" put me to sleep... This is probably one of Rawkus's best releases because it showcases so many dope MCs to get into... for example I got into Talib Kweli after I bought this and now Talib's one of my favorite MCs... basically any CD by Rawkus is good because its REAL hiphop from the heart...  xcept Lyricist Lounge Vol 2 (that one's not good) Speakin my mind...
