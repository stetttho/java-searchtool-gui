 Now I respect MISTA because at tough times in my life I just needed a voice to help me out...  reminiscing about Blackberry Molasses I desperately searched everywhere for the CD... eventually I found it and bought it right away...  and I was so strengthened emotionally and mentally after listening to it. The tracks that stand out the most are... "Blackberry Molasses" --- a beautiful song both musically and lyrically, about teenager hardships that lets you know there are other people that feel the same way that you do... "Lady" --- cute little track about the boys showing there affection to a real attractive girl they see one day... "Tears, Scars, and Lies" --- excellent track, beautiful musically and lyrically, about them suffering from lies and not forgiving the ones who hurt them... "Everything Must Change" --- even though it's an interlude and there aren't that many lyrics in it, the harmony they have is a beautiful sound to your ears... "Crossroads" --- shows us that eventually in your life your going to have to make important decisions and go the proper way...choose wisely the other tracks on this cd are very good also...not a bad track on this entire cd, but these tracks tend to stand out the most... if your a love / teenage topics R&B cd listener this is a good cd to add to your collection
