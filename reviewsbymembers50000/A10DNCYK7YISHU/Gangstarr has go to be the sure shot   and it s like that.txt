 Once you start playing this cd you might have to force yourself to stop...it's that good! It starts off with the bangin' "You Know My Steez" where Guru is constantly spittin' out good rhymes and DJ Premiere serves us with a dope beat...and ends with the R.I.P. peeps dedication "In Memory Of"... Guru's very mature, metaphorical, even humorous with his lyrics in this LP, with quotes like:  ....."right about now it's time to expand my authority / cuz i'm like the wizard and you look lost like Dorothy"....."nobody's invincible, no plan is foolproof / you all must meet your moment of truth"..... "first and foremost / some rappers are sweet like fructose" and DJ Premiere is excellent at creating music and shows professionalism at his scratching... Pretty much every single track on this 20-song cd is excellent or at least a 4 star rating...only 2 tracks on this cd weren't that great : "BI vs. Friendship" - wasn't a bad topic it's just that having a monotone Guru rap with the crazy 2,000,000 decibel M.O.P. didn't mix well...also "The Mall" - sorry but this track was pathetic...Premiere and Guru really both sucked on this track and the 2 other lyricists were terrible other than those 2 messy tracks, the rest of the cd definately makes up for it, thus creating a 5 star CD... IT'S DEFINATELY WORTH THE MONEY       "underground will live forever baby cuz we like roaches, never dying always living!"
