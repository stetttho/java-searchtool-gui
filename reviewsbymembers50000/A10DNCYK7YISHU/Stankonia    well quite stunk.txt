 I bought this album about a week after it came out and I was looking forward to listening to it.  But, while listening to it rather forcefully (which is a bad sign) I noticed how fast one of my favorite hiphop groups was changing...  It was almost as if they were slowly going commercial and purposely selling out...  personally I think I'M RIGHT, even in the booklet of lyrics you can see shots of them by cars and showcasing their girlfriends as lower class (Big Boi's girl bendin over back view)... I never really heard any of Kast's first CD, but ATLiens was definately their best work I've heard.  That entire CD had a point to it mostly and the lyrics told stories.  Aquemini was a decent follow-up with some amazing tracks that got cancelled out with some bad monotinous tracks, making the CD an average release.  However Stankonia Kast decides to show a highly funkadelic feel of themselves and abandoning their roots... The tracks on Stankonia I was definately feeling were: B.O.B. , Ms Jackson (which is over played now) , Humble Mumble (took me back to an ATLiens feel) , Slum Beautiful, Gasoline Dreams, and So Fresh So Clean...    but the rest was mediocre work or not their best at all material:  We Love Deez Hoes (why not just feature Jay-Z and Nas on that track) , Gangsta Sh** (does not sound like Kast at all) , ? (didn't know what that was) , Stanklove (way too long and put me to sleep)... another one of my favorite groups turning commercial...  Kast is slowly going, Tribe is gone, Nas is way off point, Jay-Z lost it... Hiphop's losing some of its best talent because of the media and what they think is good...screw the HYPE, artists should do what they want...music's for love not for money!!!
