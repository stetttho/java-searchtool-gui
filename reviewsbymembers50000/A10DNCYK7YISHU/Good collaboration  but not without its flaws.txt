 This project almost came TOTALLY out of left field, but regardless of the severe lack of promotion, the album is pretty good overall...  Canibus for the most part dropped hot verses, although there's a few moments where he's just spitting some random nonsense.  I'm one of those people who wouldn't mind hearing the 2000B.C. era of Canibus, but I welcome his diversity...  He shines tremendously on tracks like Def Con Zero, Letter From Head Trauma, and Cloakman...  However, he spits some really nonsensical jargon on Titans Clashing, Gold Finger, and Ya'll Can't Ball...  This is the first time I'm hearing Pheonix Orion, but he definately spits less complexing rhymes than Canibus, which is good and bad at times.  My favorite verses of him were Majestic Mic Masters and Titans Clashing.  His delivery for the most part is energetic, but at times insanely annoying especially on Ya'll Can't Ball.  However, he occasionally outshines Canibus on a few tracks, but he's lyrically the weaker of the two.  I might look into his solo albums though because he did spark my interest...  Production on this album is all over the place.  You occassionally get some REAL HARD BANGERS which are accompanied by some real GARBAGE...  Letter From Head Trauma, Cloakman, Gold Finger just to name a few are insanely dope.  Then there's random sh** beats like Commandos or HTR which I either found very repetitive or annoying...  GOOD THINGS ON THE CD: The majority of the rhyming is very hot on this, some very hot Canibus rhymes, Kool G Rap - K Solo - Tyrant - and Free's guest spots, the additional DVD  BAD THINGS ON CD: Almost NO conceptual tracks found here (except Livin), a few lousy beats, some really annoying hooks, sometimes Pheonix Orion gets redundant (along with one or two Bis verses)  ------ Overall: 7 out of 10  I wouldn't mind seeing a follow-up as long as C&D fix up these numerous minor inconsistencies...  This group definately has major potential --- GET BETTER PROMOTION NEXT TIME!
