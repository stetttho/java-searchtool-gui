 Hieroglyphics - 3rd eye vision is an excellent example of what rap YET AGAIN is supposed to be like...if you listen closely Hiero takes slight stabs of commercialized rap music.  And on the other head, Hiero rap clever word play and each lyricist of the group get their time to shine...Opio's solo track was probably my favorite out of the bunch... Straight from "You Never Knew" all the way to "Miles From The Sun" Hieroglyphics will capture you with their hypnotizing rhythm...and you'll find it hard to turn the CD off or listen to it without pushing repeat... If you're unsure of what 3rd Eye Vision even sound like...it consists slightly of A Tribe Called Quest music with a Jurassic 5 style harmony, just that Hiero raps modern... "You Never Knew" , "Dune Methane" , "At The Helm" , "The Last One" , "Oakland Blackouts" , "Mics Of The Roundtable" , "See Delight" , and "Miles From The Sun"...are my personal favorite tracks and the best thing is, there's not a bad track on this entire album...it's definately worth the money...  OTHA MIC ROCKERS THAT KEEP IT REAL : Common, The Roots, Talib Kweli, Pharoahe Monch, Jurassic 5, Gangstarr, etc...
