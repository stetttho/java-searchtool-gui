 S Double aka Shabaam Sahdeeq finally got his debut LP out after what seemed to take 5 years, but he came still hungry for props.  I really got my first taste of Shabaam on the Soundbombing compilations and Lyricist Lounge Volume 1 CD and I was pleased with the man's lyrical ability.  I decided to explore into him more and peeped his vinyl singles: "5 Star Generals", "Pendulum", "3-D", "Concrete", "We Gonna Eat This Year", etc... and I just digested it all up and loved it.  Now sure it would have been nice if Scandalous had a chance to drop because his old Rawkus material is much better than this, but Never Say Never does have its head nodders... Take for instance the opening track "It's Nothing" S Double shot out some decent lyrics and he had a nice James Bond type of beat to rhyme over -reminiscent of his old Rawkus work-.  "Strait Like That" was a harsh diss to Rawkus which came out well and SS left some scars on them.  "Can't Be Together" was a smooth love track that I was feeling to death.  Some other very good tracks to take a listen at are: "We R", "We Holdin", "Fed Up With The Bull", and "I Still Love Her." Sure there's some elements on this CD for real hiphopers to spit upon.  SS raps about girls and hot tubs every now and then, some beats were real trash, and some of the hooks on a couple tracks were painful: especially "Who's At My Door?", "You Need To Give It Up", and "That's How We Do"...  but Shabaam's flow really really helped make these tracks tolerable... I hope the man has a rewarding career and I really hope that his bottled up anger doesn't force him to go the wrong direction in rap because talent like SS is tough to find... I'm Out...Mind Power!
