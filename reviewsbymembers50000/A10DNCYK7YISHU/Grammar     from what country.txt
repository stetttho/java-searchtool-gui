 Nelly shows us his magic on this release: write absolute jibberish, organize it with horrible computerized beats, sell out and make cash by the truckload... I'm still yet to understand as to why hiphop has gone in such a pathetic direction lately.  MCs used to rap for respect and love and in the early 90s a branch broke off forming rap about "topicless subjects" , "drugs" , "gangsta / thug" , "money flashing / jewerly" , and "jiggy/ mainstream"...Nelly showcases mostly in the topicless subject/ jiggy mainstream area... Even worse Nelly had the nerve to diss Common during an interview.  He stated something like "oh i don't need to rhyme about topics in my songs, i don't have to go on a level and put extra thought into something that has nothing to deal with rap music like Common or someone" he stated harshly...  and to make matters even worse Country Grammar is nominated for best rap album grammy while Like Water For Chocolate (Common) isn't and Com's CD is actually of 6-7 star rating for amazon... with lyrics like "eehh ahh  uh oh..shimmy ya"  it seems Nelly is a crossbreed of illiterate and teletubby MC... "Country Grammar", "EI" , practically the whole entire release showcase that...however on "Luven Me" Nelly actually has LYRICS sorta except he gets lost in his own barage of words after the first verse... So all in all -- this cd doesn't deserve even 1 star -- Nelly shows us his preschool IQ -- and for those who are lost in hiphop and are on the quest to hear talented artists : check out Common, The Roots, Talib Kweli, Pharoahe Monch, Gangstarr, Hieroglyphics, etc... those are the cats who still and always will keep it real and they contribute a braincell to their work...
