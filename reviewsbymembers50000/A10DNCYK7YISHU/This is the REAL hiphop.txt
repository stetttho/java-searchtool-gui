 I love The Roots, I cannot think of any words to compliment them any higher.  I'll start off by saying this CD is smooth as hell, just like all their CDs but the tracks kinda flow into one another like 'Train Of Though' (Talib Kweli) or 'One Day It'll All Make Sense' & 'Like Water For Chocolate' (Common)...  Every member in the group gets a chance to shine.  And just like all their CDs this is a great representation of REAL hiphop... Through out this entire LP the group is expressing creative approaches of hiphop, and they play their own instruments and barely ever sample.... "Table Of Contents" is purposely made sloppy to show the ruggedness of hiphop's culture.  "Step into The Realm" has a constantly fading beat and at times sounds accapella showing off Black Thoughts and Malik B's ability to flow without a beat in the background.  "Without A Doubt" has Blackthought's verbal onslaught accompanied by bongo drums making a raggae style song.  "Love Of My Life" has BT and Common showing their dedication to hiphop (note: Com's verse was incredibly good, he rhymes about his entire career until then).  "100% Dundee" has Razhel beatboxin and Thought and Malik emceeing over it.  "You Got Me" the Grammy winning love song which got a lot of well deserved radio play...and lots of other good songs... I've heard all from The Roots except their first album: Organix.  But 'Do You Want More' was very musical, 'Illadelph Halflife' seemed more lyrical, but 'Things Fall Apart' was JUST RIGHT gotta give props to Goldielocks and the pourage... If you're having second thoughts about buying this CD, the right choice is to buy it.  $18 is a good price for it!! I'm Out... Mind Power!!!
