 Growing up A Tribe Called Quest was one of my favorite groups. Finding out that they were gonna break up killed me, but later found out that they're all separate ways...so I would be loyal to them and support them... Amplified comes out so I go and buy it, expecting to hear the usual Q-tip sound... I was surprised at how much he changed... Tip used to purposely not act this way when he was in ATCQ, but now he chose the route to go all for the catchy beat and rap about cars and women (played out miserably)... about 75% of this release is pure garbage, to the average quester...  The only good tracks were "Lets Ride" (real nice beat and OK lyrics) , "Vivrant Thing" (even though it's topicless Tip made it sound nice) and the bonus track "Do It See It Be It" (shows a reflection of his youth)... If your interested in Tribe solo projects check out Phife Dawg's cd ... it's better than this, but its not a 5 star rating...
