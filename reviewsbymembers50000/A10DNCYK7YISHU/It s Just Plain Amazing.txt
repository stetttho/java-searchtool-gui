 Prepare yourself to take a journey throught the minds of 2 highly intelligent gifted musicians.  This is one of those CDs where the artist puts their entire souls into, but this seems like they put even more than that..."amazing" doesn't compliment this release enough, but I cannot think of a term to discribe how excellent this CD is... From start to finish your hit with various rhythms, stories, serious or humorous lyrics...even though its only 11 songs every single one of them is perfect in its own way: "Definition" has its reggae vibe, "Respiration" has its powerful musical performance along with lyrics by Mos, Talib, and Common, "Hater Players" contains a humorous slight diss to commercial music, and both artists very cleverly parafrase 'The Bluest Eye' by Toni Morrison on "Thievs In The Night"...Mos and Talib drop their solo tracks.... Along with the great tracks, you get to read each of the artists perspectives of each track in the booklet; when they finished them, their feelings about them, etc... These are 2 very slept on artists... the media doesn't know what good music is.  They seem blinded by the shine off BGs bling, or deafened by the blasphemous yelling and complaining of DMX, or have their attention on seeing low class women bending over in about 99% of all rap videos shown on MTV and BET...   c'mon true talent is whats on the mind of the musician.  Mind Power...
