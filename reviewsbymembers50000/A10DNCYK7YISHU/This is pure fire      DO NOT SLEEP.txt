 Stoupe is an absolute sick twisted genius!!!  Vinnie Paz perfectly compliments Stoupe and always busts a raw verse!!!  A last and NEVER least Kool G. Rap is the extra cherry on top!!!  Animal Rap definately lived up to the hype, despite being pushed back on what seemed like forever!... There are 2 mixes on this single along with an interview (which is interesting, but actually not very necessary 'leave it for the website if anything')...  There is a classical fast-paced version which is something perfect to get hyped to.  And the other version is a much slower organic mind twisting version, with absolutely beautiful production by Stoupe...  (if you think I'm talking from my [...] listen to the song, then tell me different)... Jedi Mind Tricks is definately going to be a big dominant force in hiphop if they keep this up... * P.S. - also be watching for the Canibus & Stoupe collaboration album 'Rip The Jacker & The Enemy of Mankind'... I'm Out... Mind Power!!!
