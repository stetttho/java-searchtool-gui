 i would really give this a 3.5 Phife Dawg's solo LP has its high points and low points... **song by song rating** "Flawless" is one of the LP's best tracks.  Hi-tek mixes a good beat and Phifey is shooting some good lyrics including that diss to Q-tip (which I believe Tip deserves for what he's become)... "Alphabet Soup" is mixed very well by Hi-tek and Phife delivers some good lyrics... "Miscellaneous" is an OK track, nothing special about it... "DRUGS" has a good beat and Phife spits some good lyrics dissing what has become of hiphop commercially... "The Club Hoppa" was ok, but nothing special about this either... "Lemme Find Out" is one of the LP's worst tracks.  The Pete Rock mixed beat sucked and Phife didn't really do that much better... "Ben Dova" shows us Phife's more humorous side.  This is one of the best songs and it's something to party to... "Beats Rhymes & Phife" is a reflection of Phife's life.  The beat is good and Phife shows us his fun storytelling skills...one of the LP's best tracks... "Ventilation" is Phife's kinda "don't **** me off" track.  The beat and lyrics are good...but the lyrics and beat doesn't mix well together... "4 Horsemen" shows us Phife and No-Name's freestyling skills.  No-Name's mcs are average but Phife isn't that impressive either... "Melody Adonis" is definately the LP's best track.  Pete Rock showed us that he wasn't totally lazy on this release.  The lyrics and the beat are really good... so overall     LYRICS - 7 (better in Tribe)      BEATS - 8 (some mixed real nicely)      CREATIVITY - 5 (has to work on that...can't be saying what hiphop should be all the time, even though I agree with him) phife should have included Thought U Wuz Nice and If Men Are Dawgs, they would have made the LP better...
