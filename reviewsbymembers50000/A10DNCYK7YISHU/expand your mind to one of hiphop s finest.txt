 Overall Dilated Peoples is your average everyday underground group... but little do the commercial heads out there know, that all these little average underground heads rarely put out any GARBAGE on their releases.  'Expansion Team' is full of bangers, and the entire CD contains a little bit of everything for the real hiphop heads to digest all up... For instance "Live On Stage" is Dilated rockin the stage live and its a great way to start of the CD. "Dilated Junkies" is the DJ posse cut and the turntable wizards tear it up with their turntable tactics... 'thats a dangerous man that speaks with his hands' couldn't have been any better a quote to scratch. Plus there are solo tracks for Evidence and Rakaa to showcase their skills and there's appearances by The Alkaholics (heavy rotation), Guru (worse comes to worse), BlackThought (heavy hitters), the Beat Junkie Crew (dilated junkies), and 2 solo tracks with Defari and Phil Da Agony... Plus on production we have DJ Babu, Evidence, Juju, DJ Premier, Beatminerz, etc... one of 2001's greatest albums, so peep it! I'm Out... Mind Power!
