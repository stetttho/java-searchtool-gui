 This was the only CD off Rawkus Records that I didn't like...it was possible maybe because of my high expectations or that I don't mesh with semi-commercialized artists.  There were even a whole bunch of MCS on this compilation that I'm usually feelin' normally, but even some of their tracks didn't amaze me either...the whole project was just dissapointing to me... - Mos Def is overused on this cd and he's not very impressive on any of the 3 tracks he's appears in... - Pharoahe Monch should've been used more on this...he was amazing on "Oh No" totally outshined Mos (even Nate outshined Mos) - Q-tip just shows us again that he's gone commercial - For the first time ever HiTek mixed a rubbish beat on "Get That Dough" but look who he had to work with on it... - Talib Kweli and Dead Prez held down the mic ok on "Sharp Shooter" - Dilated Peoples showed some underground potential on "Right & Exact" and the Lyricist Lounge veterans: Wordworth and Master Fuol got stuck working with bad artists (Q-tip, JT Money, Pastor Troy) ... remember Consequence (he was on a couple TRIBE CALLED QUEST tracks back in 96) makes a decent appearance in "Cypha" which happens to be one of the best and underground sounding tracks accompanied with 5 other dope lyricists.... so overall -- if your a mad underground hiphop head you might be disappointed and this would be the cd to buy on clearance or borrow off a friend...
