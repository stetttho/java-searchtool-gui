 Evil D was on the mix, come on kick it! Here's one of Rawkus's earlier projects featuring dope MCing, professional DJing, and an entourage of talent that the commercialized media / money hungry "MCs" (excuse that usage) are unable to show... This record is such a treat because it contains some of Talib Kweli's and Mos Def's oldest tracks: "Fortified Live" , "If You Can Uhh" , "Universal Magnetic" , "2000 Seasons" , and a nice freestyle by both.  It also gives the lesser known Rawkus MCs a chance to shine along: Company Flow, Black Attack, Sabaam Saadeeq, RA Rugged Man, Sir Melenik... Like always the underground mcs are always impressive, takin their stabs at commercialized rappers: RA Rugged Man especially, but he's the only one I wasn't crazy for on the CD, but he's ok...and obviously Company Flow, Mos & Talib, and Saadeeq were excellent which i expected ahead of time, but that Black Attack track "My Crown" my reaction was like - oh sh** that was sweet... And Soundbombing Vol 2 was even better...and i'm still awaiting a probably impressive 3.
