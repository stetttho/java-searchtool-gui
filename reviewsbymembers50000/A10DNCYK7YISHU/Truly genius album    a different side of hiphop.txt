 Definative Jux couldn't have started making noise at any more perfect a time.  During an era of slowly weakening hiphop, a group of truly gifted individuals have all allied with one another to create such an odd harmony that's appealing to the ears.... The lyrics of abstract rap are actually an ocean of words about emotion rather just simply speaking the English language to tell a story.  Those who hate on Co-flow and Def Jux artists are either too ignorant to understand this type of music or they just simply do not want to explore into this genre of hiphop.  Can Ox's mcs, Vast Aire and Vordul, have mastered the art of abstract lyrics and accompanied by the 'ahead of its time spaced-out production' of El-Producto... where could you go wrong?  no wonder why this CD was claimed on of the best of 2001... Can Ox presents a tale of harsh city life on 'Iron Galaxy', they explain their feeling of love on 'The F Word', substance abuse in rap on 'Painkillers', about the obvious dying hiphop culture on 'Ridiculoid', and they even show off their style of battle skills on 'Strait off the D.I.C... Even if you cannot fully grasp the lyrics after plenty listens just allow the music to take you in...  The beats hold it down on their own also.... here's an example of how poetic this group is:  You were a still born baby /  Mother didn't want you, but you were still born /  Boy meets world, of course his pops is gone /  What you figgure? /  That chalky outline on the ground is a father figure /  So he steps to the next stencil, that's a hustler / Infested with money and diamond cluster /  Lets talk in laymen terms /  Rotten apples and big worms / Early birds and poachers /  New York is evil at it's core, so those who have more than them /  Prepare to be vic-tims /  Ate up by vultures, the politicians /  If your a lost hiphop head asking yourself 'where are all the innovative creative true hiphop artists?'  Come and check out the Def Jux roster...   I'm Out... Mind Power!!!
