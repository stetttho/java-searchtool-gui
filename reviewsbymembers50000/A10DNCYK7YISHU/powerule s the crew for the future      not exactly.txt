 "powerule's the crew for the future" boasts the lead vocalist Prince Powerule in the track 'Smooth' (which is exactly what it is)...  They made some noise with the single 'Brick In The Wall' and they are credited as one of the first puerto rican hiphop groups to represent NYC...  It's hard to think why this album wasn't really perceived by hiphop listeners... The first song I've ever heard by Powerule was from their insanely dope vinyl single "well connected / bright lights big city".  Those 2 tracks were highly impressive and I desperately tried to search for more songs or information on this group...  Which eventually led me to this CD!... which is even better than their comeback singles I must say from start to finish this CD was really really hot.  They get fun, rowdy, relaxed, intelligent, and unbelievably dope all through out this entire LP.  Tracks like 'pass the vibes', 'gots ta get this', 'smooth', the ill posse cut 'young stars from nowhere', and 'rub off the wax' would be a good enough reason to even consider buying this CD...  EVERY CUT IS HOT!!!  I was really confused as to why this group virtually vanished off the hiphop scene...   Well I am pleased with what they have contributed to hiphop, even though their material is limited...  My words are that if you feel like taking a dive back into the old school era, this would be a fine selection to hear!!! I'm Out... Mind Power!!
