 I got my first dosage of High & Mighty from Rawkus Records and I checked out their 'Home Team Advantage' CD and I went through a lot of Energizers listening to that so much... 'Home Team Advantage' introduced me to Cage so I decided to get the Smut Peddlers LP 'Porn Again' which was just as good as 'Home Team Advantage'... Then i explored into some other Eastern Conference related artists and found out about 'Eastern Conference All Stars volume 2'... Ya' know after reading all the MCs on here I had VERY high expectations and most of them satisfied me... the BEST tracks in this were by Smut Peddlers, Cage, J5, Tame 1, Copywrite, RA Rugged Man, Evidence, Kool Kieth, and the 2 All-Star versions... Mighty MI, Alchemist, RJD2, and Reef were behind the boards and they made some rather decent beats (especially the Alchemist and RJD2 tracks)...  The only downside on this CD is that having an all star (no pun intended) cast of mcs had me expecting some constant DOPE material to make my eardrums bleed... however, some tracks were filler material with a surplus of average rhymes.  There's not too much material on this compilation that's very memorable.  There's only nice beats on this CD, but some sound too similar to the others... But fortunately there's more upsides to this CD than downsides.  If your unfamiliar to EC or any raw underground rappers this would be a good CD to take a listen to... I'm Out...Mind Power!
