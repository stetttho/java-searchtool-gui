 The very first time I've ever heard of High & Mighty was off the Soundbombing 2 compilation, which was a pretty dope track... And my one friend requested that I buy this CD and it ended up being worth the money...  Lyrically Mr. Eon is interesting to listen to, he'll either be dropping comical lyrics, perverted ones, or just strait up dope! Sometimes he sounds a bit monotinous on tracks but it doesn't really hurt the CD at all.  And DJ Mighty Mi definately put some dope beats on this... The Very Best Tracks: "Dirty Decibels", "Top Prospects", "B-Boy Documents 99", "The Last Hit", "The Meaning", "In Outs" (my first dosage of Cage), "Shaqoun & Eon" (incredibly dope beat), "Weed", and "Open Night Mic remix"... plus the skits are actually funny on this, not trying to sound funny (good example of stupid skits (Eminem - Slim Shady & Marshall Mathers LP, D-12 - all of them) Usually CDs with a lot of guest rapper appearances to me wrecks the CD (good example: Warren G - I want it all 'terrible CD') but High & Mighty have a great chemistry with the artists they work with here. Pharoahe Monch sounded perfect on "Dirty Decibels" but he only did the chorus which was a little dissapointing, but still dope. "Top Prospects" came out very well and Evidence sounded better than ever on it. Mos Def just dropped more dope lyrics on "B-Boy Document 99" addin' up to his name. Eminem was at his best on "The Last Hit". I got my first dosage of Cage on "In-Outs" which definately impressed me. Kool Keith was cracking me up on "Hands On Experiance". And Wordsworth and Thirston Howl were a delight to hear on "Open Night Mic"... Actually Mr. Eon sounds best when he's rapping with other rappers on tracks, kinda like Q-tip and Phife Dawg... But Eon does not dissapoint anywhere on this CD... I'm Out...Mind Power!
