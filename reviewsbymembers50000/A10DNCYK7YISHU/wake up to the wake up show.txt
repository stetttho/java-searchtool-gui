 Man forget about all the commercialized garbage that's degenerating the culture of hiphop!!!  If you want full relief from that putrid garbage stealing radio time or if you're already an underground head, then check out any Sway and Tech freestyle CD (I just happen to only have this one so far)...  Sway and Tech rep the underground to the fullest exposing some of the game's best emcees (Chino XL, Crooked I, Juice, Supernatural, etc...) Everyone on this CD is talented.  A couple rappers in this may obviously outshine others, but no one is close to coming off badly on this (not even DMX or Sauce Money)...   Every track on this CD is great but the best of the best are : "Chino XL and Crooked I" - Chino comes off sick but he's actually outshined (a real rarity)... Crooked I is just NASTY as hell in that track. "Supernatural" falls victim to Sway and Tech changing topics for Supernat to freestyle about ranging from b-boys to cavemen to mathematical equations for solving angles of triangles "Eminem and Akinyele" use their crazy antics to make the listener crack up to death...  "Chino live" is a live concert where Chino is freestyling and actually has to STOP every couple lines because the crowd is reacting so much... "Supernatural vs. Juice" was the PERFECT way to end this freestyle compilation...  a 12 minute battle where both MCs are spittin some great lines, but Supernat stole the show... in other words if you want to declare yourself a hiphop head, then GET THIS CD or any sway and tech compilation!  they'll help you avoid [stuff]like puffy, nelly, and ja rule I'm Out... Mind Power!!!
