 Before I heard this CD the only material I've ever heard from dead prez was "Sharp Shooters" on the Lyricist Lounge Vol. 2 which was a decent track. And the only other time I've seen dead prez was on a T-shirt Common was wearing on an episode of the Lyricist Lounge Show, and if Com likes them I now knew for sure that dead prez was worth listening to... Eventually I bought Let's Get Free and I was blown away and I woke up! Straight from the intro "Wolves" to "The Pistol" dead prez is talking about bettering black life, from their treatment in society to their health and mentality...At first I thought they were racist and bashing whites, but after a few listens I discovered that they were angry about society that was and still benefits ... ... ...so give dead prez another try if you didn't like how it sounded at first, I did and now dead's one of my new favorite groups... With their hard sound and intelligence you find yourself forced to listen to what they have to say on society. They bash the school systems on "They Schools", bash the police and prison systems on "Police State" and "Behind Enemy Lines", have a retaliation for justice with "Assassination", "Let's Get Free" is self explanitory, cleverly change the story around from Animal Farm to fit in with their viewpoint on "Animal In Man", and alert you about the dangers of the media on "..."... But not every song on this release is bashing society... "Be Healthy" talks about how their fet up with people abusing their bodies with drugs, "Mind Sex" is a very interesting love track, "Happiness" is talking about good times and memories, and "Hiphop" and "It's Bigger Than Hiphop" doesn't bash on society instead it bashes on commercial rap... Overall this is an excellent hiphop CD, not one bad track on it... if you don't like it at first give it another try... I'm Out...Mind Power!
