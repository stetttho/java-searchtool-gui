 I loved Bitten.  Bitten was a book about werewolves that was also a book about a young professional woman coming to terms with her wild side.  It was lushly written and crossed genres gracefully.  This book... not so much.  This book does not say anything interesting about her character or Clay's character or even Winslow's character in that way.  At worst it is a weak imitation of Buffy's 4th season, which IMHO was the weakest season of the show.  Both of them are about the (boring) idea of powerful people kidnapping supernaturals for their study.  Elena even mentions this similarity at one point!  As I have said before, mentioning a poorly executed homage does not excuse it.    This book is still readable, but at best, it is the continuing adventures of three characters who are still likable but no longer dynamic.  I would have liked to see Elena grow further.  Perhaps in this book she could have come to terms with her femininity, or her relationship with Clay, or anything to make it as relavant as the last one.  It simply was not.
