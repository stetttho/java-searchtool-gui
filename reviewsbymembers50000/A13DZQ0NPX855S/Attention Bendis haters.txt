 I understand why many comic book lovers hate Bendis.  He writes too much dialogue, forcing artists to draw repetitive pictures of characters just standing there talking.  I like it and I think it fits the now-older Daredevil who probably needs to take things a little slower and smarter, but I understand your complaint.  This book is a little different.  Daredevil finally gets to stop talking and start kicking butt.  There is a wonderful fight in this book between DD and Bullseye that has a great splash page and some snappy effective dialogue.  He also takes out the Kingpin and shows his dark side. Along with "Out," this is one of my favorites of the Bendis run.
