 SSX Tricky was a great game, but this one is clearly better.  Instead of cartoony characters and bright garish colors, this game sports lovely snow-covered scenery and color-coordinated character design.  The weather is more advanced, with snow, wind and ice feeling true to life.  The lack of snowboard selection is sorely felt, but made up for by the coolness of the single mountain and the improvement in game play.  Still, there are some really obvious problems with the actual navigation of the game that I wish they would have fixed.  For example, why, when you click on "Save" does is ask you "Are you sure?" and then set the default to "NO."  Why on earth would you not want to save?  There is no penalty for playing poorly, no save tricks.  So why would you want it to keep you from saving your scores and points earned?  It does the same thing when you try to load for the first time; "Are you sure?"  Of course I'm sure, I just started, I need to load something, don't I?  I just wanted to scream at the stupid text prompts.  There are some other problems like this in the navigation, like the difficulty in getting in and out of the lodge and the inability to compete two different saves againt each other, but this is easily made up for by how much fun it is to play this game.  The tricks are great, the courses are great, and the music is great.  I just wish they had spent five minutes making the navigation even vaguely intelligent.
