 ...with no cellmate... the long way back...  After hearing "Slow Hands" on the radio a couple of times, I had to buy the album.  The song was hypnotic but catchy.  At first, I was somewhat disappointed by the rest of the album; it seemed like everything sounded the same, and somewhat dull.  What a difference a few listens makes!  The nuance on this album is subtle, but the melodies are driving once you get to know them.  Paul Banks has a sleepy, cool voice like Beck or even Jim Morrison, and the instrumentation is good old fashioned rock, with a chiming guitar not unlike early U2.   There is not a bad song on this disc.  There are definitely some I like more than others; I like "Evil" and "Slow Hands" the best.  It is interesting that Amazon suggests "Killers : Hot Fuss" in addition to this, because I had a similar experience with that album.  It took me a long time to get into it, but now I love it.
