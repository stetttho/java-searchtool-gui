 ...as one of the greatest comic book hero movies.  This longer version makes a lot more sense that the theatrical version.  The extras are also very cool.  Biographies of the characters flesh out the story a lot more... and be sure to check out the Pancake comic, it's bizarre yet awesome.  There's also a weird Easter egg in the DVD menu you should look for.  How often does a funny-looking guy like Ron Perlman get to be such a dashing romantic lead?  Not very often, but it works so well in the movie, and it works even better in this extended edition.  If you like the movie in the theatre, you should at least try to rent this new version.  It's a lot of fun.
