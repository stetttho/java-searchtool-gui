 Please ignore the review above that says this DVD is bad - this review refers to an earlier editon of the DVD, not the grand-spanking new Disney version.  Disney has started to do unbelievably good dubs of Miyazaki's DVDs, and this one is one of the best.  The two little girls on this disc are voiced by Dakota Fanning and her little sister Elle Fanning, and both of them do a bang-up job.  When Elle cries, you will cry.  Their father is also well cast, as Tim Daly, voice of Superman on Justice League.  Usually with anime, I listen to the Japanese tracks, but with these new dubs, even Miyazaki agrees that the voices are sometimes better.  The quality of the video is also outstanding.  Disney has given the same treatment to Miyazaki's movies that it gave to its own classics like Aladdin and Lion King.  Bold colors, perfect compression, and crystal sound.  And it goes without saying that this movie has a great story.  It is touted as one of the most beloved family movies of all time, and this has to be true.  I am not a fan of every Miyazaki movie... I thought Kiki was a little dull, and Spirited Away was a little too weird... but this movie is precious from start to finish.  It is a profoundly Japanese story that nonetheless transcends barriers of nationality, language, and history, and is enjoyable for all ages.
