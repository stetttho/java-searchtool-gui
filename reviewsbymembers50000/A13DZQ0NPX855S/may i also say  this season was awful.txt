 The season finale of Alias season 2 was breathtaking.  The final fight between Sydney and faux-Francie had me on the edge of my seat, and then the cliffhanger was vintage J.J.Abrams.  Then it came back and it all went down the drain.  Vaugn's wife, Lauren, is for lack of a better word... lame.  The fact that she turns out to be (spoiler) evil is so cliched.  The fact that she is ineptly dating Sark and is bad at keeping the secret, EVEN THOUGH SHE IS A SPY, is pretty ridiculous.  And I think the big reveal about Sydney's memory loss-- that she did it to herself-- is weak storytelling.  I mean, how dumb is Sydney?   Doesn't she know herself well enough to know that she wouldn't accept a loss of TWO YEARS without an explanation to her memory-less self?  Or did she just not understand the concept of NOT REMEMBERING?  And don't even get me started on Indiana Sydney and the Temple of Rambaldi.  There are some good things about this season.  Dixon, Marshall and most of all Jack get a chance to shine.  But my firmest memory of this season is the moment when Sloane raises a stupid-looking green glowy hourglass over his hand and smashes it, with videogame cg-style, on the ground.  At that moment, I wanted to do the same thing to J.J.Abrams for wasting my time all  year.  Save your money and buy "Lost" when it comes out; it's much better.
