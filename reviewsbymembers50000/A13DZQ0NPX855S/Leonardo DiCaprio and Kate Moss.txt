 If you look at my other reviews, it will be patently obvious that I am a big fan of BMB -- please excuse my simple taste.  I will stray from that here by saying I am not a fan of this book.    The first reason is David Mack.  I know a lot of people like him, and he does have a lot of talent for capturing light with watercolors.  I understand his own books are really good, and I liked his covers for Alias a lot, but his angsty teenager style (like the way he writes words into his drawings) is a little hard to take for Daredevil.  I also couldn't stand how Peter Parker looked EXACTLY like DiCap and their secretary bore a ridiculous resemblance to model Kate Moss. I mean, photo referencing is fine-- clearly, I excuse it of Maleev-- but could he use less recognizable faces please?   And I think Brian Michael Bendis' work is not as compelling here, either.  I have a big problem with comics that do the "child in trouble" storyline.  I mean, what is up with this city?  Why are children always in some sort of contrived danger?  This storyline has been done too many times. JMS did it, twice, on Spiderman, and that's unfortunately when I stopped reading that book.  Bendis doesn't really find Daredevil's voice until "Out" with the help of Alex Maleev.  I would pass on this one and start on volume 4.
