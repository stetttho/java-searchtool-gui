 I picked this up out of the bargain section because ever since Harvey Keitel played Judas I have found him fascinating.  This wasn't as revolutionary as that, but I still found it worth reading.  There was something compelling about this story, so much so that I didn't want to finish it because I was afraid the ending would disappoint (it did a little).  I don't think it was terribly realistic, either in terms of biblical history or the secret lives of priests, but there was some elegant writing and interesting character points.
