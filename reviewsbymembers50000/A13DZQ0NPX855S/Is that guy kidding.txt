 "The Chris Claremont interview shows what a dull/uninventive writer he really is. I'm glad he's not involved with the X-Men movies in any way. Only Stan Lee is." -A Viewer (See below)  Is he kidding?  Not only is Chris Claremont CURRENTLY writing Uncanny X-men, he's also the best writer they ever had, penning for example a funny little tale called THE PHOENIX SAGA!  Which X-Men 3 is going to be based on!! Stan Lee's great, but Chris Claremont did for X-Men what Miller did for Daredevil... he brought them to the next level.  I agree with the other reviews that this show was great, but why are they giving them to us bit by bit?  X-Men is the most popular comic of all time, and this show is arguably as good as Batman's show, if in different ways.  They are releasing Batman properly, so why not X-Men?
