 She-Hulk vol 1 was a great book, with a little something for everyone.  It had great dialogue, clever action sequences, and a lot of heart.  The book was about Jennifer more than the Jade Giantess, and that was not a bad thing.  The only bad thing was waiting for the next book, wondering if it was going to be as good.  It is, mostly.  I was kind of bored through the first issue, because I found her "sidekick" supremely tedious, and the whole She-Hulk-as-interstellar-Solomon wasn't that interesting.  The book really kicked in when she started hitting people again.  She-Hulk faces an formidable adversary and has to use both brains and brawn to defeat him.    The end of the book deals with Shulkie's craziest adversary, Titania (from Secret Wars).  This is the best part; it is smart writing and  shows why the folks at AintItCool are saying Dan Slott is the second coming.  I highly recommend this book.
