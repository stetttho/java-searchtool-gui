 I got this book out of the library, along with "Bouquets: A Year of Flowers for the Bride" and the Knot book, and I would have to say, this was by far the least useful.  For one thing, there was nothing simple about it-- the arrangements either involved mountains of flowers, or varieties of orchids I had never seen anywhere else, or arrangements that were closer to balancing acts.  There is one picture that seemed to have literally hundreds of calla lillies around a doorway.  Come on!    Compared to the Bouquets book, which offered a lot of variety and was pretty creative, this just seemed like a lot of lilies & orchids & roses, and compared to the Knot book, it wasn't as practical, cost effective, or even very descriptive.  I am not a fan of the Knot website, but surprisingly, I found their flower book the most informative.  I would recommend either book over this one.
