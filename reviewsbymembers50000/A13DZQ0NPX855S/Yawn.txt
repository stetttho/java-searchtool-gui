 Nothing has ever made me appreciate Stan Lee more, than reading someone else try to do his shtick.  Comic books are silly, I accept this, but when Stan Lee wrote them, everyone had a real reason for doing things.  Yes, they felt the need to talk about it a lot, and the science never even tried to make sense, but there were real people in there.  This is not the case with Secret Wars.  I feel like the creators are just making it up as they go along.  The dialogue in this book is strikingly bad, which is partly because it was written in the 80's (my favorite line: "Like tubular to the max!" -SheHulk) but their are other comics from this era (Daredevil, Batman) that were above this.  In general, there is too much gobbledygook and no real motivation for what comes out of their mouths.  There is also some really yucky thought bubbles, mostly from Colossus (sic: "I miss Katya.  I had so many plans for what we could do together when she is old enough") which make you understand why Frank Miller abolished them.  Once the action actually gets going-- and it takes a while-- the story becomes more interesting...somewhat.  Doctor Doom is surprisingly well-written, so much so that he jumps off the page; he is even generally better drawn than the other characters.  I also enjoyed the weird romance between Volcana and the milksop Molecule Man.  In general, the villains fared better in this book than the heroes; the one exception is Spiderman, who kicks the whole of the X-Men's butts in a memorable scene, and later gets a suspicious new black suit that modern readers will quickly recognize.  I think this was the first "event" comic of its kind to be released, preceeding the Crisis on Infinite Earths (also a snoozer) by a few years.  This is now the bread-and-butter of the comics publishers, so it is interesting reading how it started.  Still, I had a lot more fun reading Identity Crisis, or even the dubious House of M.
