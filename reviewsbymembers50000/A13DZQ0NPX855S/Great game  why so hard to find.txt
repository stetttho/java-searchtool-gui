 This game is one of the greatest board games I have ever played.  It is simple to learn but very challenging to win at.  It can be won with many different strategies.  Some strategies work better with 2-3 players, others can only work when there are four players.    It is not too long, and not too simple, either.  Everyone who plays it loves it.  That being said... why isn't this game carried everywhere?  Or anywhere?  Toys'R'Us sells this game online, but no one in their store has even heard of it.  They have seven different variants of Risk, sure, but Settlers of Catan, which is apparently one of the most popular games worldwide?  Nothing.  I just don't understand why the distribution of this game is so poor.  Everything else about this game rocks.
