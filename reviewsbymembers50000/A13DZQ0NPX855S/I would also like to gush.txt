 ...about Peter Beagle.  He writes simple stories that mean more to you the more you read them.  He has a quirky and ironic way of writing that makes him fantasy's answer to Vonnegut.  I read this book from a proof copy I found at a used book store, which meant it had quite a few typos and some missing lines, which did not make it any less endearing.  This story plays with the form, much like Vonnegut did in Slaughter-House Five.  Instead of coming unstuck in time, Beagle's story comes unstuck in narrator, as each chapter is told from inside a different head than the last.  By the end, you know all the characters so well it's hard to let go.  This book was a little hard to find, but the search made it sweeter.  It is more mature than the Last Unicorn-- there is a sex scene that's probably too vivid for youngsters-- but if you're old enough to handle it, you will enjoy this book.
