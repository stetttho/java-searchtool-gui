 You can see in my other reviews that I a) love Bendis and b) did not like Goldfish, so it was interesting for me to read this book, in which Bendis tries to sell his screenplay based on Goldfish to Hollywood.  While I can't imagine Goldfish as a movie, it was funny to read about Bendis' experience trying to sell the idea to some airheads in Hollywood.  I've watched my significant other trying to make it as a writer in Hollywood for some years now, and Bendis' experience rang true.  Bendis draws himself as a white bowling ball-headed character, with wide eyes, while everyone in Hollywood is drawn with big chins, big grins, and closed eyes.  There is a great bit of monologue where Bendis is lying with his head on his wife's lap, looking fetal, thinking something like (sic), "You try not to get too excited, to think about how your boyhood dream is about to either start happening or disappear forever.  You try... but COME ON!"  I can't tell you how many times this has happened with me and mine.  It was also amusing as a historical document, with Bendis talking about how he is an independent comic book writer, and by independent we mean Not Superheroes. Clearly, now he writes everything for Marvel, including Daredevil, Ultimate Spiderman and New Avengers, so he's gotten over his disdain for the genre.  Overall an entertaining and insightful little memoir.
