 I love comics.  I love the X-Men TV show, the one that aired Saturday mornings in the 90s.  So why did it take Joss Whedon to get me into the X-Books?  Fear of the unknown!  There are like 600 X-Books being published today.  Okay, that's an exagerration, but there's New X-Men, Uncanny X-Men, Ultimate X-Men, X-Calibur, not to mention the individual books about Wolverine, Rogue, Emma Frost, even Jubilee.  Where to start?  Joss Whedon made it easy.  Not only did he sign his familiar moniker to an attractive new book, but it was a book readily accessible from the get-go.  The characters are iconic and easy to know, and the story is classic X-Men fare (mutants vs. normals).    In the intro to his excellent "Fray," Joss admitted to loving Kitty Pryde, and so it's not surprising that she stars in this book, and he writes her with love.  The banter between Logan and Scott is snappy Buffy-style wordplay and it works well here.  Stupid costume aside, Beast is also lovingly rendered and is the heart of this book.  The art was a pleasant surprise.  I had never read a book by Cassaday, but now he is one of my favorites.  Emma Frost looks stunning, and the compositions are original and striking.  The one that got reprinted everywhere was the dutch angle of the whole team, with Scott saying, "We have to be astronishing."  And with good reason; it's gorgeous.  One of the covers in this collection, one where Kitty is half-phased through Colossus, actually won a fan award at the Marvel website.  It's really good stuff!  My only complaint is that it doesn't come out fast enough.   I don't buy issues, I wait for trades, but I have heard that there have been problems getting this book out on time.  Come on Joss, Serenity is done, get with the program, I need it now!
