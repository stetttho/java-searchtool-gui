 I am outraged at Marvel for the City of Heroes nonsense, but I still can't help myself from buying their books!  Daredevil remains my favorite despite the general backlash against Bendis, and this book is one of my favorites.   Obviously, it features the Black Widow, Natasha Romanov, Matt's partner and former lover.  She is always sexy, always interesting, but in this book she feels like a real human, both vulnerable and strong, and the interchange between her and Matt feels very true to life.  If life happened to be about former Russian spies and men with superhuman senses....  My favorite moment is when Matt comes home and finds Natasha waiting for him, in his bed, naked.  Matt's thoughts are something to the effect of, "I used to dream about this sort of thing happening to me in high school."  And you can't help thinking, sure she is here to use you for protection, but I'll be damned if the Widow isn't the only lady in Matt's life who is worthy of him.  He doesn't take advantage of her, because he is still in love with his estranged wife, but they are so in touch with each other in this book that you really wish he would.  I didn't think I could still love this book after all this time, but I do.  "Widow," along with "Hardcore," and "Out," is some of the best superhero writing around.
