 While season two will always be my favorite, this season had some tragibeautiful moments.  Among them : Wesley's decision about Angelus; Cordelia's admission of love; the return of Faith; and Connor's desperate need for family in whatever form.  Also of note is a very good episode directed by hobbit extraordinairre Sean Astin.    The DVDs are well put together, with good interviews and a very funny commentary on the memory-loss episode.  I don't understand why only Cordelia and Angel can be on the cover of EVERY season, though.  There is some very disappointing stuff, too, most upsetting is the loss of Cordelia.  She doesn't die this season, but she might as well have, which makes me want to scream, "Joss!  Why did you spend 3 years trying so hard for me to like this character, only to write her off when she becomes the heart of the show?"  For this, I dock it one star.
