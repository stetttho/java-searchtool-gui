 I started reading this book because Matt Hollingsworth gave it to me, and it has since become one of my favorites.  I love reading it in public, just so I can tell people about it and say, no, it is not the TV series!  Despite having some impressive powers, Jessica Jones has never been your typical heroine.  She's a trash-talking, normal-looking chick who has trouble making sense of life.  In this final book, though, we get to make sense of hers.  We finally learn how she became a hero, and the awful reason why she stopped being one.    Bendis is not big on action.  He is not big on fantasy.  What makes him one of the great writers today is that he is big on dialogue, and character.  Jessica is a beautiful creation.  Her insecurites make her stronger.  Bendis is also great at pulling obscure MU mythology out of the woodwork and making it interesting.  Carol Danvers, the uber-heroine best known for being the lady Rogue stole her powers from, is the perfectly perfect foil for the troubled Jessica.  The Purple Man, meanwhile, is pulled out from the archives to tear her down.  Jean Grey, Luke Cage, Scarlet Witch, Nick Fury and the Ant Man also fill the pages.  Great stuff.
