 This is less of a review than a reminiscence.  I read this book in eigth grade, for school, and I am now twenty-four, and it is probably the only book I read that year that I remember, partly because Chris Collier came to our school that year, but mostly because the book was so effective.  A child's review below this one mentioned that the title gives away the ending, which of course it does.  Like the classic "Sunset Boulevard," this is what gives the story its power.  A sense of doom clouds every choice that the young Meekers make.  As an excercise, we students were asked to write an alternate ending in which Sam lived.  An interesting thought; mine involved a daring rescue by Tim.  Ultimately, of course, this ending is a fantasy, impossible within the confines of the closed world the Meeker's lived in from the outset.  I just read on ALA's website that this book was one of the most often banned books of the 90s.  It comes in at #12, right between "Heather Has Two Mommies" and "Catcher in the Rye."  I cannot imagine why.  Perhaps it is too violent?  An interesting tidbit: Mr. Collier said he had been trying to convince his brother to work with him on a historical novel for years, but it was not until the bicentennial in 1976 that James thought it would be marketable.
