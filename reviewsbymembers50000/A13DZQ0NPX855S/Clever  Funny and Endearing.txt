 I don't care what anyone says, I like this quirky babe.  I've brought it in to work to share with others and everyone think's I'm weird for reading a book called "She-Hulk" ... until they read it too.  This book is filled with laugh out loud moments.  David E. Kelley would be proud to hear that Dan Slott is a fan of his, and it shows.  She-Hulk is exactly the character Ally McBeal would be if Ally McBeal were a superpowered jade giantess.  And I also like the art of the first four issues -- never has a seven foot tall green chick looked so cute; it reminds me of a well-drawn Sunday comic strip, like "Rose is Rose" or something.  The art of the last two issues is plainer but also adequate.  I look forward to more in this series -- I have heard that it is being cancelled but then re-issued after the next arc.    Pick this one up, you won't be disappointed!
