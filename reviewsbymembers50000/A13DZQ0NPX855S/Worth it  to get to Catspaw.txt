 Warning: This book is not as good as Snow Queen.  It has a lot of the same lovely, anthropological attributes that Snow Queen shines with, but certain elements (ie the cardboard villain Quicksilver) are not quite as original.    I do highly recommend this book for two things, which are 1) Cat.  He is a great character and this book is spoken in his own unique voice, and  2) 'Catspaw,' the sequel to this book, is full-on excellent, and you will enjoy it more if you read this book.  The other complaint I have is the cover art.  I mean, who is that supposed to be?  Cat is a teenager in this book, and that dude looks 40.  The original cover art was uglier, but at least it looked like Cat.  The cover art for 'Catspaw' was so much better -- did the fabulous Micheal Whelan do this one too, and if so, was he half-asleep?
