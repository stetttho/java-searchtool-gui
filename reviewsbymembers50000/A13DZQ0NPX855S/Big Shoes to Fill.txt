 Dan Slott is an excellent writer.  No on is going to dispute that.  His She-Hulk and his Spiderman/Human Torch books are beloved by everyone, from the AintItCool guys to Joe Average comic book reader.  This book, like its title wannabe superhero team, had a lot to live up to.    It is not a bad book.  Dan Slott is pretty incredible at pulling obscure and lame Marvel superheroes out of the archives and making them cool.  I honestly wish that Squirrel Girl would help me out in Central Park some day.  Mr. Immortal is pretty weird, I'm not sure I like him, but he's got my favorite line in this book ("I'm Homo Supreme!")  Still, this book is not She-Hulk, and it is not Spiderman/Human-Torch.  I came away from it entertained, sure, but those other books are masterpieces that blend comedy and drama and character development in the grand dramedy tradition of Ally McBeal, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Rescue Me.  Those are tv shows, not comic books, but that is what makes Dan Slott unique.  I expected a little more.  This whole [m/d]isassembled saga was fairly disappointing, and I guess even Dan Slott was tainted a bit by this.
