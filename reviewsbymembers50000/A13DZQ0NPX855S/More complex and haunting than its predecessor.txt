 I avoided reading this book because I feared that it, like the sequel to Dune, would not be as engaging as the original.  How wrong I was!  This book is better than the original, and since the original was a Hugo award winning classic, that is saying an awful lot.  Moon's major quest is not just to recapture her lost lover; it is to save an entire race of intelligent sea creatures.  And her adversary is not one woman, her genetic equal; it is the entire might of the Hegemony.  As in the first, her undeniable pluck and good will help her overcome the most difficult obstacles only to find herself faced with more hardship, so much that your heart cries out to her and everyone around her.  As Moon has grown up, I think Vinge also has grown up.  The relationships in this book are much more mature and complicated, and I was constantly reminded of true feelings in my own life as I read this book.  I think Vinge also fell in love with BZ, because he becomes so much more dear in this book, so much more complete.  There are flaws, of course.  The first book was much tighter; Vinge is contantly re-iterating events from the past, particularly concerning BZ, extending the pages with excessive exposition.  And it does not have the same "Ah-Ha!" revelation as the first one, as the story is pretty clear to the reader from the beginning.  It more than makes up for it, though, in small surprises, in moments of beauty and tragedy that forced me to read the last 300 pages in a single day...  There is something about this book, something so much more than real, that makes it hard for me to stop thinking about it.  I think what makes it so wonderful is that even though, in the end, Moon and her cause accomplish so much, they lose so much in the process.  It is a bittersweet ending, both happy and sad, and there is nothing better.
