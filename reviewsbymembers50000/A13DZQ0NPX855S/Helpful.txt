 I'm not the kind of person who has planned her wedding since she was six years old.  My family is not religious, we do not have our own traditions, and I really had no idea what I wanted to do for my ceremony.    I liked this book because it provided a lot of options.  It showed vows for a handful of different religious, from the traditional Protestant vows, to ethical humanists, to Buddhists.  I especially liked that it had a wide selection of readings that were not from the Bible, including some really beautiful Native American prayers, and some of Shakespeare's sonnets.  Selections for music were good as well, although not quite as helpful to me since they are so many good lists available for free online.  There were some places I wish the book was a little more descriptive, though.  For example, the description of how the Unity candle is used within the ceremony could not have been more vague.  I would have liked more information on how things like this are actually staged.  Still, a very useful starting point.
