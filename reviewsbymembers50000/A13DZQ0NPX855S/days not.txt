 ... just in case anyone else is confused.  If you click on the image, it enlarges and you can read -- this is a 60 day play card for $30.  Serious money, but not as much as the next review suggests.  This game is loads of fun.  There is so much freedom in how you design your hero, you can really make any sort of character you can imagine.  You are also allowed to charge your character's clothing later in the game if you want to change your mind about the color of his spandex.    In just a couple of weeks, I am already level 14 and can fly, yay.  My only problem with it is that it seems that as you get to be a higher level, it could get tedious.  This is my first mmorpg besides a little Diablo 2, and I would say its very easy and very addictive.
