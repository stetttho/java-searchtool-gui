 I am going to take an educated guess and say that this animation has been reassembled, re-scanned, maybe even redrawn.  The lines are exceptionally crisp and I don't think tools this clean existed in the early 90s.  Also, a song has been changed to be less racist.  Oh, my righteous heart, stop, I can't stand the lack of integrity.    Puh-lease.  This is a beautiful DVD.  The brightness of the colors will literally burn through your retinas... in a good way.  The sound is exactly what you'd expect from a Disney super-special edition -- flawless.  And about that word change?  It is so minor, and it makes a better rhyme, to be honest.  The extras on this DVD, not surprisingly, are worth watching.  There's a very touching documentary about the lost songs that Howard Ashman wrote before his death, and you get to hear a lot about how he poured his soul into the movie and how it broke everybody's heart to have to cut them.  Luckily, DVD gives us a chance to see/hear them here.  "Proud of Your Boy" is particularly sweet and Clay Aiken does a good job with it.  One lame extra is the recording of  Nick & Jessica singing "A Whole New World."  Jessica is a very beautiful girl and she's often endearing on TV but she has no voice whatsoever.  It's not even that she's awful, its just that she is weak... she has nothing to offer the song.  There is also the original music video of Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle, and while they are not as photogenic, they are definitely more talented.  This DVD is a gem, a great collection of documentaries, extras, and a perfect transfer that make it a must-have for anybody who likes animation.  We all know about Disney's habit of forcing people to buy their movies by putting them "back in the vault" ... which is evil ... but for this one it's worth it to bend to their will.
