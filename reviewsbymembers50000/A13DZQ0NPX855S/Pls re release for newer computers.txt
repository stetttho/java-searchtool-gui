 I miss these games and games like it that Sierra used to make, pre Half-Life.  I played Space Quest, Police Quest, Gabriel Knight, Leisure Suit Larry, and Kinq's Quest, but my favorite has always been Quest for  Glory, which I played when it was still Hero's Quest.  Of these, my favorite is number 2 "Trial by Fire" because it is such a long, involved story with many interesting Zelda-like quests.  Except Zelda never had a button that replaced townsfolk with clowns! There are no games like these any more.  Please bring back the puzzle adventure game Sierra!
