 I am surprised by the other, less positive reviews, because I thought this book was superb.  I am not a huge Superman fan, I don't get excited by "Smallville," and I mostly prefer Marvel, but I think this has got to be the best Superman book I have ever read.  It does a little of what Jeph Loeb did in "Superman For All Seasons" and picks up the clumsily discarded torch of "Smallville" to create a beautiful, modern Superman.    The art is definitely among the most striking Superman art ever drawn, taking the best elements of manga and American comics to make a brightly colored and appealing book.  For those of you familiar with "Invincible," it has a similar look except with more sheen, and more primary colors.  This Superman is certainly a different Superman, and some people will take issue with the fact that he is, among other things, a vegetarian.  This discrepancy Mark Waid makes up for it by his awesome portrayal of Clark, a confident and popular guy who has to hide his talents under the false guise of a wallflower in order to maintain his secret identity.  Best of all is the ending, which is poignant, ironic, and will quite possibly make you cry.
