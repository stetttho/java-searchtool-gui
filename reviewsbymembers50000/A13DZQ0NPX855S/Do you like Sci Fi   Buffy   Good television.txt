 I, like many other Buffy fans, tried to watch Firefly when it was on TV and failed miserably.  This was due to many things, mostly the fact that is was on Friday night, and because it was not shown in order and therefore made a minimum of sense.  Much better on the DVD, you get to watch everything in order, on demand, and without commercials.  I bought this at the Fox studio store for $20 and it was the best $20 I ever spent.  Like Joss Whedon's other shows, Firefly blends the best of the dramatic ("Out of Gas") with the humorous ("Jaynetown") for some truly excellent television.    The DVDs are nicely packaged in individual slim cases so the discs aren't constantly falling out and getting scratched like the Buffy/Angel sets.  There are some neat extras too, notably Joss Whedon singing the theme song (his version is actually better than the one they used) and an awesome 5.1 audio track that makes it better than it ever could have been on TV.   Buy this DVD set, and see the movie Serenity next year!
