 When I got engaged, the first thing I did is what everyone does... I went out and bought one of those cheesy wedding magazines.  That magazine was practically useless -- the only useful thing that I saved from it was a page describing what makeup lasts the longest.  Everything else was ads I could find on the internet, for which I paid $6.    This book is different.  There are no ads, just honest-to-goodness advice from someone who has made a career of understanding the bridal industry.  The best part is the designer-by-designer breakdown of bridal gowns... it makes it so easy to figure out what ads you should and should not look at, based on your budget.    The other information is useful as well, including what to look for in a reception facility and how to judge a photographer.  The homemade flower kit information is great, too.  I have to say, though, that I found their suggestion of going to a strangers wedding to judge a band a little strange, but this is more than made up for by her frank commentary and specific, straightforward advice.  So how did I get a wedding dress for $150?  A brand new dress by lovely gownmaker St. Patrick with a full train and built-in crinoline?  I went to a website she recommends and discovered they were four miles from where I live!  I went to their warehouse and found a mint-condition sample of my dream dress, which I was allowed to try on, on Sunday, just like in a nice salon.  The attendant was wonderful, and she is also a seamstress, so I can get my dress fitted there as well.  This is a $500 dress, and I more than paid for the cost of the book with this significant savings.    There are so many gems in this book, I highly recommend it for anyone trying to save a little bit on their wedding without sacrificing anything.
