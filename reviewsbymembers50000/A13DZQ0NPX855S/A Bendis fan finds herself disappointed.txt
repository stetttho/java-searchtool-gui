 I really like Bendis, in general.  He is probably my favorite comic book writer.  I really like Powers,  and Daredevil, and Alias.  Since all of those books are superhero books with noir elements, I figured that this book, his root of noir, would be the rosetta stone of Bendis.  Instead, it was just kind of lame.  Goldfish himself was only somewhat interesting.  He is a crook who is pretty much just a run of the mill crook who never redeems or elevates or changes himself in any way. I sometimes had trouble knowing which one he was because Bendis' art was pretty unprofessional.  A lot of stuff happens to him in this book that you feel is going to add up to some firecracker ending, but then the ending, also, is just kind of lame.  Since Bendis both drew and wrote this comic, and it is all black and white noir, it draws an obvious comparison to Frank Miller's Sin City series.  While Sin City is not my favorite comic (I generally find it amusing but one dimensional), it was a lot better than this.  I am sincerely surprised that this made the Wizard top 100 list, as I would not even count it among the best of Bendis' work.  An interesting debut, yes, but not a book I would recommend to anyone else.
