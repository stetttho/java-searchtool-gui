 As far as I know, this is the last book Ms. Vinge wrote about Cat, and I think that's a damn shame.  This book does not do him justice.  I think Catspaw is one of the best books I ever read about sci-fi psychics, but this book was pale in comparison.  The first problem is the girls.  Kissindre and Miya aren't half as interesting as the symbplayer and Elanor taMing (sic).  Even Jule had more spunk than Miya, and every time Kiss shows up, I keep thinking, Aren't you the dull student from Catspaw?  The answer is yes.  Also, because Cat is so enamoured of Miya, he spends a large chunk of the book being bubbly and happy.  That's no fun!  Cat is best as a snarky, cynical freak, and I'm not interested in listening to him go on about his 'one true love.'  He makes up for this with much suffering towards the end, but still, this section is painful.  The most disappointing thing about this book is that the ending is not a great ending for the trilogy.  His life is still up in the air, and he doesn't really grow in his power at all, if you know what I mean.  If you're like me, you pretty much have to read this book if you read Catspaw.  Just don't get your hopes up too high.  This book does nothing to diminish my very high opinion of Ms. Vinge as a writer (read my other reviews) but I think this is her slightest work.  If anyone's interested, I found Joan's homepage.  Looks like it might be kinda old, but still authentic: [...]
