 After watching the whole series again on FX, I have decided that season five is far and away my favorite season of television, of any show, ever.  It contains some of the show's best episodes (Fool For Love, The Body, The Gift) and it also pulls together as a thematic whole, in ways only cult TV can, further exploring the moral ambiguities that made Buffy so innovative.    The disks are also great.  Unlike the Angel disks, they actually put some thought into who should be on the cover, and Joss' commentary on the Body is worth a listen.    There is a major mistake in this release, though.  One of the most poignant moments of this season on TV was the beginning of The Gift.  Giles' voice says, "Previously, on Buffy the Vampire Slayer..." as usual, and then the viewer is treated to a splashy montage of the main plot points of entire series.    It was a beautiful way of telling the viewer, This Episode Changes Everything, and the choice of shots summarized so well the feel of the entire show.    Now that I've made you want to see this montage ... too bad, you can't!  Its not at the beginning of the episode.  Fox cut the previews from all the episodes, which is usually fine, but for this one, they really should have made an exception.  Guess I have to keep my home-recorded VHS after all.
