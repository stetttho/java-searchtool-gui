 Although relatively unknown in the United States, Salvatore Adamo, a Sicilian-born Belgian who sang mostly in his native language, French, was very popular in Europe, South America, and the Far East (Korea, Japan, etc.) in the 1960s and early 1970s.  There are two groups of people who love Adamo's chansons.  One group is avid fans who try to collect all of Adamo's albums that are available.  Then there are people who just like to listen to some of Adamo's songs which they used to enjoy when they were younger.  This 2-CD set (C'est Ma Vie: Les Plus Grands Succs) is a great choice for the latter group, which includes me.   I used to listen to Adamo's songs (such as "Tombe la neige", "Inch'Allah", "En blue jeans et blouson d'cuir", "Une meche de cheveux", "La nuit", "Sans toi, ma mie", etc.) when I was growing up in the 1960s and as a college student in the 1970s.  Unlike some of Adamo's recently-released albums which contain recently re-recorded versions of old hits, the 40 hit songs in this collection sound to me like the original versions recorded when Adamo was young (but I could be wrong).  Thirty-eight of the songs are from the 1960s ( beginning with "En blue jeans et blouson d'cuir", 1962), and only two are from the 1970s ("C'est ma vie" is the latest one, 1975).  This CD set comes with liner notes by Thierry Coljon, author of the biography "Adamo-C'est sa vie", and includes seven b/w and color photos of Adamo.   For fans for whom these 40 hits are not enough, a new 12-CD set, "C'est ma vie (l'intgrale 1962/1975)", has just been released in France, but I'm not sure whether it will be available in the United States.  However, the 40 songs in the 2-CD set (C'est Ma Vie: Les Plus Grands Succs) probably would be more than good enough for most people.  For those of us who lived through the 1960s and 1970s listening to Adamo's beautiful songs, this collection should make us nostalgic for the days when we were much younger and more emotional.
