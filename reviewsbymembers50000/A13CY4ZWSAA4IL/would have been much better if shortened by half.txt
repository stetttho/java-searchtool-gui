 I read "Invisible Eden" last June as soon as it was published, partly because I have always been attracted to the Outer Cape and partly from curiosity sparked by media publicity about Christa Worthington's death.  Although I was satisfied with how the story began and ended, I was somewhat bored with the over-detailed description of Christa Worthington's life in the fashion world: The book would have been much better, in my opinion, if it had been shortened by half (about 200 pages).  The book is about the loves and murder of a fashion writer on Cape Cod, not an unauthorized biography of Christa Worthington.  That said, I think the book is reasonably interesting enough to get a three-star rating.  While I do not know how accurately each of the characters was described, I could almost imagine the whole story as fiction (an unsolved mystery novel) rather than a true story and I still enjoyed reading the book. I congratulate Maria Flook on her courage to write a real-life story about her neighbors and to stand by her story.
