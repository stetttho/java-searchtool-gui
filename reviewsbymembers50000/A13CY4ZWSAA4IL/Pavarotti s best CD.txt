 If you could have only one or two CDs of Luciano Pavarotti, this 2-CD set probably would be an excellent choice.  The first CD contains a great selection of 21 arias (such as Nessun dorma, Brindisi, Di quella pira, M'appari, Una furtiva lagrima, Amor ti vieta, La donna e mobile, etc.) recorded over a period of three decades (from 1968 to 1997), and the second CD comprises 20 beautiful songs (mostly Italian lyric songs, such as O sole mio, Torna a Surriento, Core 'ngrato, Ave maria, Caro mio ben, Santa Lucia, etc.) recorded from 1974 to 1995.  Two songs in CD #2 appear to be ill-chosen among the otherwise excellent selections: "My Way", where Pavarotti sings along with Frank Sinatra, is not the sort of song one would expect in this CD set. In "Notte 'e piscatore", where Andrea Bocelli joins Pavarotti, Bocelli's voice is rather disappointing in comparison to Pavarotti's. But overall this CD set is, in my opinion, the best of Pavarotti's CDs.  If this set is too pricey for you, you may want to consider Pavarotti's "Romantic Italian Love Songs", which has a good selection of arias and Italian lyric songs (a total of 17 selections) in just one CD.
