 This book could be a good beginner's text for self-teaching on traditional East Asian brush painting popular in China, Korea, and Japan.  This book comprises 22 lessons, starting from calligraphy of Chinese characters to a complete landscape with people and animals, with reasonable instructions and beautiful paintings as examples.  However, this book emphasizes "xieyi" (free brush painting) rather than "gongbi" (fine brush painting).  To those who prefer "gongbi" (as I do), it is somewhat disappointing.
