 It would have been much better if this book had never been written.  The story in this volume takes place in the time period  after the wandering photographer (Robert Kincaid) left Madison County, Iowa, following his short love affair with the  conventional wife of an Iowa farmer (Francesca Johnson), until his death.  Actually there is not much discussion about  Francesca; rather the story is focused on Robert's new discovery of his forgotten son produced from a one-night sexual  encounter with a free-spirited girl in Northern California when Robert was much younger.  This epilogue dilutes the beautiful  love story between Robert and Francesca described in The Bridges of Madison County, which I have always defended against  pretentious friends who regarded it as a trashy romance novel.  It appears to me that Robert James Waller was forced to write  this terrible "A Thousand Country Roads" for some reason which I don't understand.
