 This is a well-written introduction to modern theoretical physics.  The author did an excellent job in reviewing the concepts essential for understanding modern physics, such as relativity theory and quantum mechanics, and in leading readers to  string theory, which combines gravity and quantum mechanics into one unified field theory, purported to explain everything in the universe.  Although mathematically very attractive, string theory may appear to some people to be a philosophical idea rather than a scientific theory.
