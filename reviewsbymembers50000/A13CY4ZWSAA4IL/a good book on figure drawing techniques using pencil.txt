 Tony Ryder is perhaps one of the most talented American artists in Modern Realism.  His oil paintings of figures, portraits, and still life are brilliant, but he is also a skilled technician in figure and portrait drawing using pencil.  This volume, "The Artist's Complete Guide to Figure Drawing: A Contemporary Perspective on the Classical Tradition", is, in my opinion, a good choice for those who want to improve their figure drawing technique.  The book describes Tony Ryder's protocol for pencil drawing of figures: block-in, contour, and drawing on the inside with an understanding of gesture, light, shadow, and form.  This method is extremely painstainking and requires great patience: according to Ryder, he spends an average of twelve three-hour sessions for each complete drawing (i.e., 36 hours per each finished drawing!).  The book also contains dozens of his excellent, inspiring figure drawings of models from diverse ethnic groups.  However, this book is not for those new to drawing: it lacks the lesson plans and exercises needed for beginners. If you are a real beginner to drawing, perhaps you should start with Betty Edwards' "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain".
