 Well, not quite. I think this book is the sequel-in-spirit to The Mathematical Tourist, and the prequel-in-spirit to Jungles of Randomness (if I have the publication order right).  This and Tourist are about a  scattering of research topics in modern mathematics; Jungles of Randomness  focusses more on probability, etc. I've met an awful lot of people who  hate math and profess not to understand how anyone could endure it  willingly.  (I'm a math major.)  Well, I used to be one of those people.   Peterson's books, among others, convinced me that could be exciting topics  in math, that math could be *fun.*  Not that I have any hope of touching  said research topics in the near future, or understanding them in any  depth--but it gives me something to look forward to. As for people who  don't think they can understand this--well, I probably didn't when I read  this and its "prequel" in high school.  I'd just gotten through  some basic calculus.  But Peterson's writing is lucid and entertaining; he  does a good job of giving the reader a flavor, if not the details, of the  topic he covers. And hey--if you can't make it through all the text,  there are an awful lot of neat color plates and diagrams to entertain you.   (To this day I have an inordinate fondness for drawing approximations to  Menger sponges during math lectures.)
