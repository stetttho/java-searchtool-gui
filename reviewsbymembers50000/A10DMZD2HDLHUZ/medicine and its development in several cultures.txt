 I ran across this in a high school library.  A high school library, for crying out loud--and I don't believe anyone else had ever checked it out.  It made wonderful Christmas reading.  I suppose most people don't read  about medical history over Christmas.  I did.  I couldn't put it  down. Ancient Greece, China, India...I can't remember the rest.  (That  copy is still *in* the high school library...though temptation beckoned.)   Majno covered medical practice (or malpractice from a modern  perspective...) in loving detail.  I wish my medical background were  better, but I believe this book is honestly written and as accurate as it  could be.  Some of the research was eye-opening even to my poor ignorant  eyes. Medicine isn't everyone's favourite leisure reading...but if it is  yours, take a look.
