 I've seen romances within fantasy novels.  This is one of the few examples I've seen of a story where the romance is more important than the fantasy. Dragon Prince concerns the coming-of-age of Prince Rohan and his  efforts to keep the one-dimensionally evil High Prince Roelstra (and  Roelstra's scheming, stifled daughters) from winning greater power.  It's  also about Rohan's trials and tribulations in getting together with the  Sunrunner (read: mage) Sioned, since Rohan is busy trying to convince  Roelstra's daughters that he's wooing *them.* The plot's okay, though  Rawn's worldbuilding is questionable.  You see "desert" words  like "farad'him" and "azhrei" showing up randomly, and  I seem to recall that in a later volume of this 6-book series (technically  2 trilogies), the continent's inhabitants are clueless as to siege weapons.   I'm sorry, but you don't see the development of forts and castles without  also having the development of siege machinery...the battering ram, at  least, was known *very* early in the world's history.  The cultures  depicted are sketchy and stereotypical, and I felt I was getting a view of  "the rich and famous."  These people never seem to have economic  problems (or if they do, they're easily solved).  Feudalistic societies are  generally built on the backs of laborers, common people--where *are* they  in this world? The book's main problem is that a major premise, Rohan and  Sioned's love for each other, is forced.  Yes, I've seen "love at  first sight" depicted in other stories.  *Better* depicted.  The  mechanism Rawn uses is almost ludicrous, though if you can get past that  first leap of faith, everything's fine. My advice: read this for popcorn;  if you can keep all the minor characters straight, it's not a bad  afternoon's entertainment.  But if you don't like it, give the other books  a pass.  (When I hit the siege engine idiocy, I gave up on the series.)
