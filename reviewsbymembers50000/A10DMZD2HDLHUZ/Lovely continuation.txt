 It's a pity the Seven Citadels books haven't done better in the U.S. (I understand they do well in the U.K.).  Perhaps they should have been released as one novel; certainly, understanding what's going on is easier  having read all four...which took me years to acquire through used  bookstores. Harris writes a fantasy quest...but it's a quest with  well-drawn characters and cultures, and avoids the all-too-common  "stableboy discovers he's the heir and must go on a quest for items X,  Y and Z to save thw world" epic theme that's been abused by countless  authors (no names named). It's about Kerish-lo-Taan, spoiled Prince of  the Godborn who must come into his own strengths and acknowledge his  weaknesses; his brother Forollkin, a soldier, who must accept his brother's  strengths; the fate of Galkis, their homeland lying besieged by corruption  within and invaders without.  If you can find the books, read them.  It's  worth your time.
