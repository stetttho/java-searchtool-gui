 Normally I hate tie-ins for rpg's and so on; most of them are awful.  But Cunningham's one of the (few) exceptions.  Here she sets up an interesting mystery about a half-elf and her mystical sword, not to mention the tangled  (and trying!) relationships between Arilyn (the half-elf) and the apparent  wastrel, Danilo Thann of Waterdeep.  My only complaint was the culprit's  motives--seemed a bit too tied to the AD&D alignment system, and wasn't  entirely convincing.  But worth a look.
