 If you pick this book up expecting comprehensive detail on all the world's weapons, you'll be disappointed.  You will, however, find a decent survey of many world weapons (with some bias toward the West), and sometimes short  descriptions of where/when/how they were used.  I find it most useful for  looking up an unfamiliar weapon and for finding out what things look like.   If you want more scholarly or detailed information, you'll have to hunt a  little harder.
