 Don't be misled.  This barely qualifies as sf: the tech and "science" are, for the main, horribly thought-out; the society portrayed is dominated by the echoes of Western civilization (Plato,  etc.). But the series (I've read this trilogy plus _Ghost Legion_), the  above notwithstanding, is *fun*...once you stop expecting *real* science.   Its true strength is in the relationships between characters: Derek Sagan,  ambitious...and alone; Maigrey Morianna, tormented by a lost past and her  sundered relationship with Sagan; Dion Starfire, the "lost king,"  who has a ways to go before achieving adulthood, let alone kinghood; the  mercenary Tusk and his wisecracking computer XJ.  It's a space opera with  battles and romance and plots galore.  Read, let go of science, and enjoy!
