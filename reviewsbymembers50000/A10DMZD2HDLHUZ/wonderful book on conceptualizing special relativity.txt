 I'm not a physicist or physics major, but I do like reading physics on a lay-level.  When I hit special relativity in college physics, it was no surprise--because I'd read Epstein's book and gotten past the biggest  hurdle, being able to conceptualize what's going on.  (I can tell you that  as far as math goes, special relativity at this level isn't difficult at  all as long as you don't get your frames of reference screwed up...which I  usually do.) And that's where Relativity Visualized excels: helping you  get your brain around these strange, strange, STRANGE ideas.  No math.  A  little geometry, and believe me, you don't need to remember much from HS  geometry to make sense of this, if you're curious about relativity.  While  I've no complaints about my college prof's treatment of relativity :-) this  would have helped the poor freshman engineer in my class who, upon learning  why the twin paradox isn't a paradox, said in bewilderment, "But  that's stupid!"  It isn't--it's just hard to accept.
