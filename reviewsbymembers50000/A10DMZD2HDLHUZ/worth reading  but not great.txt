 I enjoyed Weis & Hickman's Dragonlance Chronicles, and even _The Second Generation_ (some reprints, some vignettes).  I was hoping for more from this "final" story, though. For one, I would've enjoyed it  much more if the book had been written more "stand-alone"--some  of the characters were barely sketched, relying instead on _The Second  Generation_ for background.  Not good.  Similarly, I would've liked to see  *much* more development concerning Steel (a fascinating and  multidimensional character) and Palin (you never *feel* his brothers'  deaths--no, this isn't a spoiler; it's one of the book's first  events--because you never *see* them).  Much *less* concerning the annoying  "Irda" twerp. Chaos struck me as unconvincing--he was just  there to be a big bad guy who'd beat everything up.  Uh-huh. As far as  apocalypses go, I've seen better.  The book has its moments, though, and I  didn't regret reading it.
