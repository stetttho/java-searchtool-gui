 I was delighted when I heard that a sequel to _Operation Chaos_, a collection of loosely-related stories set in a techno-magical alternate Earth, had come out.  Unfortunately, I can't recommend _Operation Luna_ as I would its prequel. A lot of great elements are there: mankind's effort to reach the moon, our familiar protagonists from _Operation Chaos_ (Steve Matuchek, werewolf engineer, and Virginia Graylock, witch extraordinaire), a garrulous enchanted sword (named Fotherwick-Botts) from the Norse era and his forger, a dwarven smith who adjusts poorly to modern life, Coyote's schemes and uneasy dreams.... Alas, despite the attempts at levity, the story never really comes together.  Steve Matuchek wasn't the best choice of a narrator.  While he's definitely involved in the action in _Operation Chaos_, here he's relegated to reporting on everyone else's actions since, due to his lack of magical expertise, he can't actually get involved.  As a result, a lot of potential suspense (will Virginia succeed in her quest for Mimir's knowledge?  will their daughter Valeria survive her desperate attempt to foil the IRS?) trickles away.  Another problem is that the evils and dangers confronted are rarely convincingly dangerous.  Occasionally Anderson throws in social criticism of our world as it is (in contrast to this magical alter-Earth), but there isn't enough of it to fully convince, and it sits uneasily with the lighter tone of most of the story. All in all, while it's a light and often entertaining tale, _Operation Luna_ fails to live up to the wit, fine worldbuilding and daredevil adventures of its prequel.
