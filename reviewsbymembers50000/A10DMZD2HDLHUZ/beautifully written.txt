 I'm sorry I can't offer a better opinion on the accuracy of this book, which did seem to have something of an agenda when I read it.  I'm not a linguist.  I did find it an interesting read, though, and it challenged me  to think about the topics raised. (Since I read eclectically in many  topics but am "expert" in few, I'm used to taking books with a  grain of salt.  It's not a bad practice, especially if you can't run the  book by several real experts.) That aside--I'd be tempted to hand this  book to an English class as a lesson in *style.*  Content aside, Pinker's  writing is entertaining and lovely.  Which probably isn't the purpose he  was looking to accomplish, but hey.  I wish more books were written this  way (with much importance given to the content, OC--but good content  doesn't *have* to preclude good style).
