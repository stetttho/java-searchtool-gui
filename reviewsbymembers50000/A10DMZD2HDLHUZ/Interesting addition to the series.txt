 I think I must have missed a book, because there were references to a mission that I didn't remember (the last I read in the adventures of Ariliyn & Danilo was _Sylvan Shadows_).  I also don't recognize Bronwyn  and Ebenezer from any previous book, but then, I'm behind... That being  said, I found the book enjoyable.  Cunningham's one of the best writers in  T$R's stable, and she puts a lot more thought into her novels than most of  the others.  The exploration of Waterdeep's darker secrets was intriguing,  but not nearly fleshed out enough!  (As for those who complained about the  mercantile use of magic--well, considering how common magic is in the  Realms, why *wouldn't* it be put to financial and practical use?  See Poul  Anderson's excellent _Operation Chaos_ for an example in a completely  different setting--a magical Earth.) Danilo's grown more serious, true,  and Arilyn more tolerant--but then, after all those two have been through  together, it's about time for some more character development. I'd say  give it a try.  Mileage varies, but that's true for any book.  :-)
