 ...or at least, this is the first book I've found that talks specifically in chapters about infantry, artillery, etc.  (I'm sure others exist, but my reading has been eclectic.) I'm too much in awe of Keegan, and too poorly  read in anything military *after* the 1500's, to attempt any real judgement  on the scholarship here.  (My credentials in military history are  nonexistent; I'm just a reader.) I can say, however, that whatever its  faults, I've found this book to be a valuable resource.  The organization  helps greatly when you want to know about, oh, pikemen.  It did seem a bit  Eurocentric to me, and I would have liked to see more inclusion of  non-European unit types and *their* development, at least in the pre-modern  era.  Nevertheless, I'm happy I own this book...and it's staying in my  collection.
