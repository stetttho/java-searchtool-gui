 I am not a military historian, though I spent a good portion of my life wishing to study military and medieval history.  I was delighted to find this book in a random L.A. bookstore, and I'm still happy I picked it  up. It's lavishly illustrated with photos, drawings and the like; I found  it a pleasant and interesting overview of knights in medieval England and,  to some extent, France. And that's where the 3-stars rating comes in.   Please take this with a grain of salt--but I would guess that this book  succeeds in evaluating knighthood in England more than anywhere else.  If  it sought to perform the same function for European knights in general,  this Anglocentric presentation didn't succeed.  Mind you, where the  background exists, it's fairly detailed.  But I would have liked to see  this scholarship extended to more of continental Europe.  If you're looking  for anything on the Germans, forget it. Other than that, a nice addition  to my (growing) collection of military history books.
