 I found this a decent, though not outstanding, survey of linguistics.  I'd hand it to a monolinguistic English speaker who was curious about linguistics.  I wouldn't hand it to a multilingual or to someone who  already knows something about the subject.  In fact, I'm far more satisfied  with David Crystal's Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language as a survey both  for browsing and the more serious lay reader. I suppose my real complaint  *is* that the book is oriented toward monolinguistic English speakers,  which I am not.  I feel a more interesting introduction to linguistics  would have included more on other languages.  Not bad, mind you, but  understand its limitations.
