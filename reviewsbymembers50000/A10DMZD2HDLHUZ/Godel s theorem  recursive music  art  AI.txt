 Before I start: this isn't a book, it's a commitment.  I liked Bach's music, Escher, math and what I'd seen of computer science before I started reading, and even then it was a long, long read.  Not out of boredom, but  because my brain is finite and mortal and couldn't absorb more than a  chapter in one sitting (if it even succeeded in that). More than being a  commitment, GEB is a work of art.  Not just the music and numerous Eschers,  but the writing.  The dialogues between Achilles and the Tortoise were a  riot even as I reread every line, struggling to keep up with the pace  Hofstadter demands.  And be warned, it's no slow pace, either.  But it's  worth every page, whether or not you agree to the conclusions he leads you  to. My only caveat is: find some nice quiet summer when you'll be able to  give GEB the attention it deserves and requires, or you'll find yourself  putting it away for half a year until you do have time, as I did!
