 I wish I'd found this earlier in my introduction to calculus, which at first was a Grand Mystery only to be penetrated by Wise Math Geeks.  While it's *not* a guarantee of perfect math grades (few things are), it does  offer useful rules-of-thumb for checking your results in introductory  (single-variable) calculus.  I've found the estimation techniques useful on  occasion in places like physics classes. It's also a fun read, if you're  struggling with calc.  :-p
