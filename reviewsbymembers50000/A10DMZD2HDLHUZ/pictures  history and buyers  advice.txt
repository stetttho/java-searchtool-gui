 There are an awful lot of fantasy writers who would benefit in reading, if not this book, then one very like it.  But that's not a recommendation. I had the first edition, lost it, discovered the 2nd edition, was happy.   Even if you're not a gem-shopper (I'm not), the book's worth it for the  zillions of full-color photographs alone: you can *see* what all these  gemstones look like. Arem discusses carats vs. karats, gem-cutting,  mining, trivia and lore on various gemstones...a lot.  There are other  books on the same subject, of course, but this one's a decent survey.
