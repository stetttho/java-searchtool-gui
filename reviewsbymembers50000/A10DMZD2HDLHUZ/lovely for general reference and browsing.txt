 This isn't Everything You Need to Know to Become a Linguist.  But it *is* a good reference book for people who aren't linguists and would like to see what the field is about.  There's a little bit of everything; no great  depth, but you can't *have* everything and still have a book small enough  to lift. It's also awful fun to browse if you like languages in general  and are curious about "how they work" or what linguists study.   I'm not letting go of my copy, ever.
