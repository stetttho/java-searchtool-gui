 I've read *all* of Kay's previous works, more or less as they came out.  Verdict: He's tending more and more toward the distant and verbose, which I think is a shame; even as his wordcraft improves, the prose loses some of  its wrenching passion. That being said, I enjoyed the book--it grew on me  as I read.  It's nice to read a story for once that isn't centered on  world-shattering events.  It's also fun to chart historical parallels, even  with my scant knowledge (I *thought* Leontes might be Belisarius, but  wasn't Belisarius a eunuch?  or was that someone else?). Flaws: Too many  minor characters cluttering the action; not enough action; not quite enough  development of the really interesting characters. The culture felt a little  thin; perhaps he was relying on the history to carry it, a dangerous  assumption. It's slow--if your attention wanders easily, this book will be  a chore for you. Virtues: As before, Kay's prose is lovely, and he makes  mosaics quite, quite interesting (though I contend that L.E. Modesitt, Jr.  in his descriptions of carpentry in _The Magic of Recluce_ did better).
