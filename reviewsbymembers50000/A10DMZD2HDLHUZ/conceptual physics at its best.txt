 I took this book with me on a retreat--and read it straight through, unable to put it down.  Physics actually made *sense.*  Yes, for topics like mechanics you need texts like Kleppner & Kolenkow (or the text of  your choice, I suppose) if you intend to study physics more seriously.  But  the *why* of physics never made so much sense in K&K as it did in  Thinking Physics. While a lot of physics (from what I can tell) *is*  calculation, the heart of it (also from what I can tell) is in the  understanding, the *why.*  You won't get much math out of Thinking Physics,  but that's what the *other* textbooks are for.  And math without  understanding isn't much help. Thank you, Mr. Epstein, for writing this  book.
