 There's a lot going on in this book: Signy Mallory and her ruthlessness (or pragmatism, if you prefer); a Unioner rediscovering himself; the Downers and their involvement.  I was hooked by the scope, though  confused--possibly because I read this after _Cyteen_ and _Cuckoo's Egg_,  and I suspect I'm still missing background. The characters are  well-drawn, though I feel the Unioner (whose name I can't recall) became  more bland as the story went on.  There's a lot to keep track of, and it's  a challenge to the reader.  Still, worthwhile.
