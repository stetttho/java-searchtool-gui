 I expected a lot from this book.  I enjoyed the Finder's Stone trilogy greatly (*especially* _The Wyvern's Spur_), and was looking forward to seeing the characters again. Instead, I found a hackneyed plot and  flattened characters.  Alias and friends seemed to move like puppets, and  the villain was never adequately fleshed out. Avoid this one and go back  to the Finder's Stone trilogy.
