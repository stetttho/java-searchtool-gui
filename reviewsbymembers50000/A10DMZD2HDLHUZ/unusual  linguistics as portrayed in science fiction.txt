 I was lucky enough to find this book in a dim corner of Uris Library at Cornell U.  As a sf enthusiast with some layman's knowledge of linguistics (mostly from the Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language), I found it  fascinating. I do wish that someone would write an updated version, since  many of the sf stories that Meyers refers to can be hard to find.  Also, I  found his religious adherence to the Whorf-Sapir hypothesis amusing...but  then, I don't know what the accepted viewpoint was in linguistics when he  wrote this book. Definitely worthwhile for people curious about  linguistics or about language as portrayed in sf (usually poorly, I'm sorry  to say).
