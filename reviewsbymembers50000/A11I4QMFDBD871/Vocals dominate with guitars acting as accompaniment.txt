 Except for the song 'Chidel Wydul', which is an instrumental blend sounding like south African accordion jive, vocals actually dominate with the guitars acting as accompaniment. If you listen carefully, however, you will notice that some of these guitarists are quite good. Pay particular attention to Nicholas De Heer: he's as good or better than most blues or country pickers recording in the same era.
