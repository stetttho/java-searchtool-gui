 MANHUNGETUNG (the cd, not the song) was recorded in 2000, CHIMURENGA REBEL was recorded in 2001.  The mbira sound dominates CHIMURENGA REBEL more than any previous Thomas Mapfumo recording, bringing the sound of home to a foreign land.  In addition a few guest musicians are added on appropriate cuts: this isn't a new idea for Mapfumo, but his skill at using guests continues to impress and improve.
