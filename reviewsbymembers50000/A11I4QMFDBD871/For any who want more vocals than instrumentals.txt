 OUMOU is a two-cd set tribute to the range of her skills: Oumou has been described as the 'songbird of Wassoulou', and is Mali's diva. Her roots lie in the musical traditions of Southern Mali, and her songs comment on social problems in women's lives as well as more universal metaphors of heroism and the human condition.
