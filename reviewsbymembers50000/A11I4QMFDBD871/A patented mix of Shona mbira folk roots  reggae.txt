 Thomas Mapfumo continues to expand his sound: rhythms from Central and West Africa (as well as guitar riffs from South Africa) are subtly fused with his patented mix of Shona mbira folk roots, reggae (especially drum) and his rock and soul past in TOI TOI.  Its very joyfulness represents a form of rebellion against repression.  TOI TOI is their best cd thus far.
