 No one style of music defines Mexico - and no one style dominates the lovely various artists introduction MEXICO by Putumayo: indeed, the intent here is to represent a range of styles and new artists, and in this Putumayo's MEXICO succeeds beyond expectations.  An accompanying booklet in both English and Spanish explores the fusions and styles of Mexican sound from the ballad corrido to the ranchera. MEXICO is a basic 'must', serving as a winning introduction to any collection: if only one Mexican compilation were to be considered, it should be Putumayo's MEXICO.
