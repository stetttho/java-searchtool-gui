 Surprise: a modern beat and French vocals in a slick production contrast sharply with the usual Brazilian recording, so if you were expecting forro or some other ethnically rooted Brazilian folk tradition in Daude's NEGUINHA TE AMO, you won't find them here. Instead you'll find such songs as 'Muito Quente', an almost hiphop beat with French vocals; or 'Ala-La-O', a sparse dance beat profiling Daude's smooth and lovely French voice.
