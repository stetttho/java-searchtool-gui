 From the opening twelve-string guitar and vocals to the progression of full-chorus embellishments on songs ranging from a traditional Chiluba celebration song Kokolay to the poignant Ninlilie Nani, we knew YELLOW CARD to be a rare 'keeper': a star in a sea of fine music from Tanzania. Ndala Kasheba's fame reaches back to the 1970s, when he led the famous Orchestra Safari Sound. There's a strong Congolese beat throughout YELLOW CARD, typical of the region's music - but just as powerful is the sparkling guitar and Swahili lyrics. In Tanzania Kasheba is known as the Maestro Supreme for his fine tenor vocals and twelve-string acoustic guitar - and it's about time the rest of the world enjoyed his fabulous, unique sound.
