 OS FILHOS DE VENTO is a composition of classical, jazz and Brazilian influences written about the Roma gypsy people. No Roma influence mars the smooth pieces of jazzy keyboard works and clarinet/oboe throughout, however: this too is pure jazz with little Latin influence other than the background of its creator.
