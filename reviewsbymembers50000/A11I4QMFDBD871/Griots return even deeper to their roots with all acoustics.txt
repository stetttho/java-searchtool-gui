 Like his previous recordings, KASSI KASSE keeps it simple and harmonious with primarily traditional instruments and style with just a small touch of modern technique to enhance the recording quality. A real surprise is the use of Orlando "Cachaito' Lopez, the great Cuban musician, on double bass. Of course, Cachaito is the latest star in a long line of family musicians, so maybe it's logical he was chosen for this recording: he fits right in, uplifting the African music without standing out or showboating.
