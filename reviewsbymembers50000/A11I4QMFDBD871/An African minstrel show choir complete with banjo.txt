  South Africa is truly a unique country: unlike most African countries, it's known for its vocal rather than percussion groups. Another unusual fact is its realm of outside influences: while Cuban music was setting West and Central Africa on fire musically, the South Africans were listening to music from the USA and adapting it to various local styles. Hence the amazing recording SOUTH AFRICA: THE CAPE TOWN MINSTRELS by The Tulips: a minstrel show choir complete with banjo - but not  a carbon copy of American minstrels at all! For one thing, South African minstrel groups are composed of people known as 'Cape coloureds" who (as opposed to blacks - true Africans or Bantu peoples) are a mix of various races - Khoikhoi (Hottentots, the cape's original people), whites, black Africans and Malays. Many different styles of singing are represented, from the sacred to the profane. Some songs even have a hint of the Muslim singing style brought from Malaya. Some tunes are very serious, some are hilariously funny. Listeners may be shocked to hear refrains from 1930s or earlier pop tunes segue into very modern songs, then into something in between. Various languages, including English and Dutch, are constantly slipping in and out: thankfully, there's a great booklet written in three European languages (French, English, and Dutch) to tell interested listeners what's going on - and there's a lot going on, even if the instrumentation remains simple.
