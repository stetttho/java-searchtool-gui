  Music of the deep Saharan tribes takes on a decidedly modern, sometimes rocky overtone with Tinariwen's new recording AMASSAKOUL. The slow, nearly sleepy passages of introductory song 'Amassakoul n Tenare' is startled from rest by the nearly John Lee Hooker/Malian guitar of 'Qualahila Ar Tesninam', starting a past/present theme swing which moves progressively between songs. 'Chatma' holds shades of Ali Farka Toure in its precise chants and guitar style. There's even Tamashek rap exposing the fragile world of the fading desert, if political observational poetry is desired. Neither fish nor fowl is Tinariwen's latest AMASSAKOUL: not blues, pure North African, nor Western - but with elements of all, uniting for the greater good.
