 Natacha Atlas's new SOMETHING DANGEROUS is steeped in both Northern African and Middle Eastern traditions: it's rap and Morocco music meets New York and London; a rai-infused disco dance beat modern listeners will find compelling. Listeners had better like their rap tingled with Middle Eastern influences: that's what SOMETHING DANGEROUS is: if it wasn't for a sparse sprinkling of Middle East influences in the background, 'modern pop' would best categorize Natacha Atlas' latest. Songs range from hard-beat disco to quieter, crooning vocals - but are unified by the disco beat and backdrop of Mideast/North African influences - even the startling 'Man's World' standard holds evidence of this beat, although Atlas' vocals are profiled smoothly on the cut, displaying the range of her prowess. Another 'first' on her latest: in SOMETHING DANGEROUS,  Atlas features guest vocalists plus more singing in English than in past; though Arabic, Hindi and French are all integral languages running through most of the songs. More Middle East!
