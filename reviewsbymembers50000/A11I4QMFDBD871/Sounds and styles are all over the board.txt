 Billed as the 'Woodstock of the Sahara' and other names, FESTIVAL IN THE DESERT's various artists are unified by one thing: participation in a 2003 desert ethnic music fest sixty kilometers northwest of Timbuktu in Mali. Its organization - a non-government association of international world councils and unions - includes such diverse groups as Tinariwen, Robert Plant, Ali Farka Toure, Omou Sangare, and more: so don't expect a uniformity of sound or theme in FESTIVAL IN THE DESERT 2003's production: sounds and styles are all over the board. This is the place to hear new groups; from the renowned band LoJo to the UK answer to Ry Cooder in Justin Adams. The live recording is clean and clear enough that little is lost in fidelity due to audience participation: so if it's twenty diverse cuts of African music from across the continent that's needed as an introduction to some of the best artists of modern times, don't miss FESTIVAL IN THE DESERT 2003 - or future yearly productions to come.
