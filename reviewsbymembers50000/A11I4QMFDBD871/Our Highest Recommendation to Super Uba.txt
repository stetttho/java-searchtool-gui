 Meringue done acoustically instead of electronically, an Afro-soul influence, and a carnival set of rhythms marks this 'archetype of a lost Caribbean legend's compelling keeper album TIERRA LEJANA. Another big plus: the publicity notes for Super Uba are simply packed with information on the Dominican Republic's premier band and its old-time style. We give Super Uba and TIERRA LEJANA our highest recommendation for a combination of accessibility, dedication to preserving authentic traditions, and diversity of powerful carnival-style playing.
