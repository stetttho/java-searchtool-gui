 In TUNULA ENO  Samite, the flute-playing, Kalimba-plucking singer/songwriter returns with another group of traditional Ugandan and homegrown songs. Anyone familiar with Samite's music knows he tends toward mellow, spiritually-uplifting tunes on themes of world peace and understanding, yet they're not sung in English, so the cornball factor never enters into them. Songs range from very pretty ballad-style tunes to rhythmic shakers. Occasional piano adds a slight jazz touch without getting in the way or distracting from the somewhat ethereal groove. We'd had varying reactions to Samite's music over the years; from loving his first album to thinking he should have kept it simpler on his later releases. With TUNULA ENO Samite really pulls it all together: this truly is his best album of songs so far. Sad to note, Samite's wife was dying of brain cancer during the making of this album; yet somehow no sense of overwhelming sadness permeates the album: mostly, it's the sound of joy.
