 Seeking cds with more Andean emphasis? Then Grupo Condor alone in their COMPILATION is for you: Andean folksongs from Peru, Chile, Argentina and Bolivia are simply lovely, demonstrating - and thankfully identifying in the notes - a wide range of Andean rhythms: classic Tunatuna, Cancion from Chile, S. Juanito rhythms from Eucador and more.
