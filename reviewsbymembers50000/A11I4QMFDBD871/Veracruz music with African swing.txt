 If you live in California long enough, especially Southern California, you'll come to know Mexican music: you hear it all around you; it's everywhere. This land used to be part of Mexico and some days it seems like it's being re-absorbed. Although the members of Conjunto Jardin are all veterans of other Latin bands, their backgrounds are not strictly Mexican: Marcel Adjibi is actually from Benin, West Africa; but his African swing and drive is an important part of Conjunto Jardin's sound. The group specializes in the music of Veracruz, Mexico: an area unlike most of Mexico which had a large black African slave population that strongly affected the local music, known as son jarocho. The famous driving Mexican tune is from Veracruz, written by a black ex-slave sometime in the 19th century.
