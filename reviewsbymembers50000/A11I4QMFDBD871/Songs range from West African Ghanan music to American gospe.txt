 Slow drums and slow romance open JOURNEY with 'Jenny', where the singer laments Jenny's departure - then moves into wide-ranging grooves. The goal in JOURNEY is to expose the world to Jabali Africa authentic tunes (Jabali being a rock): thus 'Jenny''s romance evolves into the even more rhythmic beats of 'Tubula', a tribute to Joseck Asikoye's mother. JOURNEY is most powerful when all the polyrhythms stop completely, as in the third song 'Magunga''s introduction. Jabali Afrika doesn't rest on East African laurels and traditions alone, here: their songs range from West African Ghanan music to American gospel - and it's the group vocals which shine in JOURNEY.
