  From the fast pitter-patter beat of its opening cut to the gorgeous vocal chants, TAITA TUNE is like nothing African you've heard before: a rollicking beat which is fueled by the fire of rhythmic singing and call/response styles. As usual with the budget-minded Laserlight series there are absolutely no liner notes offline or on to enlighten on the music or musicians: suffice it to say the Gonda Traditional Entertainers' TAITA TUNE is simply astounding in its diversity of upbeat vocals and traditional drums and instruments, inviting dance.
