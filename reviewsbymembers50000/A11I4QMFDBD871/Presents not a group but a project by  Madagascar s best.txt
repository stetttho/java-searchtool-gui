 This island of unique charming animals also holds unique charming music. The people of Madagascar are thought to be a cross of primarily African and Malay-Indonesia descent: listen to the music on INTRODUCING VAKOKA, much of it played on instruments found nowhere else in the world (including my favorite, the valiha), and you will be transported at times to Southeast Asia, Southern Africa, or even the Manding countries of West Africa.
