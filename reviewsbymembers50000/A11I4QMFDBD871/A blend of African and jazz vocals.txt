 Don't attempt to neatly niche Gino Sitson's SONG ZIN: it just won't work - his music is a blend of African and jazz vocals and is so intrinsically interwoven between both traditions that it's impossible to separate one from the other. Jazz vocalist Sitson's style comes closest to Bobby McFerrin, blended with a distinct Cameroonian vocal style and female backup singers who add touches of gospel, blues and traditional African at the drop of a hat.
