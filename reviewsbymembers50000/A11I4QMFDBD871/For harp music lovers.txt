 Rafael Angel Aparicio is from the Llanera Plains region which has been influenced by its proximity to the Caribbean and its rich African traditions. This gives the music a drive and rhythmic complexity similar in some ways to the son jarocho music of Veracruz, Mexico; yet most of the music does not sound like son jarocho, though a few tunes have passages that do. At other times a listener may think he's in Paraguay, but the drive is usually stronger than the gentle, lyrical sound of the Paraguayans.  If you love harp music, especially Latin American harp, you owe it to yourself to include RECONDANDO A VENEZUELA in your collection: it's a winner.
