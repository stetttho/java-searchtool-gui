 Thomas Mapfumo and the Blacks Unlimited works with Wadada Leo Smith and N'Da Kulture on DREAMS AND SECRETS: a strong departure for Mapfumo who shares musical ideas, songwriting credit and band members with another musician/writer: and what a contrast in styles!  N'Da Kulture is a band very much influenced by the sonic explorations and experimentation of jazz and rock groups of the late 1960s. For regular Mapfumo fans, their music can be quite jarring and much jazzier than The Blacks Unlimited.   Some tracks are completely dominated by Wadada Leo Smith and his group; others by Mapfumo - but with the musicians of N'Da Kulture adding extra color to the patented Blacks Unlimited sound. These later tunes turned out to be our favorites.
