 Reverb-enhanced English lyrics, a gorgeous calypso-style intro air to the first song 'Bomba Shack', then haunting female vocal backups, and a gentle guitar luring the listener to the reggae-backed beat of 'Radio Free Babylon' : these are just some of the hallmarks of Mighty Vumba's AFROROCKIN' RUMBA. Much rock, a healthy dose of reggae, and little traditional African mark  'Radio Free' or  the first 'Bomba Shack' intros,  but there's a lot to love in AFROROCKIN RUMBA, with changing rhythms and multicultural influences - even a rock guitar solo. Then move to 'Mpota Esali Ngai' and there's another surprise, departing from the reggae influence but keeping the sweet background vocals and gorgeous guitar of its predecessors. AFROROCKIN RUMBA neatly fits no niche: neither wholly African nor entirely worldbeat, not reggae nor Western. Composer Gary Brancel has been experiencing difficulty finding a distributor who will appreciate his unique sound: it seems today you can't sell music on beauty alone, and Mighty Vumba's gorgeous sound truly defies niche marketing. His accompanying booklet VUMBALYPSOS is even more revealing of the origins of Mighty Vumba: Brancel is truly an artist of the world, with extensive connections in the Caribbean, Africa and the U.S. His most powerful influences lies in Africa and the Caribbean - and in these worlds, AFROROCKIN RUMBA shines.
