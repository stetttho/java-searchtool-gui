 Reading the liner notes to GIGI ("world fusion of jazz, funk, dub, African and Afro-Asian styles") and gazing at the somber dark cover, we were prepared to dislike this recording; but while listening to GIGI something happened: it got inside our heads, reached for our souls, and amazed us. "Wow, this is a real keeper" was the general response. If you liked the cd anthology WASSALOU SOUND or perhaps the haunting voice of Cecile Kerabywa, you should love GIGI:  not so much for dancing or sing-alongs, but for mesmerizing, laid-back listening. GIGI provides an astonishingly beautiful voice captured just right: everything neatly in balance. Highly recommended indeed.
