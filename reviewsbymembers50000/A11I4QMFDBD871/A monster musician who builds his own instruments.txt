 Rufino Almeida (a.k.a. Bau)'s all-instrumental CAPE VERDEAN MELANCHOLY presents a monster musician who builds his own instruments, has mastered several styles of music from swing and jazz fusion to morna (the melancholic music of the Cape Verte islands of Africa), and who plays guitar, violin and cavaquinho (known in Hawaii as the ukulele) with equal skill.
