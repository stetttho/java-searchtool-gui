 The former bassist for David Bowie, Lou Reed and Ngegocello wants you to 'feel the bass in your body' - and boy, do you: WEST NILE FUNK  is modern African-rooted drum and bass at its hardest - joined by Ghanian musicians and an African tinge which remains more European Afro-funk than actual African. This is the band's second full-length release and is meant for modern world dance floors - and for people who think most world funk is too light on the beat or too soft on African. It would be even more fitting to view this band live, when dancers are added - but as WEST NILE FUNK is only a cd, take it on the tempo alone: it takes the fast dancing of general African music, erases the hiphop elements which don't fit, and turns up the amp and volume a notch. WEST NILE FUNK is everything west of the Nile, from West Africa to Caribbean influences: it's not as beefed-up bass as modern drum n bass listeners are used to, but it makes up for the tone down in a complexity most drum and bass dance collections lack. Not recommended for sit-down listening: WEST NILE FUNK  is dance floor beat at its best.
