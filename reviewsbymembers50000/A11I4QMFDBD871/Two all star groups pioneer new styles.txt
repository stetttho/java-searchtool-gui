 Twenty years ago two groups formed in Puerto Rico: Truco, led by Hector Valentin, played the traditional Puerto Rican styles of bomba and plena; Zaperok was formed in the early 1980s and pioneered the new style Songo. Their union fuses powerful rhythmic patterns from a range of traditions, creating new styles and improvisations which are lovely representations of infusions of all styles.
