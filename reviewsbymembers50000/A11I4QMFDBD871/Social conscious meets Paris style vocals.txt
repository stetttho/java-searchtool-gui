 Mariana Montalvo, like the singer/songwriter Victor Jara, was part of the Nueva Cancion movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Like so many of her contemporaries, she left Chile when the Pinochet dictatorship took over, settling in Paris where a smoky ballad style already had an influence on her vocal style. Mix the serious social conscience of the Nueva Cancion with the style of Paris made famous by Edith Piaf and others, and you get a type of singing and songwriting totally unsuitable for dancing or raucous behavior - hence my love for the rousing title cut.
