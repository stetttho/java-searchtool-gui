  Any who think Cuban music is mostly drumming, any who love the choral vocals of Africa's Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and any who wish top appreciate the rich heritage left by waves of immigrants into Cuba will simply love Grupo Bocal Desandann's DESCENDANTS.  Released in 1999, DESCENDANTS remains outstanding and unique; simply breathtaking in its vocal harmonies and choir effects.
