 Take Afro-Cuban singing and drumming, mix in an almost hiphop modern element, add a rich voice in Bobi Cespedes - equally able at presenting rap, Latin, jazz and soul influences - and you have a work difficult to categorize and quite compelling in REZOS. Not quite for the completely modern listener but more than its Afro-Cuban roots, REZOS is packed with charged action, blending jazzy riffs and Cuban traditions with reggae, hiphop, and electronic drumbeats.
