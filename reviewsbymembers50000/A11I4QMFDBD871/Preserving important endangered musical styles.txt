 Like most of Pan's ethnic series recordings, JOROPO fills that nether land in-between sharp/crisp studio recording and field recording. These are not commercial tries for hit recordings, but attempts to preserve important endangered musical styles. JOROPO is a wonderful cd. Most of the music is not only beautiful but exciting: the music combined with Pan's copious liner notes is very educational - and compelling.
