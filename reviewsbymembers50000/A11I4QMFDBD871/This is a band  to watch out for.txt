 On their second album ALI KEJA, the group takes a great leap forward with a couple of personnel changes: guitarist Teddy Toure brings a true late-20th century African sound to the band - very professional now; not so experimental as before.  This really works well: the sound of the band is much more professional on their second album. Learning how to use the studio probably helps.
