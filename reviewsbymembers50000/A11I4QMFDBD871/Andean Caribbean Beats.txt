 Konrad Rhee's BLUE SEA DREAMS uses guest percussionist Brent Lewis (of Australian fame) to blend Native American influences from the USA with the sounds of both Andes and Caribbean beats to create a truly world music feel. Within the same song you'll hear essences of the American Southwest, Pacific Northwest, Caribbean, and even African instrumentation: all blend together, held by a subtle yet unifying percussive beat, to create a melodic, rich atmosphere reminiscent of soft rock and new age.
