 On FLOREANDO, Conjunto Jardin is joined by Tim Harden on harp and jarana. Tim is the music professor/folklorist/father of Libby and Cindy Hardin, the leaders of the group. Tim gives the group even more of an authentic sound, although this does tone down the almost rock-like drive of the group slightly compared to their first cd NUEVO SON JAROCHO. Another change between FLOREANDO and the group's first cd is the addition of multi-instrumentalist/vocalist Jorge Mijangos. Jorge plays both string and percussion instruments.
