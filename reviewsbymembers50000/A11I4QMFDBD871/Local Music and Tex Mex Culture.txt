 CHULAS FRONTERAS is almost thirty years old - but the culture hasn't changed; it's still as relevant today as it was 30 years ago when this film was first made.  Much of CHULAS is wordless and depicts the local music and culture: lack of narration allows for more focus on both scenery and sound. And, what sound: from a rollicking polka band to a ball waltz and Latin party music.
