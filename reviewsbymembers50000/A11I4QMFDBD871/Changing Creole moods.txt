 Though Izaline and most of the other musicians in her group are based in the Netherlands and have traveled the world, all are natives of Curaco, so even though most of the music can be described as jazz (and individual tunes will remind listeners of different places such as Brazil, Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica, Trinidad, etc.), the core of this project is the Creole (African/European) mix of her native island. The moods of her music keep changing: ballads, sophisticated samba, dancable carnival music - back and forth.
