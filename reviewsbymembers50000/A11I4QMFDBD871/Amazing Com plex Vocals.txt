 Eva Ayllon's vocals are nothing short of amazing: her songs focus on the coastal plains of Lima, she can sing the lando, festejo, and val styles with equal fervor, and the range of influences varies from Andean to African - with everything in between. Ayllon specializes in complex syncopated beats and interactions between voice and instrumentals - an almost jazzy background offers uniquely Peruvian embellishments and a recording replete with dance beats from Caribbean influences.
