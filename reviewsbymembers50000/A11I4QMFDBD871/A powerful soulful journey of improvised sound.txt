 FARAI: HIGH ENERGY JITI is a hit in just the opposite direction: where MATARE encouraged relaxation and mellowing out, FARAI is a 'get up and dance' album somewhat reminiscent of the Bundu Boys, but not as dominated by electric guitars - though there is a lead and bass guitar. Strangely, there are no mbira players on FARAI: even Virginia Mukwesha confines herself to hosho (rattle) and vocals. To separate this group from other guitar-oriented jit groups, there are two marimba players: one a sporano marimba, the other an alto. There are also six female vocalists, plus Virginia Mukwesha: a male vocalist doubles on percussion and there is a (full kit) drummer. Few recording artists anywhere in the world would have the courage to show two such different sides to their musical personalities such as Virginia Mukwesha shows on these two radically different recordings.
