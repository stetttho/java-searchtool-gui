 Here's the supreme cross-over cd: a collection of reggae artists who tackle Bob Dylan standards. Imagine 'The Times they Are A-Changin' with a reggae beat, or 'Maggie's Farm' sung by the gravelly voice of  Toots Hibbert!  IS IT ROLLING, BOB? is reggae at its best: 1970s style, the height of  the movement's technical accuracy, with the Dylan theme providing a diversity of classics with quite a new edge.
