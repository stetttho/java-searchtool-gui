 MIKE MARSHALL & CHORO FAMOSO is gentle but danceable Brazilian music that harkens back to the 1940s when Jacob Dobandolin was giving Django Reinhardt a run for his money (albeit playing mandolin.) Some would describe this music as 'soft jazz', others as 'new acoustic music': both descriptions would be right, even though some of the tunes are over fifty years old.
