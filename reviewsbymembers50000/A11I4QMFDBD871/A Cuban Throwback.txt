 The big '59 Cadillac tailfin on the cover of MAMBO SINUENDO should have been a hint: though mostly recorded in Havana Cuba, this is not another Buena Vista Social Club-type recording, though a few tunes hint at that. What MAMBO SINUENDO is, actually, is something of  a throwback to the 'exotica' records of the 1950s and 60s. Some Latin percussion and rhythms are coupled to Hawaiian sounds: throw in surf guitar and you have a great 'lounge' recording to contribute to the mood.
