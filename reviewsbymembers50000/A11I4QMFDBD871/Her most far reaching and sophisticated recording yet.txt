  In what might be her most far-reaching and sophisticated recording yet, Miriam Makeba reaches way back to the 1950s, and all the decades in between, re-recording some of her biggest hits and mixing them into an international stew of lovely, well-written songs that show off as never before just what a great singer she truly is with REFLECTIONS.  The arrangements are slick, but only occasionally too slick for my taste (i.e. violins on the fadeout to a Mbaquanga song).
