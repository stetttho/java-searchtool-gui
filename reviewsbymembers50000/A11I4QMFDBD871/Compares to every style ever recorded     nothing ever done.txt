  A jet-powered trip around the world, rootsy folk traditions blended (or is it jammed?) together with pop, electro-disco, jazz, psychedelic and classical traditions - including spoken word, mellow rap, and idealistic 'save the world' sociological commentary: that's 1GIANT LEAP in a large nutshell. 1GIANT LEAP compares to every style ever recorded - and nothing ever done before. Beat Poetry? Beatles? Youssou N'Dour plus George Harrison channels Ravi Shankar? 1GIANT LEAP defies easy categorization - and challenges the imagination. All this - and if you want, there's a DVD supporting the music, of the same title.
