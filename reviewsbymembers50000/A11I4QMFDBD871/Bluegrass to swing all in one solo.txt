 Acoustic guitarist Ricardo Silveira and pianist Luiz Avellar along with percussionist Robertinho Silva are quite qualified to play and interpret the songs of Milton Nascimento, as at various times they have all been members of his band. How appropriate, then, that the opening tune on their live concert album PLAY THE MUSIC OF MILTON NICASIMENTO which honors the great composer should be by his own favorite composers Lennon & McCartney - beautifully redone.  Silveria's guitar-picking attack can go from a country bluegrass intensity to a Wes Montgomery swing  - all in less than the breath of one solo.
