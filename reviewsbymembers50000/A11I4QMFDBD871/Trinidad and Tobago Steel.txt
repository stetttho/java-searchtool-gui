 Part of Delos's 'Caribbean Carnival Series' is this lively collection of steelband traditions from Trinidad and Tobago alone, STEELBANDS OF TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO: unusual among the wealth of group-specific recordings or those which embrace the entire Caribbean. Surprise: there are no liner notes of band history - but a fine essay on how to build a steel pan drum.
