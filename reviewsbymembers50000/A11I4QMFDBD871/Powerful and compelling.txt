 The percussive rhythms of CANDOMBE are powerful and compelling, and the satisfying complexity doesn't stop with drums, but is enhanced by numerous vocalists and a large 'big band' feel produced by the interactions of many musicians. CANDOMBE offers lovely songs, outstanding choral effects and works unparalleled in both depth and technical complexity.
