 Take an African beat, blend it with religious songs of praise, and add a choral backup and you have Chuks Ofojebe's JESUS IN AFRICA, a lively and uplifting praise album sung in English but strong in African rhythms and roots. Evangelist Ofojebe is an innovative African gospel artist with influences ranging from Johnny Clegg and Ladysmith Black Mombazo to King Sunny - and it shows. Criss-crossing between American gospel and black African roots, move from the inspired title song to African changing in 'Oh Come' to the driving soca-enhanced 'Why Not Praise the Lord'. JESUS IN AFRICA was recorded in Nigeria, but its message and beats are the heartbeat of religion - and all of Africa.
