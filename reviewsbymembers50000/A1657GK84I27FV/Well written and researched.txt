 When I went to Yellowsone N.P. and was researching the Archives there the librarian there said that they consider this book the most complete and accurate account of the history of the park. I liked it because it was well written and nicely illustrated, making it not just a good reference, but enjoyable to read as well.  This park is truly a unique place and the first of a most wonderful concept.  If you have any intrest in Yellowstone, or plan to travel there, this book will provide some rich history you should not miss.
