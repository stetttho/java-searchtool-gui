 Anyone with a speck of curiosity  will find this book fascinating.  The breadth and depth is truly amazing.  Topics include natural history, the human body, geology, physics, airplane and ship technology, and sports, just to name a few. The  illustrations and photographs are numerous on almost every page and are extremely well done, to say the least.  I consider myself fairly well versed in science and technology, but this book never seems to quit surprising me with details of so many wonderful subjects.  The information is presented in a unique way that makes it easy to understand and holds your interest.  How did they build the Opera House in Sydney, Australia?  What exactly are all of the parts of a modern bike called? How is Cricket played?   All this and about 600 pages of other spellbinding information are included here.  Great for adults and the best  introduction to science and technology for children I know of.   It could easily take the place of many of other reference books I have accumulated.  I am at a loss to think of something negative to say about the book.
