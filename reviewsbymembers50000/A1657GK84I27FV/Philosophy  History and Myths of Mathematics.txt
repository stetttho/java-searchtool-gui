 The Mathematical Experience by Philip J. Davis and Reuben Hersh 1981 Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston    Is all of pure mathematics a meaningless game? What are the contradictions that upset the very foundations of mathematics? If a can of tuna cost $1.05 how much does two cans of tuna cost (Pg. 71)?  If you think you know the answer, don't be so sure.  How old are the oldest mathematical tables? What is mathematics anyway, and why does it work?  Can anyone prove that 1 + 1 = 2?    This is a book about the history and philosophy of mathematics. I'm certainly not a mathematician, and there are parts of the book I will never understand, yet the balance of it made the experience well worth while.  The authors presented the material so that it is interesting and (mostly) easily understood.  They have a creative way of making a difficult subject exciting. They do this by giving us insights into how mathematicians work and create.  They live up to the title making mathematics a human experience by adding fascinating history.  Frankly I was shocked when they pointing out how even mathematicians have made questionable assumptions and taken some basic "truths" on faith.  They show the beauty of math in the "Aesthetic Component" chapter. Ultimately the question that comes up again and again is the question of whether or not we can really know anything about time and space independent of our own experience to make an adequate foundation for a complete system in mathematics.   If you have ever wondered about the world of mathematics and the personalities involved you might consider this book.  If you are a mathematics teacher you should read this book.   If you are a mathematician you could find it quite unsettling.    It contains eight chapters, each one broken up into many subtitles so if you do get bogged down in the mathematics it isn't for long. There are 440 pages.  I'd like to see a much more complete glossary for people like me who need it.
