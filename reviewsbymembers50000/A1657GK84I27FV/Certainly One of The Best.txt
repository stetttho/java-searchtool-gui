 Certainly this is one of the best references for alpine style mountaineering.  It is used in our local college Basic Mountaineering class as the text and answers almost all the questions students have. I have had several editons and I am happy to say that they have updated technique and equipment descriptions in the new edition.  While different climbers may have different opinions about how things "should" be done, this book does an excellent job of recommending efficient and safe basic mountaineering techniques. After more years of mountaineering than I care to admit to, I still occasionally find something in this book that I can benefit from. Certainly a must for people getting in to mountaineering.
