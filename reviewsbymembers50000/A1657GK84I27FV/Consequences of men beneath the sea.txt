 Hans Hass is every bit the pioneer of self contained breathing apparatus as Captain Cousteau. His vision and exploration of the underwater world are breath taking, even today. He describes the mysteries of the sea and especially the consequences of mans intrusion into the sea. Much of the book deals with the history of  inovations that make diving what it is today.  I have read several books on the subject and find much in this book original and very different. For example, there is a discussion of a 1971  attempt to dive beyond the 270 foot record on air, and a fairly detailed description of Peter Small and Hannes Kellers 1000  foot dive in 1965.  Hunting u/w and treasure hunting, sharks and dolfins, law u/w are also discussed, among other things.  But I think it is the facinating history of diving that this book does so well that makes it unique and valubale to a person interested in diving or adventure.  An older book, but the ideas should never be out of date and some of his ideas were well in advance of his time. Dozens of photographs and some cute drawings and some historical reproductions of drawings. Good index and complete Bibliography.
