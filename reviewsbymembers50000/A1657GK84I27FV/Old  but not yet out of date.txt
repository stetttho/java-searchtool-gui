 I found this book informative and useful.  Although materials have changed, techniques and appreciation of the wilderness have not.  Raymond Bridge is right on when he explains how to camp and cook and travel in snow.  He has accurate and timless information on how to sleep warm when it is very cold outside. The chapter on safety including avalanche information is accurate and unchanged. Other subjects include things like solo travel, pace, planning a trip, finding your way, storms, making your own equipment and a checklist of equipment to take.  It was a pleasure to read this and see how accurate it still is.  It is not much different than recent books on the subject, with the hype about so-called breathable/waterproof materials left out. Worth having in your library if you can find a copy.
