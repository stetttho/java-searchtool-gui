 Because of the majestic photos and wonderful stories I think this is a superb book.  It also explains the techniques used by those on the leading edge of the sport. Although the climbing doesn't remotely look like anything I will ever be capable of, I found it most enjoyable to see how, and in some ways, why, these people climb what they do.  I have never seen any book quite like it.  Extreme indeed!
