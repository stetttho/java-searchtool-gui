 This book starts by giving you an exam and rates your experience. Don't be discouraged by the exam, it isn't valid and I doubt it is reliable. Nevertheless, Marshall has some great technical information on all sorts of things to consider when you select a boat.  Best of all he has a spread sheet of statistics on a large number of production boats.  Selecting a boat is much of the fun of owning a boat and this book helps with the fun. The information doesn't seem to be unique, but it is well enough presented to make it worth while looking at, especially if you are new to sailing.
