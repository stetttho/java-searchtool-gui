 I have done about 80 hikes or climbs in the Olympics in the past two years.  I think every description I have used in this book has been accurate.  It includes some handy small scale maps as well.  The Olympics is one of the best places to hike, winter or summer, and Woods is certainly the expert on the hikes and the history.  A must for anyone who is even considering a hike of any length in the Olympics.  Like one other reviewer implied, this book is way beyond the simple hike books that simply describe the popular hikes. Add this book to "Climber's Guide to the Olympic Mountains" by the Olympic Mountain Rescue and you will have everything you need to explore the Olympic Mountains on foot.
