 The author has simplified drawing the human figure by eliminating real anatomy. While perhaps this might suit beginners or children, I believe too much is left out to be helpful to the serious artist.  For example there is almost nothing on musculature.  The drawings are quite crude.  The author claims that he makes the body mechanics "simple and sensible".   It would be nice if body mechanics were that simple, but unfortunately they are not. In my opinion there are many very good books written for artists on this subject. This doesn't happen to be one of them.
