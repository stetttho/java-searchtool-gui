 Colin Fletcher had a simple solution to the tedium of civilized live.  He simply decided to walk the length of California from south to north.  Including the Mojave Desert and Death Valley. He doesn't miss anything.  He recorded the signts, sounds, people and his successes, failures and fears in wonderful detail. He found the purpose of the walk as he went along.  The desert revealed its secrets to this man who took the time to experience the place on foot.  Fishing in a creek, or climbing a mountain, or sleeping under the stars, Fletcher makes you feel as if you were there with him.  A great writer and explorer, Fletcher is a joy to read.  I have read most if not all of his books and this is perhaps the best.  Whether you wander on foot or in you mind, you will, I think, love this book.
