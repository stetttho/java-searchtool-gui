 Written in 1963, but timeless in its insights into human nature.  The very best science fiction turns its focus to an alien place or time and shows how strange and even bizzare their customs and emotions are. And in the end we realize how much we share these traits.  Boulle does all of that in spades.  He also just happens to write well.  It is enjoyable to read and says something about our ethics and evolution.  It is a relatively short book in the number of pages, but long on edification.  The premise is absurd, but you will almost believe it because of how Boulle explains and describes each situation so clearly. A classic by any standard.
