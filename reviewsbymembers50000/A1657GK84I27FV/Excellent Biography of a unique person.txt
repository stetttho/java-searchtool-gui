 I think that to appreciate fine art you must know the artist.  This book is a biography of Frank Herbert written by his son, Brian Herbert.  Frank Herbert was best known for his Dune chronicles, but also wrote many other books including nonfiction and was a newspaper journalist for many years. Brian Herbert did a worthy job of providing vivid details about growing up with his father Frank Herbert.  Frank Herbert was a rare science fiction writer who understood how to write about possible futures and hold the reader's interest.  Brian Herbert follows closely on the heels of his father and writes an interesting and detailed biography.  Frank Herbert, a highly acclaimed author, and justifiably so, had the ability to look beyond old habits, myths and superstition to go past the limits most people set for themselves.  The book contains a medley of fascinating anecdotes as well as thoroughly researched accounts of the successes and failures of Frank Herbert.  I especially liked the descriptions of how Frank Herbert worked at writing and how unbelievably energetic and exuberant he was in the many years before he was finally so very successful. The book is also a very personal and touching story of Brian's relationship with his father. Frank Herbert died in 1986, but we are still blessed with his literary work.  I feel I can better understand his work having read this biography.
