 Colin Fletcher managed to escape civilization with a simple plan.  He would walk the length of California, including the Mojave Desert.  The Ranger in Death Valley worried a great deal about him, but Fletcher's knowledge and understanding of the environment kept him safe and alive. In fact he enjoyed the "walk".  Colin Fletcher is an excellent writer and this book is, in my opinin, is one of his best. I think I have read them all.  He notices and describes details in vivid language. The clouds, the wind, the color of the valley, the trout, even the beetles and spiders don't miss his eye or nose.  He also describes the details of his hardships and joys, equipment failures and successes. He makes you feel as if you are with him on the trip, and often you may wish you were there. Some very well composed pictures are included. The trip took exactly 6 months. In the end he says "Then I walked down through the trees toward the road that would take me back to San Francisco and everything the city now offered."     I recommend the book to anyone.  It is a good story, great adventure, and written by an unusual person. (He would like being called "unusual", I think.)
