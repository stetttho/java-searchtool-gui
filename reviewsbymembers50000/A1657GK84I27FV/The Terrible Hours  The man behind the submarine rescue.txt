 I see a lot of glowing reviews here.  I'll add another. It is difficult to exaggerate how interesting and exciting history can be when it is written like this.  Mass knows his subject but more importantly he knows how to stir our imagination.  He has combined diving, submarines, and some vivid characters in a ture story more extraordinary than most fiction. The sinking of the SQUALUS in 1939, the rescure of the crew, diving operations, and her eventful salvage were all fraught with danger.  Mass covers it all from begining to end. Accruate and poetic.
