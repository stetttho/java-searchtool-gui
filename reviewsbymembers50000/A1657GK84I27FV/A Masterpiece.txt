 This volume is impressive. Certainly an unparalleled achievement in diving manuals.  I can't claim to have read it completely, that will take a while, but it is obviously a very complete treatment of applied diving technology.  It is well organized, well written and very well thought out. Many changes from earlier editions, with up to date information on highly technical subjects. Also clear explinations of the basics: Physics, physiology, first aid and such. It is certainly for the serious reader, miles beyond the basic SCUBA manuals. It covers diving operations from an planning viewpoint also. It is the accumulation of the work of many of the most athoritative people in the field. I work as a volunteer at the Navy Undersea Library at Keport WA where there are hundreds of books and manuals on diving technology. This one certainly stands out as a remarkable tome on the subject.
