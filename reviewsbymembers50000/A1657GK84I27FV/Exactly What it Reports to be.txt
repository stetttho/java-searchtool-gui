 McKinney's book is exactly what it says.  A very good guide to day hiking in the Desert Parks of California.  Some are easy hikes, some very difficult, most somewhere between.  Mckinney does a very good job of describing the highlights, terrain, difficulty, and warnings, as necessary. He points out that if you are not familiar with the desert there is much more to it than you might expect. The maps in the book are adequate. There are some pictures. There is an instructive introduction to hiking in the desert. The book is easy to read, well researched, and covers some very interesting areas; geologically and historically interesting. A good resource for anyone interested in the California Desert.  A must for any hiker interested in the California Desert.
