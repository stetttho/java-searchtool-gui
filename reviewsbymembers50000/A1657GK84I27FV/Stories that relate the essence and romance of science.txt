  When science is written about it can be dull or it can be a mysterious, and fascinating subject that has a special appeal. Carl Sagen certainly had a rare ability to deliver the latter.  The book is a series of short stories, but they blend togetheer in a strangely beautiful way.  There seems to be a philosophic perspective throughout the book that is there, but elusive.  The essence of science, not just scientific method, is a wonderful thing that you will get a glimps of here, many times. Most people don't think of science as something adventurous or heroic, but it is and you can read it, indeed feel it, in these stories.  I highly recommend the book to any thinking person concerned with or interested in science. Fun as well as edifying. Some history of science, some astronomy, a personal view of science fiction (by a master), the future of science, questions and paradoxes and more are covered, to some extent.
