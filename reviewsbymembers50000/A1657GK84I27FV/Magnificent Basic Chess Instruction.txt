 There are one zillion books on chess. This is one of those. It is written in a style that is easy to follow.  It uses the new algebraic grid method for identifying positions on the board. That immediately makes it better than all those that use the old method. The narrative descriptions are well written and hold one's interest.  No book on chess is exhaustive, he points out, but this book does cover strategy well for the adult beginner at least.  If you read and understand it you will be well ahead of a beginner.  I recommend it if you are interested in chess at all.  The diagams are well done and frequent.  The analysis of various moves is easy to follow and insightful.  It would stand alone if it is the only chess book you read and it would be well worth having in you  chess library if you have several chess books. Bruce Pandolfini does a much better than average job of offering the elements and the generalizations of good chess strategy. Well organized.  Adequate Glossary and index.
