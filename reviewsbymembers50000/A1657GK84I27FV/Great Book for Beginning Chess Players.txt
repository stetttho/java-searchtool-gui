 James Eade is a chess master and understands the game and explains it well.  I read two chess books before this one and looked through a few more.  Because he explains each move with a picture of the board it is easy to understand.  All other authors seem to show the initial picture of the setup then go to algebraic notation to explain the moves.  I don't think I like the name.  "Dummies" implies it is for stupid people, which it is not.  Get the Oxford Chess Companion if you want to impress your friends.  Get Chess for Dummies if you want an excellent reference for all parts of the game. Eade doesn't try to snow you with complex terms like adjudication, Zwischenzug, and fianchetto, but does explain them and does have a nice glossary of chess terms in the back of the book.  If you don't buy it, check it out at the library.  I think you will find it useful, unless you are already an accomplished player and have read and understood more advanced books.
