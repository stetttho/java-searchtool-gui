 This is a magazine that is well respected for its high quality articles that cover current science and technology.  Given the popular media's trend to sensationalize the news it is a breath of fresh air.  Scientific American articles are usually written in such a way that people with only a very basic background in science can understand them.  Articles are often written by leaders in the field being discussed.  Although it was started in 1845 I have only been reading Scientific American for about 50 years.  It has added greatly to my education in science and technology, moreover it has been a joy to read.
