 The author's experience in long distance backpacking is obvious when he shares his knowledge in an honest and enlightening way. The section on inspiration and reality is well worth reading. He gives a nice little description of the long trails, with his comments and experiences.  His food choices and ideas alone make the book worth the price.  He includes the best description of chemical purification I have seen in some time. He covers boot fitting (one of the most important items, I think, in backpacking) like no one else I have ever read. Not a rehash of what has already been written (I admit I haven't read his other books), but some critical and important original views on the subject.  This book delivers excellent information for the long-distance hiker.
