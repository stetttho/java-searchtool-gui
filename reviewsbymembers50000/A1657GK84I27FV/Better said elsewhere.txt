 I thought this was mostly a rehash of what has been said better elsewhere.  It is not as complete as Ray Jardine's Beyond Backpacking. Not as well researched as Colin Fletchers Complete Walker.  I thought Kestenbaum didn't have much to add and his opinions were just that, his opinions.  Chris Townsend's book, The Advanced Backpacker, (oddly by the same publisher)is much better and seems to come from someone who benefited much more from his experiences.   There were some nice pictures and descriptions of gear, but then I can find that in my REI catalog! I also liked the picture on the cover.  Save your money and purchase Jardine's book for ultralight, or Chris Townsend's book on long-distance hiking.  If you are interested in Mountaineering get Mountaineering:Freedom of the Hills.  I don't recommend this book.
