 Horie if nothing else certainly has a sense of adventure.  This book is about his 94 day trip from Japan to San Francisco in a 19 foot plywood sailboat.  The writing is not entirely smooth, perhaps something was lost in the transulation. Nevertheless, it is honestly written and he does have a sense of humor. There are lots of amateur photographs.  There are some very good charts and several pages of detailed drawings of the boat ("Mermaid"). Good appendices on sailing and such.  An accurate, almost day by day, account of a very daring undertaking.  If you like true adventure stories you will probably like this one.
