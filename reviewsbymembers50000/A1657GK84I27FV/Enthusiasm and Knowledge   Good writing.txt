 If there were 6 stars, that is what I would give this book. I read the other reviews after I had written mine and oddly (or perhaps not oddly) they seemed similar. Oh well. I was very interested in how this book would be revised to cover this quickly growing and changing subject. How do you take the overwhelming explosion of products and ideas about backpacking that have developed over the last decades and try to write about them?  Well, Fletcher and Rawlins start by discussing that very subject.  How do you keep 845 pages on gear and technique from being a long pedestrian trudge?   I'm not sure, but somehow they combined personal experiences, wry humor and charming illustrations to do so.  The book abounds with illustrations that are as beautiful as they are functional.  Mostly though, they used their own unique writing styles to accomplish the task and completed a remarkable compilation of facts about backpacking gear and technique that reads like a novel.  The two authors take turns writing about each subject, sometimes each idea.  They seem to have similar philosophies (e.g., get out and do it, and gear is only a means to that end) yet the juxtaposing of ideas gives the book a fresh, and I think, healthy flavor.  With many fine (and some not-fine) books available on the subject they still managed to write a remarkable, complete, and interesting book that is not just a rehash of what has already been said.  Some of  (the late) Vanna Price's familiar illustrations from the original edition again bring the subject to life.  There is also some of the original text where appropriate.  Hannah Hinchman's illustrations do a nice job of taking up where Vanna Price left off.  More than just a "how to" book, the authors have managed to embrace "why to" appreciate the wilderness on foot.  Reviewers often say things like "nothing comparable" or "Without a doubt a classic".  This time it might be true.
