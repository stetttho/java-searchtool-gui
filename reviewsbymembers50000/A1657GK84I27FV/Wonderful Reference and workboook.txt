 If you are interested in drawing the human form this book, in my humble opinion, is not only a wonderful place to start, but also an excellent reference and workbook to practice drawing from. It covers Arm, hand, leg, foot, torso, neck, head, and builds up each part from bone to full surface anatomy from several views and several positions (flexed, relaxed, turned in or out, etc.). The complete figure is covered in the last chapter.  A bargin at twice the price!
