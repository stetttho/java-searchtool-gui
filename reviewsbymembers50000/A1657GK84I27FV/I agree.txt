 I agree with all the 5-star ratings here.  Ray Jardine has used his experience, education, and logical mind to improve on (by most often simplifying) equipment, technique, and I dare say the philosophy of backpacking.  I may never be an ultralight backpacker, but this book lightened my pack by 20 pounds!   ...and for that it was most valuable.  Many "myths" of backing are debunked in this book.  He carefully looks at the advantages and disadvantages of each piece of equipment and how it relates to the goals of the journey. Just for example: tarps vs. tents. I particularly enjoyed his reasons for "stealth" camping.  He deals frankly with the bear and cougar issues and personal safety. I especially liked the section on sewing your own gear.
