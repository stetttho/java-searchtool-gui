 Although Cousteaus arn't marine biologists, the book does a fine job of describing their adventures underwater with sharks.   Some of the stories depict courageous acts and an enthusiasm for underwater adventure that make the book engaging.  There has been better and more scientific studies more recently on sharks of course, but this book is worth having in you library if you are interested in the subject. The illustrations by Jean-charles Roux are excellent.  The photographs are good.  This book is also certainly a history too: a history of the popularization of our excursion into the underwater world by the Custeaus. Not a five star because it is dated, but five star in most other respects. If you were to collect the whole collection I would think it would be quite a good set at that.
