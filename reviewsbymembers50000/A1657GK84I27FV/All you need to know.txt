 This is a neat little book with lots of wisdom Gustafson apparently learned through experience.  Some "how to buy a sailboat" books seem to be written by naval architects or good writers with limited experience. But this one combines experience with science.  I have quite a few years experience sailing all sorts of boats in several locations and have owned several boats, but I still found myself taking notes while I read the book.  You will too, I think, enjoy this little masterpiece. When purchasing or researching a sailboat to purchace this book will save you time and help you make an informed decision.
