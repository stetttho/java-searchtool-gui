 This is a guide book for diving the Puget Sound (Seattle area and more), the San Juan Islands, and British Columbia (Vancouver, Victoria and More).  Each site includes Skill level, Why go, Access, Bottom and depths, hazards, Facilities and other comments.  Also each has a map, and some sort of photo (surface or U/W).  The maps are just NOAA duplications and I would think they would be better in a larger scale.  Overall you can't really miss with this book.  It has 141 good ideas about where you might try diving in the Northwest.  Some of the information may be a little dated now, but I can't find many examples of that. I am also not sure how this book meshes with her other books that seem to be more specifically aimed at individual areas: that is, more narrowly focused.  Good book, well worth the price for any northwest diver.
