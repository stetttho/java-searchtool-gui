 This book is exactly what it says.  It is like a Handbook of Physics for diving.  You remember how you had to learn about pressure and volume and temperature relationships in you basic diving class?  This book expands on those subjects and many others many fold.  Also chapters on decompression calculations, salvage calcs, air supply calcs, waves, current, light and sound underwater.  I have no idea how so much data could be fit into 182 pages, but Tucker seems to have done it.  Obviously a knowledgable person, also a good writer.  Well explained and wirtten, accurate and well illustrated.  Mostly technical reference data, but if you are a diver I promise you won't fall asleep reading this.
