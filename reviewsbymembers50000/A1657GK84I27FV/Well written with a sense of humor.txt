 There is a special quality in Tom Cuthbertson's sense of humor.  My wife bought me this book many years ago and it is well smuged with greasy finger prints: a good sign for any bicycle maintenance manual.  The illustrations by Rick Morrall are very special too. I enjoy this book because of the clever words and pictures, but I also find myself referring back to it frequently, even though I have exactly three other more recent bicycle maintenance/repair manuals. I just repalaced my front wheel bearings and had to laugh when I read "Hold the right end of the axle in the hub so the bearings on that side won't jump out and run away...." and later, "Get extra ball bearings for the ones that will run away and hide." In the book there are many very accurate warnings and personal advice that most manuals seem to leave out.  This is an exceptionally good manual because it explains the details of each operation and the little problems you might encounter.  I guess most manuals assume some experience, but Cuthbertson gives you all the info you need, even if you have never even changed a tire. So if you can find a copy, you will enjoy reading it (yes, reading it is enjoyable  and edifying even if you don't have any pressing maintenance/repair jobs to do). Five stars based on originality, usefullness, and splendid writing.
