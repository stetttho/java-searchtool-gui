 To say that this book can change your life might seem like hyperbole.  Yet this book teaches you to make decisions in a way that certainly can change your life.  It is so much more than time management, it is a practical approach to psychology, philosophy and business.  It is a well written book, to the point and interesting.  There is so much in this little book that it is difficult to summarize.  The Contents pages shown on this site give you a good idea of what Lakein covers so very well.  This book isn't just for professional people or business people, but for everyone who wants to live a rewarding life. I highly recommend it to all my friends and employees.
