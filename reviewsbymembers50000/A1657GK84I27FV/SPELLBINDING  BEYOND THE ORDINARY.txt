 I try to avoid this platitude, but I could hardly put this book down.  Among the many Mt. Everest tomes I have read this one is truly remarkable.  This is an honest account of a monumental achievement in the face of enormous emotional, cultural and physical barriers.  This exceptional person with an exceptional dream somehow found the ambition, skill and opportunity to achieve what no other American woman had done.  She walked alone onto the highest summit in the world. But not without facing failures in the process.  To simply say it took courage and ambition is an understatement.  Yet, in her words, the summit itself was ephemeral and gone in an instant. It is apparent that in the end what is important to Stacy Allison is the pleasure of living and experiencing. Climbing is just her means of doing that. Her message is, "Look beyond the ordinary.  There is always something more." I highly recommend this book.  It is a great story and well written by Stacy Allison and Peter Carlin.
