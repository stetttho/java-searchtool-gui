 Doulis takes on his vacation to Italy and in the process discusses bonds with his friend who is putting a barrier coat on the bottom of his fiberglass sailboat in a boat yard protected by the Mafia. The information on bonds, and the boat incidentally, seem very accurate.  These are complex subjects and the explanations of the intricacies are excellent. For example, he uses graphs and text to explain how return on bonds are a function of interest rates. He explains some weaknesses in the way equities (ie, stocks) are sold to the public, and how the yield on stocks is not always what it is seems to be.  I'm not certain, but I think he may imply at one point that you can avoid paying income taxes by having money in forien banks. (Hmmm...)   My dissappointment came at the end of the book. I would have liked more information on mutual funds that invest exclusively in bonds.  I expected him to show us, based on our individual risk tolerance and goals, how to best invest in bonds or bond funds. I had hoped he might even mention some bond funds he liked. Perhaps he believes you should make that decision on you own, but I came away without any inkling of a strategy or direction for investing. I also wonder why anyone would take the gel coat off of a perfectly good boat bottom and replace it with a prophylactic barrier coat.
