 I need not repeat all the good things that has been said about this book in the other many positive reviews, about how it works, how well wirtten it is, or how easy the Zone plan is to follow.  What I would like to say here is how pleased I am that Barry Sears uses scientific evidence and knowledge to come to his conclusions.  While many diet books seem logical, few others, if any, are based on good science.  This is a unique and facinating explination of why we are eating the wrong things. Unlike Dr. Phil and other popular snake oil salesman, this is based on Barry Sears' extensive medical and biochemistry background. It would be reductive to say much more.  Read the book and I think you will like it.  It just may change your life for the better. (And I don't say that lightly).
