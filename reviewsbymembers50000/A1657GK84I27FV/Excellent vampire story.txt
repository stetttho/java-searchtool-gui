 I'm not familiar with vampires or should I say books about them.  However anyone can enjoy this delightful book about Desidra the vampire who helps out the USA in WW II.  The story starts in Seattle and she serves as a code breaker in Anchorage, AK and "travels" to Japan.  There is romance and intrigue. In the end you will have to decide who is more thirsty for blood and territory, humans at war or vampires? The plot is good, the descriptions and dialogue are believable and the historical and cultural facts seem well researched.  Brian Herbert is best known for his Dune prequels, not vampire novels, but he and Marie Landis produced this most enjoyable little story and I think it is a jewel.
