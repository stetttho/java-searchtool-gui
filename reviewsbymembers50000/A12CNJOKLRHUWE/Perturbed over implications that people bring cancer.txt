 I'm guilty and hesitant about not raving about this book.  Bernie so obviously loves his exceptional patients and has done so much to highlight the importance of love as a part of healing. I do not agree with the  chapter that talks about the cancer personality.  The cancer personality is  one theory -- there are many theories about cancer.   This book simply  lays a guilt trip on someone if they don't view cancer as the greatest  opportunity to change their life for the better.  If one practiced the  visualizing and the drawing and the proactive working with physicians, and  still didn't go into remission/cure, wouldn't one feel like a failure?   First you have a cancer personality; second, you died without changing it.
