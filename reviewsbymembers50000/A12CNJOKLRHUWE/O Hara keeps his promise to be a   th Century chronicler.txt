 John O'Hara once said that one of his driving instincts in writing was to chronicle the first half of the 20th Century.  A great deal of his large body of work does just this. "From the Terrace" is not only one  of his best novels, but is sound history as well.  We are introduced to  poor Alfred Eaton who overcomes a bad childhood to become a success as an  adult to become .... perhaps what he was meant to be all along.  It's part  Man in a Gray Flannel Suit and part Greek Tragedy.  As to what it  chronicles: the old boy WASP network of prep school / Harvard or Yale or  Princeton / club life.  One's early life provides networking forever for  the fortunate upper class white male in that upper class.  One sees how  these same males get tapped during WW2 to fill the better positions opening  up in Washington thanks to the war effort.  O'Hara excels at the tiny  details that expand in your mind to tell an entire story.  His dialogue  (particularly between men and women) sounds true.  Given the time in which  he wrote, O'Hara got away with a lot of explicit sex.  The lead character commits adultery and is all the more happy for it.    If you've seen the  movie with Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, you should know that the book does not end with Paul Newman walking down a Manhattan street happy to  be able to marry his mistress.  In the book, he marries a second time, his  naval career ends, and he finds his life taking a new turn.
