 With  Butterfield 8, John O'Hara tells a great yarn.  You know Gloria is just  short of being a prostitute.  Yet one feels quite sympathetic for her.  I  like O'Hara's ability to preserve time periods through his writing.  (See  Appointment in Samarrra for PA).  In this novel, he has managed to preserve  what life in the 30's in Manahattan: nightclubbing all night, lots of booze  and sex and fun fun fun. Elizabeth Taylor starred as Gloria in the movie of  the same name.  I think the movie's ending is better than the book's  ending.
