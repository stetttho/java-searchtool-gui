 I make my own yogurt for a couple of reasons -- the store bought either has added sugar or added gelatin (frequently both) and is never made from cream or half-n-half.  I bought one in 1999 and used it weekly until it just died last month.  I bought a new one directly from eSalton for the same price I paid in '99 -- $14.99.   Homemade yogurt incubated longer than 24 hours is ideal for low carb diets because in 24 hours, the yogurt bacteria have devoured most of the sugar and there's far fewer carbs than grocery store yogurt.  If the unit is placed in darkness, the resulting yogurt is less tart tasting.   I have never liked the spoon-lid-container.  But the size allows one to make 5 cups at once rather than just 1 quart.   The self-storing cord is also a messy design -- there's not enough of a notch for the cord to stay in the same spot when in use.
