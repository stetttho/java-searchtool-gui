 This book is reminiscent of Dashiell's Hammett novels such as "Red Harvest" or "The Dain Curse."  Adjectives such as "hard-boiled" apply to the hero as well as the villains.  The  hero in Blue City (like Hammett's Continental Op) accomplish the impossible  because they have crossed over the line at times into murder.  Yet somehow  the hero is not corrupted even while living in the middle of corruption.   The style is choppy and the action is jumpy.  It makes one wish for  smoother connections between scenes.  The book is almost too abbreviated.   The characters are not developed beyond what is needed for the plot line.   As a result, everyone seems hard-nosed, cold-blooded and lacking in  humanity.
