 The movie is haunting and worthy of the Academy's attention.  Bruce Willis and Haley Joel are perfect for both the roles.  The movie is engrossing from the first and successfully carries one to the ending.  It is an  ususual mix of horror and tear-jerking.  I bought the DVD on purpose  because I like the DVD format with its Menu showing up first.  Then I can  fuss with settings etc if I like; watch the extras; and choose when to  start the movie.  I returned the DVD for exchange because I was certain it  was defective.  The second DVD behaved identically.  It's almost as though  the VHS version was dumped to DVD.  The Menu was not able to be shown  first.  First one went through the FBI warnings, then we were forced to  watch Previews, and then the movie started.  Only once the movie began, was  it possible to select Menu.  The DVD suddenly went blank at the end of  Chapter 10.  This happens each and every time.  One must forceably kick in  Chapter 11.  I returned the DVD and got a second brand new DVD.  It behaved  the same way. Something is wrong in how this DVD was programmed.
