 As we understand and come to address the many ways we have, as a society, excluded groups of people, we begin to include them in subtle ways.  For instance, as the women's movement took hold, female metaphors such as  "giving birth" began to show up when describing business  successes.  So too, it's the subtlety of having prayers that deliberately  protray inclusiveness that demonstrates society's movement towards  inclusiveness.  It also allows those that are traditionally excluded to  participate in sacred rites and feel a part.  The prayers are liturgical  and non-liturgical.  In phraseology and tone, they draw a great deal of  inspiration from the Jerusalem Bible.   Both authors have a deep religious  life background and the reverence shows in the prayers.
