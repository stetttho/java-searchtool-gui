 This was a complex movie requiring several viewings to unravel the clues and solve the puzzle.  The movie is more along the line of Blue Velvet rather than The Straight Story (both directed by David Lynch).  However, I found the DVD rather disappointing.  There was no way to access individual Chapters to go to exact sections of the movie.  It ran just like a VHS tape. To return to a spot, you must actually put the DVD on rewind.  Further the DVD has a bad flaw.  It stops suddenly after about 90 minutes.  Since there are no Chapters, it's not possible to simply jump to the next Chapter.  After much trial and error, we figured out we start the DVD from the beginning at fast speed until it fast forwarded past the stopped area.  I returned the DVD twice for a new copy; all 3 copies have this flaw, so it must have been manufactured that way.  The DVD is pricey and has no extras except for Cast bios.
