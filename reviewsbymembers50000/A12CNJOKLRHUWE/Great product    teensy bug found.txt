 I was really excited when I came across this item because I am a fan of John O'Hara and John O'Hara practically invented the New Yorker short story.  There are some O'Hara short stories that are only available in the New Yorker and until now, I could never find them.  The packaging is beautiful and they have taken the time to add a thick book with highlights.  It looks impressive.  The CDs are behind a cardboard page that looks like an old 33 1/3 record.  Nice touch.    It's easy to install (intuitive) and the search archives works pretty much as one would expect except for a small bug.  In typing "O'Hara", an error message is produced.  I tried it without the apostrophe and no match was found.  I went to Technical Support and discovered that my registration had not been saved on their database, so I had to re-register to ask my question.    Prior to getting an answer (minimum wait is 24 hours) I decided to try "Hara" and voila, John O'Hara showed up.  I am enjoying coming across unexpected treasures, such as the last short story from JD Salinger that has only been published in the New Yorker.  I tried printing and it works easily and intuitively as well.  A bargain given the amount of pleasure and entertainment it will provide.
