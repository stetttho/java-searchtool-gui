 Ross MacDonald is quite well known for his series of mysteries starring Lew Archer as the erstwhile detective.  In this kidnapping / murder mystery, the Lew Archer stand-in is a probation officer who admits he lives  on several sides at once.  This novel shares several themes with his Lew  Archer series.  One's past sins do come back to bite you; women inevitably  ruin their life with the wrong man; and an absent father will reappear in  one's life.  The dark atmosphere is also present in this novel.  It is a  very enjoyable read.  MacDonald has an excellent ear for dialogue and  detail.
