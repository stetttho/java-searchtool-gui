 Okay, I didn't really like Portnoy's Complaint either although I appreciate it as a coming of age type of novel.  This novel is like Portnoy grows old and still does disgusting things with his body fluids.  Even  worse, the plot dragged.  I feel as though I'm reading the reminiscences of  a stunted teenager who hasn't a clue that he's stunted.
