 I was 22 when this first came out and thought it was a very emotional and sensuous movie.  The ending produced a tremendous feeling of  sadness which stayed with me for years.  I recently saw it again.   Disappointingly it has one of the most erotic scenes edited.  The trick of  showing time passing by having a picture boat glide across a picture ocean  really seems corny.  For a better Sarah Miles movie which holds up for its  eroticism and story quality, I'd recommend "Ryan's Daughter".
