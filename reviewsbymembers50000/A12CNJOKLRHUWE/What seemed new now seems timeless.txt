 When this book was originally published,so many women benefitted from the simple concept of knowing what your best colors were and buying only those colors.  Once I knew I was a summer, I saved hours of shopping time because  now I knew what colors would look good.  I also understood why I always  felt great in ice pink:  it was a one of my colors and subconsciously I  felt more confident wearing it.  Frequently overlooked is the money saved  by NOT BUYING clothes that look good on the rack but don't look good on  you.  12 years later, the same colors still make me look good.  It's a  simply ingenious system.
