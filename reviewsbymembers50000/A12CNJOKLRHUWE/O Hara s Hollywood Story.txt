 John O'Hara wrote in several geographies: Gibbsville, PA; Manhattan, NY; and Hollywood.  The Big Laugh is one of his Hollywood novels.  In his entire body of work (and it is prodigious), I would put this in the bottom  25%.  It begins with a nobody forging a career in hollywood by blackmailing  the first person to give him an acting job.  A weak premise not usually  found in O'Hara's plots.  It ends with a twist -- hence the Big Laugh.   This is the type of novel that is only enjoyed by someone who is a diehard  fan of the author.  The plotting is weak; it's missing the dialogue and  little details that are a hallmark of O'Hara's outstanding work.
