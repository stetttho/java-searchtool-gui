 My family's first means of addressing medical problems is with homeopathy.  For some time now, I've been looking for a text book I can use to treat my own pets acute conditions using homeopathy.  This book is the one!  If you are not familiar with homeopathy, you'll like the first chapters which give an overview.  I especially appreciated the chapter on how to administer the remedies to pets.  With humans, it's a simple matter of placing the pellets, untouch by hands, under the tongue to disolve.  With pets, I really needed this chapter.  With homeopathy, it's important to differentiate under what conditions a remedy is chosen.  The book has a substantial portion devoted to this critical aspect of homeopathy.   Finally, I did not want to purchase a book that addressed all animals, so I appreciate the focus (as does my dog) on cats and dogs.   I noticed a lot of the reviewers were highlighting the sections on why not to vaccinate.  I rescued my dog from the shelter, so vaccination was a done deed.  I have used homeopathy to keep my dog much healthier than the average 15 year old senior dog citizen.
