 I just read the previous review and I find I like this book for all the opposite reasons.  I like this size.  It fits into my pocketbook ready to pull out any time I'm waiting.  I don't use pencils for puzzles, but I did try a pencil and agree that the pencil does not show up well.  I prefer a fine point ball point and this paper is good for it.  I like a paperback like this because I tear out the puzzles when they're complete and toss them.    As to the puzzles themselves:  they a nice size -- most are 30x35.  They're challenging without being impossible.  Very few are easy.
