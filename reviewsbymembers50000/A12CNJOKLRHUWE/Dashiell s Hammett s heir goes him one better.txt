 Ross MacDonald is usually compared to Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler.  However Lew Archer is never hard-bitten (despite hard-bitten experience) as Hammett and Chandler's detectives are.  In Lew Archer,  MacDonald creates a wholly sympathetic detective with loads of angst or  emotions more akin to Dave Robicheaux (James Lee Burke's detective).  That  is, his life is not just something he's surviving -- he is experiencing it.   There is violence, but the violence is secondary to the feelings and  atmosphere of the story.  It differs from an Agatha Christie mystery where  you come to admire her ability to fit a plot puzzle together.  With the  Drowning Pool, there is more a feeling that this is a tragedy rather than a  detective story.  The Drowning Pool shows themes that run throughout  MacDonald's mysteries -- multi-generational sins of the father being  visited upon the children, sincs with long roots and branches,  dysfunctional families.  MacDonald's talent lies in infusing his stories  with dark atmospheres that generally has not been translated well onto the  silver screen.  Paul Newman playing Lew Archer is much more light-hearted  than the book.  Melanie Griffith plays the seductive daughter in the movie.   I remember the first time I saw the movie that I was surprised that  Melanie's mother (whom I didn't know was Tippi Hedren at the time) would  allow her 14 year old to project such sexuality.  I don't think that  Melanie was acting the part because she went on to live with Don Johnson  shortly after the movie.
