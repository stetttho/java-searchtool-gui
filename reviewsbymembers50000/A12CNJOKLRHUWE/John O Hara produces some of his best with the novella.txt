 Sermons and Soda Water consists of 3 novellas which involve the same person -- James Mallory.  Mallory is thought to be the alter ego of O'Hara.  The first story "The Girl on the Baggage Truck" is a story of  the younger Mallory barely avoiding being pulled down by involvement with  an aspiring actress.  The second, my favorite, "Imagine Kissing  Pete" is the story of a bad marriage which goes good.  I'm surprised  no one ever made a movie of this one.  The final one is a story of  Mallory's senior years.  He meets up with an old friend he has gradually  moved away from, mainly due to the friend's marriage to a woman no one  likes.  Mallory is surprised to discover that his friend genuinely loved  his wife.  These stories remain popular because, like Appointment in  Samarra, they highlight O'Hara's ability with dialogue and the description.
