 Hellbox is a collection of 26 short stories.  John O'Hara defined the twentieth century short story.  This is one of his best collections consisting of stories for the most part published in The New Yorker from 1945 to 1947.  He gives a  glimpse and a memory into middle class white life, the things people  thought about, the things they fretted and aimed for.  It's the small  detail at times that frames the atmosphere of the story.  On the flyleaf,  there's a explanation that Hellbox is a printer's receptacle for broken  type.
