 Most of the reviews of this books are either 1* or 5* depending on whether one sees Dr. Bernstein as a crackpot or a savior.  I'd like to address the content of the book.   I rate this book high because it was well laid out  and easy to read.  It begins with a chemistry of digestion, laying the  groundwork for his theories.  It then goes into typical foods.  One is  provided with a clear simple list of no-no foods.  Then one is led into  sample menus so you can clearly see how flexible the diet is or is not.  There are several chapters specifically geared to unique situations. Then a  chapter with recipes. A couple of appendices. Simple -- logical -- clear.
