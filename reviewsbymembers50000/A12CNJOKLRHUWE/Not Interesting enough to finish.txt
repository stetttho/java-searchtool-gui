 This novel had a strong beginning -- even if somewhat implausible -- about an eccentric who is about to screw all of his heirs out of his billions and leave it to his unknown illegitimate daughter who has become a very holy  missionary. I got as far as the alcoholic lawyer (likeable, of course)  finding the missionary and finally turned to the end of the book to see if  my suspicions about the plot were confirmed. One question:  why were all  the heirs so stupid as to agree to such a huge contingency fee for the  lawyers?
