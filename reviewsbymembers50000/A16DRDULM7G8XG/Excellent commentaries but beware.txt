 The revised edition of Barclay's commentaries was issued in 1975 and was prepared not by William Barclay, but by the Rev. James Martin.  According to the introduction, the revised edition renews the printer's type,  restyles the books, corrects some errors in the text and removes some  references which have become outdated.  In addition, Biblical quotations in  the commentaries use the Revised Standard Version instead of the King James  Version (however Barclay's own translation is retained at the beginning of  each daily section).   The reality of the revised edition is quite  different.  What the introduction to the revised edition fails to mention  is that while the 17 volumes of the previous 2nd edition contains a total  of 5,195 pages, the revised edition prepared by Martin has only 4,541  pages, or a reduction of 12.6%.  The reduction is most noticeable in the 2  volumes on Revelation, which is reduced from 528 to 415 pages, a reduction  of 21.4%.  In Ephesians, the revised edition contains 30 fewer pages, a  reduction of 19.1% (157/127).  The Gospel of John is reduced by 87 pages, a  reduction of 13.7% (634/547).  In the commentary in Revelation 3:1-6  (Sardis: A Lifeless Church), well over 50% of the material written by  Barclay in the 2nd edition is removed by Martin in the revised edition.  I  first noticed this editing in the commentary in the Gospel of John 13:33-35  in which Jesus speaks of loving one another as he loved us.  In the 2nd  edition, Barclay so beautifully states the following: "He [Jesus] knew  all their [his disciples] weaknesses and yet He still loved them.  Those  who really love us are the people who know us at our worst and who still  love us."  However, these two sentences do not appear in Martin's  revised edition.  Repeatedly, key sentences and phrases are deleted from  the revised edition.         Therefore, the revised edition is in fact an  edited and condensed version of the commentaries actually written by  William Barclay. William Barclay's commentaries are the most insightful and  meaningful commentaries that I have ever read on the New Testament.   However, if you want to read what Barclay actually said instead of what  Martin thought was important enough to leave in, then check with a used  book store or do a used book search on the internet to get the 2nd editions  of these wonderful commentaries.
