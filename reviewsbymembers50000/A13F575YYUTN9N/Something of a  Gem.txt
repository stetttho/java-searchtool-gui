 Mary Chapin Carpenter is one of those uniquely wonderful singer-songwriters who reminds us that the key to emotionally evocative songwriting is not neccesarily found in poetic density. And like all great folk and country performers, Mary knows how to tell one hell of a story, aided by the warmth and distinctiveness of her vocals.  On "State of the Heart," Mary skillfully balances both her country and folk leanings. The album is fun, moving, cohesive and the perfect length. My personal favorite track is "This Shirt," in which Mary skillfully uses an article of clothing as a vehicle to explore not only several formative years of her life, but also the relationship which defined them.  Most definately priced to buy (I bought it off a sale rack for 9 bucks), there is little excuse for not owning this album.
