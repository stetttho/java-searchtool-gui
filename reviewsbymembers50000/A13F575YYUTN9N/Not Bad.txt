 The reviews are correct -- this is quite clearly not a "romantic comedy," but might be more accurately labeled as a comedic drama. The movie might be described as a super-glossy, Hollywoodized version of Love! Valour! Compassion! The bonds of friendship are the central theme of the film, and the explorations of said friendships are effective, if surface-level. Berlanti's Dawson's Creek connections show themselved, both through the characters' verbose self awareness and through emotionally manipulative melancholic music montages, two of which are backed by Dawson's Creek soundtrack regular Mary Beth Maziarz. (A master of deliciously depressing cover songs.)  The film draws upon the romantic comedy conventions of witty one liners and sappy, perfectly scripted dialogue to force us into caring about its characters, all of which have just enough depth to trick us into thinking they might actually be three dimensional. The characters' intertwining stories of love, loss and lust -- if   derivative -- are engrossing, and ultimately moving. I'll disagree with other reviewers in my assertion that Timothy Olyphant's character (I've forgotten his name -- I'll take a page from the Broken Hearts Club book and call him "Lead Guy") nicely pulls the friends' stories together w/ a character arc of sorts. His romance with Keegan's Kevin is sweetly, nicely, built, and his ultimate departure for Europe (in conjunction w/ John Mahoney's death and Blonde Guy's overdose) provides a well-timed -- if slightly forced -- culmination of the film's stories. The Broken Hearts Club is a sweet, engaging, film. And though mildly shallow, this is easily forgiven -- it is intended to be formulaic -- a neatly wrapped cinematic package.
