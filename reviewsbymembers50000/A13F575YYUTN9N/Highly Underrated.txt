 This genre-hopping album has been consistently bashed for its poor attempts at hip hop and its sophomoric lyrics. And unfortunately, this (...) Grammy nominated singer has mysteriously dissappeared since this album's release.  While it doesn't hit you with the initial impressive womp of "This Fire" this album has a great deal to offer. You grow into its moody mellowness like a comfortable glove. Paula effectively hops from blues mama to hip hopper to dance hall diva. And while some of the lyrics are a tad surface, they are always sincere.  Whatever you're doing, Paula, I hope you haven't given up on making music.
