 I first heard SONiA about a year ago, when I purchased the Disappear Fear album "Seed in the Sahara." Though I loved it, I felt the album's later songs didn't quite live up to the immense promise of the first few tracks. I often found myself losing interest and switching albums before Seed's completion.  Not so w/ "Almost Chocolate." SONiA is one of those rare socially oriented singer-songwriters whose politics are so achingly personal that no activist-phobic [...] could ever accuse her of jumping on a soapbox. Like early Tracy Chapman, her musical storytelling has a clarity and simplicity that is utterly engrossing. Also like Tracy, her folk rock sound makes for perfect road music. This album is remarkably cohesive, and each track is distinctive. My personal favorites include the rockin' call for companionship -- "Two Eggs Over Easy" -- and the movingly mellow autobiography "13."  Buy SONiA. Love SONiA. I myself am eager to explore her earlier work. --TIM
