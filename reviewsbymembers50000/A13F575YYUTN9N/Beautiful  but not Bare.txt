 One unfortunate result of hype is that expectations are raised to such a fever pitch that the product in question is an inevitable letdown.  In Annie Lennox's case, the hype is coming directly from her own marketing stategies; the album (and its print advertisements) is covered in testaments to its emotional nakedness, its singular place in the Annie canon.  When, upon first listen, "Bare" proves itself to be a rather ordinary Annie Lennox album, it is somewhat off-putting.  That said, an "ordinary Annie Lennox album" is no small feat. Annie can always be relied upon for sophistication, artistry and integrity. "Bare" is no exception.  Though several tracks are marred by what sounds like smooth jazz-esque cheezeball production (think empty airport corridor at 6 AM), the songcraft and vocal delivery are of the utmost quality.  Certainly worth a second (...and third, and fourth....) listen.
