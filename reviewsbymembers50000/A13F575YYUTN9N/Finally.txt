 This delightful movie comes closest to being something I've searched for a long time -- a gay romantic comedy which follows the cheezeball Hollywood romantic comedy formula -- right down to what I've always referred to as the "hurry up and catch him before you lose him forever" scene. The leads are adorable, and the supporting cast is a riot. However, Gabe and Mark's romance could use a more even build -- less angst and more emotional chemistry might help. Gabe's edginess, at first endearing, became far too reminiscent of my own real life relationship jitters as the movie continued. The combustion of Tori Spelling's character in a diner, though neccesary and highly amusing , disrupted the conclusion of Mark and Gabe's story at precisely the wrong moment. I found it distracting, and would prefer to see it relocated to some point earlier in the film. Beyond these minor complaints, Trick is highly entertaining, endearing and adorable -- the most whimsical, escapist gay romantic comedy I've come across.
