 I rented this movie expecting highly entertaining, enjoyable fluff. This movie was all that -- but also so much more. Legally Blonde is one of the most subversive mainstream movies I've seen in a long time. I would go so far as to call it a daring stab in the back to to the feminist backlash in its assertion that independent, empowered women come in all shapes, sizes and haircolors.  This film, on the surface, appears to feed into our culture's stereotypes of women. We pigeonhole and define women by their appearances, and judge them through harsh dichotomies -- virgin/whore, beautiful and stupid/ugly and brainy. Such categorizations help prevent women from uniting and overthrowing the patriarchal establishment.  Witherspoon's Elle must work hard to overcome the preconceptions that come w/ her background, appearance and experience, but she eventually succeeds in asserting her intelligence, her independence and her determination to a doubtful student body. The judgement she initially receives from her more traditionally "feminist"-ish fellow law students eventually turns to respect and friendship. Women unite themselves across societally-imposed boundaries, and the result is energizing, encouraging and entertaining. Legally Blonde is comedy at its best -- a substantive message well disguised in the form of light-hearted entertainment.
