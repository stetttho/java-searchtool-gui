 I first became a Natalie Merchant convert after purchasing "Ophelia" my junior year of high school. That album's resounding, poetic and inherently painful ballads were instantly absorbed into my personal soundtrack for that year, and hearing them still evokes a myriad of emotions and memories specific to that time. I've eagerly awaited Natalie's follow-up. "Motherland" both meets and confounds all expectations. Though the songs are, for the most part, melacholy-tinged ballads, they are also wildly versatile and courageously experimental. Natalie's vocals -- as appealingly distinctive as ever -- explore a wide variety of new terrain, from blues to Latin to middle-eastern. The result is a richly intriguing landscape of voices and sounds -- a Motherland meant to be explored, enjoyed and nurtured. This album is an experience, and one worth having.  TIM
