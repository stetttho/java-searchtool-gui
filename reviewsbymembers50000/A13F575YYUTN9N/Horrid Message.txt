 A few clarifying comments- I adore Bette Midler. How can't I? I also adored this movie -- right up until the end. The film is nothing particularly Earth shattering. It is, however, a sweet, well told, genuine story of a single mother's relationship with her daughter.  My mother took me to see this in the theater when I was very young -- probably only 7 or 8 years old. I recently rented it, remembering having liked it as a child.  It held up -- the movie was still moving, still touching. My MAJOR complaint is with the ending. We are made to believe that a lower income, blue collar single mother can't succesfully raise a child without lying to her, convincing her she doesn't want her anymore, and turning her over to her richer father. What kind of values are these. Worse, what kind of message does it send about the effectiveness of single mothers? As the child of an exquisite single mother, I resent the assertion that I had nary a chance to make it without the presence of a wealthy male.
