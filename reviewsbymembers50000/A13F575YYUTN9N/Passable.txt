 Despite her Pollyanna approach to life (far too many of her songs involve dying children), at times cloyingly poppish sound, and her vaguely unpleasant and Alanis-esque singing voice, Chantal manages to create a few gems, including the haunting "Eve" (used quite effectively on an otherwise hideous episode of Dawson's Creek) and the rousing "Souls." The album's production is its strongest point. Its sound is cohesive and consistent, creating different but interconnnected moods for each song, and resulting in several memorable moments, one highlight being the extended piano intro to Souls.   A sweet but on the whole unmemorable collection from a passable singer-songwriter.
