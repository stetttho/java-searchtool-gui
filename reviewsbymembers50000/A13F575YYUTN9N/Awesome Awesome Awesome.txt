 An almost flawless work from a timeless singer-songwriter. A stunning collection of memorable tracks, seamlessly and evocatively produced. Stevie holds onto just enough of her divine witchiness, while taking on a new, and very real persona -- that of the wise and rugged traveler. "You know me, I'm a nomad. I can't feel bad about the way I am." This album is great road music, as well as great room music. Stevie is a survivor, and this collection's incomparable awesomeness is well earned.
