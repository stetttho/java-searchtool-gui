 A remnant from a time when Sarah's new age sensibilities overruled her more melancholic musings, and electronically atmospheric in the way only an 80's album can be. Though a bit amateurish and inconsistent, "Touch" is great fun for fans who wish to see their favorite Lilither in a very different capacity, and "Vox" rocks in a way no current Sarah song ever can.
