 Rose Polenzani is a vaguely talented singer songwriter who could stand to benefit from a good shot of adrenaline. I'm not one who tends to poopoo mellowness or depression. I love what I refer to as "wallow" music. My listmania list "Songs for a Rainy Fall Day," is an ode to precisely this form of music. Yet despite my masochistic taste, Rose Polenzani loses even my interest. My first impression of Rose -- at an Indigo Girls concert the summer after my high school graduation -- was positive. Unfortunately, I quickly found my mind wandering and my attention lagging. At the time, I chalked it up to my lack of knowledge of her songs and my eagerness to see my girls. After finding her album in a recent visit to a used CD shop in Northampton, Mass, I decided to add her to my ever expanding and extensive collection of female singer-songwriters, hoping for a pleasant and welcome surprise. I thought if Amy and Emily supported her, Rose must have something to offer. But despite my desire to adore her -- I didn't. Perhaps it's the album's pacing, which can only be described as monotonous. Or maybe it's the songwriting, which can only be described as repetitive. An even stronger possibility is the vocal style, which, though pretty, is marked by a certain distracting histrionic choppiness reminiscent of early Jewel or "Little Black Girl" Rebekah.  I still hold out hopes that,with time, this album may grow on me, as many albums have. I do think Rose's sound has potential. I also haven't heard her more recent work, and I realize it's quite possible her sound has matured.  I can't give Rose a positive review -- but I do wish her the best of luck in her artistic growth.
