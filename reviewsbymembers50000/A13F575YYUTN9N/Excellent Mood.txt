 I discovered John Mayer through the song "83" -- his track on the Serendipity soundtrack. Like that song, this album is defined by an appealingly mellow folk/rock sound, and fits nicely on my shelf next to other male pop/folk/rock artists like Duncan Sheik and David Gray. The lyrics may not be anything particularly meaningful, but they're basically harmless. This is an excellent album for servicing romantically angsty moods.
