 This is by far one of my all-time favorite albums, and one of the only albums I insist everyone ought to own.  Tracy's debut posesses a lyrical, vocal and musical clarity and simplicity not found on her later work. Each track tells an achingly personal and timelessly political story in an accessible, meaningful and grounded way.  If you don't already own this, buy it. I insist.
