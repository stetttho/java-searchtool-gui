 This is a wonderful country-rock type album with a heavy Neil Young influence. Moorer's voice is sexy and bluesy and glides effortlessly over crunchy, hot, yummy guitars. A seriously melancholic thread weaves its way through every track, (w/ lyrics like "The cuckoo clock quit chirping/The bird fell out and died/Spent its whole life working/And never learned to fly/It ran out of time."), which is very much to my liking.  Also recommended: Anne McCue's Roll. She's an Australian femme w/ serious electric guitar chops.
