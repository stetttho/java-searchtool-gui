 I first heard Anne Heaton just over a year ago, in one of her several performances at my campus, Sarah Lawrence College. I grabbed her album and have been hooked since.  Anne's versatile vocals -- at once smooth and biting, delicate and searing -- are remininscent of an amalgamation of Ani DiFranco, Tori Amos and Paula Cole, among others. The vocals are perfectly intertwined with the piano and guitar work. Each song has an inherent power, held just below the surface and holding our interest as it moves seamlessly toward its crescendo.  The album's tone is a healthy balance of effectively melancholic emotional musings and lighter, whimsical story songs. "Megan and Kevin" is an especially entertaining example of the latter, and is certainly one of the album's highlights.  Intimate in the way only the best live albums can be, "Live w/ Frank Marotta Jr." is an excellent introduction to a singer songwriter to watch out for.
