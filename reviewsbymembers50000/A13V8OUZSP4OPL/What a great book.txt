 My daughter loved it, I loved it ... and I have a hunch you probably will too.  I picked this up on a whim, and was very pleasantly surprised.  Great illustrations, a story line with some meat to it, and some fun and wit thrown in too.  What more can you ask?  As a side note, I wasn't surprised to learn that the illustrator is from "coal country" because, frankly, Miss Rosemary reminds me an awful lot of my grandmother.  Great fun!
