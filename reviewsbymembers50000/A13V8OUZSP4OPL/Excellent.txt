 The artwork is incomparable.  Really, that alone is reason enough to buy the book.   It's not your typical cutesie kids' book pictures, but something much more.  I pulled out my newly arrived copy to show my sister, who paints (and sells) some pieces in a local gallery, and she paged through it again and again.  The artwork has that much depth.  And the story is very good too, making the book well worth buying.  I'm sure I'll be back to look for more from this author/illustrator.
