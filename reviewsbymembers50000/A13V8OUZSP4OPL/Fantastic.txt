 Of all of the gems I've stumbled across on the internet, one of my favorites has to be Catherine Newman's "Ben and Birdy" column.  I always have to smile when I realize that it's the beginning of a new week and there will be a new chapter posted.  Usually I end up reading most, if not all, of it aloud to my husband, albeit in bits and pieces.  Some of it I share because it is simply hysterical, some because it captures the essence of what I feel with my own 2 and 6 year olds, and some because it can nearly make me cry.  Basically, she sums up the roller coaster of motherhood in a few perfect paragraphs, and this book is a continuation of that.  As far as I am concerned, it is a must-read for all mothers -- a definite addition to the baby shower gift.  I doubt that anyone can read it and not feel touched, and grateful, for having done so.  Unlike so many other books that you find yourself reading when you're pregnant or a new mother, this one doesn't make you more worried, more unsure of yourself, or more depressed.  There's no overwhelming amount of dire possibilities that you've never considered, no second guessing all of your parental decisions, no nail-biting.  This is like sitting down with the best of friends and having a good long laugh, or cry, or "aha" moment that boosts your mood and makes you feel less alone.  The anecdotes are so refreshingly real -- it's a relief to find out that there's someone else out there just like you -- you're not the only one who misunderstood, or worried all night, or said crazy things to your husband.  And it's clear that she is such a good mother and that her children are lucky to have her, and it's easier to believe that you are too -- for all your flaws, things really are ok.  This is a totally unflinching, unselfconscious look at motherhood, and it's beautiful. Buy the book.  You won't regret it.
