 ...it couldn't be more enchanting.  The pictures are so beautifully detailed that you notice more things happening each time you look through it.  While I was busy with other things, my 2-1/2 year old daughter sat down to look at this book alone when it arrived.  She was perfectly content this way, but then when we 'read' it together,  and she was even happier -- with each of us spotting things that the other hadn't.  It is one of our favorites; I can't imagine a book packed with more warm, feel-good images.  This book will stay on our shelf for a long time.
