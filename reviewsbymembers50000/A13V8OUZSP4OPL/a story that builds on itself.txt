Grandpa kicks off the plot by buying Jesse a pair of shoes, which of course, need a pair of socks to go with them...and soon the whole extended family is pitching in to buy something "to go with the shoes from Grandpa."  Nice, warm illustrations and the rollicking text combine to make a very pleasant reading experience.  Enjoy!
