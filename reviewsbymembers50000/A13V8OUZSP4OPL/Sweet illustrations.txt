 If you like Joan Walsh Anglund, you'll like this book.  She has filled it with simple drawings of the most endearing children, who are busy doing activities that we all remember.  There aren't a lot of words, but there are just enough to build on the feelings that go along with the pictures.  Adults might like it even more than children will.
