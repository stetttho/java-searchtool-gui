 A thoroughly enjoyable book, with a magnificent glimpse into the Alaskan wilderness.  Stunning pictures, with some fun facts sprinkled throughout can easily hold you and your child's attention as you follow the bears through their year.  (Did you know that at the height of berry season, one bear can eat 200,000 berries each day?!)   But this is no textbook.  It's a little piece of magic that reminds us just how much we should appreciate any last bit of wildness that remains.  Highly recommended.
