 I wanted to get my daughters some play food that wasn't plastic, and this turned out to be a gem.  I have to say that the picture here doesn't do it justice -- the pieces are much more appealing in person.  Originally I thought they would like one of the other 2 sets better (the pizza or the sandwich set), but after purchasing them, this is the clear favorite.  These pieces are the most versatile.  There is some bread, which can be fashioned into a sandwich.  The veggies/fruits can be served as is or chopped up in a "stew", etc.  The carrot can double for chunks of cheddar.....and on and on.  We've counted pieces.  We've played restaurant. And really, getting the cucumber back together so there is not a kink in the middle is almost a puzzle.  There is something most satisfying about the crunching, slicing sound too.   I do agree with the other reviewer about the paint smell though (but it does go away).  And the red paint started rubbing off on the knife almost immediately.   All in all, however, this will get played with A LOT.
