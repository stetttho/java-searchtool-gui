 Warm, homey illustrations that almost seem to glow are paired nicely with the sweet storyline.  As always, James Herriott knows his animals, and can capture their essence on paper.  I have known cats like Oscar, who is most definitely a "people" cat--he loves to be in the thick of things!--and reading Oscar's story was like a touch of nostalgia.  If your little one loves animals, do get them this book.  I have a hunch they'll like it.
