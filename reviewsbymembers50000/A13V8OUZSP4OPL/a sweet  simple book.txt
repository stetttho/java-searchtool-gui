 I loved the illustrations, and could feel the change of seasons in my bones.  There aren't a lot of words, so if you are reading to an impatient page-turner, then this might be a good book for you.  On the other hand, there are details in the illustrations that other children might want to linger over.  I did think the ending was a little flat, but perhaps I am being too harsh, since my daughter didn't seem to mind it at all.
