 This is really the best collection of fairy tales that I've ever seen, and I have seen a lot of them.  First, the illustrations are simply exquisite.  The heroes and heroines of this book are a seemingly multicultural bunch, and there is a dreamlike quality woven through the art.  It's an unusual approach, and it makes this collection so appealing to see dark-haired, brown-eyed princesses.  I love it, and so do my daughters.  And the stories themselves are well told.  It's as if the author sifted through all of the versions of these stories floating around, and put down the very best of them -- the ones that you would pick yourself.  I don't like it when I am reading a classic story and parts of it just seem simply wrong.    But that is most definitely not the case here.  If you are looking for a collection of fairy tales, stop.  You've found it.  Buy it, and I guarantee that you won't be disappointed.
