 This was another book that I picked up on a whim, and ended up being pleasantly surprised by.  The illustrations are great and the story line is touching. And Cornelia Augusta is a very likable and thoughtful little girl, who knows just the right sort of valentine to make for each of her very different friends.  A perfect book for Valentines Day!
