 the story was fine, but not "magical"  and the illustrations were cute.  If your child was anticipating a baby brother or sister, it might resonate a little more with your family.  My daughter did listen while I read this to her, but it wasn't one she asked me to read over and over.  And although I wouldn't classify this as one of my "must-haves", it was a fine book, and certainly a lot more readable than others I have encountered.
