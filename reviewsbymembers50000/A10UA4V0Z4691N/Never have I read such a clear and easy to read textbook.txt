 As a computer-engineering graduate, I've seen some of the definitions and theorems presented in this book. Just now - I really understand them fully! The author really REALLY did a great job in clear, simple explenations. What I liked most is the way the author presents his view on how problems should be approached, when to use this strategy and the useful examples - which really are explained step by step. I didn't see anything "left to the reader" - so the examples really help out in understanding the fine details. Sipser uses clear, short proofs to theorems - which makes them easy to understand and to remember, and I might even say intuitive. Never have I studied a subject so fast, and so thoroughly as I did using Sipser's book.
