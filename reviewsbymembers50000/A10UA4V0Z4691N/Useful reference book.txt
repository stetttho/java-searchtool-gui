 I bought this book while working on some informaitno retrieval related project, and it turned out as a useful reference for explaining terminology, suggesting efficient data structures, and offering good references for further reading. However, the book turned out yet more useful to me as, during my M.A. studies (in CS) I had to write a work on "Suffix Trees" and "Suffix Arrays" and I found that Gonnet, Baeza-Yates and Snider describe equivalent ideas they call "PAT trees" and "PAT arrays". I found this book useful too for working on computational linguistics related projects as well. In short - I like keeping this book always in reach, as a reference, though, I found this book not so friendly as an introduction book to the subject ("Managing Gigabytes", might turn out to be a more welcomming).
