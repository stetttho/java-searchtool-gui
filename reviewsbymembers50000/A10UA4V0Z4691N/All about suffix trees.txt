 Excellent book on String Algorithms. A lot of material. This is not an easy read, though, relatively not difficult for an algorithms and data-structures book. This is the most complete resource i could find about suffix trees, how to implement them, usages, and algorithms. Actually, when I took this book, I was interested in suffix arrays. Well - this book explains those better than the original paper do. Many applications to suffix trees are listed, along with comparisons to other algorithms applied to those problems. If you need to get into string algorithms from computer science perspective - this is a good book to start. If you want to "feel" of the biologists side of the story, than this is not a good choice. I use this book as a textbook on the subject, and I'm sure I'll be using it as a reference later on. This book surely is worth its cost (even if you buy it on Amazon...:-)).
