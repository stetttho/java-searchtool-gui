 I bought this book as a reference book during a graduate course I took in Neural Computation. The book was clear and useful in presenting the topics, and more importantly, in presenting the algorithms in a clearn simple format which made it very easy to produce a computer program implementing these algorithms just by reading the book. It was also useful by listing various things which have been done in literature to alter the algorithms for various purposes.  I suppose that people in the field of Neural Computation might find this book useful as an introduction book and also as a reference book (at least for its clear explenations and algorithms listings), but otherwise need more comprehensive books which cover a lot more math than this books does. Actually, this is a good book for getting to know this dicipline for people who don't like to mess too much with calculus. Other books in this fiels contain more, a lot more, calculus in them, so I would also argue that this book is useful for people who want to understand the ideas, have a clear algorithm so its easy to implement, and at the same time, not worry about the math too much. You don't see proofs here, at least not as much as I expected to, but I suppose that this follows the idea that this book is useful as a complementary book, rather than the authoritative book in the subject. I only regret the high price of the book.
