 This is the most comprehensive compilation on combinatorial optiomization I have seen so far. Usually, Papadimitriou's book is a good place for this material - but in many cases, looking for proofs and theorems - I had to use several books: (*) Combinatorial Optimization Algorithms and Complexity by Papadimitriou and Steiglitz. (*) Integer and Combinatorial Optimization by Nemhauser and Wolsey (*) Theory of linear and integer programming by Schrijver (*) Combinatorial Optimization by Cook, Cunningham, Pulleyblank and Schrijver (*)Combinatorial Algorithms by Kreher and Stinson This book, on the other hand, contains so much information and so many proved theorems - it's the richest resuorce in this topic, in my humble opinion. Using it as a graduate level textbook for an *introduction* to combinatorial optimization is kind of hard - as although it's richness, some topics are described without enough detail or examples (like the topics on network flow and bipartite graphs) - yet the authors probably assumed some previous knowledge in those topics. I prefer using this book as a reference rather than and intoduction. The heavy mathematical notations in this book might scare some readers, but no-fear! You quickly get used to it, and appreciate the greatness in the notations, as they make the theorems more short and to the point. On the other hand - getting back to this book for a quick review on some subject might force  you to flip pages for a fwe minutes, just to remember the notation again. The authors intended this book to be a graduaet level textbook or an up-to-date reference  work for current research. I believe they accomplished both targets!
