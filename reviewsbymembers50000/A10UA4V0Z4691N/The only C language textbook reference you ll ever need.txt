 I've read some C language text books, and they all fell short in some (or even many) way. This book is short, to the point, exact and clear. Many useful examples, with motivating reasons for those examples. I found this book  useful not only to beginners in C (as a textbook) but also as a reference book for experienced programmers, and a good reference for people teaching the C programming language. In many C courses they give "A book on C" and this book as the course textbooks - I say forget about the ABC book - and stick to this one - you won't regret it.
