 This little book, written as a "novel", actually tries to show us that each of us is actually able to be an amature mathematician, and that "pure mathematics" is not that complicated once you get down to the rules. For readers familiar with group theory notations, this is an easy and fun read.  Byeond the superlatives given all over to the nice and simple manner in which the number system is built in front of our eyes, I would also like to add I have noticed some ideas Knuth wanted the readers to absorb by reading this book of his: * People too much into civilization need time off to "rest". * After a long while of "resting" people need brain stimulations. * The joy and interest in mathematics comes with the discovery, or at least after trying the best you can. Only then can you appreciate what others did in mathematics. * Teachers in schools would rather tell you about math, and make you takes exams, and will not encourage creativity. This results in that only in graduate school are people allowed (and demanded) to start creating things of their own. * Solving good math puzzles or solving any problem, is satisfying, and makes you horny! * definitions proofs to theorems and ideas should be expressed as simple as possible, and they can always be expressed in a simple way. I could go on with more ideas Knuth wanted to pass to the readers... I read the book in one time, not putting it down for a minute. The flow of ideas and progress in building the number system (up to the pseudo-numbers) is clear and fun. I actually felt as if I was discovering things myself. There is a lot which can be "further probed" after readnig the book, and Knuth appeals to teachers to gives seminars based on this text, and guides them how he would want those seminars to be like.
