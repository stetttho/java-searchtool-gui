 It is hard to believe this is a first novel! The book is so well written it is amazing! The story is completely engaging and I just fell in love with all of the characters! It is a very unique story and also it is so very funny that I was laughing out loud. I felt giddy while reading the book. Yet, don't think it is just a comedic work, the story is very touching too and really has a great message. It is just so very good, do yourself a favor and read it this summer! Amazing debut for Jim Kokoris!!! I am so lucky to have read it.
