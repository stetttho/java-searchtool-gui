 Why did I wait so long to read this book? Well, I finally righted that mistake. Julie and Romeo was such a fun book to read. I was totally immersed in their world. Great writing, great plot, great sense of humour, and characters I loved. I just wanted to put my 2 cents in! I loved this book. If you are looking for some great escapism, read this book. It will be on my top 10 of the year. It also gets my personal award for best book cover! I will be reading all of Ms. Ray's work. Brava!
