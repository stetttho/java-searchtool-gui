 This is the first book by Fannie Flagg that I have read, and it will not be the last. I finished it last night and all day I have been in "mourning" that I won't have Standing in the Rainbow to read tonight!! This book is one great story. It follows some truly lovable characters from the 1940's to the 1990's all the while bringing in a true feel for America throughout all of those time periods. This is a definite shoe-in for a spot on my personal top 10 books of 2002. I am now going to read all of Ms. Flagg's books. If you are looking for a heartwarming, good old-fashioned story that entertains you and makes you feel good, this is the book! I just want to hug everyone in Elmwood Springs, Missouri!!!! Great, great book! Get it immediately, it will make your day!
