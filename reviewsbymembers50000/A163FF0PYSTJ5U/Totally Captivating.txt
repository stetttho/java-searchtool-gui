 I really can't say enough about this book!!! I just finished it and  absolutely loved it!!!  It was totally engrossing, interesting, and full of  the most wonderful characters!!  I really didn't want it to end, actually I  could have read a continuation of the book for about six months.  I loved  Jane and Akiko!!  And of course all of the people they came across to be on  the TV show!  My only regret is that I don't have this book in  hardcover!!!!!!!  It will definitely go on my list of of best books I have  read this year!  I am very anxiously awaiting the next book by Ruth L.  Ozeki!!!!!  I am now a big fan.  Her writing is excellent.  If you want to  read book you can't put down, this is it!!!!!
