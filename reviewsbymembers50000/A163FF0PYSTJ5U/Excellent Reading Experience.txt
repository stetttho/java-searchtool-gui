 This was truly a book I could not put down! I was rapt with attention on every page. I could have read another 500 pages about this family. Dani Shapiro has a gift for making you feel like you are listening to a friend tell her story to you. I was rooting for all of the characters and really cared about them.  This is definitely one of the best books I have read. Do not hesitate to purchase this book, just make sure you have an open schedule when you start reading it, you will not want to stop!
