 This is an outstanding book in every way. As a reading experience it is everything you hope for as it draws you in and holds your interest. I did not want the book to end. It is hearbreaking, funny, and riveting. I feel bad saying that because it is about one family's life-altering experience, one that no one should have to deal with. But I thank the author for honestly telling us about his experiences. I think that was an act of bravery. This is definitely a book that I will recommend to many, many people. I am sending all good thoughts to the author, Kirsten, and Rowen for blessings of health and happiness. I, too, will look forward to any other writing by Mr. Halpin. I loved this book!
