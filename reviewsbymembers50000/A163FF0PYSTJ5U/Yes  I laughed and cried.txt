 I am always attracted to reading books about how "ordinary"  people deal with loss and grieving, but I am also a big fan of Harry  Truman, so when I saw the title of this book I bought it sight unseen which  was fortunate.  I really enjoyed the book and was deeply touched by the  author's experience and appreciate her ability to honestly recount her  painful experience.  She is definitely a warm-hearted person I could see  hanging out with, hence spending today with her book was quite  rewarding. An added plus is her wonderful sense of humor.  When I read  about Truman (the dog) in Chapter 5 and their games of "Kiss and  Cuddle," etc., I truly laughed until I cried.  The death of the  beloved cat Angel made me weep as my dear cat Harriet died this summer.  I  really appreciated the author's expression that animals are to be respected  for the love and support that they bring to our lives.  All in all, this  was a great book and I am glad I got to spend a Sunday with it!  I only  wish there were more pictures of Truman, especially in his party hat!!!!
