 This is a really great book.  I read it in 24 hours.  I have a cabinet where all of my best books go, and this one will join the others there. I did not want this book to end, and I want to know what Richard and Theresa will be doing in ten years.  This will definitely be on my top ten books of  the year 2000 list.  READ IT!
