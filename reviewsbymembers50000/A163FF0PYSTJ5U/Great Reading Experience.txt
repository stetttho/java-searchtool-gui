 Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni is now one of my most favorite authors! In January I read Sister of My Heart and then I counted down the days until I could read Vine of Desire. Taken together these are just wonderful books! The story is so engaging, the characters are intriguing, and it is the type of writing that makes one smile with contentment! These are must read books if you love to be transported into the lives of other people. I am telling all my friends to read these books. Read Sister of My Heart first though. Also, the author is currently on tour, if you get a chance go hear her read and answer questions. She is so very interesting and one wishes you could go out to lunch with her and talk the afternoon away. I am already sure these books will be on my own personal Top 10 list of 2002. I am now reading everything Ms. Divakaruni has written and I feel LUCKY!
