 O.K. first of all this is a book that you get totally engrossed in and will have to read all at once. Now, this is not for the faint of heart. There is some coarse language and perhaps off putting situations to some, but you cannot find a more honest accounting of actual life, just like it happens every day and then to top it off it is written with such style and hilarity that it is a shame when the book ends. Mr. Magnuson drew me into his story and I never wanted it to end. I laughed so much, and yet there were many important points to ponder. I will now be on the look out for all his work. This is sure to be on my own personal top 10 books of the year list.
