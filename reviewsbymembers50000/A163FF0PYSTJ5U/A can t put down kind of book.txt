 Martha O'Connor is the real thing!!  She has written a real page turner while also offering heartfelt insight into the lives of these three women characters.  This is the story of three girls in their last year of high school and then again when they are in their 30's.  Something major happens when they are in high school which deeply affects each girl.  It is the story of friendship and hard times, and how to get through those hard times.  I never wanted to stop reading this book and I keep thinking about it even days later.  Looking forward to many more books by Martha O'Connor.
