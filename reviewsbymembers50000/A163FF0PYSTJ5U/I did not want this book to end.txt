 I was anxiously awaiting this book because of all the great advance reviews it received. Plus, the subject matter sounded really interesting. The whole time I read the book I was completely engrossed in what was taking place, and for the last third of the book I felt short of breath. I was really concerned with what would happen to the characters. I really came to care about them. I would highly recommend this book. You know a book is really good when after you finish it you have an emotional reaction and you don't even want to start a new book yet. You just want to sit and let this book sink in to your consciousness.....
