 On the recommendation of my friendly bookseller I bought this book, and I am so glad I did!  I read it today, and it made me laugh as I read every page!   The illustrations also are wonderful, I am considering buying a copy to frame the cover!  This book is wonderful, lots of fun and laughs.  I can't wait to give my nephew a copy for his birthday, but it won't be my own copy!  Also I am calling my best friend in California and ordering her to get a copy tomorrow.  Get this book - even if there are no kids in your life!   I will now look into reading Roddy Doyle's adult novels!  READ THIS!
