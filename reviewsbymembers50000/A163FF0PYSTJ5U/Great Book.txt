 This is one of the best books I have read so far this year.  It is extremely well-written and I could not put it down.  I am not a huge ice skating fan, but this book made me go the library to search for tapes of the 2002 Winter Olympics pairs competition.   The greatest thing about this book is the background stories of the six pairs this book focuses on.  The story of the Chinese skaters alone is amazing.  The dedication to the sport these pairs maintained is jaw dropping.   Usually reading nonfiction is a bit plodding for me, but this book just zips right along!  Do not hesitate to buy it!!
