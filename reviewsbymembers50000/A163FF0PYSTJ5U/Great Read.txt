 My definition of a great book is one that you literally cannot put down, and NO SECOND CHANCE is definitely that!  Once you start the book you will not want to stop, luckily I had the chance to read it all in one day. What a blast! Harlan Coben is a great thriller writer. He gives you interesting characters with interesting jobs and then makes wild things happen.  I highly recommend this book! Mr. Coben is on his book tour now, see him if you can.  He is warm, friendly, and deserves all the accolades he receives.
