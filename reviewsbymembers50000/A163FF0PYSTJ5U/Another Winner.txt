 First of all, let me tell you that Elizabeth Berg is one of my favorite authors!   I have read all of her books.  Open House is right up their with my very favorite, Range of Motion.  The best thing about this book is  that in so many places you read what Sam is thinking and say to yourself,  "Isn't that the truth! I feel the same way!"  That happens in all  of Elizabeth Berg's books and it just makes this reader feel so happy and  comforted. Sam's shopping spree is just such a moment! If you have a  chance to go to a reading by Elizabeth Berg, do not hesitate!   She reads  her books with such style and verve and then talks with the audience like  you were all long lost friends!   She is such a special person, and  whenever one of her books comes out it is like Christmas morning!   Thank  you Elizabeth for another top-notch book that you can't put down!
