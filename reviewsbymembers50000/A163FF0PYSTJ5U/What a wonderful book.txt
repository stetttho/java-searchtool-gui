 What a wonderful book by Ken Stark!!! This is a great story about two brothers growing up in small town Illinois in the 1950's. It is about a simpler life than we all lead now and that is so refreshing!  The illustrations are a wonder! Just gorgeous! The themes of friendship and brotherly love are so comforting! Get this book!!
