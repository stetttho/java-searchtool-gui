 Here is what happened to me....I bought this book on a whim. I was not sure I would like it. I started it on a Sunday. I finished it on a Monday. I read it in Illinois, but for two days I felt like I could have been in Italy, San Francisco or Morroco. I mean to say I loved this book!!!!! I was totally transported to another world and I felt I was involved in a love affair. I highly recommend this book. It is a wonderful memoir on many levels, a love story, a travelogue, a tutorial on how to get over a broken heart, and a simply put, just a really good read. It will be difficult to go to work tomorrow as opposed to an Italian island with the love of my life......
