 I just finished The Usual Rules this morning.  I am still kind of breathless. I absolutely loved this book. I love the main character Wendy.  She is an inspiration.  I have never read a book by Joyce Maynard before.  She is an excellent writer. I won't summarize the plot you can see that above, but suffice it to say this was one of the best reading experiences of my life and I hope this book finds a very wide audience. It is really something special! I am so lucky to have read it. I feel deeply touched by this experience. Thank you Joyce Maynard.
