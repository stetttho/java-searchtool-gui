 Do yourself a favor, go get this book today! It is a masterpiece plain and simple, and aside from that it will have you howling with laughter! I only review books that I consider totally top notch, and this is one of them! I am telling everyone I know to get this book. I only wish I could spend an afternoon with the author and her cats! Thank you Stacey for a beautiful and moving book.
