 Ruth Reichl is simply one of the best writers I have ever read. I was lucky enough to be off of work today so I was able to read all day long and finished this book in one day. What a splendid way to spend the day. I was totally transported into Ruth's world. I just feel so lucky to have read this book. Do not hesitate to buy it. It is one rewarding, not to mention engrossing, journey. Thank you for sharing your story Ms. Reichl.
