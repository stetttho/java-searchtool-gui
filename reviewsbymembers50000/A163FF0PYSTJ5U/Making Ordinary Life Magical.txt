 Don't hesitate to get this book! Every story is a joy to read. Elizabeth Berg is able to take everyday situations and make then a joy to behold. She has the most exquisite writing style, it makes me giddy when I read her work. I get exicited because I become so involved with her characters and what they are doing, which is usually "ordinary" yet it isn't.....like I said she makes the ordinary in life seem magical which gives you a pretty happy feeling inside. I can't seem to do her work justice by what I write, but I want to convey the importance of this book....It is just beautiful.
