 When I first heard this debut album, it absolutely floored me.  I didn't know a remastered release was in the works until surfing the internet one day.  I went ahead and replaced my old copy of this classic and one of the greatest debuts I have ever heard...from front to back.  The sound quality has been improved (although the original version of this release is definitely not bad).  The highly intriguing part of this package is Disc 2 containing the live material.  You hear performances of Etheridge and her band in front of an enthusiastic crowd as well as Melissa by herself with an acoustic guitar (very nice).  You get to hear her with all the raw and vibrant energy she had as an artist about to skyrocket to fame.  I regret that I missed the one chance I had to see her live just as this album was released.  This package is historical and provides a nice glimpse of Melissa Etheridge, her attitude and sound as her career began.  Apart from certain bootlegs, I'm not sure how much live material her fans have heard. Disc 2 is definitely a listening pleasure and one of the main incentives for me buying the CDs.  The only drawback I would give to this release is that for the more casual fan or one who is just being introduced to her music, the original disc may be easier on the budget.  To be honest, the asking price for the package is one that die-hard and highly interested fans like myself will be willing to shell out.  Others who are just getting into Melissa Etheridge will be more than satisfied and in awe of her with just the single disc if that's what they're really considering.  BUT, five stars anyway because it contains the orginal CD remastered, and, who knows...you may find a super deal on this as a like-new or gently used set.
