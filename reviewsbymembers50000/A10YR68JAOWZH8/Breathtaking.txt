 I had searched for several years for information regarding the Funk Brothers, but, until now, so little was known or written about them.  I had only heard them mentioned on TV twice -- once during an interview with Martha Reeves and again during a documentary on the history of rock and roll.  Both times peaked my interest as I already appreciated that the Motown sound was really the musicians (taking absolutely NOTHING away from the great vocalists and performers).  Recognition of these outstanding men was long overdue (and that's quite an understatement).  The movie is highly personal and highly entertaining.  Watching the fascinating story of the men who invented the Motown sound is akin to actually being there with them at the time they were creating history in "The Snake Pit."  In a sense, you are given a very unique opportunity to travel back in time and feel the same emotion they did.  Kudos to Martha Reeves for being part of the film.  There are also cameos by Mary Wilson, Otis Williams, and Stevie Wonder.  I only wish other Motown stars had been with them during filiming or available to comment on these men who were at the heart of their success.  This DVD is truly indispensible for anyone who loves Motown and soul but, most espcially, for anyone who loves and appreciates popular music.  PUT THIS ON YOUR SHELF!!
