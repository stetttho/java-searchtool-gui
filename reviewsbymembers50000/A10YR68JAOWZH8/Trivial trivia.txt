 Few would argue that the Beatles are the most well-documented and critiqued act in entertainment.  Admist a vast sea of literature, there are bound to be books that don't necessarily give those who are casually interested in the Beatles or those who are avid fans the best and most interesting source of information.  This book is one of those examples.  To the casual fan, the book will mean nothing since it does not serve as an introduction to the group's history. More notably, to the more serious fan, the book presents nothing new -- these "myths" have been known and understood for years.  For example, it's safe to say that a handful of them stemmed from Philip Norman's "Shout" and Nicholas Schaffner's "The Beatles Forever" - two far more superior books, but not without their flaws and questionable interpretations.  If you are an avid fan or a more serious Beatle "scholar", you may want to skim through this book as I did and see the humor in it.  Then, toss it in the pile of other trivial Beatle books to recycle.  If you are a casual fan and want more of an introduction to the greatest rock act of all time (including all the "mythology"), you are better off investing your hard-earned money elsewhere.
