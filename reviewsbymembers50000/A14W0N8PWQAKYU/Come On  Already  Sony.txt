 One of the best shows of the 1970's, "One Day at a Time" is very deserving for a first class DVD release.  I just wish Sony would get their butts in gear and release it.  I heard it should be coming out this fall.  It's still quite a bit a ways but hopefully they will stick to it and not keep pushing it back.
