 The first two sets are awesome and I would love for the set to be completed.  A few people at the Truly Outrageous message board have e-mailed Rhino regarding the final release and there's good news and bad news.  First the bad news, Rhino said in their response that they no longer have the rights to Jem and the rest of the Sunbow shows.  But here's the good news, Sony now owns the rights and Rhino said that they (Sony) plan to reissue the titles at some point.  Personally, I don't care who owns the rights just as long as the DVD collection is complete.    And another reviewer mentioned that there were some typos in the Jem Bible.  I heard that the Jem Bible was more of Christy Marx's rough draft to show Hasbro when she was approached to develop the show to go with the doll line.  Evidently some things were changed or taken out all together when the show actually started production.  So that's why some of the things in the Jem Bible are a bit different than what we see in the actual show (what's on the DVD extras are just excerpts from the full version which used to be on sale until Sunbow (or Hasbro, I forget which) asked Christy Marx to stop selling copies).
