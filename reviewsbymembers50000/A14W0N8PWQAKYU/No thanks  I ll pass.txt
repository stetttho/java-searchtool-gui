 I would most definitely buy this set if the videos were left in tact with the episodes.  They just add so much more to the show.  Since music licensing is such a huge factor then I just don't think B&B is meant to be on DVD.  I'll just record episodes off MTV2.  I just wish they'd show some of the very early episodes.
