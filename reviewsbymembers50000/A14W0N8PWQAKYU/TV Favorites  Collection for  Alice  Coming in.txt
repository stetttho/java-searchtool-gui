 If you go to the "Alice" message board at Sitcoms Online, you should be pleased to see that Warner Bros. is planning a "TV Favorites" DVD containing episodes of "Alice" that were hand-picked by the fans.  I am encouraging all "Alice" fans to please purchase this DVD because if it sells well then Warner Bros. will be sure to release season sets.
