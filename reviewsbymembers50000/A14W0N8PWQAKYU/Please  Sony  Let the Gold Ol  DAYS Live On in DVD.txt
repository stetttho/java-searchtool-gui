 DAYS is so deserving of DVD releases.  While it is impossible to have season sets (come on, it airs five days a week year-round) Sony could still come out with themed "Best Of" multi-disc collections containing various FULL EPISODES, like each character or couple (past and present) having their own collection, or a weddings collection, and so on.  A good way for Sony to test the waters and see if DAYS DVD's would sell would be to maybe release the three primetime specials (One Stormy Night - 1992, Night Sins - 1993, and Winter Heat - 1994) as a set.  Then if successful proceed with larger themed collections.  It would be great if DAYS were to be the soap that broke the ice for daytime soaps on DVD.  I bet all die-hard DAYS fans would go absolutely wild over having classic memorable DAYS episodes on DVD.  How 'bout it, Sony?
