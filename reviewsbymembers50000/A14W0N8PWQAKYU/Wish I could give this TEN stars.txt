 It is so awesome that Nickelodeon is launching this DVD series.  I think it will be a great way to satisfy the classic Nick lovers such as myself.    This is an awesome set.  It's so great to be able to see Clarissa Explains It All again and what makes it even better is that I can watch the episodes whenever I want.  this is highly recommended for every Clarissa fan.  And for the reviewer who asked about the Nick Time Capsule, it's an awesome collection of old Nickelodeon promos that aired between the years 1991 and 1993.  There's nine of them all together on this one.  I hope there will be more Time Capsules on future releases.  I'm especially hoping if they release "You Can't Do That On Television" that they'll include a Time Capsule that has some promos from Nick's "silver ball" logo days from the early 80's.  I'd also love to see those classic mid to late 80's promos as well.  Keep 'em comin,' Nickelodeon!
