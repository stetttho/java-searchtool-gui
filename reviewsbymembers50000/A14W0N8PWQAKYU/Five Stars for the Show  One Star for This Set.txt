 I got some horrible news from the Roseanne board at SitcomsOnline.com.  A poster e-mailed Anchor Bay and asked if this set will contain the syndicated prints, and they replied confirming that yes, the episodes will indeed be the SYNICATED prints.  (...) I really saw this coming.  When I heard about The Cosby Show set (another Carsey-Werner show) being editied, I got a sickening thought that Roseanne would be as well.  Two first class shows getting third class treatment.  Thanks for nothing, Carsey-Werner.
