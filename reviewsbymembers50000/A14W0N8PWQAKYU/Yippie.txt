 My second favorite family drama of all time (Our House ranks #1) is finally coming to DVD!  I watched this show religiously every Sunday night (back to back with America's Funniest Home Videos) when it originally aired.  Like the other vreviewer said, the only bad part is that the original theme will not be intact.  But hey, it's a small price to pay to have the show on DVD.  I urge all fans of this show to PLEASE buy this set despite the theme change.  There is a lot more to a show than just it's theme.  This show is very deserving to have all four seasons released.  I believe Warner Bros. also owns "Our House," so hopefully if this does well they'll eventually feel comfortable with releasing "Our House" as well.  First Knots Landing, now Life Goes On.  Well done, Warner!  UPDATE;  Sitcoms Online has posted a review of the set and even has an audio clip of the new theme song.  However, the original theme song is still in tact in the pilot! :)  The original closing song is in tact in the pilot as well, and the original end theme is in tact in all the other episodes.  The new theme song is alright, but the DVD reviewer was right when they said it sounds more like it's for a teen show but still catchy. The only problem I have with the new theme song is that it sounds a little too today-ish.  But it's the episodes themselves that really count and that's all that matters.  If you'd like to read the review and listen to the audio files, just go to Sitcoms Online (with your standard www. and .com after it).  Click on "DVD Reviews" in the side panel, and scroll down until you find "Life Goes On."  The reviews are in alphabetical order.
