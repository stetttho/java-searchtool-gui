 I simply cannot wait until this comes out.  I started watching the show for the first time as an adult beginning wih the second season on SOAPnet.  I've yet to see the first season, lol, so this will be a real treat.  I still think seasons 1 and 2 should have been released together but I'll take what I can get :)  With Knots lasting 14 seaosns, I sure hope Warner Bros. has some kind of schedule worked out in advance (assuming that this set will sell to Warner Bros' standards) as to how often to go about releasing the future seasons in a matter that won't take a small lifetime to complete.  I'll be sure to update and actually review this set when it comes out.
