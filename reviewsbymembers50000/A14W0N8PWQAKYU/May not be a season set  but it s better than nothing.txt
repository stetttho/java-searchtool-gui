 I totally agree that this should be a season set instead of a Best Of.  But I post at Sitcoms Online, where the voting for the episodes for the disc took place, and apparently Warner Bros. is unsure if season sets of Alice would sell well or not.  So they decided to test the waters by releasing a TV Favorites collection with 6 episodes.  If it meets their expectations, they will for certain release seaon sets, but if it doesn't sell well then there is basically no chance.    I understand it's absolutely ridiculous for us to have to buy a Best Of release in order to get season sets, but doing so for Alice would be worth it.  That's why I encourage ALL Alice fans to please buy this DVD and not boycott it because it's only a Best of release.  This DVD can make or break it's chance for season sets.  We have to make this disc a success.  The episodes on the disc are as follows:  08/31/76 Alice Gets a Pass Alice falls for an ex-football player, who is now an actor.  02/26/77 The Odd Couple Flo's trailer is stolen, and Alice has the heart to let her stay at her house for a spell. The spell is broken when Alice finds out that Flo is an all-out slob and have unwelcomed visitors (Flo's latest boyfriend, not roaches).  01/22/78 Close Encounters of the Worst Kind Hostility rages at Mel's after the workers decide to vent their petty grievances.  10/22/78 Block Those Kicks The diner personnel try to kick their bad habits.  12/02/79 Cabin Fever Mel, his girlfriend and the waitresses spend the weekend packed like sardines in a fishing cabin.  02/24/80 Flo's Farewell A wealthy Houston restaurateur offers Flo a job she finds hard to refuse.
