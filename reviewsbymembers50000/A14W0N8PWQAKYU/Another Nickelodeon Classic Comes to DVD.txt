 I think it's so exciting to see so many classic Nickelodeon shows coming out on DVD.  First Danger Mouse, then Clarissa Explains it All, Count Duckula is coming out in October, and now The Little Prince.  My memories of The Little Prince are pretty vague (heck it's been almost 20 years) but I know I loved it.  I can't wait to purchase this set, and add it to my collection of classic cartoons to keep for not only myself, but for when I have children someday and they won't see such quality programming like this anywehre.  I hope to see more and more classic Nickelodeon shows (from its glory days in the 80's especially) come to DVD.
