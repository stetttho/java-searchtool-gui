 The problem is after listening to Son House everything else seems decidedly low-octane. Compared to something like Death Letter Blues, the so-called angst of the latest boy band isn't really something for a reasonable person to get worked up about.  His lyrics always obey the "show 'em, don't tell 'em" aesthetic.  When he sings "Late in the evening, I went out on the outskirts of town; I choose me a seat, and watch the evening sun go down" you know exactly how he's feeling.  So Son House is a must.  The only question is what to buy first.  House recorded three main times: seven sides for Paramount in the 1930's, nineteen songs for Alan Lomax in the 1940's, and then this studio session in the 1960's.  I'd say that this two disk version of the Vanguard stuff is essential.  (I bought the single disk version and regretted it.)  The complete Alan Lomax field recordings are on a disk called "Complete Library of Congress Recordings 1941-1942".   The Paramount stuff is best heard on the Document CD "Complete Recorded Works".  There are some other compilations (Delta Blues, Preachin' The Blues, etc.) but they don't give you the complete picture.      I'd say buy this Vanguard stuff first.  As you move back in time the performances get more fiery, but the sound quality gets much, much worse.  So start here until you get yourself acclimatized.
