 This film, as you know by now, is about Tom Cruise hiding and fleeing and hiding and fleeing. Aliens are pursuing him, but really it could have been anything. Spiders, muggers, stevedores, women over the age of twenty five - I'm sure that under Steven Spielberg's direction he could convincingly flee from anything.  Both types of scenes - the hiding scenes and the fleeing scenes - were very exciting, of course. But did the film go far enough? I think we're on the cusp of a new world of cinema here - an entirely new genre which I choose to call the Retreat Blockbuster. To show you the potential of this brave (?) new world, I've altered some classic tales to make them more Spielbergian. Note the vast improvements.  -High Noon - When Marshall Will Kane hears that a vengeful foe is coming to town on the noon train, he courageously hops aboard the eleven-fifteen for Albuquerque.  -Star Wars - When the mighty Death Star menaces a band of rag-tag rebels, they go to the desert world of Tattooine and hide in Luke Skywalker's basement until it all blows over.  -The Searchers - When a tribe of fearsome Indians kidnaps his little niece Debby, frontier tough guy Ethan Edwards embarks on a two year quest to get the hell out of there.  -Jaws - When a great white shark attacks the peaceful resort town of Amity, Sheriff Brody applies for a transfer to Cape May, New Jersey, which he receives. Amity schmamity.  -Moby Dick - When Captain Ahab loses his leg to a ferocious white whale, he turns in his harpoon, changes his name to Bartleby, and becomes a scrivener.  There. You see how easily we can improve any story? All it takes is a little more fleeing, a little more hiding, a little more all-round passivity, and bingo - box office gold!  The special effects weren't bad.  BTW - Do you realize that a $135 million film costs well over a million dollars a minute? Pardon me whilst I hurl.
