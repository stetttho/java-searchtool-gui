 The day of the jackal without doubt was one the most powerful issues in the seventies . The story is loaded with potent realism and the characters are so well defined that it will be very difficult for you to abandon the reading. In my personal case , I read it in just one night . Forsyth wrote other brilliant best sellers but this is one of the top winners . This novel has been adapted to the screen twice , the first entrie directed for Fred Zinnemann (Edward Fox in the role of the Jackal) and the last for Michael Caton Jones (with Bruce Willis as the Jackal) .
