 First at all I never have  been a fan of Pierre Moneux. I respect him as a honest and convincing director but with some diferences. That's why I have to make a double acknowledgement in what it concerns to the final result of this Sixth Symphony performance. There have been many succesful recordings in the past: the most remarkable to my mind, have been: Furtwangler Berlin, Toscanini NBC, Van Kempen Concertgebouw, Cantelli NBC, Giulini Philharmonia and recently discovered tresured from the nineties of a Japanese conductor who sadly is not with us: Asajina with the Osaka Philharmonic. But this version shines with major intensity respect to the  previously named performances. Monteux caught the tragic spirit with such passionate intensity and febril desperation as any other conductor. Go for the Second movement and listen carefully a theme sung in Waltz form in the middle of the movement. And then go to the final movement: you will discover the same theme but expressed in tragical mood. This Symphony and Manfred anticipated as any other previous works the Mahlerian mood. Besides it revealed the final dissolution, and the cosmic farewell of his author in a very similar approach that Mahler employed with the Ninth 's final. Go for this treasured album and discover the best approach of the Sixth never released before.
