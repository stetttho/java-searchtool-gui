 I am still shocked due the loss of this superb and giant director. His integrity and artistic conviction, approach, commitment and personal statement was always under the music by itself. His readings were far beyond the score. He owned that touch of distinction so characteristic of the great conductors of the past. And I guess the real concern by the searching of the meaning of the work, the sense of the modulation, character and intention of the score do not seem nowadays a real problem. The point is that if you conduct without this premise, your role at the podium has no sense. We are talking about the singularity inside the homogeneity.  Giulini the maestro; In memoriam!
