 Filmed in the superb building of the ONU, this film has overthrown possibly all the similar films, due its absorbing character.  A President of an African nation, has developed behind this mask of victim role, a very well built stage to trick the whole world his countless murederers beneath the well known argument of the National Security.  There are so many analogies with many nations in the world pitifully, but this compelling film focuses about not only the gradual process of political puzzle, but its inner and even outer consequences; that's the case in Silvia Brome who has lived the hell before her eyes, and tries by all means to guarantee the peace and the justice in her beloved country. The long arm of the policial investigation will come perhaps with certain delay, and so meanwhile we will be the silnet witeness of a turbulent web of scandal, corruption, double cross and betray of the highest order. Sean Penn will be the assigned officer whose mission will be working out as the bodyguard of Silvia while certain facts don't fit in her previous confession. She states she listened a whisper in which she has known about a possible attempt of homicide on the figure of the President, but someone watchs her and the tension acqires a multidimensional complexity. Sidney Pollack made at last a solid, realist and passionate drama without restrictions playing hard with such script loaded of violence and undeniable actuality. Don't miss it under any circumstance this overhelming picture!
