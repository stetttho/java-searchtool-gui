 To my mind this film constitutes one of the most invaluable documents in the whole cinema story. This picture, inspired in real facts shows us the hard  combative spirit of the Dutch Resistance during the WW2. A true portrait and honest work, that meant for Paul Verhoeven his leap and allowed to Rutger Hauger to ascend in his fulgurant career. A real cult war movie all the way !
