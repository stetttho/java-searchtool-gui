 Terence Fisher directed this outstanding picture supported by the best and most reminded Dracula in the cinema story -Christopher Lee-as the Count and Van Helsing featured by Peter Cushing. The excellent reworking of Bram Stoker ` s classic story has never been best expressed on the screen. A genuine classic and with all security the best entry of  the multiple versions.  We should expect for most of thirty years for the hallucinating and very personal approach of Coppola , but despite of the fact of so many technological devices and admirable performances there are certain details (the presence of Keanu Reeves simply did not fit at all and it was a serious default), and the excesive overindulgent treatment that weakens seriously the main character, and definitively is far to reach this legendary achievement.
