 There are several undeniable arguments that make of this treasured album a real must for you. Fritz Reiner was a true champion in the orchestral direction. His obsessive frenzy for the accurate precision, his controversial personality, his profound concerns by improving the orchestral rank of almost forgotten orchestras as The Pittsburgh Symphonic, his tenacity and fierceness were unvaluable contributions in USA.  In what the performance of the Sixth Symphony, you nay consider this version is unique; conception merciless, brutal, biter and expressive without a bit of theatrality or false postures. He made a true scalpel disection with this work. The dark and somber passages if the First Movement were made with the major fullfillment level. I have tried with other versions in the market but it's impossible to find another one as this one. The third movement with its kinetic and gay rhthym, find to Reiner in the height of his directorial powers. In the final code with the percusion, he gets a ritard effect as any other else. The rest of the CD is fine, but the jewel of the crown i insist is this performance of the Sixth. Go for this Cd just before this historical and unequal recording is out of the market.
