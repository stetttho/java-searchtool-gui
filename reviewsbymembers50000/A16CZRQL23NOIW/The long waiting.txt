 I must confess this formidable film was the final product of a fortunate accident. I watched it by TV cable and due the presence of such legendary cast, it was a true must-see.   Valerio Zurlini was practically an unknown Italian director who, nevertheless, made his last Opus and at the meantime his supreme masterpiece.   The powerful significance of this metaphorical film exceeds the most encomiast epithets. In the middle of the desert there is an inexpugnable garrison, in which will coexist a group of distinguished although well different militaries; each one of them maintains crucial and particular vision about what will the next step to follow. And thanks to this admirable and solid script we will explore one by one, the gradual process of madness and isolation when the pretended combat never comes.   I don' t have any doubt to equal this glorious film at the same level of Apocalypse Now or Paths of Glory or All quiet in the Western Front.  It's time for you and the great audiences all over the world, to know about its existence. This is Giant film absolutely ignored and minimized in which its stature concerns. And I consider it among my top Fifty Great Films of any Age.  Go for this jewel and you will certainly agree with me.
