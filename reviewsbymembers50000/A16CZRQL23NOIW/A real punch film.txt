  This is a heavy weight film in every little detail. A disillusioned priest in a small village will inquire himself for a lot of issues concerned with the free will, the faith and the eloquent silence of God, the coldness of living doing without about God's belief.   This film is specially recommended for Bergman's buffs, but I would like to remind in a film of Robert Bresson : Dairy of a country priest. Watch first this last one film and please go for Winter light. You will find more similarities that you ever know.    A challenging artwork that will dare you due its punching feature. This is the second film of the celebrate Trylogy initiated with through a glass darkly and eventually would culminate with The Silence.
