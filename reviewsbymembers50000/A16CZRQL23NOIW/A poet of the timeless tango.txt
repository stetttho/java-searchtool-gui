 Piazolla was a master without restrictions . His approach to the tango is more than a simple coincidence . It was a real twist of fate . When Gardel knew about his virtouosity (being a teenager) , he requested the permission to hire him , but this petition was denied by Piazzola ' s father . That request was just the last tour in Gardel 's life . So, when Gardel dies in that no sense and stupid accident in Medellin (Colombia) , Piazzola felt the inner solitude and he decided to transform the tango and carrying to a top level . He decided to study in Paris with Nadia Boulanger and the rest is story . The Milonga del angel is one of his greatest compositions , but his expressiveness and powerful sense of musicality are out from his own time . Died on 1992 July 5 , his name keeps growing among the new music lover . Since my favorite Piazzola one is Adios Nonino (in memoriam of his recnt died father) , works such Tangedia or Mumuki are loaded of tragical mood . He composed la balada para un loco ( The ballad for a mad )sung for Amelita Baltar his wife in that age .  His status as artist has so many virtues , that you will you will be surprised with his rapture inspiration .  I was an exception witeness when I saw twice in Caracas in 1977 when Aldemaro Romero a venezuelan conductor and gifted composer invited him for The New Wave Festival playing with the  Caracas Philarmonic Orchestra , one of the best historical orchestras (if not the best) in the story of my country . Enter into Piazzola world and you will be rewarded.
