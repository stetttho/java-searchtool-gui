 There were three outstanding and bold films that faced without hindrances that thorny subject in the crudest possible way, resisting the attacks of the Moral league: Baby doll, Anatomy of a murder and this one. In the Fifties Decade: the most of filmmakers bet for one of these three options: science fiction, Noir Film or dense emotional conflicts. Of course, there were exceptions: Billy Wilder left behind his sarcastic irony with Sunset Boulevard in 1950  and decided to smile with Stalag 17 and Someone like it hot (curiously The Best Comedy in the Century), but Stanley Kramer, Otto Preminger, Elia Kazan , Samuel Fuller, Nicholas Ray and Richard Brooks were the most relevant social scalpels of the society along that dark decade.      Superb, complex and mature existential conflict around a woman who wants to be loved and her extremely heat and soul wounded husband, whose inner demons have him struggled swimming in alcohol; add to this hell the familiar pressure. Burl Ives gives an outstanding performance featuring the father in law of the grieved Miss Taylor.      Another sonorous adaptation of Tennessee Williams, who naked the soul of the North American society in the most intimate details.     Bernard Shaw wrote once: "There are married women who have not husband, while there are single women whom seem to surplus them; and one asks oneself what is better or worst: if not being corresponded by a legitimate right that belongs her or being corresponded by many rights that do not belong her."
