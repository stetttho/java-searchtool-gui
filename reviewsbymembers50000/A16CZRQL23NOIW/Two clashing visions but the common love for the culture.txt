 An emblematic script shows us a long preamble where the silence plays an important place, being by itself another invisible actor. A nazi officer during the German occupation in a small French village, after a long speech about the universal values of the culture, finally when he is capable to revert the dark side of the coin, he is set to the Eastern Front, as a fatal irony or dramatic premise to let us think about a lot of issues.   Monumental and superb film. One of those you will never forget once it invaded your brain, senses and spirit.
