 Bob Fosse was one the more brilliant minds in the story of the cinema . Gifted with that gaze of genius , left us several treasures Cabaret , Lenny , All that jazz , Star 80 , Sweet charity are undoubtly his better achievements. But this movie became a reference issue. Lenny Bruce became a hard challenge for any actor. But what Hoffman got with this role still surpases , in my point of view all his next achievements. Valerie Perrine never reached the highest peak as actress with this breathtaking performance. Her role deserved her the Prize as best actress in 1975 in the Cannes International Film Festival. The film is deeply bitter and tolds the slow but progressive decadence of Bruce Lenny : in his private life and in his creative gifts as a stand-up comedian. Filmed in glorious black and white . this film is one my personal one of the major cult movies in any time.
