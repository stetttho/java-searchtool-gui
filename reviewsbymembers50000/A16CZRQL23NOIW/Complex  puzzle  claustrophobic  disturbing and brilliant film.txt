 The first Opus in color of Michelangelo Antonioni is not an easy going film to watch. It is extremely meticulous and harrowing picture. For the first time the rarefied atmosphere of the industrial processes, the marshy environment, the unbearable machines sound, the cloudy weather originated from industrial remainders, the overpopulation metaphor in the trailer,  and the grind existential has never been expressed in the screen with such visual power and cynicism. This gradual alienation has transformed the most of persons who, accustomed to live there in that poisoning surrounding do not perceive anything altered. But this woman seems hard to adapt herself to that oppressive reality: She is under the rational perspective, to be on the verge of the madness. Her unstoppable schizophrenia and ontological loneliness, makes of her an isolated human being and the inner desolation is simply, a translation of the wrecking environmental degradation. This towering movie remains as an island film through the years. It's a bold film hard to swallow and assimilate because it hurts. The final speech between Monica Vitti and his son is one of the most demolisher, sordid, troubling, and brutally bitter in the cinema's  story. Indeed, the little birds know it and they chose to ignore that way.
