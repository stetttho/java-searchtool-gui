 The Four temperaments is one of the most emblematic Symphonies wirtten in the XX Century. It describes accurately the anguish, fears and hopeless of the actual man. The Fourth Symphony is possibly the most solid Symphony written by Nielsen. Its complex dramatic structure and its frenetic atmosphere makes a must for any lover music to know about it. This set maintains the historic interets of having been World Premeire Recordings. If I was required to recommend some othe optiuons, go for Bernstein New York for the Second Symphony and four sumptuous and very different approach for the Fourth: in this strict order: the most complete and dense version I have ever listended, it has not released yet on CD format, but fortunately I have it in vinyl: Igor Markevitch and Danish Orchestra; the very famous Zubin Metha and L.A.Philharmonic in the early Seventies, Herbert Blomsted and the Danish Orchestra and finally Ekka Pekka Salonen in the middle Seventies.
