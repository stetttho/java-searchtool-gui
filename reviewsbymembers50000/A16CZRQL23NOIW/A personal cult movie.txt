  This film is very often forgotten when you make the whole account of the great American films in any age. Artur Penn made a superb sociological portrait about the chase and wishes of revenge of the crowd with interesting insights and serious connotations. This film threw the ring to Robert Redford and gave Brando another opportunity to play an unusual and magnificent role.  And despite the multiple problems among Penn and the illumination supervisor according to Penn told in an interview with James Lipton in Inside the Actor's Studio, the film deserves a special place in the reduced golden list of the great American artistic triumphs.
