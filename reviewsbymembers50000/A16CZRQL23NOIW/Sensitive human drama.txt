 This was the third adaptation, whose Op. 1 was directed by Lewis Milestone in the early thirties The portrait focuses around the value of the friendship and shelter given to a weak mind. Two lonely men who bet for a better life and challenging it, elusive dreamers of a uncertainty future, but as you know the fate will come for them to fade. Fine performances, specially mention for John Malkovich as the defenseless human being. Sherilyn Penn made a very credible role. Her beauty runs parallel to her talent.
