 The films of Peter Greenaway are the perfect sum of craftsmanship : text , painting , photography , a minimalist script and frenetic exuberance . All the imaginable beauty and the unthinkable ugliness ; the hidden fears of the human being  the timeless evilness . Greenaway films are made such a great symphony . You can identify the four movements in every single movie of this original film maker. The happy joining with Michael Nyman was a very successful encounter . Because Nyman with his fertile creativity makes possible the most intimate motives and depicts with precision the right feeling and the implacable fate of the characters in the play. From the draughtsman' s contract . to the sinister A zed and two noughts , passing for the cynical Drowning by numbers , the merciless vengeance in The cook , the thief , his wife and her lover and finally Prospero books based in the Tempest of William Shakespeare . This album is a summation and digest of ten years of progress in the performance of musicv by a composer whom evidently is gifted and identified in his commitment , and joyous enthusiasm..
