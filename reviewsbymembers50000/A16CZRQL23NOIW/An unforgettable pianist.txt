 The best brittish pianist have been Myra Hess and Clifford Curzon . But just behind these two giants ; is John Ogdon. Once more it?s deserves to remark the amazing expresiveness of this pianist. We know about these piano concerts . They are esentially colorful concerts ; and to me Ogdon only matchs against that unforgettable greek pianist called Rena Kyriakou . who in the sixties recorded almost all the piano music. Ogdon gave not only presence but majesty to every one of these pages. Ogdon knew how to employ his musicianship under the service of the composer. His octaves and arpeggios ; his sforzandos and pianissiomos are first rate; elegance and nuance loaded his performances. I recomend too his Busoni piano concert and his Liszt recordings. I disagree with Ogdon in what Scriabin concerns. Ogdon died in 1989 and since his death it has difficult to find out an artist who can fill his place.
