 This film is top-notch description of the female universe. Possibly if you check all the previous American Filmography until this film you would surely have to build a bridge and wait for The Hours to close the cycle. Altman made a mesmerizing picture, with crucial shots and visual clues; the dragon in the bottom of the swimming pool, for instance. If you remind two stunning films of Ingmar Bergman (Persona and Cries and whispers), you feel this film is extremely linked in what spirit concerns to both of them. Altman made to my mind his most introspective work, and once more he had that special eye to find Spacek and Duvall two excellent actress for that moment.(Remember that Shelley Duvall is the wife of Nicholson in The Shinning). In this order of ideas I recomend you watch this film free of any other problem. It is not an easy going film. It will demand from you all the pssible attention and commitment. Go for this curiously little known chamber piece of Altman who after his recent succesful film Nashville (1975), a broad audience seem forget.
