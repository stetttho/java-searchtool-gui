 This was pitifully the last recording of this enfant terrible of the Rock: Roy Buchanan who still had so much to give and so much to say. He lefts us in a very early age. This album contains one of the Best Blues of hos persona career: Blues lover, extraordinary. We must mention the special version of 25 miles a remake of the original Soul singer Edwin Star of 1969. But there is still more: The instrumental Hot wires is atrue tour de force all the way; his flamboyant Flash Chordin, Country Boogie and the enrapturing Sunset over Broadway. Go for this album it's a must in your personal collection. Roy Buchanan: In memoriam!
