  Percy Aldon built a simple but haunting script in the middle of nowhere between two women. Both  will enrich the life through a set of clever and incisive vignettes. Two cultures will join the best of its nature and the result will be a very original picture.  A powerful and funny film which joins to the elder major film Babette Feast as the two greatest films dedicated to the friendship : that treasure of the Gods.
