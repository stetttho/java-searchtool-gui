 Two films of the Tavianni brothers are to my mind part of this legendary choice . This one and the night of the shooting stars .  This poignant story deals with the efforts of two poor young italians who make this long journey from Italy to the promised land in serach of a better future .  This long and pianful road will lead them by several stages till D.W. Griffith will seal their lives for ever .  But Cabiria ,this masterpiece of Giovanni Pastrone, indicates us we are in 1914 , just in the dawn of the WW1 .   And once more the cruel twist of fate will appear with all the merciless you can imagine and still more .  This is a superior , singular , artistic and original film.
