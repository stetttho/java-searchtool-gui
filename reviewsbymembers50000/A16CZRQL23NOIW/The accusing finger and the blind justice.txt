 In the name of justice not always the truth is its fellow partner. Somehow this overwhelming film opened the Gate for futures similar entries. An innocent man is convicted and even brutalized by a corrupt court system in name to preserve and undercover the appearances. As you know Paul Muni was possibly the most effective actor for this roles just before James Cagey and Bogart follow his traces. This is a moody, well done film that anticipated another wide gamut of remarkable films such as The Wrong man, The Ox Bow incident among others.  One of the most unforgettable works of Melvin LeRoy.
