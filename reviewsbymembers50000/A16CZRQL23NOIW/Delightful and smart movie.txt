 This movie is a true revelation. You`ll face a fight against the death but not tearful, just braveful.  The amazing script is simply extraordinary. All the cast is superb, specially Marie Josee Croze, winner in Cannes 2003 like best actress. Watch this film and consider it from now a new classic canadian cinema. And remeber Tarkovski`s statement: The death doesn`t exist, just the fear to it.
