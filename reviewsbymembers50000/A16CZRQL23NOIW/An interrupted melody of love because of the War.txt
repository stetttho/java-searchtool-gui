 This is a wonderful and carefully sculpted script on the nature of the art and impossible love. A Polish widow and an American Soldier joined and ironically separated for the invisible barriers of a bloody War: Affections, memories under Chopin 's music will allow us to establish an immediate link with that unforgettable gem of the late Forties: Jean Pierre Melville 's  The Silence of the sea.  A haunting and poignant portrait around the unsaid of the War' s legacy.   Maja Komorowska 's towering acting!
