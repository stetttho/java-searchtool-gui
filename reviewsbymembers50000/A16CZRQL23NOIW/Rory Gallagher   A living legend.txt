 The charismatic magnetism can be felt in this admirable CD.  Ain't no sadnt is a very rhythmic blues with fresh acoustic guitar and beating riffs .  The loop is a frenetic instrumental  rock & roll piece , and calling card is a very fine piece ; as the crow flies is a peaceful blues in the purest country style. Off the handle is a very expressive blues song loaded with too much feeling and may be well the crown jewel . Back on my stomping ground is a rock & roll piece with the purest essence of the fifties ; Empire state express is a very well played blues theme and one of the best tracks.  Continental op and Skin kicker is the most pop rock song of the album ; it sounds so fresh and so innovative that you'll find it hard to believe and while Public enemy is an excellent blues , Pistol slapper blues  may be the weakest theme in the selection . Don't start is a vivid blues piece with interesting approach who reminds to John Mayall , in which concerns to harmonica use : Nothing with the devil is a simple divertiment and while Alexis is a very good rhythmic instrumental song Barley and Grape bag we are carried for the seducting acoustic guitar to the folk essences ; optimist and nice beating. In sum from one to ten this album has 9,7 points.
