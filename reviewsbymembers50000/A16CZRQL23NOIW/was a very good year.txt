 This book may appear without reserves and by own right - next to Milton ` s Aeropagitica", Locke ' s "Essay about the Civil Government", Rousseau `s  Social Contract" in the enviable gallery of works of political combat that, still determine capital influence on the mankind. This is a vibrant and passionate defense about the thinking and expression liberties, a vehement apology of the tolerance and respect beliefs or dissident minorities, a fearless recovery around the human spontaneity and singularity against the exerted oppression by authorities, costumes or public opinion.   Under the lucid perspective of the elapsed years, this was a visionary text whose importance perhaps still has not been evaluated in all its wholeness.
