 Two Goddesses in the violin playing along the XX century: Erica Morini and Ginette Neveu would enlighten and even astonish the whole world with her impeccable refinement.  Morini combined the balanced technique with expression; temperament with lyricism and tune with majesty; an authentic artist, by definition creates atmospheres; no matter what plays, is the absolute domain of the score conceived as mean and not a goal by itself. Her vibrant performances are the final result of the always desired link between soul, mind, heart and fingering.  From the first bars, you realize about her grandness; eloquent sound and perceptive handle of the thematic material. She confers Tchaikovsky of verbosity and universality, enriching in this sense the sense of the score. Her Brahms although does not reach the passionate incandescence of Neveu, is superbly articulated, warmth and fierce. To get such tonal balance is nothing easy because the temptation to play Brahms just only under a romantic approach is enormous by the most of soloists.  Artur Rodzinski is another important variable in this superb achievement. His gifts as conductor are extraordinary. He knows his role as accompanier, rather than soloist; a virtue by itself that many conductors tend to neglect or minimize.  A fundamental and quite relevant musical treasure.
