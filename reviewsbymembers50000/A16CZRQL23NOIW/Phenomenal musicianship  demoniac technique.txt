 Michael Ponti won the First Prize in 1964 in the Busoni competition. And despite he is American, he resides in Europe since 1955. His debut in Carnegie Hall 1972 was successful, receiving the nickname: "The Horowitz of the new generations." The first half Ponti played Brahms Haendel Variations. The performance is simply overwhelming; each variation is played with special emphasis, trying to underline the intrinsic values and recreating them with humor, vigor, nuance and rapture. Powerful imagination and sublime musicality make of this version one of my five favorite ever recorded. The quintet is completed by Julius Katchen,  Rudolf Serkin, Claudio Arrau and Lincoln Mayorga. The second half was devoted to Schumann. His Carnaval is very expressive filled of details and sensibility far from being effeminate. Kinderszenen Op. 15 is lovable and touching with accurate phrasing.  The encores were two Romances sans paroles of Mendelssohn Op. 85 No. 4 and p. 67 No. 4. Go for this dazzling performance. You won't believe it.        This is a live recording made in Munich 1987, on a Bechstein.
