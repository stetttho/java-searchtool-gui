 Almodovar reached the highest peak with this imaginative, potent, original and powerful movie.  A disturbed man of introspective character falls in love with the woman of his dreams , his muse . Suddenly she will have an awful accident who will allow to Almodovar to make an intimate jouney through the psiquis and the hidden feelings of that anonymus guy who will become in his fellow guardian . The caleidoscopic , arresting and surrealist images will envolve the viewer in a complex web of unthinkable situations in which the love and death will act as a perfect syncronized mechanism of watch . This film awarded the best original script , but in my personal point of view , this work is by far the best achievement of the notable career of this talented and irreverent film maker in this well gifted generation of spanish directors. Superb in all its powerful meaning .
