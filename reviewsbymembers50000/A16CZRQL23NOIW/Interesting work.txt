  Interesting album but let's go by stages.  Wait is very commercial song with interesting twists .   Your love is stranger than mine shows somehow the far influence of Yes .   Eye of the storm is a very smooth piece of instrumental character with Mini Moog flute by Kit with military rhythms.   Who we are is has a character strongly imported from the jazz. which reminded me immediately to the first Metheny . The guitar never plays in a leader mood . It is a reminiscent ballad easy to listen.  Survival is a sad and very brief instrumental piece (1:04).  Hymn to her is one of the most solid and expressive themes. Drawn with elusive atmosphere and interesting rhythmical metamorphosis. Once more the echoes of Yes resound with notable masterful.  Neon magic looks back the rock roots. It promises with a surprising character typically commercial.  Remote romance is a very extremely original piece. The bass initiates the song with original curtains. But the chorus looks like imported from the Yes group.          Ice is the crown's jewel and justifies by itself the buy of this CD.. The fortunate combination between guitar an piano announces the main theme.  a crying lament exquisitely phrased in a quiet mood. The guitar will take the leadership and draw a slender musical ellipsis which will finish in a very intriguing melody. Excellent theme.
