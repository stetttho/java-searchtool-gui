 Since his son is arrested due a political murder, his father-a watchmaker who lives in Lyon is mortified to learn this awful new.  He will employ all the tools ofhis office to analyze, scrutinize and inspect all the related issues of this political murder. This was the first feature film of this famous French director.  Overwhelming acting of Noiret,as always. A slow paced film which will reward you!
