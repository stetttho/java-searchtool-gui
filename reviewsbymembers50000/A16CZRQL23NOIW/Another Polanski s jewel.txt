 Few years after the painful personal tragedy of this gifted director, he decided to materialize this sad love story with a wonderful photography, an unforgettable soundtrack, an astonishing cast and a slow paced but perfectly articulated script. As all we know the everlasting prejudices and moral conventions do not belong to a specific country, religious beliefs, or citizenship. These rules remain in the unconscious collective, if you just want an supported evidence, go for Effie Briest in Germany and Madame Bovary in France.  These portraits are not more than the final result of a consequence of the inability to get the true culmination inside the individual sphere of the triumph of love between the couple, this failure has its more important testimony in the King Artur's legend and this seems a remarkable point because this is simply the most important myth of the Western World.  This film meant to the endless beauty Natasha Kinski to be known.  Admirable and highly recommended artwork.
