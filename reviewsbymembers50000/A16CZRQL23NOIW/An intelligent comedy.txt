 As you know King Arthur is one of the most (if not the most) reminded character of the Western tradition that overpasses by far the kingdom's domains to inscribe in the essential paradigm and meaning about the lost values and the inability to get a true and effective unity in the love. All happiness is far to be innocent said Jean Anouilh. And the story of Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot will be engaging to millions and millions future readers over and over again. The mythic roots are too powerful and survive far beyond any other circumstance or religious belief. Monthy Phyton makes a fantastic turn of page about this legend and precisely due its black humor doses, put us in context with some revelations that can not be told by reasons politically correct. The sense of irreverence, and sharp deformation of the personages helps still more to get a closer approach to the meaning of this legend.  Go for this ever lasting cult movie and if I may express with absolute sincerity this is the real masterpiece of that legendary ensemble.
