 The perverse reasoning hides behind the suspect: tacit agreement, unconscious behavior, the thin curtain that rules and evolves the essential basis of the human relations is broken. The horror and the magnitude of its repercussions escapes from the scope of legal norms due its unexpected appearance. The terrorist is basically a night creature, a bewildered personality who finds shelter and satisfaction in the collective suffering and the absence of guilty, he simply endorses his moral reliability, masked behind the anonymate and the ideological flags clamor. In ancestral times, the terrorism was focused on public personalities, the case of Archduke Fernando in Sarajevo 1914 is perhaps the most significant evidence. But now the terrorism has specialized, spread and diversified in its targets; the politic mobile has transformed from prime host into a sub category: you can classify them according a quite number of phobias, distorted beliefs, emotional upheavals the perfect expansive outlet to express any disagreement of any nature.  Somehow the terrorism has democratized itself. The ancestral behavior codes that reveal a profound discontent, an enervate collective state anguish constitute motives to build an organization. This book presents a systematic analysis made by experts about definitive themes as the moral problem, the transfer of blame, the possible legal rights of the terrorists, the laws of the war and the terrorism. A book of passionately fond content. Don't miss it under no circumstance
