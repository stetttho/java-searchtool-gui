 Carpenter stroke in the middle of a  myth and became it in a horror story . It is more than obvious the remarkable influence of Hitchcock in the behavior of Michael Meyers as a murder whose mental breakdown is ruled stiffly by serious and disturbing prejudgements installed in his psiquis a long time ago . He punishes all those people who deflect from the right way of the moral and good customes . Halloween is a fundamental ritual in all the western world . It allows us drowning in the underworld and enjoy just for a night this funny encounter with the otherness , a brief moment with the unreality . When Jean Cocteau filmed Orpheus in the last forties , he showed with outstanding  mastery the otherness behind the mirror . That jump to the dark world was absorbed for Carpenter and employed with all the available effects in that age . The result was amazing. Having earned $50 million on a meager $320.000 investment, Halloween still ranks as one of the most  winner movies of all time . Carpenter plays hard around the concept of dislocation and lack of ubiquity. He made the most significative use of the wide frame which allowed him to obtain some frightening visuals . Notice these two related circumstances : Jamie Lee Curtis is the daughter of Janet Leigh the victim in Psycho and the inner dragons present in the disturbed mind of Michael Myers are very similar to those in Mr. Bates in Psycho. Notice Alan Bates murdered Leigh , who was an adultery and besides stole $ 40.000  , while Myers in its puritanical morality cleaning murders the sexually promiscuous Judith, Annie and Lynda and forgiving? The only virgin of the group : Laurie . Obviously there are another points of view my kind reader , such as the fact of opening the gate for future sequels . Pleasance as Loomis is great and Curtis wonderful in her role . An instantaneous cult movie from its initial release.
