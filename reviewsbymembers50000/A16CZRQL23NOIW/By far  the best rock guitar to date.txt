 Satriani is the state of art, about playing guitar. He is an outstanding musician and over all , he owns a powerful creativity.  This double album offers some good examples of his musicianship. The extremist is one of the best tracks, but seen as a whole, you are rewarded extremely, because Satriani never let you down.  I havent the DVD yet, but it must be worthy to have it. In Film and arts Ive watched Joe at least six times. Satriani has a strong presence in the stage, and considering the prodigius Steve Vai, Id rather set both of them in the pantheon of the guitar rock in this moment. Anyway Satriani and his talented pupil Vai are the alha and omega in the craft playing rock guitar.  And for those who still think the rock is dead, listen Satriani and youll change your mind faster than the first track of any CD finishes. Dont miss this album.
