 This recording is another file treasure of every lover classical music. This achievement since his first release in 1958 became in a cult recording. I never had it in vynil record, but I acquired since his release in CD. The epical approach given by Dorati and the commitment and histamina offered by the 120 musicians of The Minneapolis Orchestra, is now part of a legend. The sound gotten by Mercury Records made a landmark in the recording story.  Dorati literally took this well known piece and carried to cosmical level.  I remeber a very interesting commentary of Glenn Gould about this solemn overture. He stated this score contained folk melodies and even religious hymns.  Obviously, the celebration over the French Army in 1812, let you establish a clear similitude between it and the Marselleise hymn, which makes the second national hymn in Russia. Nowadadays this epic sense has lost. We only have the knowledge but we lack the experience. In the ancient times it made history: but today we only study and analyze it. Today we are more civilizated, but the achievements made under this new approach do not look like so shocking. That is what it could explain why we watch all this glorious generation of past conductors as if they were from other world, and we admire in the same way that we do with the great painters from the past. We go to the musseum , we feel its huge expressive force and that sensation dissapears when we leave the hall. What a pitty! In mythological terms, we have reduced Dyonisius to ashes and we have celebrated just the apollinean sound.   Vow by the Minneapolis orchestra , and a special ackonowledgement to the percussionists. Buy this one and you will be always eternally awarded.
