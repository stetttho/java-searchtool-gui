 This version is simply overwheelming. Kogan is a supergifted violinist.( I like above Oistrakh ).His caucassian poetry, the monumental histamina and energy seem to have no limits. Believe or not Kogan makes sing the violin even in the most difficult passages. His cadenza at the end of the first movement is unbelievable. The sense of urgence, Kogan makes that Apolo and Dionisio become just one. His vibrato, the sensual brightness,  doesn`t match with the fiercy, wildness and bravura that this works demands. And it`s important to make it clear because Paganini was a composer that literally exploited the instrument. And a crowd of violinist go through the legend and forget the devilness enchantment filled with nostalghia, melancholy and sorrow; in this sense I think this is the most difficult of the six concerts for violin . The references of Ivry Gitlis, Stern, Grumiaux and Accardo are okay. But all those lack of that devil madness and titanic power that in hands of Kogan the notes reveal us. Dont think it even twice. If you are a Kogan`s fan this commentary is unnecesary but if you suppose that Kogan is a simple virtuoso, try with this and you`ll change your mind just before that the first movement concludes.  I swear you.
