 Splendid and vivid adaptation of Zola's play. Emile Zola was the real father of the French realism, his literary style is extremely reiterative about the minuscule insights in the human soul. He focuses on the tribulations and little triumphs and defeats of the middle class and poor families in a French in transient process toward the Industrial Revolution. In certain way he is the counterpart of Charles Dickens in France, despite he is less optimist. A woman makes the best she can, struggling and fighting against the odds till finally she gives up and succumbs to tawdry life of his drunk man. Another triumph of Rene Clement! Why hasn't it been released on DVD format?  A supreme riddle.
