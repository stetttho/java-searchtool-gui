 This album contains the cream of the cream about Kenny Rogers , his first steps just in the rise of his unbeatable career .  Something's burning , Ruby don't take your love to town or Ruben James are among the most representative and emblematic of this ensemble with clear country influences , but his compositions are made with broad gusto , rhytms and excellent arrangements . This album still remains as a classic in the glorious sixtioes decade . If you are a hard fan of the Kenny Rogers from 1977 to 2004 , please turn around the clock , go back to his origins and you will be rewarded with this melodic voice.
