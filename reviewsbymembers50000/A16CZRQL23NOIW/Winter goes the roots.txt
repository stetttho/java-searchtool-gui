 Edgar Winter made it . This recording is remarkable. It contains memorable tracks. Good o'shoe is a country folk blues well made , the rhythmic section is excellent . The onions is another folk song with chorus and a style who reminds me too much to Leon Russell in the seventies . Texas may be well one the three best tracks of the CD . The potent voice combines with the most original country folk mood . Time millennium is a hard piece , with strong presence . Trumpets and guitar blend in a very interesting approach and a very solid built theme. White man's blues is a punch theme . And to me the most solid track of the CD
