 The fervent sense of dramatis personae in these difficult passages of these dissonant piano concerts demands the most exigent domain of the instrument as well a notable conductor. When Bartok stated in 1905 : The dissonance ` s empire is mine , certainly he was so far from being lying . Ferenc Fricsay and Geza Anda gave the best of their craftsmanship to record one of the most notable and above all idiomatic readings of these concerts . But besides , if you get the Piano Concerts with Gyorgy Sandor (The Complete Piano Concerts with Michael Gielen in the fifties) and a hard to find recording with Fricsay in 1955 with The Vienna Synphony , you will have the essential spirit of this notable composers . But these recordings are priority. In addition , I recommend you a hidden and two distant recordings of Sandor Ormandy in the Bartok Premiere Third piano and the historic Barok Premiere Third Piano concerto in Europe given for the couple Louis Kentner - Adrian Boult  . There was an outstanding Hungarian pianist in the thirties named Edith Farnadi who recorded an excels Liszt but I have got nothing about Bartok , but after listening to her it will be hard to fail ; as well any recording made for Annie Fisher , Zoltan Kocsis and more recently Andras Schiff .  It is not a mere casuality all these named performers are Hungarian . The only point to remark is to these last interpreters that to make a journey with Bela Bartok demands a conduction and such level of commitment that hardly you will be able to find after Fricsay and Kertesz 's deaths . You may argue than Georg Solti and  Istvan Kertesz were remarkable conductors. Yes indeed but I have always thought Solti was an overrated director and besides Solti and Kertesz established with Bartok a distant approach . Solti conducted more Orchestral pieces than Kertsesz but ironically they never found a high caliber pianist to play Bartok piano concertos   Acquire this set . It will reward you. I give you my word.
