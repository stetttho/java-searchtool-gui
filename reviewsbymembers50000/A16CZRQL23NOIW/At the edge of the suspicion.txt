 A Hollywood screenwriter literally swims in alcohol; his unbearable temperament and bitter character is not precisely his best recommendation chart. An unknown woman comes for him to visit with a febrile idea, but soon his kind manners will determine her departure. She will be found dead and consequently he will arouse even without wishing it, the immediate suspicion. His alluring neighbor (the exquisite Gloria Grahame) will defend him alleging she saw the woman leaving his apartment alone.   They will fall in love but once again, his unstoppable character will be building an invisible barrier between them, when she begins to suspect if she was wrong to protect him.  Nicholas Ray had a clinical eye for those dark personages and bleak future. Think in the dramatis personae around Bitter Victory, for instance. The weight of the guilty and the excesses derived from it are a perpetual mobile. Moreover they are unconsciously instigator factors, that even affect and determine future miscarried behavior patterns around them, as we will realize in Rebel without a cause    But the inner world of the characters is another subject to analyze. Their lives are surrounded of dark clouds and that works out as a true barrier who isolates them respect the outer world, condemning them beforehand.  Bogart shines in this formidable and stylized chamber noir.   Go for it.
