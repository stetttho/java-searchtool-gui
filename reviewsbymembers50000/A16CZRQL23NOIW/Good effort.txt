 Malkovich made a worthy effort to carry this movie to the promised land but the script is the ship that allows you to reach the goal and this is the fault of this movie. The script lacks the dramatic continuity , you feel the ravishing presence of Javier Bardem , but a good cast doesn't garantee you a good result. The narrative web which supports the drama is fragile , and obviously the film results predictable at the end. Laura Morante makes a good work .  Stunning visual locations.
