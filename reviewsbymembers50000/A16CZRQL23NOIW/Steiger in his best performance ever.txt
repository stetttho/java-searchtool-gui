 The Steiger acting in this film is even better than his role in The heat of the night - 1967 - which deserved him an Academy Award . The magnificent Lumet camera work and the meticulous script around a disturbed man whose mental wounds from the WW2 still makes him company . Inmersed in his own world (or jail) he is a pawnbroker jew and lives in an isolated way . He has no friends and  he experiences very often , the ancient and painful memories about the Nazi violence on his father and him as a child in the war . The introverted character will carry him to a lot of unpredictable and challenging situations in which you will notice the mind hell in this ill man , with the unavoidable tragic consequences .  Superb movie.
