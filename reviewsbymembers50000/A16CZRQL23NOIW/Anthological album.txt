 If Magical Mystery tour may be considered as the First work of a transient trilogy that continued with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, the White Album would be without doubt, the successful culmination of a true metamorphosis and musical improvement conceived as perpetual innovations and new sounds.  In White Album we have the confluence of rhythms, challenging newness in the musical language, forerunner sonorities for the age that we just could have found in outstanding bands such as Vanilla Fudge, Led Zepellin, Cream, or Jimmy Hendrix `s experience among the most remarkable ones.  The astonishing mood and rapture creativeness could be easily compared with a volcano in eruption. The genius touch of the Beatles was the accurate ensemble of easy going themes for great audiences as O- bla-di O- bla-da and Revolution both versions, delicate country folk influence themes such as Bungalow Bill, Cry, baby cry and Honey pie, soft ballades as Julia (one of their best songs), I will, Good bye, Dear Prudence and Martha my dear, an irreverent and anti establishment (for the age) song  like Back in the USRR with authentic outpost songs such the impressive While my guitar keeps gently,  Helter- skelter, (Notice the Finale and then go for Doors The Soft Parade), I' m so tired,  Happiness is a warm gun, for not make mention about premonitory echoes, spelling mystery and higher spirits suggested in Number Nine and the song whose title may be placed among the longest title ever written for a song in Record Guinness, I `m talking about "Everybody gets something to hide except to me and my monkey." How to deny the marked influence of this album in late bands such as Gentle Giant, REM, Police?   This album is not only a superlative and mile-stone record but besides part of the rock mythology if you let me put me on this way.
