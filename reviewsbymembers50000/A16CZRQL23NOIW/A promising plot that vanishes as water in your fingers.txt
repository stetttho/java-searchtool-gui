 The use of Le Sacre du prientemps of Igor Stravinsky was a magnificent device to describe the brutal murderer in the first shot of this sordid thriller where Palmitieri as the chess mind and Fiorentino as the sexiest femme fatale after Sharon Stone (Basic instints ) and Madeleine Stowe (China Moon) makes of this film a watchable work . The car chase in San Francisco is a sincere tribute to Bullit but the raising promising script falls down and lacks of real punch at the end . But luckily the craft of Friedkin saves this film of a worst destiny . Still we expect much more of that veteran director . He is very close related with that scope typical of that master film maker who was John Frankenheimer . And that is the sin of that movie ; its lack of perspective . It remains just in the anechdotical episode .
