 A brutal tragedy around the lives of five beautiful girls whose ages in perfect tandem (13, 14,15,16,17)  living the best and unforgettable years of their lives (in the supposed case they were living under normal conditions) in Michigan; you easily may deduce we are in the early seventies, the music by itself is another guest actor.  The possessive, repressive and authoritarian character of an unhappy and visibly unsatisfied mother will exert around all the members of that family, will be undermining all the illusions, dreams and hopes of these teenagers, avoiding them all sort of social contact.   Under this isolation state, the music and the geographical magazines will feed their fragile world, since all possible communication is broken. The social conventions, the rigid moral, the narrow state of mind of both parents, plus the accented religious fervor will be creating an increasing state of boiling point with unexpected consequences.   James Woods as the weakest, dominated husband through his unwarranted behavior added his little grain of sand in this brutal nightmare, and Kathleen Turner as the implacable mother are splendid. The marvelous camera handle and the smart visual effects work out as a huge radiography that explores that impaired way of thinking.    The moral when is formal, devours. And here you have an awful proof.     Promisory debut of Miss Sophie Coppola.
