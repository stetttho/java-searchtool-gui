 This movie is great. The depicted character of the human being , his inner thoughts, his fears in the battlefield , the sense of no sense proportions of the general inmediatly reminds us to Paths of Glory , where the order to advance is just a suicide as wisely the captain answers by radio. The Guadalcanal is now part of the story ; but Malick made much more than a war film . The camera shows you the different characters and points of view without tearful manipulation as Platoon , for instance.  Who's the good guy and who's the bad?  Nolte and Penn are magnificent in their respective roles and Harrelson played a very believable role. Superb photograph and dazzling direction! A real winner film!
