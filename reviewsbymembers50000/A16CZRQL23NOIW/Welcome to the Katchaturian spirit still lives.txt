 Tjeknavorian is terrific in this admirable tour de force along the most representative works of this unforgettable colorist composer Aram Katchaturian (1905-1978) I thought that the last word in The Suite Gayaneh came from an old vynil recording of Efrem Kurtz the New York Philarmonic in those fifties, but I still remember how wondered I was when I listened this version thanks to a friend who love the Russian music . Gayaneh is played with such wildful rage , and so expressiveness that you will be uncapable to find another version in the market  that even it gets closer and less to pretend be at the same level .  The Sabre dance is simply out of this world , plenty of force and presence : The Lullaby is exquisite . The music suggets as any other reading the oriental landscapes , the oriental pomp and circumstance . The Masquerade Suite is simply radiant and Spartacus is filled with hard beat and filled heart expression . The Caucasian Sketches is another big point .to its favour . Acquire this CD , it will be a wise choice.
