 The amazing introduction in which we watch two puppets conducted by versatile hands works out into perfection because the best is yet to come.  This is one of those few films you love from the first five minutes running time. This a genial cross between Terry Gilliam, Luis Buuel and Woody Allen. Surreal and irreverent; caustic and astonishing; unexpected and provocative.  In the seven and a half floor of a building ( a hidden homage to the desperation and troubles of Marcello in 8  perhaps?), the people is obligated to walk like a hunchback and this several deviation leads to unexplored realities. This bizarre office encloses a secret; a portal - an illegal but unexpected device - who lands in the intimate territory of John Malkovich 's mind. During fifteen minutes. Interesting cipher: Do you remember my kind reader about the famous fifteen glory minutes of every human being must live according Andy Warhol?        Three different attitudes will turn around that surprising discovery : admiration in first instance and then a clever vehicle to get his unstoppable desire by John Cussack, a gold mine to make easy money by his job partner and the unexpected reaction of his beloved wife who discovers - a Woody Allen typical lure - behind her exaggerated devotion for the animals (their home is almost a zoo) the true sexual vocation.  As  you may expect the existential anguish, delirious obsession, greed and the cruel torture that means for Malkovich when he feels invaded his intimacy for outer Peeping Toms will make o you to break the logic links and enjoy and plunge in those weird but not least funny and hyper original script.  Two previous movies come to my mind that may be close in this sense: All of me and Zelig, both films deconstruct the ego and rebuild them, but demanding its prize (nothing is free).  John Cussack is terrific in his role. He is nowadays, one of the most versatile and talented actors of the American Cinema. Cameron Daz is brilliant as the neurotic wife and finally a sincere ovation for the artistic direction.
