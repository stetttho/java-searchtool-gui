 Under the perspective of forty elapsed years it 's easy to understand the narrow existent distance respect to "High and Low" or "The Bad sleep well" in which Kurosawa develops similar concerns.  A peculiar Samurai (Toshiro Mifune in another terrific performance) is recruited as teacher and spiritual guide in nasty corrupt times (any similarity with those times is a simple coincidence). He will advise and help against this villain, through a set of admirable vignettes and fabulous sense of humor.        This the sequel to Yojimbo.
