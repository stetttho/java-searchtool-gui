  This masterwork around the awful disgrace of a man who just can move his only foot is a wisdom experience of life about how strive against the adversity and the fate.   Superb performance of Daniel Day Lewis and overwhelming acting of Brenda Fricker who were happy winners of the Academy Award.  A must see and a towering film.
