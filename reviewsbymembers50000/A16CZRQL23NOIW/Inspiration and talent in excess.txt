 Two remarkable talents of the Nineties landed in such fertile land. The guitar was the great instrument along this decade. From Pat Metheny to Lee ritenour, from Petre White to Chcuk Loeb, from Craig Chaquico to Larry Carlton, from Othmar Liebert tio Chris Spheeris.  This gifted musician gives us one of his most inspired works. Aria is a moving ballad inspired in Arabian airs. Margarita finds him in a very touching theme with far echoes of Flamenco. Embrace is the  best track; his incandescent charm plenty of suggestive moods, is a true pleasure for higher spirits. Gypsy airs involve Culture. Bombay is a smooth piece in high inspiration. One is a very good theme filled with marked Indian influence. One could affirm it was written for Ravi Shankar.  A gratifying album that will overpass your expectations.
