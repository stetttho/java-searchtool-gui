 The smart script from Bernard Shaw made it possible this monumental film. The myth of Pygmalion was translated to cinema with a dazzling direction and obviously one supeb cast ; this couple Leslie Howard and the always beautiful and charming Wendy Hiller stealed the show. The tale about a poor girl who sells flowers in Covent Garden; a gamble between two men; the awake as human being is a match against all a new world of possibilities for this woman who suudenly transforms before us and everybody in a woman with class, charming and glamour. All the script is filled with ingenious and laughable situations with that clever sense of humor, so typical of Shaw. This unique match will impact the life of these three people with unthinkable consequences. A delightful movie and one of the best english comedies ever filmed.  Remade in 1964 as My fair lady. But this one is one million years light better. A must in your collection.
