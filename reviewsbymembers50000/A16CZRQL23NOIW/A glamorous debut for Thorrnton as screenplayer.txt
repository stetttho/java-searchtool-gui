 Billy BobThornton and James Woods are one the most original and challenging actors in the american cinema. Thornton won a deserved award as best screenplayer in 1996. The script turns around ritarded man who paid a sentence by a murder. Since this point of view; our character is a veryu isolated man who suddenly befriends with a child emotionally hurted. The links between them will grow, till the time will come for him to make another justice act. In this state of things , at the end of the movie youll still be thinking if the justice could have been better done in a rational world. There are many important issues in that film; specially the depict of characters. Thornton is so well screnplayer as an actor. We really expect much more about his future works. He keeps to date as true promising hope. Watch this one. Its a little gem.
