 It is useless to carve in relief the astonishing abilities of this legendary musician. Jarrett in this time makes an impressive tour de force around the most remarkable ambassadors of the jazz. Old folks is a sensitive version original of Willard Robinson. Jarrett is fine creator of atmospheres and his playing texture flows with such accurateness and brightness that you can consider be listening ten pianist in one. When musicians of the artistic stature of Jack De Johnette and Gary Peacock decided to rejoin him after Standards Vol. I and Vol. II, there was that invisible and necessary rapport. Woody in you is an admirable exercise of virtuousness and expressive elegance. Blame me it on my youth is the most introspective piece. Surrounded of a nocturnal breath and lyrical mood, sensitivity and outstanding refinement. Body and soul is a towering classic and Jarrett makes an extraordinary rendition of this work. In sum one of the most interesting works of this overwhelming musician.
