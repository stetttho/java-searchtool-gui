 This kaleidoscopic movie has certain highlights: structurally well made, with the taste and enrapturing company of the wine: this emblematic friendship drink. Around the standpoints of this kind connoisseur, we assist to a  road movie about two extremely closed friends: emotionally they are separated 180o  . One of them is profoundly depressed since his divorce two years ago, he has been unable to forget his ex wife Vicky ; he is a literature teacher and waits for the approbation for publishing his last auto biographical novel. He decides to make a true gift to his friend : an ex actor who finds himself at the edge of the collective forgetfulness, his narcissism rules and sharps his behavior with the women. Both of them are too worried by the pass of time and try to revive their vanished university experiences. Along the road they will meet two women: both of them are somehow the mirror image: they are divorced and find in the wine a good reason to live.  The story maintains the surprise element in its two thirds parts: in fact our loser, isolated, frustrated and desperate writer seems to be emerged from the Woody Allen imagination: his memories don't allow to grow up and enjoy the little details the life gives us; his wine dissertations are cerebral  But the film experiments a lack of creative breath since the announcement of Jack's marriage to Maya. From that instant the inspiration's light lacks intensity and the story becomes predictable: the magic starts to vanish.  Virginia Madsen is terrific with this role that deserved her  a nomination in the Academy Awards. But we have to recognize and even celebrate the great return of the author cinema: there are some flashes in the script that remind me to the French filmmaker: Eric Rohmer. Visually arresting, the picture is a true hidden homage to the French New Wave and the savoir vivre!.
