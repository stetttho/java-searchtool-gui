 The talent and good taste are factors that have supported and molded the astonishing and brilliant career of this notable artist. The impeccable and surprising musical arrangements make of Michael a true living legend, just a few artists know to keep the profile and originality through the time.  From Jesus to a child to Careless whispers, there is great blend of known rhythms, and inspired themes that seem to reinvent themselves day after day.   Like the Beatles four decades ago, this untiring capacity of self renovation  makes this set remains as true timelessness songs that will reward you by far today and for a long time.   That quality that so many seek and just a few can find it is the symptom of genius.
