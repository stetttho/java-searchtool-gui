  Pat Metheny could make it perhaps the best smooth guitar album in the year. In this time we find to Pat under the midnight spell with an impressive selection of slender melodies and the remarkable supporting of Charlie Haden in the bass. From the first track to the last one you will amaze and engage immediately. Metheny decide to pay his personal tribute to the lyric guitar under the candlelight. Thanks to a very missed girl who gave me her last present, I found myself extremely and powerful amazed from the first time I listened it. And since that moment I became a profound fan of this album, enjoying with avidity and immense pleasure.  Do not doubt for a moment. This album is great and I recommend you without reserves.
