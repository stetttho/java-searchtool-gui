 Casals literally stole for himself the primacy in what concerns about how it must be performed. He got one of his major achievements with the wonderful rapport with Szell and the Czech Philarmonic in 1938. The others performers may fight for the second place but this recording has become in a standard issue : a model! Filled with inner force , lyricism and ravishimg commitment. The New World is well played ,but there are more remarkable gladiators : Fricsay , Talich , Kertesz , Kubelik , De Sabata . This is a must in your collection. Don't think it twice.
