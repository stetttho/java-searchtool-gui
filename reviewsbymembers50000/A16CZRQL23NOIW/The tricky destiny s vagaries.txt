  Erick Zonca in his first feature film proved from the initial shots he is one the real hopes for the French Cinema in the actual ages. He accuses the notable and auspicious influence of three great film makers like Erick Rohmer , bits of Wenders's eighties and Buuel posthumous film. Two young women with very opposite characters. You could said one is the reverse side of the coin of the another one. They will become very close friends until the love interposes between them when they fall in love of the same man.  The script would seem very predictable but as always happens with the master directors you feel the pulse of a poet behind the camera. The superb performances of both actresses are also a main ingredient when you make the sum of the inner virtues of this overwhelming film, that figures in my personal list of the top twenty films ever made in the Nineties decade.
