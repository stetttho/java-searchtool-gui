 The tension social state in USA in those ages was practically reaching the boiling point. There were many conflicts issues and counter faced items. The collective self esteem was extremely low: evasion, scandals, affairs. When that happens you need to recreate another vision in the movies and many times you must apply the same process suffered by Alexander in the Clockwise Orange; this shock therapy may provoke a natural escape in the social body. That's why this Wave of catastrophes in the screen gave so very good profits. Somehow Airport  was the pivot and the different maneuvers were perfectly articulated: Poseidon Adventure, a terrible sea accident, and then a natural phenomena: Earthquake, but something missed to complete the cycle. A tragedy based in the violation of norms of Industrial Security, with the subsequent homage to the Firemen, trying to warn about the possible effects derived from risky actions to minimize operational costs.  The rest of the story follows the ancient patterns of this genre: the abnegate fireman, the modern hero who will lose his life, a love affair, a sinister character, a couple in trouble who eventually will rejoin and all the well known premises that you may guess.  Admirable from all standpoint with impressive special effects to that age; I insist in that point due the technology has experimented such advance level that the new generations will establish the respective differences with let's say Titanic. But it's good to advert that this young generation, in 2020 will suffer the same smile of that generation. Many people tend to forget, the life is simple cycle. Steve Mac Queen and Faye Dunaway shone above the rest of the cast. Dazzling direction. Highly recommended.
