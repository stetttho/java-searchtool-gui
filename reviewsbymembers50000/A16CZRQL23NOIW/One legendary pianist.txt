 Haskill was one of the masters pianists in order to play Mozart. She was not merely colorist; she emphatizes that caleidoscopic world that Mozart impplies. His touch is velvet; and knows how to make floating the melody ; she owned the gift of produce a dyonisiac sound of W.A.M. without affection , or theatrical rapture sense.  His Chopin keeps the charm, elegance and nuance given by the last romantic tradition. Think in von Sauer, Cortot or Martin Krause , by instance. She'll never give us a dirty play; his sense of how the music must sound is organical; and you can feel the beat sense even in the most lyrical phrases. This album is essential for you. It will let you know once more to understand Haskill was the favorite of Fricsay and Markevitch in other Mozart Concerts, and yet why she was choosen by Artur Grumiaux as his musical partner in Mozart violin sonatas. She was requested too by Pau Casals in several Prades Festvals.  After all these proofs, do you need another one ?
