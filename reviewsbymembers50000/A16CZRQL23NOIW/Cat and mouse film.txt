 This movie is interesting , but it will never be a classic film. The charismatic presence of John Cussack , the dazzling performance of Gene Hackman and the worthy effort of Rachel Weiz save the film in 60% . The script is kinetic. The process of selection of a jury , is shown before the viewer with all his ugliness and tricks. The information services are under several forces of different ethical levels. The fable of the hunter hunted is told with dynamics ; the script is well written . You may reply the picture lacks deepness ; but who cares? You really wont find out shadows of Twelve angry men , for instance , but the cast is alright. The film promises you more than you expect , especially to the end ; but it reveals an interesting insight about the dark regions of the justice underworld .   Good direction!
