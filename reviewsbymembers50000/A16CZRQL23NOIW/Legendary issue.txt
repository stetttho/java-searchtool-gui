 In the last sixties this overwhelming album turned around the clock in the search of new expression possibilities . The legendary pioneer besides Cream was Vanilla Fudge . Theis innovative trio composed for three virtuosi every one in his respective instruments caused souch level of admiration all over the world as any other previous band . Just think in Clapton in the guitar , Jack Bruce in the bass and Ginger Baker in the drums . Having watched the Cream must have been an astonishing experience in those experimentation phase . The incredible rhythms emanated from this trio still are subject of study for the newcomers bands . Consider the breathtaking and original proposal White Room with such allusive and even disturbing ; the legendary song Born under a bad sign that drew dark precognitions about  Vietnam and the not less suggestive piece Desert cities of the heart .  The secret of their success was the integrated sound based in the conjunction and not in the protagonist of any special figure . The sound was the final product of exhilarating and fevered rhythms . Bruce in his fierce attacks , the ineffable and always Baker and the imaginative riffs and solos of Clapton . The Live Concert in Fillmore is simply amazing . Spoonful is a heart-rending piece . And Toad is the jewel of the crown the harmonica solos and the drumbeats of Baker make of this album an indispensable item for any hard rock fan or even serious rock investigator .
