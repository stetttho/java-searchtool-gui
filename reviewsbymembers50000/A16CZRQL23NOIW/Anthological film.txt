 This picture is literally overwhelming . Deep , complex and extraordinary well written , The plot is merciless and disturbing . It is about the hidden web of the power ; but it goes too far in its proposal . Tom Tyron gave the rol of his life with this performance . Unforgettable direction , and superb edition and art direction . Sublime photograph and admirable cast . What else can I say about this one hundred stars film? One masterpiece all the way .
