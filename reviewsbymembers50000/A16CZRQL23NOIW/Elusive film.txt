  If you are looking for a lineal film beware with this artwork. A trio  at a forlorn spa, a man who desperately attempts to lure a mysterious woman away with him. This picture works out at several levels , it demands your attention without any concessions. You have to build the complex web of allegoric symbols and narrative rapture. Hailed by international critics, you will love it or may be you don't but it will never you let you indifferent.  To me it a real masterpiece who demands from you to get immersed in Antonion films such L' eclisse, The Adventure and Le Grido.  A must for any serious and hard fan lover of the cinema. Art in its major expression!
