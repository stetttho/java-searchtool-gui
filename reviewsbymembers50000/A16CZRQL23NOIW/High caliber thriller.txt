 Desire and seduction, murder and cover up, scandal and intrigue, half truths and false promises of patriotism; where the duty lies beyond the flatter and the appearance must become a politically correct matter. In this sense this Neo Noir Film transcends the anecdote in a very linked similar profile with classics of the genre such as Pick Up on South Street or Kiss me deadly where the personal destinies are tied with the another dark side of the ethic.     Costner is an actor who is not precisely among my favorite ones, but I must acknowledge all the possible credits for this role, the alluring, irresistible and captivating of Sean Young as Femme Fatale and the worthy acting of Will Patton plus the presence of this giant actor as Hackman making of the sophisticated villain conform a magnificent cast that support the admirable camera work of Roger Donaldson who made until now, his most interesting work.    A magnificent remake of the Big Clock.
