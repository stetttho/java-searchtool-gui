 This is one of the most captivating gems in Charlot 's career. The blindness and the poverty; two irreparable scarcities, unconsciously bounded by its unavoidable affective loneliness; the perennial illusion for best times nourishing the sadness of a world in shadows; the elusiveness working out as counterweight of a hopeless state. The geniality of Chaplin resides in joining these unpaired balances randomly established by the destiny 's caprices to build a love story able to move us.  The unforgettable Jorge Luis Borges formulated about this work the following statement: "Who dared to ignore Chaplin is one of the safest Gods of the Mythology of our times, a colleague of the quiet nightmares of Chirico, of Scar face' s fervent machine guns, of the finite universe although unlimited, of the zenithal backs of Greta Garbo, of the obstructed eyes of Gandhi?"
