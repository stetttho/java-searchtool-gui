 This irreverent and almost surrealistic film finds Woody in plenitude of humor and ingenious; he truly played hard with this free comedy which worked out as a magnificent exorcism exercise about the hidden dragons around this subject; every one of the vignettes is built around the sex and its implications but narrated in such caustic and bitter approach that it will be hard for you to avoid laugh and smile; because this is far to be a common place; it 's a true hitherto in what intelligence, refinement and good spirits you can imagine.  Watch for Gene Wilder and his weird passion: it 's an unforgettable classic that has not aged just a bit. On the contrary, It tends to improve through the years.   One of the five gems of Woody!
