 Listening to Mr. Redman it would seem that Ben Webster himself would have reborn. The thriving musical motives involve the most exigent of the listeners. Redman never repeats himself, he is always searching beneath the score for something new, a sound, a color, a  sensation. From Sweet sorrow (the best track in my opinion) to Past in the present or the moving Obsession, Redman gives that impression of zero rigidity and constant movement. As the same Redman confess: "Jazz is not about flat fives or sharp nines or metric subdivisions, or substitute chord changes. Jazz is about feeling, communication, honesty, and soul." Fundamental album in your personal collection.
