 Agustin Barrios (El Indio) Mangore was a true sensitive composer, a real poet of the guitar, and John Williams understood so well the score's intention as any other player of this instrument.  When you listen "Una limosna el amor de Dios" or to my view the best track: "Sueo en la floresta" you will be inmediatly in rapture state. Williams added a profound,touching and expressive lyricism that completes the circle. Williams have been always a guitarrist deeply involved with the Latin American composers: He has developed a great admiration for Antonio Lauro and his performance of Concierto de Aranjuez with Ormandy and Philadelphia Orchestra in 1967 stands by far as the most convincing version I have ever listened. Go for this album and you will convince by yourself.
