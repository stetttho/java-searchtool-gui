 This is a picture that pitifully, promises much more than what it gives. At the end, when you sum, you feel something didn't fit, despite the frenetic narrative rhythm. Visually the film is stunning, plenty of action, but the script is extremely weak, the dominant presence of Cruise along the film, shadows the ominous presence of figures as Jon Voight, Scott Thomas, Jean Reno and Vanessa Redgrave who are pitifully wasted in insipid lines.  To win in a thriller you have to think in the evilness of the characters too. It is not enough to shine with bit nails sequences. I mean; there is a balance problem in the dramatic environment. And the presence of the enemy is so diminished that it is reduced to a simple cartoon.    The final sequence crossed the line of the credibility to convert itself in a funny joke. That's what it happens when you loss the dramatic equilibrium and the abuse of the special effects domains the balance.
