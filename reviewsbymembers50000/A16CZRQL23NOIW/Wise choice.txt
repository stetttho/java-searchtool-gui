 I'm so very proud of this TV . The resolution is vivid . Since I bought in August 2002 , I have enjoyed it without restrictions  and zero problems . The handle is very friendly and has three component outputs. The state of art and a particular triumph of the whole personal behind his making .  Congratulations . You made the state of art . Keep on so.
