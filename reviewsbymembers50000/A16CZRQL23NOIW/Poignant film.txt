 This is a real gem movie . The supreme magnetism of this immortal actress Greer Carson (one of the top ten  Northamerican actress ever) makes a must for all the cinema lovers . She founds an orphanage in Texas since she loses her pwn child. The blame and the redemption will open for her a new gate with unssupected possibilities .  The film os so overwhelmong acted that you miss even the plot is dated . When you watch in screen both acting giants as Pigdeon and Mrs. Carson, try to find an answer : Would you be able to find a couple actually which could match with that one? A haunting film directed with broad gusto by Melvin Leroy who would give us years later The bad seed . Fundamental film of the forties . A must in your collection.
