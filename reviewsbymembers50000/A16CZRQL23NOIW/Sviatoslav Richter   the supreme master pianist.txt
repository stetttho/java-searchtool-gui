 The introspective mood of Richter and his personal convictions about the meaning or the tempos of certain piano pieces has been always subject of unfinnished discusions. In this case Richter temperament worked out to perfection levels. I am a hard fan of Richter pianism (almost sixty five recordings) and I own four different versions of the Pictures . This is one of his best but not the winner . Believe or not , one week later in Bucarest he played the Pictures again with amazing results . Indeed he was a unpredictable pianist. His Chopin is always interesting though it lacked idiomatism . He always was a champion master playing Rachmaninov . As historic reference you must acquire this album .Undoubtly Richter was much better and most interesting artist than Horowitz , he did not only seek the shinning and thundering sound so typical of Horowitz intentions , he seeked the color tonal and the scope beneath every piano piece he played .
