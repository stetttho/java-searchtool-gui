 Is the man reedamable after watching these horrible evidences?  Alan Resnais filmed the most harrowing and brutal document about the wrecks of the Concentration Camps after the WW2. His camera explores without mercy every little detail in all the crudeness you can imagine. Not recommended for squeamish or sensible spectators.   More than a film, a powerful historic document. Don't miss it.
