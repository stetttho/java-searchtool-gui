 To many listeners around the world, Wilhelm Kempff still remains as the authentic voice of Beethoven. The expressive and peerless phrasing of this colossal pianist simply has no parallel in the music. Luxuriant, elegance, class, flair, energy, and absolute domain of the span makes of him one the supreme interpreters of Beethoven.  In this case his collaboration with Ferdinand Leitner brings us a performance where wisdom and elegance shake hands; Kempff was always surrounded of that supreme conviction, that undeniable commitment about the significance of Beethoven ?s legacy. That ?s why his sound looks like the rest and nevertheless no one sounds like him.    To my mind his version of the Fourth is unbeatable but I rather his Emperor reading with Paul van Kempen of the Fifties.
