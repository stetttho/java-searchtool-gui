  The definitive version of Sally Bowles, the original Christopher Isherwood's 1939 book about life in Pre War II in Berlin. Liza Minelli proved she could act better than her mother (Judy Garland) . Minelli made a bravura performance and the inspired rapture of Bob Fosse makes of this film an absolute must to acquire it.
