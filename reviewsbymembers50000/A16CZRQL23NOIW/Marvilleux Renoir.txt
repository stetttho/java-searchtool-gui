 Auguste Renoir (1841-1919) represented by far, one the lofty painters of the second half of the XIX Century. His enslaving talent allowed to make a true sweep through the most diverse tendencies. His visible influences received from Courbet, Van Gogh and Delacroix, did not leave on him, a perennial trace. The presence of Czanne and Monet irrupted strongly in the necessity of rejecting the conservative patterns and raid in new stylistic proposals. He was not only a notable Realist artist but also crossed the Impressionist threshold, in an untiring process of self renovation and fervent  conveyance.   "Nowadays there is a tendency to explain everything. But if I could explain  painting, it would not an artwork. Must I tell you what qualities constitute to my judge, the true art? It must be indescribable and inimitable...The artwork must captive the watcher, bundle him, drag him. Through it, the artist communicates his passion; it is the current that emits and through includes the watcher in itself:"  Renoir.           Admirable and compelling biography that it will catch you from the first page.
