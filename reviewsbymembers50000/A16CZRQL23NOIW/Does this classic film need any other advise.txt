 This is the real milestone in what historic roots concerns . It owns a superb and extremely detailed scope about every frame of the Old Days of the Civil War .  This monumental film which belongs to the artistic museum of the memory is filmed with glorious and sublime good taste ; with wonderful script and ravishiung performances of all the cast . There was any hole in this superb work . Consider this film as one of the top five best Americna films in anyage . It owns the seal of the immortality. Somehow that statement when Scarlett O'Hara affirms that neither no one nor nothing will stop her , are part of its multiple virtues . The names of Rhet Butler and Scarlet O ` Hara now are part of the story .  The musical score : Tara `s theme pays a deserved homage to that well designed home in which Gable will tell her  the famous answer : I don' t give a ...just before closing the door . The movie runs for three hours and forty two minutes but with splendid cast and artistic direction ; you won' t miss it . And beware this footnote : the special charm of this timeless resides in its mythological roots present in the uncosncious collective.
