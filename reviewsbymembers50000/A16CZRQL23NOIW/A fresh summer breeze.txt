 This work meant, in the middle of this bleak and turbulent decade, the most intimate familiar portrait filmed.  Somehow this film has several common issues with It's a wonderful life. Marty is a candide, a man who still lives with his mother and besides he has not been able to engage with a woman who bears such activity: he is a butcher and also an old fashioned human being. His growing up process remained suspended. His emotive experience is even minor than a teenager from those ages. He became in a real symbol of the familiar union after several dark films that walked precisely in the oppsoite side of the street as A streetcar named desire, Baby doll, Rebel without cause. The best proof I can argue is the double cross that sealed that decade. The evasion expressed in the great amount of sci fi films and the Noir films that talked about the horror of the shadow of the atomic paradigm Uncertainty and hopeless were intimate partners and this film tried with certain sucess, to make forget for some moments the inner demons of USA, the Cold War and the unavoidable atomic race in the world in that decade.  Unforgettable acting of Borgnine who won deservedly the Academy Prize as Best Actor in 1955.
