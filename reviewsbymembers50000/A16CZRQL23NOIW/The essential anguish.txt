  Ed Harris is one of the most talented and real heavy weight character actors I the world. Even he owns a great repertoire of emotive range, facial expressions and expressive brightness, he has not yet persuaded to the members of the Jury to win a more than deserved Academy Award. Think in his incredible and amazing performance in The Hours for instance.  In this singular project, Harris caught the essential roots of this mesmerizing artist. The artistic direction was wonderfully good taste made. Marcia Gay Harden is overwhelming too. Pollock is shown in all his primitive nature, his creation process, his troubles with the alcohol and twist of character supported by a very kinetic frenzy. The dialogues are admirably well depicted and so his inner demons and his irreverent mood.  You must be absolutely immersed in those years to enjoy every frame of this portrait of one of the most fundamental icons in United States.
