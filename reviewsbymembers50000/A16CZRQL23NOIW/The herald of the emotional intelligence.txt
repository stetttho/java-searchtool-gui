 We live molded by words; all of us know about the persuasive, seducing, enervating and even mesmerizing effect.   Dale Carnegie wrote something more a hallucinating text, he has written a very simple guide for achieving a major and best quality of life. From the simplest actions till the most revealing advisements. The book does not pretend a spiritual guide; moreover Carnegie just want to be our personal friend, where the sincerity and goodwill can be adverted from the first pages.  Since its early publishing this book has become an instantaneous classic. Go for it. There is so much to learn and compare respect the very applauded and well received term: Emotional intelligence.  And I am absolutely convinced that many others thinkers, writers, artists and philosophers( Confucio, La Bruyere, Esopo, La Rochefoucauld, Ibn El Barud, Emerson, Gandhi, Edgar Cayce, Bacon and so many others), who have written thousand and thousand ink `s kilometers about this concept. But the stylized scripting of Carnegie will amaze you due the singleness and lack of pretension.
