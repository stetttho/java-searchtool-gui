 The typical aberrant behavior of the best known Latin expression "machismo" -that fortunately is decreasing- is shown with all the brutal realism.  The sudden transformation of a man who was in love, occurs precisely after knowing his happy wife is pregnant. The gradual tension will be increasing when the violence speech and the physical agressions become normal.   The levels of desperation and slow but effective arousing about the awful reality of this distorted situation will resolve violently. It seems that there is no way out.  Extraordinary script, and fabulous performances, specially in what Paz Vega, the raising and promising Spanish actress concerns.  A theme that securely, will be the cause of similar adaptations in the near future. It is time to open the closed respect this miserable way of behavior.   Bold film!
