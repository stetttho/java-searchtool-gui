 Julie Andrews makes the most robust performances on screen through this vivid, intimate and sadly adaptation based on a true and sensitive testimony of the real life. She is attacked by a degenerative sclerosis that eventually will lead to the grave. She plays the role of a famed violinist (in the real life she was a very talented cellist) who suffers this awful penury, nevertheless she possesses that untamed will, materializing  this epic fight against the destiny. Backstage his husband a director is cheating her with another woman, artist too. Fine performances of Alan Bates and max Von Sydow.
