 I am not a fan of Martin Scorsese . He is a very talented film maker but with his last works he seems to be in a zero atmosphere . From Cape fear to his last work ; something 's wrong seems happen . But fortunately before this strange path happened , he made his last giant work .  Warning that 1990 was a battlefield in the mob movies ; this one ; Godfather III (the worst of all the saga) ; State of grace and the best of that group (Miller's crossing) . Goodfellas is an extraordinary organic piece . Filmed with artistic commitment but also with a superb flowness and naturality that it lets you astonished .  Scorsese adds a high dosis of black humor in all his characters . They are all involved in such kind of divine madness , that you copnsider the sucesive murders as something completely natural .  What can we say of De Niro in this role . When De Niro works with Scorsese , there is something inside the soul of Robert which seemed the happy result of that ong chemistry among them through the time . De Niro is not the same poweful and natural actor under other director . This rapport is so clear (Casino , Mean streets , Taxi driver ; Ragging bull ; New York , new York)that it looks like more than evident to conclude this overwhelming phenomen is just casuality . Pesci is so great , so cynical and Ray Liotta in his finest role to date . The film is artistic a real jewel . They are good kids , good sons , they are excellent gourmets and unique husbands , and they do their job as you or me ; they kill and you can refy}use this behavior ; but for them is a matter of living . That is their job . So what's the point with that ? If I had to take two films of Scorses to the desert island ; I would take this and his masterpiece : Taxi driver .
