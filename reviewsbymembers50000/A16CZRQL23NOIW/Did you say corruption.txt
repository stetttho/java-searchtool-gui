Perhaps the script was overloaded and the running time of 167 min. can make you get tired due many involved issues. I still remind in the interview's James Lipton (Inside the actor's studio) When Sidney Lumet stated the lenses he employed was another actor in the film, altering the reality making the things look like totally deformed; to accent the rarefied atmosphere and remarking the rottenness.      Towering performance of Williams. It's amazing this gem film hasn't been released on DVD at this time!
