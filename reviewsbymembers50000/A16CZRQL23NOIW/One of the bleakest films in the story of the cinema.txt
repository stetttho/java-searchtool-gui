 The accusatory finger of Hitchcock was never so lacerating as in this film . The work is a frightening account of what it happens to a man - Christopher Emmanuel Ballesteros , a New York bass player (his surnames are of jewish and latin origin , a little coincidence, perhaps ?) when he is wrongly accused of being the man who has performed a series of hold - ups . The story is based on real facts . Manny and Rose attempt establish his alibi ; but they find the witenesses are either missing or dead . Rose suffers a serious nervous breakdown and is placed in a mental hospital . The real criminal fails when attempts another robbery and finally Manny is cleared , but it is too late to heal certain irretrievable wounds . When he goes to the mental hospital to tell Rose the good news and the nightmare is over , she declares : "That's fine for you" staring blankly into space . The dark perspective hold by Hitchcock all along the film reminds us again the direct influence of the shadows of the german expressionism . The movie honestly is filmed with an inevitable European style , specificly german .  Vera Miles is ravishing in this role and Fonda magnificent too . The script has no holes and possibly it the most serious film of Hitchcock ; the screenplay comes from "The true story of Christopher Emmanuel Ballesteros" by Maxwell Anderson . It was rrleased in December 23 , 1956 . This is one of my five favorite films of Hitchcock . The sinister whipping you receive and the bitter taste you leave the film inscribes this film in a weird atmosphere ; a crude sensation of cosmic fatality surrounds the environment with such power that you will never this shocking and extraordinary and instantaneous cult movie .
