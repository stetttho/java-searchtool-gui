  When a peaceful mathematics teacher is menaced by a group of hooligans around his house playing to be hard, will suddenly know this sleeper giant which exists in the deepest regions of the human soul.   The rage has never been so eloquent and graphically shown on screen never before. Dustin Hoffman elaborates an impressive portrait of rising fury, irrational behavior when you defy the unknown limits of the patience. To my mind Hoffman made with this towering performance one of five masterworks: Lenny, Little big man, Rain man, Midnight cowboy and this one.  Extraordinary camera work , outstanding performances and frenetic atmosphere in the climax final sequence confirm once more the artistic virtues of Sam Peckinpah one of my favorite American filmmakers ever.
