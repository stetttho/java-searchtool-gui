 This film is a duty for all the viewer . Do not ever doubt just for a second . Murnau made a timeless masterpiece about a looser aged man who works out as a hotel porter who suddenly is fired due his advanced age .  He decides not to lose his status , so he steals his uniform and try to convince the others and himself his status has not fallen yet .  The awful truth about his personal condition makes to establish an agreement . He will work in the hotel but as a cleaner bathroom . Soon his lie will be revealed when someone watched him working and tells the neighborhood where he lives the powerful and bitter true . Haunting , poignant and crude . A knife in your soul that it will let you thinking for a long long time . A superb milestone . A real landmark in the cinema story . Acquire this one and get close to Murnau craft and enjoy about the epic acting of this giant actor who was Emil Jannings . Remember him as the proffesor in the Blue Angel, that masterpiece of Joseph von Sternberg . In my personal list of the greatest films in any age this movie is in the first twenty.
