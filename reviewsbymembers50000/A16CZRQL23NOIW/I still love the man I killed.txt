 One of the most notable features of the Noir style resides in the ambivalence of the characters; so nobody is absolutely free of guilty, that is why this genre always maintains on the edge of the knife, because we have tendency to sympathize with someone, and so the surprise element is a furtive shadow that can flatten our best choice.  On the other hand the guiltiness in the case of Leslie Crosbie is by double turn, she is adultery and also criminal. In these conditions, her nasty and distorted behavior becomes of her the genuine femme fatale, who not only evades the human justice, but besides is forgiven by her husband, despite her bitter statement. But the strange forces of the fate in absence of punishment decides to intervene; you may consider as a self destruction 's act, once you have mocked about the human codes and the rules of the game and decide to burn your own bridges.                Thoughtfully realized, this bitter and (why not?) melodramatic picture was sent to the immortality thanks to a memorable script, but always was supported by the secure hand of William Wyler and the majestic and always imitated but never equaled Bette Davis in one of her moist reminded films together with The little foxes and Jezebel.
