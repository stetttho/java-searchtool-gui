 A writer is passing through an unfruitful period of inspirational rapture. He is hired with all his family to regent a hotel during a long and crude winter. The payment is attractive and the change may bring him new airs in his artistic profile.   But there are many unsaid weird events. Dark visions occur repeatedly, curious spirits invade the intimacy of this family. Gradually these visions will grow with major intensity, and eventually will affect the mental sanity of this writer. The progressive inner dissolution will reach unexpected levels of tension, and physical violence against his own family.    Stanley Kubrick once more, dictated a true Directorial Cathedra. His wonderful travelings, and original camera angles, the astonishing and suspenseful script plus the mercurial performance of Jack Nicholson made of this film one of the favorite icons of many hard fans all around the world.
