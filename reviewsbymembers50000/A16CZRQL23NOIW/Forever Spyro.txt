 Consider Harbor nights and the glorious and unforgettable theme : Old San Juan . Only for this last track , the CD is recommendable . Spyrogyra was in a real inspiration mood with the highest creative powers through their brilliant career, with that unique sound and superb beat .  One of the top albums of the eighties and a classic issue of this original ensamble .
