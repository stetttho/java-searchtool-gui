  This is the main contribution to interdisciplinary studies that converge in psychology and biology. It is a key piece inside Darwin `s work. If the well known decay of the compared psychology at the early years of the XX Century- when the evolutionism followers forgot about the behaviors and the psychologists did without anatomy and physiology- diminished briefly influence to the actual contributions, the culmination of the modern etiology has acted in favor for rediscover this extraordinary and even singular text.      What Darwin considers as true expressions are precisely, the reflexes and instincts that suppose not only the innate capacity to react of a determined way, but also the innate acknowledgement  of that expression in the others.  A fundamental and unfairly not so known book that deserves to be recognized with major value.
