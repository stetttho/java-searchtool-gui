 I guess The twilight zone was, with absolute conviction, the main inspiration's source for Steven Spielberg in this hair raising and unequal duel between a simple man, who chose an unfortunate evening to meet a real mad driver who suffers undoubtedly of serious emotive and emotional disturbance when decides to make a race plenty of suggested and evident violence.  Few times in the screen you will be tied to your seat as in this picture. And through your emotive memories you have found as I do in my personal case, with this kind of guys who simply play to be the death's emmisares driving any kind of vehicle. All his inner anguishes and impotence state make of them assume the total command of the highway, until the transit authority makes its appearance.  But knowing Spielberg, his message goes far beyond still, I have not any doubt, the metaphor is overclear. The Vietnam affair still resounded and the use of the machine as death's device was in last instance another way to express and exert violence, may be you call urban violence but this germen lives in our souls and has nothing to do with tension states or worst still a honor question.  Dennis Weaver made a terrific role as the frightened driver who tries to keep the relative control of its own when he has to face during ninety minutes with this absurd and merciless nigtmare.  The first little gem of Spielberg!
