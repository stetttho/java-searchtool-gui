 Culbertson is still in his twenties but his mature ideas overpasses by far his promising youth. Undoubtly we are before one of the top keyboardists in the world of the smooth jazz . This album has two top tracks : On my mind and Straight to the heart , but the level is so high that you can be engaged with any one of them . What it wonders me about Culbertson is his enormous talent to switch from style under his masterful musical skills and different moods . I must confess that Culbertson, Greg Karukas, Michael Camilo and Joe Sample are the most innovative smooth jazz players today .
