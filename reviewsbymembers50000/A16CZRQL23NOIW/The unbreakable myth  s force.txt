 John Boorman has always been of my favorite filmmakers. He possesses that absorbing faculty to involve the viewer from the first shot of any film. And once more he used all the available means to get an absolute and enjoyable version of the Arthurian legend, joining to Eric Rohmer and Robert Bresson who undertook in the Seventies similar projects with fruitful results. Boorman focuses on a very realistic perspective, the rise to power of King Arthur, the forbidden love of Queen Guinevere and Sir Lancelot and additionally special attention to the magic which confers the film, not only a sumptuous stage, but it plunges in the myth 's nucleus with absorbing and even hallucinating visions, enriching visually the unexplainable, the mythic force beneath the most important myth of the Western World.   The impossibility to reach individual love 's concretion, when the natural law imposes over the made laws man.       All the cast is overwhelming. Helen Mirren captured my entire attention from this moment. I love this actress and the time for her was shining which makes me glad. Liam Neeson 's film debut in screen.
