 Kenji Mizoguchi made the most complete insight about the fascinating, complex and enigmatic universe of the Samurai.  Without hindrances, there' s a visible divergence between two well distinguished Lords. One of them, Kira represents the pragmatism, the man who only knows about loyalty and parvenu vision; is attacked by another Lord of much more robust conviction and attachment to the ancient traditions of the doctrine. This fact will cause his death, but their vehement vassals are disposed to revenge this unfair punishment and vexation and they won 't rest until this death be a reality.  Along the superb story there will be a wide number of minor secondary narrative nines that will consolidate the most important Japanese film in the Forties, but besides will allow to get in to this absolutely unknown way of life.  One of my top one hundred films in any age.
