 When you have talent, a good script and remarkable cast, it is almost impossible for you not to triumph, even you make a low budget picture without great and spectacular effects that just only mesmerize to the new generation of teenagers. There is solid story behind this plot.As you know one of the classical premises of the Noir Films is that nobody is absolutely innocent. That is why many people are beaten by this circumstance.  The presence of the captivating and seductive Natasha Henstridge from the intial shots, coming to the Used Books Tent will open Pandora' box. Through a very well articulated mechanism of dark loyalties and hard to believe solidarities, the viewer will be engaged progressively in this drama.  A personal tragedy, a love affair, several stolen millions,     betrayal and passionate and complex web of facts and events will make of this film one of the most interesting movies in years that I 've seen. Highly recommended.
