  Samson Francois, the eminent disciple of Alfred Cortot, always got around the extensive repertoire of concert and concentrated all his imaginative playing, idiosyncratic rapture  and sublime expressiveness in the romantic genre, but avoiding in every moment to express romantically. It may be sound ironic but that was his approach along his brief existence. Born in 1924 and pitifully died in 1970, Francois gave us aristocratic readings of Chopin, Ravel, Debussy and Prokoviev. But besides Francois was a consummate jazz player and good pool player.  This album is a remarkable selection of his relatively brief discography. The time has proved slowly the terrible fact caused by his premature departure. Don't doubt just any second. Go for this piano colossus.
