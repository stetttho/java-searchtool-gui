 This film has many aspects to remark. The first of them lies in the style: the film reminds to a slow english picture, in the Hitchcock of the fifties, specially The rear window and the rope, there are many unforgettable shot angles , the sensation you breathe is amazing. You feel the claustrophobic mood and once more, the camera becomes before us once more as a device for making the viewer a real Peeping Tom. The dual character played in both characters are brilliant played by Margott Kidder in his best rol to date and dazzling direction. The script runs organically , giving visible and suggestive clues. A brilliant psychothriller!.  De Palma made a little masterpiece, soon before one my favorite cult movie any age like Phantom of Paradise. De Palma was in the peak of his powers, undoubtly. If you are a hard fan of the suspense, this film is for you.
