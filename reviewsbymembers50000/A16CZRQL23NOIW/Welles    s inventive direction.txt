 Michael O 'Hara comes to the aid of a very alluring woman, she is intriguing and the imprecise and very brief conversation, she vanishes inside the night 's brumes.  Soon afterward he is hired as special member for pleasure cruise on a yacht owned by Artur Bannister the husband of the mysterious Elsa. He reminds us powerfully to Richard III 's cripple state. The dramatis personae will unfold to unexpected consequences, where a trial will be the last stage for O' Hara before he escapes in search of the truth. And in a very similar circumstance suffered by Susan in Touch of Evil, he will a wake in an amusement park to lead us to the famous sequence in the hall of mirrors. Fantasy, evasion and elusiveness three fundamental elements of the cinema will intersect in this phantasmagoric picture that so many films has inspired. The same Welles confessed in a famous interview in 1966: "I believe, thinking about my films, that they are based not so much on pursuit as on a search. If we are looking for something, the labyrinth is the most favorable location for the search. I do not know why, but my films are all for the most part a physical search: a visual obsession."   In this delirious movie converge basically all the elements present in the Shakesperian Tragedy, the unerring fatalism of the Noir Film and the absolute domain of the lens as a loyal and fervent mute storyteller through the visual imagery and the sordid environment where nothing seems worthy to trust. Welles explores the low depths of the unconscious through the gradual personality demolition and unavoidable deconstruction of the characters alienating the viewer to unbearable level.
