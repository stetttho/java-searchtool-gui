 Thinking about the impressive exhibition of Frida Kahlo paintings in London, it is good to remind this singular version of 1985.  The Mexican director Paul Leduc, made, by far, the best adaptation that I know about Frida. This artwork focuses with a major scope, the complex relationship between Kahlo, Rivera and Trotsky. The appropriate illumination was simply top-notch.  And the structure that support the script keeps maintain the whole interest along the film. Highly recommended for all those who are really interested in knowing the insights of this true icon of the last Century.
