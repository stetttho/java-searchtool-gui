 A selfish and uninspired writer finds in the cynicism his own shield, helmet and weapon to face the world. Around him there is a living world, limited according his vision: his neighbor with his emotional world and his beloved dog; on the other hand a responsible mother who works hard in a Deli with a profound pain.  Inside this normal selfishness, the daily encounter with this single but very worried woman will become a real breakthrough in his values code. The world is too much wider and complex than he really thinks, its particular universe trying to eviscerate the mysteries of the human soul through the creation of his characters finds him out of context in this case.  Through a smart script that includes a set of funny vignettes,  the power of love will gradually loom and dictate finally the expected bliss. Jack Nicholson once more is towering with this role; unbearable, neurotic and troublemaker character. Helen Hunt `s performance is impeccable; she will experiment a wide specter of emotions, blending sympathy, sympathy and pain. Cuban Gooding Jr is magnificent too in his brief but well reminded appearance, radiant, freshness and spontaneous humor. And the breathtaking revelation of Greg Kinnear in his very difficult role, making to date his best achievement on the screen.  And for this lovable pet, a sonorous applause, one of the best dog performances ever made.    An emblematic author film with a low budget concerning to special effects or car chases, but provided with a great doses of talent by all the team. Dazzling direction and memorable artistic direction.  A recent classic.
