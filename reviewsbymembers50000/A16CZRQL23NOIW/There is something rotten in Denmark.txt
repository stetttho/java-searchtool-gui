 This film is extremely interesting . Filmed in kinetic documental style , the picture denounces delicate , unknown and powerful facts involved in the Circles of the Power . To my mind the film has peaks an lows ; the recruiting process left me with a very bitter taste because I expected Moore was far beyond in this premise . In the other hand , the crucial events such the secret connections between the Petroleum affairs and the implications which carried to the all most known of 1973 event ; the impact and relation between the necessity of creating war stages and its hidden implications in the Financial World are issues which concerns not only to USA but the rest of the globe . The memory is too fragile and sometimes you need explain certain issues you consider totally fixed .  There are many touching moments a bit overlong in the film and in the other hand there are extremely smart moments too short as that one close to end in which Moore requires to one of the Members of Senate for requesting one of his sons to join the Iraq conflict. The environment question was out . The burning Oil fields  after the Gulf War has been one of the most unforgiven and criminal acts in the recent story , the Alaska project and the final destiny of the wasted nuclear material could have been another winner points. May be the documental style has its own rules but I would like to know the position of some other high personalities such Tony Blair,  Jacques Chirac, Aznar , Clinton, Kissinger among others or Peace Nobel winners about this intriguing and delicate web of hidden issues which we will never reach to know in the time of our lives due the simple fact are classified information. Anyway a brave and well received film in the rest of the world -Winner in Cannes 2004- which leaves you as must be with more questions than answers due its unexhausted and arresting lines .
