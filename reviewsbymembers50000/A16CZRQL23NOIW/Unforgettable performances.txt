 Rena Kyriakou was a brilliant greek pianist with a sense of the color tonal as only a few master keyboard . Her approach to this composer is filled with charm and nuance . Nevertheless it's would not be fair to state that in the piano pieces better known as Songs without words , to me you must to name to the brazilian pianist Guiomar Novaes with a brief selection , but if you're interesetd in the complete set go for Walter Gieseking . Kyriakou makes a splendid performance of the Piano Concert , the serenade and the capricio . These are piano pieces merely enjoyable you will never seek deepness or complex languages as the giants piano concerts as Beethoven's third or Brahms concerts , for instance . They are colorful , enjoyable and delightful where the rhapsodic games and the clear but melodic phrases run without effort for any listener . The warmthness , the melodic lines give the exact intention of the composer . Moscheles for instance , was an ardient champion in that music . He was an intimate friend of Felix and played many times his concerts . Rena Kyriakou , besides these famous works also played the best version that I know of Goyescas of Enrique Granados. If you're lucky to find out , because they are hard to find .
