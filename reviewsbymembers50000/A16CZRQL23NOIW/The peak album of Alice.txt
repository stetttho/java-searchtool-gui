 May be Alice Cooper did not notice the impact of this album in those times . But the essence of all his special magnetism never reached equal and even similar heights . To my mind the best track of this CD and obviously the best song of Cooper ever is Halo of flies . This piece not only is hard to beat but besides inmensely original in its purpose . The riffs and the rhthym changes are so innovative that literally leaves you exhausted and breathtakin : harshness in its highest rank . I consider this piece as one the most sublime and best achievements in this first half decade and all the rock story . You drive me nervous is an excellent piece ; If you want to be my lover is very funny and filled of stamine . I think seriously this album must have influenced a famous band : I'm talking about Kiss . Try to get this CD and compare by yourself. The level difference between this album and School's out is so great that you will hard believe this band be the same . The fatal decay experienced for this quartet was one of the fastest in the music may be beated for the Mountain case ; that heavy rock band whose leader was Felix Pappalardi .  The inspiration loss was so deep and fast that literally became the beginning of the end for both ensambles . Fortunately for Mountain band they acepted the crude reality and decided under mutual agreement to dissolve ; but this was not the case of Cooper who decided to follow the traces of Icarus !
