 The imagination is more important than knowledge!  Chadds Ford was a very small village with just 140 people in Pennsylvania. His father was an illustrator of childish books like Robin Hood or Treasure' s Island. But his powerful imagination was able to surmount all these obstacles. He may well considered as a painter of "crucial moments" in which the time would seem to stop creating a vertiginous sensation of realism and eternity; of vertigo and deviation.  It 's well know that Wyeth `s study that represents a curtains being moved by the wind in a deserted room was the preferred painting the great poet Robert Frost.  But his most sublime work has been to my mind: "The world of Christine" . I can still remember the powerful attraction from my early adolescence and then the weird fascination that captivated me along almost half an hour when I watched in Momma in 1995.
