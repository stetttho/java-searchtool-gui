 This film is amazing . Only the fertile imagination of this innovative director could produce such artistic triumph . Bunuel focuses his inquiring sight in the life of a boring marriage . He is a burgois gentilhomme and is married with a goddess (Catherine Deneuve).  And since the curiosity at last allows her to break the rules and become in a double life woman where she will experience something completely different .  The surrealistic mood and the spiral dreams remind us the inner and hidden demons which suddenly will appear without previous warning and will emerge with their unexpected wildness .  Masoquism , erotism and all a wide variety of erotic elements will run before your eyes . The camera work is gorgeous and the script is overwhelming . Superb,haunting and intense film .
