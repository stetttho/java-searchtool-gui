 Hitchock threw his glow to the immortality with this fine , elegant and aristocratic film where the suspense element is not the mean starring but the admirable way in which it is told . The camera in the sequence in we see Bergman trying to hide the keys is simply marvelous . Since the script turns around political events when a governemet agent and a refugee girl undertake a dangerous mission in Brazil , the puzzle is just for start and Hitchcock will build an interconected plot with unbeatable maestry, with that unforgettable casting . Claude Rains to me , makes a role even better than in Casablanca , this acting is much more demanding and exigent . Ingrid Bergman splendid as always and Cary Grant may be well has given the best role of his career . Many Hitchcock hard fans consider this one as the best work of the british director . I do not agree but this one is his best artistic issue told in a very european style .
