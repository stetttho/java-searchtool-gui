 This is simply an incisive and acid story superbly told by Charlot . A mature film and the humor becomes irony all along the film . Verdoux is a moral fable placed just after the stock-market crash with vivid notations about the rise of the fascism and bitter reflections . He is a clerk bank who turns in murderer for one goal . To my mind this one of the four immortal aces of Charlot with the other three works the Gold Rush , Modern times and Lights of the City ;  For many cult movies lovers this is the winner . A must all the way!
