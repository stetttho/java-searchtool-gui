 How many hearts did Paul Mauriat 's legendary Orchestra gather around a moonlight dinner making their dreams come true?  I just was a child when I listened his historic and most emblematic theme "Love is blue" and acquired several vinyl records of his famed ensemble.   And although forty years have elapsed since then, the sounds of this magic Orchestra still wonder newcomers, and hope new dreams, illusions and hopes of eternal love.   An enjoyable selection from the always inspired French musical universe, that will never prescribe in what fashion music concerns. It has its special moments that will always wait for you.
