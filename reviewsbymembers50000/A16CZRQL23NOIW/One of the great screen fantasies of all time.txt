Without money he loses his way in a forest and comes upon a mysterious castle where he spends the night . As you see the mythological clues are ready for you. And once you decide to enter to a incredible world .  Cocteau remained completely faithful to the spirit of the original tale but however , introduced such elements of the fantastic as the enchanted castle with arms supporting candelabra jutting from walls., Diana pavilions , Magnifique , the horse . I mean the film is a smart attempt at a realistic documentary of unreal happenings. Beauty and the Beast won the Prix Louis Delluc (1946). The masterful directions shows elegance , restriction , rigor , precision , restraint and fortunately an eschewing of sentimentalism and cliches . Jean Marais in his best achievement , Georges Auric composed the haunting music and the photograph is achieved by Henri Alkan . Based on the classical tale by Mme. Leprince de Beaumont written in 1777 , the premiere in Paris October 29, 1946 AND New York Premiere December 23 1947 .   Sublime masterpiece and fundamental item in your collection .  Films like this convinces you the pictures may become in a vehicle where the art and poetry may join without restrictions , but you need talent . This is the point and the great challenge.
