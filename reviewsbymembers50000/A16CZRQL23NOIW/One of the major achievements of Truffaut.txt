 This is a must in your collection. The charismatic and sideral beauty of Isabelle Adjani enriches itself for her gifted talent as actress .  I don't think in any other actress in that age (with the exception of Shygulla or Jill Claybourgh ) who were capable to win the this defiant performance . This role is hyper difficult and Adjani carries to cosmical levels. The story turns around the hopeless relation between Adele and a french officer. She leaves everything in France for join him : but the result is useless.  The slow of the progressive madness of Adele is told with such richeness of creative talent , that you wonder why Adjani didn't win the Academy Award with this one. The picture is perfect in every little detail. A winner and one of the most perfect french films in the seventies.
