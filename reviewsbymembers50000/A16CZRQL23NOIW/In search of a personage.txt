 Anthony John (Ronald Colman) is a hard obsessed actor with his stage roles being incapable to leave them in the theater. His wife Brita (Signe Hasso) will play Desdemona. Suddenly appears a pathetically lonely actress Pat (Shelley Winters)who eventually seduces him. By opening night Anthony begins to feel the same jealous madness when he is suspicious about a love affair among Brita and the play' s a gent press Bill Friend (Edmond O'Brien). After a jealous scene, he goes in search of Pat and personifies Othello lines and the madness will occur, struggling in the real life to Pat until die.  These are the dramatic premises in which Double life unfolds. This picture works out as tale of opposing forces, mirror images and deadly doubles. Illusion versus reality.  This was the only excursion of Georges Cukor in this genre.
