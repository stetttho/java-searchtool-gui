 This collections of vignettes around his early youth, still remain as an outstanding triumph in the italian cinema.  The Fellini's style still influences in this age. Watch Ettore Scola (C'erovamo tanto amati) ,Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso and 1900)and Kusturica (Underground). The irreverent moods created by this only surrealistic ambassador italian are a song to the freedom , a true 'ode to the joy' and a monumental rendition to the fertile imagination. Amarcord in my view, is the peak of Fellini as dream maker, as story teller and above all as natural and organical sense of humor, in all of its possible and imaginable frequencies, since the virginal, poignant, irreverent, bitter and austere till the most no mercy satire. Watch this unsurpassed film in its genre. One of the glorious achievements not only of the cinema, but the art widely speaking.
