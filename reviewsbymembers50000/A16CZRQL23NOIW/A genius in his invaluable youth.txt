 When Daniel Barenboim decided to face the huge challenge of playing the Complete Set of Piano Concerts he was making (without knowing at this moment)one of his multiple artistic triumphs. The first impressive detail to remark is the convincent maturity and silent self discipline self impossed by himself. But the genius of Barenboim's playing is the absolute conviction he always sounds so natural. And hardly you will find the minimum sensation of effort as you just can feel it with Brendel for instance.  I still have these recordings in vynil format and from time to time I compare both formats. Go for these records and you will not only enjoy to Mozart's genius but the grandness of a real Keyboard Giant in his twenties. After the wise decision to perform and conduct the orchestra from the piano, the interpretations acquired a major enrichment and enlightment, and somehow these recordings constitute the previous step for that decision.  To make a major disection of Concert by Concert would be extremely interseting but it would be equally long. There are some higlights performances and in my opinion these are: The 24th, 23th, 19th,12th, 25th, 14th, 15th and the first six. In honor to the truth there are unbeatable major versions in other performances. The 9th I find to Geza Anda, the 18 th Andras Schiff, 20th Myra Hess with Walter in last fifties, 21 th Casadesus and Munch in the last forties not available in CD format, 22th Fisher and Serkin, 26 th Gulda Harnoncourt, 27th Haskill and Curzon.  Absolutely recommended for every real Mozart's admirer.
