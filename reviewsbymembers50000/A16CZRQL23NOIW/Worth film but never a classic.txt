 The life and triumphs of Alexander the Great, the spiritual son of Achilles are superbly expressed in the screen through the storytelling of the one million carats actor Anthony Hopkins. The stage is simply overwhelming, This epic saga needed somehow this vital component. The battle sequences in the desert against Dario troops are first class and so the last fight in India where the frozen image must have been recognized by Akira Kurosawa wherever he is. The splendid images in red after Alexander being wounded was another hit to remark. The most disgusting failure of the fil is the obsessive tendence of the scripters to remind the sexual inclinations of Alexander and not about his trascencence as conqueror and epic spirit man; that would suppose for instance to denigrate about the genius of Michelangelo due his sexual inclinations, leaving outside the gretaness of his legacy. Two additional details affect seriously the movie as a whole. In the first half there is an excessive use of close-ups. In my modest opinion the close up is like rubato in music: just what you need to emphasize dramatic nucleus or remark the dramatis personae. The second is the presence of Rosario Dawson. To my mind she doesn't represent the Asiatic stereotype ; in the other hand she didn't live the role: too cold and inexpressive.         The rest of the cast was really interesting. The highlights performances are for Angelina Jolie who gives a perfect portrait of Olympia; she exploited her erotic face but also revealed the absolute domain of the body language: the expressive eyes delineated her speech. Jared Leto made a wonderful portrait and finally Val Killmer as Filipo was memorable too. Edition, photography and artistic direction are outstanding. And please realize the awful homage to Kurosawa' s Kagemusha when Bucefalo falls seriously wounded.
