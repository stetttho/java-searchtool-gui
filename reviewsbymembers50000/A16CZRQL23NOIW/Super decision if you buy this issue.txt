 There is no way about . Chuck Loeb , Peter White , Jonathan Butler , Earl Klugh , Russell Malone , Craig Chaquico and Jeff Golub are in this moment the cream of the cream in the smooth jazz to date . Specially this one , what inspired mood . Consider Bells (the best track in my  opinion). Of course The music inside , Cruzin south, la Siesta and Shangai are outstanding pieces too . But what it is remarkable is the fact that Chuck Loeb is a very gifted musician and knows playing the guitar with velvet touch and eloquent erotism . It suggests you much more than you ever imagine ; very appropriate to pass by with your fiancee or your friends in a familiar meeting , may be you decide to get out far for the crowding world, for one hour . You put this CD and inmediatly you will be in another level . Extraordinary work .
