 Undoubtedly this is one the greatest films about the politic corruption filmed in any age . A superb script a magnificent cast : Broderick Crawford gave the role of his life and Mercedes Mc Cambridge too won deservedly an Academy Award for this picture. One of the giant American films and to me the masterpiece of Robert Rosen.
