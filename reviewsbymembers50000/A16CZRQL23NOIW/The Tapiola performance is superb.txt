 Rosbaud made several important recordings with the Berlin Philarmonic. His Haydn is an example (The Oxford is a must to have it). And even his conception of Sibeliuss music may be troubled for many listeners, please try with Tapiola op. 112. This work is one of the less played in Concerts and even in studio recordings. The special commitment that Rosbaud got with Tapiola is hard to believe. Its inner passion, the increased tension among the strings section and above all these obscure themes depicted by the winds are so clear defined and drawn by this conductor like no one else before and fifty years later. Segerstam makes a very close approach but the orchestra has not the carats of Berlin Philarmonic an thats a real trouble. You need a first class orchestra if you want to be a winner playing Sibelius. And this statement goes for Bruckner, Beethoven, Brahms and Wagner. Buy this record.  Tapiola is the jewel of the crown.
