 The return to screen after twenty years of absence of that unique actor with remarkable and powerful magnetic presence : James Cagney , gave to that film a special shining to this anti racism work . This is a film of revenge , but told so magnificent splendor , with multidirectional narrative lines that will engage you from beginning to end . Carefully filmed , with a superb art direction and outstanding performances .  Breathtaking tension in the climax sequence . To me it is the masterpiece of Milos Foreman , sharing with Amadeus an enviable place , But watch the previous filmography of M.F. in Europe and you will be surprised with the loves of a blond .
