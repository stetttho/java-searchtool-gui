 It`s useless to state we are in the presence of the biggest black comedy in all the cinema's story. Every detail is perfect, from the direction, passing through the superb cast, in which Dennis Price gives the best role of his brilliant career. Alec Guiness shows us why he's who he's. A wonderful actor. Not only because in this film gives us eight different roles, but the elegance , the organical flow of its monumental script.  Together with Lavender hill mob, Hobson's choice, the man in the white suit and The lady killers, the english cinema never before had literally had an explossion of talents in multiple aspects. Ironic, cynical, ravishing, ambitious, with a lot of laughs and surrealistic situations, this movie reminds us the other side of the coin about Richard III, because no matter how many crimes you have to commit for reaching your goal. A must for everyone who loves the craft's cinema.
