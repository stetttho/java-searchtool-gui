 This is a sad and haunting story which focuses in the iliterate Sardinian boy who is brutalized by his father . Nevertheless this boy will make the grade and become a master Greek and Latin . If you look back your memory about the disturbing and distorted relationship father and son , there have been just a few who are really winner .  In the thirties , Maedchen in uniform maintains a surprise for you in this girl school with authority and lesbianism . In the forties there is an emblematic issue of Roberto Roselini: Germany anno zero and the boy with the green hair (Joseph Losey) .In the fifties , Pather Panchalli , Jeux interdits (Rene Clement), Rebel without a cause and Giant . In the sixties the sweet bird of youth and the young Torless (Scholondorff) ; in the seventies the Chinese roulette (Fassbinder), Cria cuervos (Saura)  . But it is really during the eighties when this theme will rise in importance . In the nineties the unbeatable Character ,  Sleepers and Celebration .  This film won The Cannes Festival and that is not just a cumpliment. The Tavianni brothers developed a realist and pinful portrait revealing without scruples all the fear and way of living in a peasant family .  The hard times and the fact of living under a same roof but without being a home . The school works out as a merciless institution where the power is dressed of education ; and the hidden and perverse instincts grow up and will transform in real nightmares for the not so gifted children . The Tavianni brothers have given new stories and revitalized the italian neo realism . His fundamental filmography include besides, the night of the shooting stars and Caos (my special favorites ) , Good morning Babylon and the Sun even night (Il sole anche di notte) Watch that jewel film . A triumph of the italian cinema .
