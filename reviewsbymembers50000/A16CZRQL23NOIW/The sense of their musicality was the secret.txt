 Guess Who was one of these bands that hardly will be capable to forget today or ever . Really they kenw to blend the essential harmony lines with adequate balance between the cantabile the chords and the use of electric guitars , droms and bass without creating aural fatigue in the listener .  But in the other hand , they created songs loaded of innovativeness and creativity hard to believe . Undun for example is a disturbing ballade , Laughing is a charm ballade which trsnforms in a delightful and easy follw song . These eyes is their best song . Perfect harmonies which mix a potent message and superb musical inspiration. Share the land is a triumph song .  No sugar tonight is a magnificent example how you can win with a song based in the bass . American woman does not need any other adjective , it was their battlehorse and his meeting card for new listeners in the neat generations . No time is one of my timeless favorite themes . There is a inner fire and sense of dynamism so difficult to find in similar bands of that age . Just imagine about The Guess Who could have done in these times with The Video Techonologies and other Mass Media supports . Acquire this album . And you will be engaged inmediatly .
