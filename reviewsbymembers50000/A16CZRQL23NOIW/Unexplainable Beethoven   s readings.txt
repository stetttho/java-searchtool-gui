 Hermann Scherchen was in a very special day when decided to record these Beethoven Symphonies: I have never listened them previous or later played with such urgency sense; a true greyhound race. The tempos are hyper fast, without expression and colour, the artistic gamut of his talent shone by its absence. Both works are pregnant of lightness and character that seem have recorded as a proof of works Anti Beethoven.   Go for any other recording unless you are collector of weird versions, I bought this CD but the only fact to make a gift of it would be to offence that friend.   Maybe this is the worst artistic register of Scherchen. Failed and distorted Beethoven. A hallucinating aberration.
