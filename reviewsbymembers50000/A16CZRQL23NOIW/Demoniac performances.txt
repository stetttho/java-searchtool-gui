 Earl Wild has secured his throne in the immortality as one of the twelve best American pianist of the century. Kapell was the first one and in my opinion the others would be in that exclusive order Rosalyn Tureck. Egon Petri. Leon Fleisher, Earl Wild, Eugene Liszt, Van Cliburn, Byron Janis, Eugene Istomin, Joseph Villa, Raymond Lewenthal, Lorin Hollander, John Browning ,Oscar Levant, Gary Graffman, Jerome Rose, Selma Kramer, Paul Jacobs, Abbey Simon and Adrian Ruiz.     Somehow the enormous stature of this superb pianist has been neglected by unexplainable reasons. Wild , born in 1915 had this sense of span, that whole sound that literally the phrase and sense of the breathing . If Jasha Horenstein chose him to play a set of Rachmaninoff Piano Concerts indicates by itself something. Don't you? . In the other hand his repertoire was strictly romantic. From Dohnayi, Saint Saens, Chopin, his famous performance of Gershwin piano works with Arthur Fielder still are a classic issue.  In the case of Liszt he sounds with authority and convincing expression. He is ver far of making another additional pianist who employs Liszt just only to exhibit himself as a firework player. That concept so admired by the gallery in the XIX fortunately is old fashioned and belongs to the anecdote  . However there are names that you and know but by wise discretion is convenient not reveal them.   Buy this album and if you are not absolutely familiarized with Wild moods I guarantee you  will make an adjoining rapport with this keyboard artist in these unsurpassable versions only beaten by colossus of the stature of Louis Kentner and Edwin Nyiregyhazi sideral ambassadors in what Lisztian spirit concerns.
