 Carmen Maura plays a popular Spanish actress driven to distraction when her lover leaves her for another woman. She knows she can talk him out of leaving if only she can talk directly and not deal with the answering machine. A delightful and bizarre comedy of mistakes that involve a drugged pitcher of gazpacho, Shiite terrorists and a mental patient who left the asylum too soon.  A magnificent portrait around the kaleidoscopic feminine universe, was perhaps that launched the career of this talented filmmaker.
