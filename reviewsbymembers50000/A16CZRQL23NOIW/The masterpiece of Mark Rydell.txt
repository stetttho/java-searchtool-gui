 Rydell made an eloquent film about the timeless generational conficts among the members of a family during a fateful summer with  majestic locations as superb background .  Haunting portrait written for Ernest Thompson counted with a memorable casting: Katherine Hepburn , Henry Fonda , Jane Fonda supported by a remarkable moving camera and best photography . To my mind there are been so few times of the American Cinema had been able to carry on screen such interesting and moving drama with a visible European style , stylized script and above all a mature theme with such perfection and artistic level . You should go back in time until 1971 with the Last Picture Show , The Miracle worker in 1962 , Marty in 1955 and It's a wonderful life in 1946 to name the most remarkable pictures which deal with familiar problems telling an absorbing and original story . The film is a summer breeze but also a prudent warning for three different generations , I mean the whole cycle of the man . Magnificence in its most sincere significance.
