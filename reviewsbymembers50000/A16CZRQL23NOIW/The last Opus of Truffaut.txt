 Pitifully the death came for him, leaving so this project, unfinished. Claude Miller decided to assume the challenge to materialize the script and filmed this poignant story.  Maybe the film has notorious lows; its poetic inspiration does not reach a continuous development and demerits the final result.  It is absolutely necessary to watch previously 400 blows, because the approach is strongly enriched and supported by this vision.   I guess Truffaut intended to return the departure point and so to draw the complete circle. Only under this perspective this film will be appreciated in its total dimension.
