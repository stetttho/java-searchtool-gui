 The last Opus of a filmmaker is not always, successful. There are countless striking proofs that even many times the last farewell would seem to have nothing in common respect the artistic journey of the artist. If you glimpse the last sculptures of Michelangelo for instance (fabulous works mostly unknown) or the last Sonatas of Beethoven, you will ever experience a quantum leap, or a void leap; it depends in last instance of the personality of the creator.      In the case of John Huston, I guess this work must have been a very fondled project from his early years; a sublime expression of the most pyramidal of his writers and thinkers, James Joyce is one of the supreme Giants of the literature and the inestimable specific weight of his thought must be a particular pride 's motive for Ireland.   In this sense I think Huston planned to make the mythic Farewell: a party is given by three women for a group of dearest friends. But those people now dead, had a notable influence and repercussion on the lives of guests and hostesses at the party.   Just a reduced number of filmmakers have enjoyed this special feat over the death: to say goodbye with a masterpiece. Buuel, Jean Vigo, Visconti, Kurosawa and Huston may be proud to have done it.
