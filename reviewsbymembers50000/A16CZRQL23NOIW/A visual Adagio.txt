 Historically the Golden Globe Awards have always tended to behave one step ahead in what moral codes or conventional scruples concern respect the Academy Awards. The film deals with a very special relationship widely commented around the world between two men.   This delicate issue is handled with special care, without hurting sensibilities, the script nevertheless is built on non solid basis, making just emphasis on the surface of the things. I missed for instance the necessary dramatic density or nourishing flashbacks. There is an excessive employment of arresting visual landscapes and some well made violent dialogues. But the epilogue is so artificial in what dramatic expression that really disappoints as final corollary or deserved tribute. It's like you open the door but not entirely, leaving to see imperfectly certain diffuse and distorted images in a mirror.   Just imagine what about this film in hands of Rainer Werner Fassbinder, but if I had to pronounce for an actual filmmaker, I would have suggested three names without special preference: Nagisa Oshima, Pedro Almodovar or Peter Greenaway.         Special  acknowledgement to the arresting photography, artistic direction and splendid performances of the two main protagonists.
