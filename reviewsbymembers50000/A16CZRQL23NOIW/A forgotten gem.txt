 At the moment to account the list of the hidden jewels of the American Cinema we tend to dismiss this one. A touching tale of the 60's where Joanna Going made an exceptional work in this picture as the desperate wife named Helen who is tiring about the constant and gradually more constraints of his domineering husband and a degenerating illness. But the destiny gives her the last smile and reason to live when she found a soul mate who will understand her even better than her husband in her desire to be free.   A major and outstanding script -Beware: you won't see special effects- that definitively passed without stopping by the commercial circuits.  So please beware; take your time and go for this haunting and lessoned story.
