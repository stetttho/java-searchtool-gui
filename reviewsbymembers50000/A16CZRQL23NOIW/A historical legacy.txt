 Even I am not a Horowitz admirer, it 's worthy to underline and emphasize the colossal pianism and thunderous fingering around every one of its different performances.   The special distinction around this album is the fresh inspiration and notable musicality emanated in this Recital, that deserves to be catalogued as a cult recording among the impressive and even excellent live recordings in the Sixties.  A bravura performance and a genuine expression make of this album a very special recommendation.
