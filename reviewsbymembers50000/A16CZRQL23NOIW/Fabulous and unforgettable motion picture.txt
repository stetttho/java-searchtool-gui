 The originality of this film still astonishes the new generations. The powerful script turns around an ultra cynical sergeant -William Holden in his lifetime performance - in the middle of a hopeless environment. Hollywood was never better with such mature and questioner film about the drama of the POW. This film among other virtues shows you can build a tense drama interweaved with fine, incisive and sardonic humor that undeniably accented still more the terrible conditions in which they will have to fight to strive for surviving.  From start to finish, a terrific tour de force film, a colossal masterpiece and one of my top ten favorite Fifties movies.
