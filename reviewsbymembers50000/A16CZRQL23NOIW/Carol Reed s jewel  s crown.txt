 In this magnificent and legendary movie, Carol Reed goes far beyond all his works, The third man, the fallen idol to name the most relevant.  What Reed depicts in this film is to ,ake a sociological surgeon about Ulster comunnity and through the dramatical fact of our wounded man, played superbly by James Mason, the script is consistent without melodramatic holes, so you gradually feel the tension and the predictable climax . But the storytelling is incredible, the scene in the bar and the effect of the beer's drop still remains in my mind. You may consider it like the most important political film made in U.K. till that moment.  Don't miss under any pretext watching this movie. It will surpass all your expectations.
