 This was the first and even best version of the three released versions. This picture concerns about leadership issues and it may be considered as a permanent management lesson. If you weave finely , you can find related similarities with Potemkim ; the tyranny incarnated by the merciless captain William Bligh superbly played by Charles Laughton that legendary actor allowed also to Clark Gable demonstrate his talent other areas. Formidable direction of Frank Lloyd.  Unquestionably a cult film all the way and one of the towering films in any age. A superb classic.  If I made an imaginative selection of these two characters in the seventies, think in the couple Pacino and George C. Scott; in the eighties James Woods and Ben Kingsley, in the early nineties Robert Downey and Anthony Hopkins and in this raising Century Jude Law and Russell Crowe.
