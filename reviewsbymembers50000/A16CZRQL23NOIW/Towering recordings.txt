 These works are first rate . Schiff was in the peak of his artistic powers with these piano works . Superlative in its highest level . The Fantasy op. 103 is simply amazing and by far much more expressive and eloquent than any other previous performings. The great majority of ther pianists neglect the deep significance of these works and adopt two possible atitudes . the coolness (Emil Gilels is the best example of a notable pianist who misunderstood these works) or in the other hand play with absolute indiference, producing the wrong conception in the listener about the triviality of these works . Acquire these golden recordings . And if you have in vynil those old recordings with the couple Badura Skoda-Demus of the fifties you are lucky , because you do not need any other interpreter . Freshness , inocence , lyricism , musicality and wisdom are some of the most sincere adjectives for this outstanding recording!
