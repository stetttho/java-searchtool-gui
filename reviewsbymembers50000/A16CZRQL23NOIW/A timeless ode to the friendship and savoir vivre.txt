 This is a marvelous rousing drama set in Creta . Anthony Quinn migh well have done the best role of his life . He gave to this performance an unreachable level of magnetism , vitality and credibilty that literally he became Zorba for the rest of his life . Irene Papas as a young widow is glamorous too and obviously this super actor named Alan Bates . The dazzling direction of Michael Cacoyanis made of this film one of the timeless triumphs of the universal cinema. Unforgettable!
