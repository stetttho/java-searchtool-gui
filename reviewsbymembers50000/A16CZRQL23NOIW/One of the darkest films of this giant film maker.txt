 Welles made a little gem with this picture. He followed the lines about a nazi who assumes a new identity in a small town. But Edward Robinson is ravishing when he reminds a wise statement of Ralph Waldo Emerson :Commit a crime and the world is made of glass . Superb dialogues. Powerful intense with a gothic horror ending . As all the works of the Wisconsin's genius , unforgettable.
