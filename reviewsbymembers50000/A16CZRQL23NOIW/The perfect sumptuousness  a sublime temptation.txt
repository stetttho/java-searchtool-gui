 Lasse Hallstrom evades the anecdotic character, thanks his personal style and particular superb good taste at the moment of handling the camera, getting the instantaneous spell to submerge us immediately in this battleground of ancient prejudices and the accustomed religious corset, expressed through a visible air of self sufficiency and respect for the traditions. All the scandal arouses when a free spirited woman makes her appearance in a small community trying to survive with a chocolate shop, and making of those unique smells and delicious artworks a true magic carpet ride through new universes of sensations of different nature and intensity.  The rest goes for you at the moment to acquire this sublime and perfect film that reminded so much Babette ` s Feast in what the perennial conflict between tradition and innovation. Not only an unforgettable masterpiece, but a feast to the taste and eyes.            Juliette Binoche (one of my top favorite actress actually) is lovable, alluring and perfect in this role as well as the rest of the cast.     Magnificent and sublime.
