 This movie talks about contrasts, warmth against lack of expressiveness : the latinoamerican boundaries vs. the anglosaxon behavior : the whole conception about the basic requirements against the incomplet knowledge about his vital rank. There's a latinoamerican novel whose reading is very close related to 21 grams . I mean Rayuela from Julio Cortazar . You can read in a random order and the storytellnig is always perfect . Another important point to remark is the poem that Penn tells Naomi is from a living venezuelan poet Montejo . This is a detor film . A crossroad picture which links three different lives , three different worlds , theree different fates in a dramatical fact. The love appears as a happy son from the deepest regions from the tragedy and almost wins. The religion , the uncertainity about the life , the redemption , the memory , all that complicated puzzle is told with maestry , with poetic flowness , and accurate direction . The movie never falls in a melodramatic mood , it never let you down . There are always challenging and twists of fate who amazes the viewer through all  the story. Penn plays the most difficult role of his career. Naomi makes the grade as a character actress and Benicio del Toro gives a very difficult around a man who suffers a true metamorphosis. The suggested omages , the clue shot about an empty swimming pool reveal the loneliness , the hopeless and the tragedy of that little town , with dark passages and a brilliant use of the color as an addittional actor. This film is a step ahead in 2003 and one of the best and intelligent films made in Hollywood. We really expect that this couple of director and guionist keep working together , 'because they have shown a new road and new possibilities of cinema expression. A winner film!
