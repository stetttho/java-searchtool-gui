  The possible consequences and risk involved when the Pandora box is open. An anticipatory film just before Long Island and Chernobyl explores a probability that eventually can become in a reality.  Memorable performances of all the cast Fonda and Lemmon are outstanding. Very credible script with high caliber tension.
