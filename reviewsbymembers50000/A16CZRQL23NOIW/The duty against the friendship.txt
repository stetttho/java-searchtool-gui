 Three visions ; three gazes , three generations , three points of view . The Yuppie Generation who live in The Kitchen's hell ; a police and a mobster . The cop -Sean Penn is sent to New York and will meet again with his childhood friends but the life has invited them to complete the circle of the life . A stunning film where the job , the feelings , the duty , the betray , the honour and the merciless violence intersect  searing the screen. Full blooded film but filmed with superb good taste .  Arresting angle shots where you remember some bits of The Citizen Kane , superb  illumination , and solid script make of this one of the three best mob films in 1990 - with Goodfellas and Crossing Miller . The cast is fine but Gary Oldman shines with the light of a Supernova in this case . His role is the most complex to follow due the multiple spirit states demanded . Phil Joanou is a gifted director who should be kept in mind for next releases .
