 Glenn Gould was the artistic device who worked out as an artistic ice breaker Ambassador in the middle of that tense and conflictive atmosphere in the late Fifties. The glorious performance of Beethoven 's second Piano Concerto still remains as a true milestone recording ever recorded and shares honors with William Kapell' s warmth and monumental performance. He avoids by far the most of the piano players who are accustomed to give us a schmaltzy vision around the second Movement. Beethoven is not neither Classic nor Romantic. Beethoven is Beethoven. The genius as Mozart or Bach are always contemporary.  In what Bach concerns, Gould is superb; as always.  A true legacy for the future 's generations.
