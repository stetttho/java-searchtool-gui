 Today we are celebrating an additional anniversary of Mahler's birth, July seven 1860. And in this ocassion it is absolutely important to recommed this outstanding version of the Ninth. Horenstein owned that intuition and touch of genius that allowed him to win every time he decided to record Mahler. The Kinder are extraordinary too. A low budget prize for a true legend director!
