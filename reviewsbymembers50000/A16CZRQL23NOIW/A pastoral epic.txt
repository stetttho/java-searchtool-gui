 The bold portrait of the humble village wine makers against the interloping Japanese forces. An enigmatic and brave film that marks the ascending and meteoric career of Yimou Zang. Winner of the Silver Bear 1988, and one of my Fifty top choices of that Decade.       Will 2006 the year in which this supeb film will be released on DVD format, perhaps?
