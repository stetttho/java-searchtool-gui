 Thanks to the lovely effort of a high appreciated person I could know this outstanding recording, sincer and deeply expressive in this Jazz sesion. Petrucciani was always a sincere musician, and his technique worked out as an ornament he simply did not need it to captive the most exigent audience. Go for this singular recording and you will enjoy it from start to finish.
