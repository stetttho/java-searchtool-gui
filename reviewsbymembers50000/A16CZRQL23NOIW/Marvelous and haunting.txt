 The last day of a simple man who is dying of cancer , makes for him a real transformation in the values who held him . When he decides to give a surprise to his own daughter to tell her about his illness she captures in a powerful statement where she states she wants he dies as soon as possible .  He closes the door and that reason will carry him through the reconsideration about a lot of things . One of the supreme masterpieces of all the cinema story . Many people consider this is the most expressive and poignant work of Kurosawa . I do not agree but undoubtly it is a real gem . Unforgettable!
