 Dorothy Stratten was the playmate of the year in 1980. But her life was not exactly a garden of happiness; her brief existence is told with an impeccable narrative style, supported by a very documented script around her intimate hopes and triumph 's desires that simply vanished in the night 's brume.   The artistic concerns of Bob Fosse always focused around the inner dragons of the human beings. Although he will be always be reminded for Cabaret, just a few Directors were so bold like him to propose dark and somber films such Lenny or All that Jazz.      Dense, mature and superb film that will always be (to my mind) a treasured gem of Bob Fosse. Maybe Mariel Hemingway and Eric Roberts made the best role of their respective careers.
