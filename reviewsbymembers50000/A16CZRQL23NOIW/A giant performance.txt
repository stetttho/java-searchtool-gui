 After the seventies Bernstein experienced a wisdom mature . The contact with Europe influenced him and elevated his musical scope . This sublime version of the Seventh is simply to me one of the five best achievements ever recorded for the Maestro Bernstein. The Chicago Sound reminded me the spirit of Fritz Reiner . This orchestra gave a tour de force performance all the way . this magnificent orchestra joined with Bernstein to give one of the supreme Leningrad ever heard before or since . The brutal ferocity , the terror atmosphere , the gripping and chilling passages , the cynical First Movement march and above all the great epic breath is drawn to a perfection level for Bernstein . The other six supreme and unbeatable recordings of Bernstein are to my mind : Schumann `s Second Symphony , Copland's Rodeo , Haydn 97th Symphony , West side story  in his first period and Elgar `s Enigma Variations with BBC and this work.
