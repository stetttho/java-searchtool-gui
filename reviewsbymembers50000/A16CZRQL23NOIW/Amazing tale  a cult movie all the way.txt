 If I had to make a brief account of the top five films of Carlos Saura, this film must be included in this list without any shadow of doubt.  Since an architect suffers an awful accident who lets him in a wheel chair and incapable to pronounce just a simple word , he will be the silent  witness of the horror and nastiness of his family members who are really -with visible anxiety- he dies to enrich themselves.  It is very important for you , my dear reader to realize the underground clues given by Saura in this age of the Franquist Regime where the metaphors should be intelligently suggested to avoid the implaccable censure in those times.  Watch as soon as you can this superb and powerful movie!
