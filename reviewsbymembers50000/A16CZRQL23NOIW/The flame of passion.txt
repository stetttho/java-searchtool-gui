 "In Chopin' s hands, the Mazurka ceased to be an actual dance tune, and became a tone poem, a mirror of moods, an epitome of human condition, joy and sadness, love and hate, tenderness and defiance, coquetry and passion." This is only a minimum sample of what  you will find in this treasured work.  This text is not only a fabulous guide but a smart essay, of invaluable information about the whole work of the Polish composer. The admirable style, the assertive indications and the conceptual freshness make of it, a recommended reading not only for musicians and interpreters, besides for all those who are really interested around the Chopin works.
