 Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli incarnated during many years the aristocratic mood in piano playing. Architectonic refinement, meditative phrasing without any single bit of delirious Romanticism. His performances are contemplative rather than visceral, he played the piano like an entomologist , searching the perfect balance of musicality and expression. His limpid phrasing and specially one of his most reminded personal trademarks: to leave the bar floating to create an introspective atmosphere.  If you are looking for a hyper Romantic Chopin, forget about it. Michelangeli enhanced and expressed wisely new angles of performing the beloved son of Poland.  I would like to remark, there are other players who has followed this fabulous approach; Alfred Cortot, Samson Francois, Ivan Moravec (pupil of Benedetti) and Dinu Lipatti, among the most representative ones.
