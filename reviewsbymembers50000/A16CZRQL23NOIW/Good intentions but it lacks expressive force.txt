 This film won the Academy Award as best original script. So there were a lot of reasons to watch it. The result is disturbing. The first link I found is the huge influence of Michelangelo Antonioni (The eclipse)and Jim Jarmush (Mistery train), the script begins as a promise, and many expectatives; so in the middle of the film it happens nothing; the film falls in a hole: There isn't any brief clue about these strangers in the middle of Tokio; the loneliness and the no sense life is a issue so many times told. But I still hope for a twist in the script; the boring of Murray fills the half of the movie; ok, that{s the point, so what are you going to do? . Scarlett Johanson is the most remarkable point to review, a new promise talented actress so as the homagge to La dolce Vita of Federico Fellini ; remember that in Under the sun of Toscana there's another homagge to the same Fellini's work. So the film remains between the hopeless, the memories and the huge crowd, the video games that mesmerizes to the young people against the adult clubs. A overrated film; good locations in Tokyo and Kyoto; a post card movie.
