 This towering film deals with the role and the meaning of the authority. Two opposites sides of the coin: one of them bets for the option B according Taylor's  theory : the human being must be led and punished due they are lazy, unproductive and disinterested in the work,in this sense Dirk Bogarde is the officer absolutely convinced about this; and his methods are extremely cruel and merciless. The discipline in excess is to my view  an evident symptom of mental insanity; and I agree with Freud when he affirms the violence in the human being is an exteriorization of a self destructive instinct: And the distance between violence and the excessive discipline is so close that overlap one each other behind mesmerizing words.  Alec Guiness represents the humanitarian side of the leadership. He knows that the best results can be obtained with discipline and a bit of left hand: a light and permissive relationship in which the joy can be part of the command chain.  Both visions will face in multiple areas; Bogarde disobeys elemental orders, assumes personal considerations about the navigation speed, the final goal of the assigned mission, inflames the ego of the men under his command arguing possible promotions in case certain norms be lightly readapted, he exerts a psychological pressure over Guiness exaggerating the punishment on his own child Mr. Crawford.   And finally we have a third disturbance element: the workers leader: Anthony Quayle who plans to generate a mutiny on board. As you see, we have a circle script, in the purest tradition of the British state of mind: Remember Ronald Neame's  Tunes of Glory of 1959 , the famous Kubrick ' s Paths of Glory or Billy Budd.  An unforgettable movie; supported by  a great scrip, superb cast , magnificent action sequences and edition work, a permanent lesson about the Management role in the life of the organizations and far beyond a life lesson.
