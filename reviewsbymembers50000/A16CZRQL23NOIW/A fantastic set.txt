 Pierre Boulez, as the good wine seems to improve through the years and enhancing exponentially in what Bartok concerns. This work is another additional sample of his magisterial enhancement through the years. The particular emphasis in the architectonic lines and the astonishing handle of the dark dissonances, confers him a well deserved seat of honor. This Wooden Prince is one of the best you can get in the market, as well as Cantata Profana, that you may easily consider the best version ever recorded to date.   A golden album. Absolutely recommended.
