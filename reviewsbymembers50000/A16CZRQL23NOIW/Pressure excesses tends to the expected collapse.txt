 Push and press but keep in mind you are not the only smart person on the earth. To be placed on the Top of the World does not guarantee an absolute control on the state of things. The ambition has multiple faces and you have to handle both hands: left and right. The extreme compulsion may be effective but at general terms becomes a mortal boomerang.  The life and times of a remarkable and raising promise of a sportsman is stopped because of an involuntary accident. Since that moment his life will experience a decisive twist of fate when eventually he met Walter Abrahms an ambitious and dominating chief whose life turns around the hazardous activity of forecast results in all kind of sporting disciplines.  If you notice it carefully this memorable character played by Al Pacino maintains close affinities with that devil personage he made in Devil `s advocate. If you realize Matthew MacCoughney and Keanu Reeves are the new Ambassadors of the new order where the rules are overlooked in search of future challenges.  Maybe Rene Russo was out of context all along the film. She definitively did not fit in this role. Perhaps the inquisitive Jessica Lange and even Elizabeth Shue would have contributed for a major dramatic impact.  A fabulous script with that only black stain.
