 A dying old woman waits for his son, who has distorted the awful truth making her believe he is in New York waiting for a film in progress; her daughter in law is placed in a terrible crossroad: Is it better to accept this lie or tell the truth?   This haunting but powerful picture is supported by photographs that link the frames; the frozen time inside the cinema itself.  Captivating, beautiful and slow paced film that securely will engage you.
