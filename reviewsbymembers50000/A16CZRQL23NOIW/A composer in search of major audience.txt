 The German musicians could not pretend not to hear the Impressionism, the new language of the poque. That is why further than necessary to insist, respect to Reger, he wrote fugues and as Anton Bruckner, started from the organ though unlike Bruckner returned constantly. Reger followed the traces of his ancestors Beethoven and Brahms. He knows just think on the basis of counterpoint and traditional forms. His harmonies seem am opalescent crystal without concrete color. The contiguity of two distinct accords is almost a norm to him. Exaltation and architectonic sobriety are closeness in his music.  Scherchen interprets some of his most known orchestral works in what are worthy to remark his Romantic Serenade and both Variations on Beethoven and Mozart. Pitifully I regret Scherchen has not recorded the Bcklin Suite No. 128. The jewel of the crown is the Mozart Variations performance, not only due the fact it is the most known of his Orchestral works, but the brightness and transparency conferred by his conductor.   Nevertheless, this is a magnificent opportunity to get close to Reger 's universe, because, the incomprehensible amnesia of the most Orchestras overseas Europe, we must make it by our own and recommended to our closest friends.  It' s time for Reger to be rediscovered, taking account of being reminding the 90th commemoration of his sensible death.
