 This picture is not anothere mere additional film about the Mob. It's another intelligent treatment about a story one thousand times told. But with a peaceful insight about he intimate world, the affective liasons and an adequate perspective about the role of the Mafia nowadays. Palminteri has always a notable actor. Somehow this was the right choice made for an exigent pupil as Robert De Niro in a tale of the Bronx. Chazz makes an original approach of the Boss and all his efforts to lead the new generations for the clean roads. Absolutely opposed to deal with narcs, and trying to isolate his own sons from this sordid atmosphere. There are common places, and if you want few explossions and vuisula violence, The director bet fr an intelligent dialogue and absorbing script, focused specially in the emotive beahavior of Catellano since his early years in the middle thirties. Angela Alavarado as Gloria makes a fabulous performance, very natural with a multiple variety of facial expressions and totally engaged with this secondary role. She really stole the show.  The ralents, travellings,and flashbacks are formidable. Above the average and overcoming my personal expectations, by far.
