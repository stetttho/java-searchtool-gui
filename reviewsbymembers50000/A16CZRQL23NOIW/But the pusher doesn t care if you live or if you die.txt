 Bold and transcendent movie that literally broke the walls of a delicate, awful and overlooked issue, that day after day corrodes the entrails of the modern societies all over the world.    Tense drama that will shock you from the first shot. The trilogy conformed by this picture, Requiem for a dream, and more recently, Mary full of grace are not a mere product of casualty.   Powerful, merciless, cruel and struggling script that will beat in the family of a devoted ferocious prosecutor who combats this awful lash.  Filmed in sepia tonality to accent still more the dramatis personae. Special mention to Benicio del Toro for this celebrated performance.
