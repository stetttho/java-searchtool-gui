 Tirimo, the famed Greek pianist achieved a special distinction in the middle Seventies. A deep insight vision, has allowed him to scrutinize piano works that don `t necessarily appear regularly on Concert programs. This selection of Janaceck 's piano pieces confirm it.   After Firkusny `s missing, there was an evident declivity around these works, that pitifully denote a certain disdain for that music. Its bucolic and Pastoral character don' t demerit at all its innate virtues.   Accurate phrasing and artistic conviction invites me to recommend you: These are valuable pieces of the keyboard repertoire of the last Century.
