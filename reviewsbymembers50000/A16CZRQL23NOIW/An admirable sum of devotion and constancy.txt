 Yesterday evening I received by mail a long and unexpected gift. A golden friend sent me a reproduction of this treasured book. And that 's why I just slept few hours tonight, reading here and there the invaluable and remarkable information around the development of the Russian Cinema.   Jay Leda -his author- worked untiringly during three years around the Schools and Cinematographic Soviet Studies. His tour de force allowed him to explore all the impressive amount of material, never released overseas, and obviously known works in the Western World. He made a vivid and authorized portrait of the artistic trajectory of different filmmakers and their works.   Kino is dedicated to any interested reader about the theme as well the specialist, it has been documented with statements of creators, critics and valuable illustrations, some of them never posted previously. It includes besides, a selected catalogue of premiered films between 1908 and 1958, with interesting details about directors, screenwriters, interpreters  and scenographers.                       It is a must buy.
