 Otto Preminger was one of the most creative and brave directors of the american cinema in the fifties and sixties. His works were loaded with a ravishing realism , they were very expilict , challenging and disturbing . Imagine what it means the plot around the adultery commited by the wife of an officer in that age . You can reply me with From here to the eternity but this film is more shocking , and overcomes in dramatic punch to From here ...The other examples you may think is Baby doll and Dial M for murder in the fifties, but this one wins the match.   The powerful sequence in the Court has only a serious match in The Nuremberg judgement . Never before there was not a previous film so disturbing like this that film  who explicitly turned around the bitter and awful consequences about the adultery .  The plot is overwhelming , magnificient built , without any hole . The cast is incredible . Consider these giants actors as Ben Gazzara , George C. Scott , Arthur O'Donell, James Stewart and Lee Remick in her screen debut . This film was nominated as the best film but was unlucky , because Ben Hur literally won all the prizes and somehow that fact stroke the undeniable virtues of that superb work. However the time seems to set in the right place this picture. Acquire this one.  One of the most remarkable films in the american cinema story.  If I could give this film ten thousand stars , I 'd do it .
