 In the sixties Antonioni made a similar work about the hopeless , the loneliness of the human being . This tragic mood in a certain way was released again in this work in the eighties with Paris Texas where the sense of the search is bay far , much more important that the search in itself . In the opening shot we see an incredible scene in the vastity of the desert where the wind and the sand seem to be the only friends of our desperate man . Slowly the camera will show us with merciless focus the nucleus , the dramatis personae . The mirror dialogue sequence with Natasha Kinski is one of the saddest and best achievements ever made for any other film maker. And it is really amazing that all along the years the style of Wenders ran parallel to Antonioni concerns . That is why both of them decided to work togethetr in that film titled Beyond the clouds (1995) with the master of the great silences Michelangelo Antonioni.  This is (in my personal opinion) the second best movie of Wenders , since I consider The wings of desire his most powerful and artistic issue . Wenders is a poet who inspires in the little concerns of citizen without importance . But the form in which he tells the citizen story is what it really counts . Deeply introspective , the most of their pictures are inmersed in a nosthalgical mood but never conclude in a pesimist conclusion .   One of the most controversial films in the eighties but also powerful and convincing .  Watch it !
