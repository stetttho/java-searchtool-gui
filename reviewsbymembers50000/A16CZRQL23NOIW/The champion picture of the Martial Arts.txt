 Do not search too much about a credible plot. All the pretended cover for chasing a criminal who deals with narcotics is a huge frame to show us one of the most admirable Kung Fu fighting in the story of the cinema. The camera of Robert Clouse is under the stage planned by Bruce Lee. We will assist to a petrified island with an important footage in the first minutes where the master and Bruce Lee talks about the spiritual doctrines of the Kung Fu: interesting dialogue that pitifully is not longer. We will watch interesting duels with John Saxon, Jim Kelly and Bolo Yeung the same who fought in the first great feature of Van Damme sixteen years later Lee gives us the best of his discipline, with impressive domain of his flying attacks and the use of wood weapon.  The final combat between Hahn and Lee will be in the mirror hall, a great homage to Orson Welles' "The Lady of Shangai". However I must recognize the final climax in Chinese Connection is even superior.  The last opus of Bruce Lee who died on July 20 1973, just previous several days to the world Premiere. Well restoration process that allowed to observe the terrible shot of the mortal snake. A cult movie from its instantaneous release!
