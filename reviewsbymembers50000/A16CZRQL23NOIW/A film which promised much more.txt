 It is a real pity that such interesting initial premise has fallen in common places without creative flight.  You can notice this work as a crossroad between the wings of desire and Heaven can wait but with a great difference the movie still remains in a contemplative mood and the worst of all : it has not any substance .  The tears can not become in a river . I still wonder how this film has the sign of Spielberg .  I love Holy Hunter acting . She loads the screen with her expressive force , but Dreyfus does not seem run parallel to her . Hunter as Frances Mc Dormand need a stronger presence actoral due her inner spontaneous force . We can think in that age in Daniel Day Lewis , James Caan , Ray Liotta , Tom Berenger or Robert Downey Jr , the results could be different .  Brad Johnson looks inexpressive, and James Spader, Rutger Hauger or William Hurt were perfect for this demanding role .  The script is too obvious and unnecesary tearful. You notice the absence of secondary characters and parallel secondary lines which supported the story . To make that poetic film you need mich more than simply special effects ; you need poetic tapture and commitment . The original idea was very promising . The hommage to the brave flying fireman simply does not appear .   Audrey Hepburn made her last appearance in screen and after watching all this film you miss her undoubtly and I would have wished a best result in this sense .
