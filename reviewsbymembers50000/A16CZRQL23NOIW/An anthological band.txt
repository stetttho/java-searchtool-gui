 Credence Clearwater revival is now part of a living legend. His innovative pieces were loaded with deep conviction , and above all commitment .  They created a sound based in the beat , and not in the virtuosity aspect . If they made Proud Mary as the most known theme , they translated to Lodi , a summer song or the rock and roll themes like Fortunate son or Travelling band , or well they turned to incredible pieces such as Born on the Payou or the ballad Have you ever seen the rain? They knew how to engage every different market target , and that was the secret of their sucess . In this age one wonders in silent voice how they are missed and why are not there bands actually with such creativity and beating sound ? . An unforgettable style that will never let you dissapointed. Buy this one.  A must in your private collection.
