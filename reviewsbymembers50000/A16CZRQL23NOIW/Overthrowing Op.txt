 This film meant to a very young man named Andrei Tarkovsky his diploma's film from the Soviet State Film School . A steamroller drive and a young boy who plays the violin ; beautiful metaphor among the creator and the consumer ; the mass and the art living together in harmony .  The final scene is devastating .  Simple but legendary as all the masterpeieces .
