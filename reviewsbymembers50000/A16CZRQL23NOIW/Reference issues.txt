 One of the jewels items of the music with the fierce splendor and monstrous technique of Jasha Heifetz: a collector item specially by Sibelius. This version is one the three top performances ever made. The other two to my mind would be Ivry Gitlis and Ginette Neveu.  In Tchaikovsky violin concerto I rather choose other recordings. It is an excellent version but it lacks Russian fierce and musicality.
