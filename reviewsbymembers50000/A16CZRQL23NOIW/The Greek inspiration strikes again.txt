 If there is a feature that reveals with major accuracy the troubled and irreverent Seventies was the explosion and untiring search of new sounds. The first incursions of the synthesizer allowed the raising of new bands (Emerson Lake & Palmer, Yes and Uriah Heep, among the most representative in the early Seventies) but also to test around the expressive possibilities of its minor brother: the organ.   Aphrodite 's Child combined a very peculiar style with style and class; a lyricism imported fro orthodox rituals and old dances of Greece, the monumental talent of Van Gelis and the singular voice of  Demis Roussos entered in the right moment , betting and winning.   Aphrodite 's child represented, perhaps the Mediterranean response to lyrical bands, such Bee Gees for Australia, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young for USA and Rolling stones for U.K., once the Beatles were absent of the musical stages due its recent dissolution.
