 This film was a superb adaptation from Mario Puzzo' novel- Coppola reached the peak and became a first rate director with this movie. There are many worthy issues to remark. The first of them was the superb approach and conception given to this complex and even fascinating world of the mob. Until this movie; no other one had made such analytical surgeon, with so deep gaze. The camera (with a photography which reminds us to Visconti in several dramatic sequences) establishes as another actor.  The amazing cast was another cosmical achievement. Coppola has always had that hunter smell for the outstanding actors. What can we add to the unforgettable performance of Marlon Brando? . More than acting Brando established a landmark; he became in a model for this role. But the emerging talents such as Robert de Niro , James Caan, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton and the young raising promise as Al Pacino who had revealed the year before with Serpico, looks like they had established a unspoken commitment, not only with the directorial code, but with themselves. The flow of the story follows the same model as a Symphony in four movements. Coppola will never be effectist with the action sequences; he makes that you feel as logical and the use of the music looks like a voice in off, which makes as a natural link for the work in progress. There are, at least five unforgettable sequences in this legend movie. This work from its release, became in a reference film. Watch it and you'll be always rewarded over and over. An eternal triumph in the story of the cinema.
