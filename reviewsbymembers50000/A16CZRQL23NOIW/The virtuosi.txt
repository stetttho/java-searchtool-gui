 Alfred Cortot established better than no one , the mean character of Horowitz when he was requested about his opinion between Vladimir Horowitz and Edwin Fisher. Fisher is a amn who uses the piano to play music while Horowitz employs the music to play the piano. In these clever words , Horowitz through the years kept the greatness but without intensity ; and that is the central point of his career .  The virtuosism is a double edge weapon . His incisive style shocked the crowd and the gallery public in those years in Carnegie Hall , his partnership with Arturo Toscanini remarked his musical gifts ; but I never found beneath the Horowitz performances  the sense of expressiveness and nuance ; the scope behind the score ; the demanded cosmovison , the technique literally invaded all the corners of his interpretations . and so my initial wonder was leaning downward through the time . In the Tchaikovsky performing there is efervescence but the soul of the intimate world , the coudy shadows of the russian m oods and the disturbed emotional of the composer simply it is absent . And that is a real fault . Because the easier is to make of this work colossal fireworks .     These pictures of exhibition express the most high caliber firework , they are unmatched level but the question still remains it enough to break a record to be a good artist or performer?
