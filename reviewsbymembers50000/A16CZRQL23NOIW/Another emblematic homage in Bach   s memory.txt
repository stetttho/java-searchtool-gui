 Glenn Gould in mutual collaboration with Jaime Laredo and Leonard Rose, made a brilliant account of these well known  Bach 's arrangements. Impeccable musicality, superb phrasing, flawless sonority, egregious intonation, unerring lyricism and superb expressiveness make of this album a must-reference.   Acquire it without blinking.
