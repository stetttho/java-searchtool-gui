 Daniel Barenboim played this whole set with an interesting approach to WAM . The notations about classical , beethovenian style are always hazardous. When you are a musician you must avoid in the cliche , and you should feel the music as a whole and the playing must be the consequence of a overlong process that begins in your soul , then your inner mood , your intellect and finally your fingers. I remark the aspect when you are in front of Mozart,  Beethoven Wagner,  Bruckner, Bach , Schubert and Bartok , because these composers are in a highest level than the others and the music itself is merely a device for expressing deeper issues. That's why this set is superb. Barenboim  plays a Mozart rich in expresiveness , he gives to Mozart presence . Barenboim plays music as Vegh or Furtwangler did it , always seeking the landscape far beyond the score . That's why they are so original in their performances . The rapture is not a device for exhibite his skills , it''s the final product of a long process. Acquire this set. It's an unvaluable treasure.
