 The rocking horse winner is a notable adaptation from a David H. Lawrence. This movie is practically unknown by a large audience. If you watch it very carefully , youll be rewarded, for several reasons. The middle class family who slowly suffers a status fall; has a very intuitive and smart child capable of predicting the winner horse in the race horses. This child has a close friend (John Mills) who suddenly sees this gift and so he wins some money. The close atmosphere in which this boy lives, makes that he reliefs in a wood horse , his mude friend and powerful device for his predictable visions. Soon his greddy mother (the great actress and extremely beauty Valerie Hobson) will know about his special gift and the dramatis personae will run before the eyes of the viewer inmersed in a gothical hallucination with its undeniable tragic consequences. This film, obviously was not the accostumed market product for that moment, spcially three years after that awful Second World War,  that destroyed physical and spiritually many people. Thats why the film didnt get his deserved place in those years. The audience wanted a better and hopeful future and the menu cinema should offer comedies, romantic films and light drama.  Thats precisely what it gives major value to that movie out of its time. Anthony Pellisier conducted his most intimate film with astonishing results. A true cult movie of the british cinema.
