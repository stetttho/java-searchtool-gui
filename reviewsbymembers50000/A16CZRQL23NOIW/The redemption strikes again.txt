 Tony Scott at last signed his name in the great list of the film noir titles with this work . The script meticulously depicted , is around a looser , and alcoholic ex agent who is hired to keep on safe a charming and clever child - Dakota Fanning - . With a magistral employement of cinema verite style Scott makes a triple journey in this picture : The growing and affective relationship between the bodyguard and the child ; the sordid and corrupt world of the Brotherhood in Mexico and the disturbing world of Pita's parents . Washington is superb in this role . Walken and Gianini outstanding . Rourke would seem to be out of context and commitment with a demanding role .  The only negative aspect to remark is the presence of Mark Anthony who simply is out of space .Think in Wilhelm Dafoe , Ray Liotta, Rob Lowe , Jude Law , Ralph Fiennes , Tim Roth, gary Oldman or Jason Patric , to name just a few actors who could make this film to highest level . This was in my opinion , its only fault . Nevertheless the script is so well made that it is still a punch thriller . Bravo for Mr. Scott who finally faced the challenge with this mature work . The film reminds us too much to The Proffesional (1994) that film of Jean Luc Besson with Jean Reno . Nevertheless this film is by far more ambitious and pyramidal .
