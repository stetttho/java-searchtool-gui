 The script deals around the relationship between the Union capitan (William Holden)and the people of Fort Bravo during the Civil War . A real management lesson . Very fine actings and an outsatnding and tiur de force climax in the last battle in the nmiddle of the desert. A great movie from John Sturges and also a towering performance of William Holden .
