 The ineffable and fragile figure of that poet and composer Enrique Granados revives thanks to the invaluable efforts of this new label that so many jewels have legated us. Listening that artist we can realize his powerful sensibility and Spanish charm.  The author of Goyescas plays with Iberian passion, Granados had "duende" something like special charisma to magnetize and mesmerize the people who surrounded him.   Go for this treasured album. Absolutely gratifying.
