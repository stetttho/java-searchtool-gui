  The first little detail that called me powerfully my attention was the his birth date: July 7, just twenty seven years after Mahler's birthday. He was a poet, an individualist, and a lonely artist. Absolutely divorced from this almost genetic standpoint to follow the road about the traditional slave art's autarchy, however, he will always maintain the essential roots of his Jewish ancestors. The vanishing perspectives of the most of his works would seem a dreamy pattern, challenging and daring all kind of conventionalism.   "It must no paint pictures with symbols. When an artwork is really authentic, exist by themselves symbolism in it". That sharp reflection is so narrowed linked with a Robert Bresson 's  statement: "Let the facts lead to the feelings and not vice versa"    Consider his most famous painting: The three candles, where the lovers couple defy not only the gravity 's acceleration, but are by themselves a real breakthrough with the oppressed human beings. The sad harlequin and the tragic red, the couple is just so far from being happy, they weep the invisible presence of the implacable menace. There' s an incisive line in Fassbinder' s Maria Braun in which she says in imperceptibly to her sister: "All the happy persons seem to be some vulgar, when one is unhappy".  Particularly interesting are the mythic cycle between 1975 and 1977 with those admirable motives. Icaro and Orpheus'  myth. Admirably investigative work and abundant in excellent reproductions of the most selective work of this singular painter.
