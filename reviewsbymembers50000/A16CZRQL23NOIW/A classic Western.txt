 If the Western genre has an ambassador, undeniable would be John Ford. He was his maxim exponent. The story of Wyatt Earp and Tombstone now are part of the story. If it remained some doubt about it, you may realize why Tombstone was remade in 1993 (with Val Killmer making the best Doc in screen and by far his best achievement of his career). And surely that means something remarkable. Go for this classic and solid cult movie through the years.
