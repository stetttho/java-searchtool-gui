 The impeccable phrasing , intonation and vibrato of David Oistrakh joins with the dynamic imagination and raptrure of his fellow friend Sviatoslav Richter to produce to my mind the most poignant , haunting and colossal version of this Sonata which sounds far from being romantic in its whole conception . It sounds dramatic and that vision confers it the most vibrant and passionate Frank Sonata for Violin I have heard ever .   and by the way if this performing were not enough for your requirements , please prepare to listen one of the definitive version of this piece .  Sviatoslav Richter gives a towering performance plenty of this solemn and introspective spirit this work demands . So try to get as soon as you can this golden album .  Historical recordings with superlative artists !
