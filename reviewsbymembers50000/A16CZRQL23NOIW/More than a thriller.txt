 It deserves all type of acknowledgements to make a slow paced thriller with the courageous of the best Chabrol, where the suspense and the mean motive: the kidnapping will be just a big frame to concentrate in a very smart portrait about the human reactions, involved.  Firts at all our victim is far tobe an innocent man. He has his little secrets as all of us, and our sinister and macbre mastermind will make him to confess along this mountain journey. In the other hand we watch the face of the failure, embodied in Wilhelm Dafoe who makes a very delicate role as the bad guy. His intimate life is simply a mess. He can not avoid to be the second in his marriage and he thinks he has made the grade as human being. The money according him will allow to elevate his status and respect not only with his wife but the world. Helen Mirren makes another impressive role as the wife, who far from falling in the common place of the suffered and far from being consolated woman, searchs and explores all the personal background his husband has kept in secret. She faces her lover with admirable mature's sense and crude realism. A sincere ackonwledgement to Redford's perfomance. His grow up process as director has enriched him with unexpected gestures and mature as actor.  To be honest, the film might be reduced in fifteen minutes. But the use of multiple flashbacks and the arresting landscapes work out perfectly in a story that you could consider a psychological thriller, You won't see special effects, but an admirable, mature and excellent with European taste and that may be the bottleneck for many viewers who perhaps are accustomed to a other tempo. Recommended under these warnings!
