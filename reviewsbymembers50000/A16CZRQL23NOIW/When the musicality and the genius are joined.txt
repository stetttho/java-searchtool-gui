 One of the multiple devices employed very often by Mr. Gould in his different performances was the exact use of the color tonal . So when you listen even the inner movements of every one of the Suites you are inmersed in another dimension level . The third Suite is my favorite one . I confess it . In this piece Gould atacks the notes and surrounds them with softness , moderato cantabile and noblesse sound . He was really inspired with these performances and even these Suites are not so stylized as the French Suites , for instance , they are clearly an important way to get close to the fierce , advanced and out of time musical ideas expossed all the way . Think for instance in the Prelude of the Second Suite or in the Sarabande of the Third . The melodies are pregnant of cosmical breath . Bach must never sound romantic , because this approach transforms the spirit of the work .  The real inspiration motives of Bach are far away this world and its circunstance and when Gould plays he seems to be a direct pupil from Bach . Gould never abuses of the forte piano , he plays slghly and never allows the hands produce a percusive sound . This ignored detail you feel in other keyboardists but hardly in GG . Acquire this set as soon as you can .
