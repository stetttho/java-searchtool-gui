 In spite the fact Charles Munch reached a unequaled peak with the 104th Symphony, Scherchen, Beecham and Colin Davis share deserved honors, I must recognize the devoted inspiration and sublime charm gotten by Bernstein those days with the New York Philharmonic.  Leonard Bernstein achieved an overwhelming artistic feat with the Symphony No. 97 of Joseph Haydn. You won ` t get another similar performance with such burden of stamina, imperial breath and supreme expressive elegance.   Forget about any other 97th. You just listen and then, I guess, you will agree with me.
