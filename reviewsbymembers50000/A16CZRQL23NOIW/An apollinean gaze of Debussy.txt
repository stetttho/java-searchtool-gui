 Benedetti Michelangelli was a poet, I mean a creator. Besides his huge talent and mesmerizing pianism, he also owed the special gify of overpowering his audience. And the same statement works for Kempff , Francois , Richter,  Sandor or Istomin . Listening to him inmediatly  a weird atmosphere creates and you're sure of being in front of an artist who made sing the piano. He looked like a reinassance man.  Michelangelli redefined the craft playing Debussy's preludes. His playing lacks emotion, but that's not deniable ,  he talks about memory , he is more interested in let floating the note instead sounds incorporean as Gieseking does. May be you feel a little disturbed for that approach like I did , because for many years I used to Gieseking playing in these works. But it's another observation angle and it's worthy and even surprising. Michelangelli will never let you down. Buy both CD the first and second book and you'll understand once more why Michelangelli was one of the most idyosincratic pianists in any age.
