 This film is very far to be only a more anti war film . It's much more than this . This film is deeply disturbing because it challenges you about the wildness inmersed in this coward act to a simple man in the middle of that evil conflict among the ancient Yugoeslavian . Since this perspective the film maker set us in front a serious moral crossroad .  The Red Cross tries to make all what they can do but this help it is not enough . Since this fact is a punch notice , this dramatic circunstance becomes in a rating subject . The film is opened and it is carefully objective in its proposals . This picture won the best foreign film in 2001 , competing with Amelie .
