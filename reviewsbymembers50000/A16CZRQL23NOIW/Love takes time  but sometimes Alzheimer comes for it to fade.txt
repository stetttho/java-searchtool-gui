 Nietszche stated once: "The age of marriage arrives before the age of loving each other." Perhaps we may find the clues to intend to comprehend and even approximate us to the horrid existence of a generous, sensitive and sensible personality of this brilliant poetry, whom love definitively did not take into account. Maybe such prodigious talent must pay a prize: to shine and illuminate other touching sensibilities gratifying excessively what that soul lacked: affection and love.         The blackness of the night; the horror of despair, of loving and not being corresponded, the dark brumes of the solitude, the hell of living inside a decreasing circle, struggled by disillusion and all kind of humiliations in live flesh with all the cruel intensity a sensitive soul can bear. Day after day  Sylvia Plath walked to that flame, with fears but with lucid resolution, until a day the living will was defeated.   Gwyneth Paltrow made a very exquisite performance around this demanding role; the varied gamut of emotional features was shown with admirable realism, facial grimace, illumination, hairdressing and expressive close ups that accented that dramatic anima state.    When you love and (she or he) does not, you will understand the desert at just three steps of water.
