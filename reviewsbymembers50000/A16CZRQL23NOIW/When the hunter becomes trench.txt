 This is a striking episode in the middle of the African jungle . The story could emerge from a fantastic script from twilight zone . A safari guide leads three man to make some accustomed and dangerous excursions for hunting . Suddenly the fate will appear . These man are murdered for a tribe and our guide will be advised to be the next prey . He will be provided just for nothing to survive . His clothes and his skills will be the only possible tools and weapons to survive . Interesting , brutal and profoundly disturbing . A Darwinian challenge all the way . Cornel Wilde stars and directs this sinister plot and builds one of the most creeping portraits ever made about Africa . It's a passionate and sometimes forgotten cult movie from that decade .
