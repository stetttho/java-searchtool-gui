 The thin line between imagination and reality, and the use of a cavern to cross the forbidden limits leads us immediately to the same roots of the mythic fact: Once you have decided to break the line watch out for the consequences.  Shijiro and her parents are in a happy picnic and suddenly the curiosity will empower them and you will assist to one of the most memorable imagination exercises in decades. The multiple adventures lived by Shijiro will work out as a frame and will show us some little details, but profoundly revealing such as the awful spelling of her parents on pigs when they have not obeyed certain rules of the game inside this weird world.   Excellent work, innovative, fresh that reflects a deep artistic commitment. New airs from the East, will convince you the cinema is able to reinvent itself time after time, this is the intrinsic quality of the art, in last instance.  A must for all the family, but much more than a simple children story.  A journey to the dense brumes of the imagination!
