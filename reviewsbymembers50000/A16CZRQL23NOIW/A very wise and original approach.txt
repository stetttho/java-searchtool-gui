 Since Bernstein 's departure from America to Europe in the early Seventies, his personal vision experienced a major scope and his wisdom became bigger. His well known hyper romanticism so typical of the Sixties away.  With Tchaikovsky ' s  Fifth it is extremely not fall in a contemplative rapture. The own structure of the work ldo not seem to offer too many performing ` s  liberties.  In the First movement, Bernstein 's approach is characterized by an exquisite phrasing, extremely slow to accent perhaps the bourgoise charm and the gentle atmosphere of the Belle Epoque, the Andante is transformed in Adagio, he sacrifices the Caucasian musculature and the rage explosions in search of the inner vision of the composer. It is a smart concept if you take in mind the last Three Symphonies are permeated by an introspective mood respect the First, Second and Third of visible Imperial character.     In the lovable Andante cantabile we notice an evident autumnal character pregnant of a melancholic serenity. The expressiveness in clarinets, oboes and fagots must be accented to obtain an unspotted result. These instruments are the window that allows us to loom to his disturbed soul. And the overall result is a true Mahlerian ethos, translated from the romantic Vienna to the enormous extensions with desolated steppes and endless gelid Siberian grounds. You are capable to make these risky and original innovations with a first rate Orchestra; the New York Philharmonic with its accustomed perfection, made it possible.   If you are a Tchaikovsky ' s purist, listen to your spirit and forget about it all the previous theories. Bernstein abandons all the literality you can imagine, he elaborates other canvas.  The Valse of the Third movement is performed filled on anticipatory premonition.     I do not find best comparison for this Andante maestoso and the twilight of King Lear, the horns do not announce better days, on the contrary seems to prelude a true Gtterdammenung. The Allegro vivace is played with ambition but restrained emotion, gradually the contained histamine appears to express the jubilee and glee of a new dawn. This is very important because the Russian soul has always feed their dreams through the Scherzos and Dionysian rapture. The Presto is a doubtful triumph, a well dissimulated Fanfare to ignore the ineluctable destiny, expressed according the canons of the best Russian Orthodox tradition.           Romeo and Juliet 's Fantasy Overture inspired in the well homonymous drama of Shakespeare. Well phrased but extremely cerebral, it lacks the sense of urgency and fevered anguish that characterizes to Munch 's Boston Symphony.  Nevertheless, this album is a true historical document, at least for all the sincere admirers of that magnificent and talented conductor who had so much to say in despite of having left us at the age of 73: Leonard Bernstein. Wherever you are, maestro at your memory!.
