 This is an interesting movie, well written and made with a sense of prevision and increasing tension. If the first third of the film has some problems, the picture improves notably since the dialogue with the children and then you will be a honr guest to participate of an intimate and powerful message. The use of the dragonfly as the vehicle between both worlds was a real hit!I must recognize this theme required perhaps a major approach and the presence of a script more ellaborated.   If Jean Cocteau has been the supreme master in these journeys to the death considered as the last frontier, Orpheus showed us that the same death may fall in love with the life and sacrifice by its own to find its bliss.  The personal tragedy of Joe Darrow due his beloved wife' s death will be the first step to establish an unavoidable call from the death's world. And the reason why will constitute the dramatic device, the haunting ending when the death bets for the life and wins.  The film has little details; it's far to be a pretentious puzzle mind; it's very simple to follow the clues. Kathy Bates is splendid in that secondary role as the material lawyer who supports the emotional and emotive fissures of Dr. Darrow, but even she is not able to avoid the boring dialogue. She makes all what she can, but sometimes it os not enough.  Somehow, this movie might be the complement vision of the Sixth sense. Because when one of them or well both lovers die, and the cycle has not been walked at all, it's necessary to complete it.  Certainly, after the film concludes you feel some bitter taste in the whole puzzle. The final sequence is extremely and unnecessary tearful.   Too much violins and few cellos in the orchestra, perhaps?
