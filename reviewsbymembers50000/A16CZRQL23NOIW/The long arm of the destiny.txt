 A typical feature of the Noir Film is precisely the unavoidability of the fate who waits without haste its precise moment to act and twist all kind of illusions or life `s  projects. An ex con is set free after four years in prison. After murdering another thief, he decides to prepare the big punch but the things will be out of context; you know even the most intelligent and clever of the gangster cannot be faster than the speed of life.   What I love in the most of Noir films of this French Master is the inexorable cycle of guilty without redemption, visible clues of the modern tragedy that seem to breathe with astonishing intensity and superb realism.  Despite the fact the picture is inspired and even nourished for many Noir films of the forties, retains its individual profile and maintains with enviable freshness the vigency through the years.   Absolutely recommended, without reserves.
