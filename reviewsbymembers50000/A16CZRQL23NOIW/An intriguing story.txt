 If not for the impressive performances of these two outstanding actresses, the refulgent beauty of Mary Astor and the enigmatic look of Bette Davis, the movie could have been forgotten for the great audiences. But both of them assumed the compromise and shone with effective radiance.  A gentleman lives his own affective crossroad: his actual wife (Mary Astor) is a consummated and renowned pianist, but simply the marriage does not work out, he has an ambitious mistress that pushes on him to divorce.   The dramatic nucleus will unfold since her ex wife is pregnant and he disappeares between the Amazon jungle.   A brilliant chamber work with memorable performances and excellent direction. Edmund Golding is the same director of Nightmare Alley.
