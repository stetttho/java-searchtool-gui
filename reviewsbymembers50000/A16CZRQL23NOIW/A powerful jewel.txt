 This work may be well considered as the masterpiece of Biily Wilder . This movie was done as a majestic  symphony in which every little detail , turn and twist was calculated , achieving its effect with the simplest of means . Fred Mc Murray is the insurance salesman enhanced by Barbara Stanwick in a plot to kill her businessman husband .  The ethical crossroad and the dark shadows of the film noir are shown so clearly in this film as very few have been able to do it .  One of the fundamental clues of this genre is the hopeless , the distrust and the double moral in all the characters . There is no tomorrow and the destiny follows your steps . For every inch you walk , the tragical and sinister fog of the fatality will surround you , no matter what side of the coin you represent . The fate intersections and the soul darkness emerge to prevail on your behavior .   Famous adaptation of James Cain 's novel and screenplay of Raymond Chandler . Add besides the Edward G Robinson and Barbara Stanwick presence and you will obtain a classic sample of one of the top films of the forties .
