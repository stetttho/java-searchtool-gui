Eric Clapton had the magnificent idea to join some of the best guitars in several rhythms and despite the fact there was an unbalance respect the number of jazz guitars as Pat Metheny, Al di Meola, Peter White, Craig Chaquico, the presence of consecrated figures such Steve Vai or Carlos Santana, John Mc Laughlin, Larry Carlton and the living legend: his majesty BB King, makes of these double album, a must for you.   A fantastic tour de force.
