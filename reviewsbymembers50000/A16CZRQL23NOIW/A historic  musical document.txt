 This CD is a revelation. Shostakovich playing himself with all the athoritative power who he meant ; a great composer and believe or not a very gifted pianist. In the Piano concert no. 1 Shostakovich plays with caucassian moods ; outrage and histamine . There's one serious performance that rivalizes with this one . Kapell -Ormandy-Philadelphia of 1945 . The second concert is a true revelation. The second movement is not only filled with arresting lyricism but itself means a jump to the future. Think in the andante of the ninth concert for piano of Mozart or in the Adagio of the Ninth of Bruckner : There are cosmical raptures who goes far beyond a simple moment of divine inspiration. Eugene Liszt made a great performance in the fifties too, but never wins with that. If you're a serious collector of unforgettable issues ; thius recording is a must!
