 Richter does his best for elevate the status to one of the most reiterative Piano Sonatas ever written. You can feel the lack of muse in Tchaikovsky. Banal, anodyne, non transcendent  and sincerely boring.  But the worst is yet to come. It is unbelievable how the sound Engineers and the Edition Personal did not check the inexcusable cuts along the different episodes of the Pictures.   I bought this record with the nave presumption of suppose the tracks were complete but you know ; there is always new under the sun.   All those acquired this CD should return and expect not only the most sincere excuses but sending us a new album with the required conditions, but I am afraid this expected hope will not be possible to satisfy.
