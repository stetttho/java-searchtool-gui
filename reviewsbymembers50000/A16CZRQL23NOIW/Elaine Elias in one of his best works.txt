 Elaine Elias is a talented and extraordinary well gifted brazilian jazz pianist - Her appoach and arrangements made in every track of this album are simply gold dust . Antonio Carlos Jobim represents one the supreme names in the bossa nova mood . His name is so clearly engaged to Brazil that Aguas de Marzo or Girl from Ipanema are titles that have surpased its own age and have signed its memories in the immortality . Think in Stan Getz , and Astrud Gilberto for instance among other famous examples . They won Grammy Award in 1964 thanks to their undeniable talent , and supported for the lyric mood of Jobim . All these performances are of first rate and confirm once more the prodigious talent of this artist . A must for any jazz lover !
