 This is simply , a towering movie. Just a few films show with so splendor the epical sense as this one. Not only it established a standard as the best work filmed in  the desert: the kinetic existence of this well educated man who fights in a conflict absolutely out his concerns . It's impossible not remind to Lord Byron when he died in Greece , fighting by a noble cause. All the cast was incredible. Alec Guiness , Omar Shariff, Anthony Quinn , Jack Hawkins and Claude Rains and obviously this legendary actor Peter O'Toole who lost the prize as best actor in 1962 with Gregory Peck in To kill a mockingbird. David Lean adapted the book the seven pillars of wisdom with overwhelming results. Lensed in Jordan and Spain , the film has countless astonishing sequences , but I 'd really wanted to underline , just ywo of them. When the army has crossed the Akaba desert , there's a man who apparently fell from the camel. Lawrence decides go bacj for him : and then he listen the warning : you won't get back from the journey don't challenge the destiny . Obviously Lawrence ignores the warning and goes for him . When he arrives with the half dead man , he states those brilliant lines: the destiny is just right here and he touches his head. The other scene is just the opening sequence when he crashs his motocycle and dies in an absurd accident.  The hero's life doesn't have any sense after the the triumph of the last battle. Something similar happens with Gladiator > I can't imagine the hero thinking in quiet life or a normal life as the rest of the human being . The hero has completed his mission , has completed his own cycle and the time comes for him to fade . This mythical cycle makes the death of Lawrence,has been more than casual . This work is much more than simply an extarordinary film ; it's a real triumph of the western world ; an artistic treasure ; a timeless picture!
