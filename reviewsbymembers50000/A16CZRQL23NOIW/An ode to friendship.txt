 This film is one of the most sincere and haunting films youll watch in you life. A careful sight into the affective world of three friends, his adventures and livings, until they find casually twenty years later; and the changes produced by the life in what they are, and their useless efforts for trying 'to freeze' the time. Beautifully filmed with surrealistic rapture images. Manfredi and Gassman were two of the major actors in the italian cinema in any age Watch also for that legendary seductive beauty who was Stephania Sandrelli. The dazzling script and delightful sequences are feed by a clever sense of humor. Its about the nosthalgical reflections of those years that theyll never come. A cult movie. One of my favorites italian films.
