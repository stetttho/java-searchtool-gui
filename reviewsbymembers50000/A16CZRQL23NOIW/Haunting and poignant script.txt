 Through the admirable acting  of  Jessica Tandy, and the talented Kathy Bates we will be the silent spectators of a brutal drama in the late years of the WW1 in the South.  But this central nucleus has another parallel dramatic line. Meanwhile , Bates will experience the lack of affection of a terrible boring and predictable husband who only thinks in himself and his favorite passion; the sports.  The admirable storytelling will captivate your heart and soul.  Arresting photograph and remarkable artistic direction make of this film a must see.
