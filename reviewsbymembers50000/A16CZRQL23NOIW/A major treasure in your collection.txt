 Such day as today but in 1892, Szigeti came to world. And this oppotunity to celebrate another additional anniversary of his birthday the ocassion is pleasant to recommend without reserves this anthological album. In the whole musical story you will never find such status level as in this collection. Verve, perfect intonation, superb nuance, passionate charm and flwless articulation are conjugated in every one of these Sonatas. The second choice, but miles away would be Artur Grumiaux, but Siget`' s scope certainly establishes a very spaced difference. If you have any doubt , please check for the artists who played with him: Bela Bartok, Artur Schnabel, Egon Petri and Pablo Casals. Doesn't it talk by itself?.
