 For the hard fans (as me) of the Who there will be another additional reason for support that statement. This work remains in my memories as one of the most remarkable musical triumphs all the way . The Who certainly were in his creative peaks . The creation of Tommy showed another important facet of this ensemble. My generation , Magic Bus ,or Summertime blues are played with fury and deep histamina . The riffs and the fierec of the guitar runs paralel to the incandescent rhytm and hard drum beat. Don't even doubt. This album is in the top ten list of the rock seventies gems.
