 There have been male actings which literally overpass its own condition to inscribe in a very special category : the model . To make me understand of you I will make a little account of that statement through the decades and not all of these actings were prized with the Academy Award . In the twenties : Emil Jannings with The last laugh . In the thirties : Paul Muni with Scarface and Edward G. Robinson with Little Caesar. In the forties :  Orson Welles with Citizen and Olivier with Hamlet . In the fifties :  Charlton Heston with Ben Hur , Charles Laughton with The Hobson choice and Olivier with Richard III . In the sixties :  George C. Scott with Patton , Clift Robertson with Charly , Anthony Quinn with Zorba  and Peter O Toole with Lawrence . In the seventies : Marlon Brando with The last tango , The Godfather and Apocalypse now , Dustin Hoffman with Lenny and klaus Kinski with Aguirre . In the eighties : Ben Kingsley with Gandhi . In the nineties : Anthony Hopkins with Titus . So considering this premise , the film simply is not at the same level than this outstanding and exceptional acting . These unbalances are more frequent than one can imagine . And this is one of these cases .
