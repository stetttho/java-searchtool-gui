 You may find the loneliness even in the most unexpected places; the question is how to deal with it. A famous radius talk show is the indirect causing of a tragedy that eventually will lead him to verge of the alcoholism.    The crucial encounter with a dream maker, a lonely person who undertakes an absurd search of the Holy Grail in New York city will be the premise for Terry Gilliam, who consolidated still more his personal status as one of the most prolific and innovative filmmakers of the world.   Outstanding tour de force performances of all the cast: Mercedes Ruehl is superb; Robin Williams delirious as always and Jeff Bridges in the best role of his career until this date.   In my personal list of the top fifty films of the decade there are two works of Gilliam; this one and naturally, 12 Monkees.   A majuscule work that allows not only to reconcile us with the Great Cinema but besides and perhaps most important yet,  with the life, an additional proof the Cinema is an Art by itself, but only when the camera is an eye in the mind of a poet, and this is, precisely the case.   A golden gem!
