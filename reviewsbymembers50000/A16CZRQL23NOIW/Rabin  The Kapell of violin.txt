 What a great loss for the musical world became the early death of Michael Rabin.! His reading of this Op. 1 from Paganini is overwheelming. Absolutely elocuent and passionate vibrato, Rabin convinces us that he belonged to this selected group of musicians (such as Casals, Kempff, Vegh and Edwin Fisher and Ginette Neveu, among others)who had aview who followed his bliss in his interpretations. With the early death of Neveu in 1949 and Rabin in 1957, the world of violin still is orphan.
