 At last! after a long waiting, the Sonny label has released this treasured album. The First piano Concerto is elegant and thundering with a  persuasive and mercurial approach. One of my Five superior choices of this well known piece.  The Second Piano Concerto simply is insuperable. I do not know about another performance that can steal its primacy. It possesses Oriental Fantasy, Caucasian passion, and febrile Balkan intensity. Graffman was truly enraptured and inspired as Ormandy did. This team made the most incandescent and Imperial performances of these two Piano Concertos Two and Three played with minor frequency than the First one.  Finally these Pictures are authentically sparkling and superbly performed. In what Islamey concerns, two serious rivals: Simon Barere and Julius Katchen marked an abysmal distance respect the other players, and this version might be the Third choice.               Voil for this release.
