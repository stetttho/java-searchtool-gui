 It will never be enough to remark the great loss for the musical world the early death of this outstanding conductor. Kertesz was the young promise of the conducting craft at tle level of the greatest names . When Frucsay died in 1962, Kertesz became in the great young promise.  in fact, he owned that we can call a sense of span in music. He possesed that weird ability of make the notes float, so important in the organical flow of the music, he was a truly master in underlying these secret accents that the score hide in its own, the use of rubato never was overdone. His charisma was evident and with the sublime exception of these two giants of the conducting in that moment (seventies) Carlo Maria Giulini, Sandor Vegh, Leonard Bernstein and Jasha Horenstein, there was no one more close to this elite than Kertesz was. His reading in all the Dvoraks symphonic works are of first rate. Just behind Kertesz, you may think in Kubelik, with a more romantic approach perhaps, but filled with a true conviction and sincere honesty. Dont let the opportunity for acquire this set. One of the London eternal treasures.
