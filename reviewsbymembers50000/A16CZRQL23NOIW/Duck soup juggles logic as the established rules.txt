 This atmosphere zero film defies gravity and common sense . This sublime masterpiece is funny , innovative , ridiculous , outrageous , savage , silly and caustic . Notice the concept of humor had never been shown in this way . Four brothers each one with his own profile make it possible the corporeity of this symphony in gagtime orchestrated by one man and performed by a whole army .  Specially the ravishing presence of Zepp , who despite his straight character is perhaps the most important part of the team . He was an expert gagman (remember the mirror sequence ;  the highest laughable sequence all along the film) and is so great so unforgettable that keeps in your mind so subreptitiously that becomes in very difficult issue to forget . Leo Mc Carey present the Marx Brothers in their best , purest and most consistent and imaginative work , which meant a real delivery of nonstop series of gags over this film breakneck seventy minutes . This humor derives from a set of cumulative effects never viewed before and expressed so originally , since his script sails on fantasy places issues such as invasions of the privacy , destruction of the property and underline the ridiculousness of the burocratic and clumsy behavior of the political status Q of this small country of Freedonia . Watch the script begins when Mrs Teasdale agrees to give this country twenty millions dollars to save it from the bankruptcy . So if you state the world in that age the metaphor is overclear . Such unfolding of causticity will be restored seven years later by Charlot in the Great Dictator . Watch that landmark film which in many senses may be considered one of the five masterpieces of  this genre in all the american cinema story.
