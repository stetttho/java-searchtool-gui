 Leonard Cohen in his particular mood , lets you mesmerized . The best song in my opinion in this well selected collection is Dance me to the end of love , with great lyrics and greek echoes . There another winner songs like Everybody knows and Suzanne ; Democracy is powerful too .  Cohen 's style is unique . His voice in a ultralow frequency works out as another instrument ; very expressive and warmth .  Since I got this issue in 1999 I heard it at least once every month .  High creative level , expressiveness , musicality and originality .
