 Consider just these songs : Rollin ' down highway , Beside you , the fields of joy and the driggerman. Only for these four songs the CD is widely recommended .    Since I was a teenager in this age , I can swear you the magnificent sound the original rhytms that characterized this ensemble . Beside you, Colour my world (Chicago) , Rain (Uriah Heep) , Changes (Black Sabbath) and Don ' t be a hero (Jim Capaldi) may be the greatest rock ballads in the seventies.   Superb work if you are hard fan of rock hidden treasures!
