 The camera moves in a certain style who reminds us to Aronofsky (Requiem for a dream) . The opening sequence chase is told in the pures documenal style hand nervous camera. First at all Jason Patrick has grown up as an actor to keep in mind in futures releases . His performance is deeply complex , because he has three dragons to face ; one as husband for his eccentrities , another dragon is the weight of the blame as an involuntary murderer and the other is to find out who are ehind the murderer of a cop . Liotta makes an admirable work too . His rol is extraordinary well written . The dark atmosphere is a punch ; I mean : watch this artistic work , because the picture is much more than a simple case about dealers , cops and bad or good guys ; precisely this is a strong point to its favour ; nobod is innocent (like the real life). The film trascends itself to become progressively in a disturbing and provocative story . The angles shooting and the screen divided in four (previously used for Norman Jewison in he Thomas Crown Affair and more recently in The italian job) is amazing. A very complex and perfect script support and makes of that film one of the best issues filmed in 2003 . There are shades of Serpico , Internal affairs and Dark blue but the film owns personality and too much to say. Watch this!
