 If I had to pronounce myself by the two best achievements of the Goddess Garbo I should mention Flesh and the devil and this one. In both cases the director was Clarence Brown who knew to impress it to Garbo this sense of  vertigo and misconduct, that is hard to find in any other version.   Personally I always thought in Isabel Adjani playing this role she was perfect; because she has character sidereal beauty and that expressive gaze, able to express so many emotions.     A legendary film with an outstanding, unforgettable and exquisite actress.
