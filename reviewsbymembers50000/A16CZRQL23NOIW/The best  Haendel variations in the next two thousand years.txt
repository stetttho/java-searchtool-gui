 The Haendel variations may be the best perfomance achieved by this great conductor.  Don't think it twice.  In the original version for keyboard , there are two giant versions Julius Katchen and Michael Ponti (live), but in this case the arrangement was made by Edmund Rubra and the result was a winner. The Philadelphia Orchestra sounded involved in an epic atmosphere , a happy weird comittment with dyonisiac force , telluric conviction , and glorious climax. Forget any other recording in the market.
