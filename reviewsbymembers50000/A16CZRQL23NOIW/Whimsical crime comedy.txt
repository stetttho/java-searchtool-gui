 Do you think is it possible to inspire in Bogart films to make such decision as become a private eye? This sharp and very clever film begins with this premise and develops an original story that will delight you to the end. Deeply rooted in the true origins of the British humor; dark, sinister, elegant, cynical and stylized.  Wonderful entertainment for Finney buffs and far beyond. A film that turned my personal attention for this young promise: Stephen Frears.
