 Bruno Walter's Brahms is the final result of a life's experience. Walter was Mahler champion conductor and  Mozart too. This curious association brought as consequence the intimacy, the wanderer spirit, the joyful Vienna's evenings, and the Dionysian mood. Walter was a wise musician and his approach was always deeper than most of people realize.  That's why any other conductor hasn't been able to decipher as he did, the unbeatable performances of the Second Symphony and the hard to conduct Third Symphony.  His best readings were made through the Fifties. We find a Walter in the peak of his musical powers. Personally, I don't have any doubt that his profound knowledge about Mahler was a decisive factor to express a wider and expansive Brahms ` feature.
