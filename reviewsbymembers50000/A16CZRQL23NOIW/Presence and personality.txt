  The melodic, expressive and captivating voice of this notable crooner still remain through all these years. Dick owned that instantaneous landmark seal that one distinguishes immediately in a singer. Somehow he anticipated to Frankie with that moonlight charm so typical of those difficult years, during and after the WW2. An eloquent diction and musical phrasing that literally made of his voice another instrument by itself. The influence of Bing Crosby is obvious but who could escape from it? , but that is far to be a complaint but a reflection. Besides the huge presence of Jerome Kern and Cole Porter ran parallel to Vladimir Kosma and Mercer somehow is narrow  bounded with Jacques Prevert on the other side of the ocean. Furthermore,  if you take a look around about the candlelight  songs in those ages such Laura, My funny Valentine, the very thought of you or When I fall in love, you feel the call of the Mother Earth in the sense to recover again the sense of the back to the intimate world made of affections, to try to forget as soon as possible the deep scares from the War years. Go for this CD without any doubt!
