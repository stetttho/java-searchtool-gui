 The historical concert of Berlin will persist in our memory for a long time. Recorded just three days after that unforgettable day, November 9, 1989.The emotive burden is present all along this Concert; from the first bars of that excellent performance of The First Piano Concerto Op. 15 to the last bar of the Seventh Symphony. Daniel Barenboim conducted from the Piano in the First Half of the program. The encore was just after the Piano Concerto with the Andante of Mozart ` s  Piano Sonata Kn. 333, that pitifully was not added to CD.  The astonished faces, the human warmth and the expressive gestures of a crowd who had never had the possibility to presence a live recording with the main orchestra of his beloved city.  I don' t doubt just a second about its gradual historical importance through the years to come.
