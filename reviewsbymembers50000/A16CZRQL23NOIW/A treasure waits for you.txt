 The most reminded Norwegian musician, unfairly named as a "miniaturist", wrote once: "Artists like Bach, and Beethoven have built churches and temples on the heights. I would like, as Ibsen expresses it in his drama, to build dwelling places for my fellow men in which they can feel themselves at home and be happy."  His musical nationalism does not proceed truly from his ancestors; as a matter of fact his grandfathers were Scottish immigrants. In this sense I have always maintained the fact that the chamber music has always been a magnificent device to express with absolute creative freedom and openhearted inspiration the multiple motives, concerns and livings of any composer, and many times works opus as personal dairy to communicate his most inner feelings and anguishes; (think in Smetana for instance, with his famous String Quartet "My life" in which describes in the Fourth Movement where he remarks with febrile intensity his awful raising deafness)   The first one is a visible youth composition. It is filled of vitality and innovative proposals. The Second one is much more intimate and mature, in spite of the fact there are two years of difference between them.   You should not forget besides, the lovable Cello sonata and his string Quartet, because Grieg as Brahms and many others composers open his heart in most of those intimate pages.   And if you add the presence, expressive eloquence and warm tune of this unforgettable violinist, a supreme master of this instrument whose premature departure in the Fifties was a true disgrace for the music. Sitkovesky 's Kachaturian ' Violin Concerto has no parallel.     Don' t miss this record.
