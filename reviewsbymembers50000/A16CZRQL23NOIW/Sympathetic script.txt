 This is a nice entertainment that deals with several issues. The management subject when a woman is hired as Creative director of famous Advertising Enterprise; but in the other hand explores (and here is the hook) the feminine thought thanks to a curious accident suffered by Gibson. This fact will lead to laughable situations that will conclude in an expected happy ending.  Delightful and well acted. Helen Hunt is marvelous and Gibson displays his charisma in his funny role. Good entertainment and one of the best comedies of the Nineties.
