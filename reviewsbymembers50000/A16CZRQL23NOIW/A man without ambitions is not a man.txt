 This powerful statement is the answer given for the wife of Taketoki when he argues her his great loyalty and fervent gratitude for the king ; this answer is the spark which will initiate the whole drama of Macbeth the ancient and loyal warrior of Duncan in the original version of Shakespeare .  Nevertheless the Scottish landscape suffers in the hands of Akira Kurosawa , a colossal change transforming this landscape in a misty visage of feudal Japan. The strange supernatural encounters , the arresting atmospheres involved in a sordid fog where the evilness , the ambition , the betrayal and the greed will turn in a deadly and lethal device for Taketoki Washizu (Macbeth)in a nasty human being influenced by his wife in the first part of that infernal journey to reach the power and then the slow and progressive disolution . Behind these visible traces of death , distrust, guilt ,  suspicious and lies, the real world will never be the same for this couple . Taketoki at first fights for getting the power and soon , very soon he will have to fight to preserve it : once more the eternal cycle of the power 's  tragedy shown with all its nasty reality . The madness process in his wife is first rate ; her hands are filled with blood over and over again . And no matter how many times she intends to try to eliminate ; it's useless . Light employement of Kurosawa is overwhelming to emphasize it . It is very embarrasing to describe this superb and magnificent masterpiece . Kurosawa made one of his landmarks films with this ravishing and incandescent adaptation ; brilliant in superlative degree , visually outstanding and emotionally powerful movie . One of the supreme masters of the cinema : Akira Kurosawa (1910-1998)
