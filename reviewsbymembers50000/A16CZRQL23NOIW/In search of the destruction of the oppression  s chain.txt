 Seijun Suzuki pushed out until the last consequences this tour de force script based possibly on a true story. It concerns about a group of prostitutes who decide to rebel and break away against the pimp who oppress them. This plan is molded with the help a gang of organized criminals but the things pitifully will turn another road, when the plan fails.  Brutal, somber and devastating statement about the abuse and human degradation in Japan. A story well known but told with such realism and force that engages you from start to finish.
