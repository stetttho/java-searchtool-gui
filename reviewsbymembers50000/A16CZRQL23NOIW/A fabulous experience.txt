 I knew about this ensemble five years ago, thanks to a melomaniac friend: Pavlov. From the first bars I engaged with his admirable expressiveness and wondrous lyricism. The country taste and enraptured rhythms make of this album one of the best choices for you.   Bela has expanded his musical sphere and now constitutes a reference pattern at the moment you wish to enjoy the freshness and captivating bewitch of this notable country folk musician.  The album is simply sumptuous: buy it and you will never regret it.
