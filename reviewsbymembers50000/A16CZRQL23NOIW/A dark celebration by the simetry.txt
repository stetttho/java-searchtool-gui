 This film is an intelligent puzzle. You must be building the story , the clues are given ironically, tragicaly and above all subrepticiously. Two twins married with two sisters , a swan , murder, guilty the same lover, the one and the couple are engaged, come together , and become unending laberynth of borgian proportions. A man dreams that another guy dreams. This story is just fascinatong The archetipes are precisely defined. Oparin makes his own web. The feelings involved around a common tragedy, just having the zoo as a huge frame where the life begins and ends, without any pain, with natural precision. The speling music of Nyman, Sacha Vierny and his amazing photography, the dark poetry supports the dialogues, the desperation seems even not forced but she assumes slowly its place in the play. Greenaway is a brilliant director with a unpleasant lifes view. What it realy is amazing is the total absence of feelings in every one of the depicted characters. ou wont see  a teardrop, even in the worst of one situation. The homagge to Vermeer makes the film still more interesting, arrestong and provocative, in a style who reminds us to Luis Buuel but without the religious ethics underlayed of the spanish director. Certainly the multiple readings that Zoo and two noughts offer us walk around the biology, the huge affection of Greenaway by the insects, worms and all that little universe who survives under our indiferent behavior. This trilogy of films together with the bely of an architect and drowning by numbers, allows us to traduce the universe of this excentric and irreverent film maker.  Dont miss this film.
