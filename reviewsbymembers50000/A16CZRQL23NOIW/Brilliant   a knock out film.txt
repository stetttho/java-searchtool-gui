 Since Frances Normand's boyfriend is murdered by british forces in North Ireland , she decides to investigate this weird murder , she  plays the role of an American human rights activist .  A punch in the middle of the face , because it concerns about a conspiracy , cover up and ambush policial, inspired by similar events in 1980 . Filmed in documental mood for Ken Loach. Briiliant performances of Frances Mc Dormand and Brian Cox.  One of my favorites political thrillers of the nineties.
