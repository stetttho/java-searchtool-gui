 A lonely man, terribly disappointed since his last amorous failure, decides to make a long and complicated journey to win the favor of a young lady who could be his own daughter. She will blackmail her and the pact is to spent a week with him.  The smart script is enriched with bitter and caustic dialogues; scented with that discrete charm where you immediately tie up with Vladimir Nabokov ` s Lolita. If you notice carefully the amazing resembling between Sinead Cussack and Sue Lyon you will coincide with me. It's an intimate chamber work that depicts three fundamental characters: the man in question, our candide girl and her naive boyfriend.  A clever and modern fable that shows us nobody is absolutely out of game in what love concerns. When you have talent, imagination and good taste the door is open.      A mature film that will let you thinking for a long, long time.
