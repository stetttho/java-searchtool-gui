 Bruckner's seventh is a monumental and overwhelming orchestral work. It is in itself a real universe. It owns wholeness. And as all the real complet art works that inherent sensation to be in another superior level. I think Bruckner is extremely related with Johann Sebastian Bach in this sense. His music will prevail due its huge purity and greatness. Furtwangler made the hitherto version of this work. I have got some other recordings simply as reference but forget it. This is until now the most revealing and idiomatic performance I ever know. After Beethoven I guess the great audiences will identify to Furtwangler with Bruckner and Wagner always. Fundamental issue in your collection!
