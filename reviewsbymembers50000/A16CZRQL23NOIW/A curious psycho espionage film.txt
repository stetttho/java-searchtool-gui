 The master of the suspense gave his first slip with this existential espionage picture that does not get to move or commit the viewer. Its coldness narrative, the narrowness of its scope, and its impressive slow paced rhythm constituted the first signal of  conceptual fatigue and lack of major ambitions. Maybe it was extremely dated even for the age it was made. A true disappointment considering the stature of his director.
