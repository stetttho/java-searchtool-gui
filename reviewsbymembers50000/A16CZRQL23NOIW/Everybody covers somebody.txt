 It is good to remark the slender differences between it means a thriller according the European style and the American approach. In the first case the psychological motivations and the danger taste come from the inside to the outside: that makes the rhythm and the tempo looks slower. You must build the puzzle and the facts will complement the whole drama.  This brief introduction makes the picture may be considered not a perfect thriller according the American gaze. There are many dispersed clues and many involved interests. All of them have a common denominator; the fight for power and domination and the fact of no matter how your weapons are: the betray, adulation corruption double moral. But these variables maintain the dynamic from the power's spheres downstairs and vice versa. Everybody has something to win and loose. Covering their backs according the position in the social pyramid. The truth is handled as a romantic and devaluated concept in this ideas' order. And that' s the original point game that revaluates this slow paced but fresh thriller. It will reward you. Highly recommended.
