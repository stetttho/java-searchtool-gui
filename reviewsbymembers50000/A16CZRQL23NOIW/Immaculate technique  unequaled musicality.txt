 These unerring recordings are absolutely essential in your collection. The trio for Horn, Violin and piano Op. 40 reveal to Brahms as major composer. Filled with nuance and wonderful expressiveness, the warm hues of this fabulous ensemble surround this chamber work of particular brightness and enviable singularity.   Both sonatas for Clarinet are major works that would precede to his grand quintet for clarinet one of my most beloved pages. Dieter Clocker, clarinet was the founder and musical director of the famous Consortium Classicum. Winner of several gramophone recordings with a wide recorded repertoire.  Nevertheless, the First of the Sonatas is better achieved than the second one, which lacks of breath and brio, pitifully.  Outstanding phrasing and superb inspiration, joined with Werner Genuit, who studied with Hans Richter Haaser and notable interpreter.  This happy encounter of three great chamber works of the Glory of Hamburg, make of this CD a very advisable acquiring. I got it in 1992 and since then I use to listen with accustomed regularity.   So I recommend you it  with closed eyes.
