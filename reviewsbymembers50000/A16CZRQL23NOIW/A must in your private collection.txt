 I had the enormous privilege to watch twice to Sandor Vegh conducting the Salszburg Camerata in Caracas 1989 and 1992.  I will never forget the most incandescent version of Dvorak's Strings Serenade I ever listened in my life. His mercurial powers were beyond any rational explanation. And this day 1992 , after the performance a group of friends made me knows some musicians of the Ensemble. I remember some fragments of this dialogue which lasted almost three hours in which we exchanged multiple issues. I told them that Vegh was far beyond to be a musician. He was a real maestro in the widest sense of the word.  His Mozart is so eloquent and filled with purity and innocence that it will be hard for you to enjoy those well known pieces with such artistic commitment.  Do not ever miss any one of those recordings with the unique seal of Vegh , the maestro.
