 Samson Francois playing represents the perfect balance between the sound and its significance; expression and temperament; poetry and emotion. Francois as the Giants musicians possesed that hard capacity for creating atmospheres. From the first bars he created a magic environement capable to seduce the most exigent listener. Those selections are just an additional proof that confirm what I have stted so many times before in past reviews; his grandness as pianist have not been acknowledged in the world, due perhaps other items that trascend the limits of this brief review, but try with him. Once you have listened you will be bewitched by his sound.  In memoriam (May 24 1924/ Oct. 18 1970)
