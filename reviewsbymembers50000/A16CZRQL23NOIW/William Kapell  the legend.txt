 Every year, when October arrives, my thoughts and memories seem to concentrate with major intensity around the figure and meaning of this keyboard colossus; untiring artist and connoted pianist: William Kapell was indeed, the maximum expression of the musical pianism ever born in North America. His playing was amazing, but beneath his flashing fingering and delirious phrasing remained the sense of attachment respect the composer 's  intention, that, adjoined with his unbeatable musicality and acute domain of  dynamic range display, generated  and still on a true orgiastic experience even in the most insignificant piano piece. William never sounded Apollonian but Dionysian, his performances were loaded of passionate commitment capable to engage even the most indifferent listener in the Hall.  This year we commemorate another additional year of his early departure and we still ask ourselves how different the musical world would have been if he would just only have lived three decades.   I can not avoid to singularize my deep sadness, but I guess the future audiences must be increasing. At least I have made my best in this sense, every time I accustom to invite a group of musical dilettantes to get close Kapell 's universe . This Saturday 29th I will meet again around the memory and treasured legacy that the Prince of the Keyboard left us for the posterity.  Finally I would like to share a happy circumstance experienced for a group of friends who had the huge privilege to meet him. 1947 and 1949 were the years Kapell visited Caracas; in his last appearance after concluding his Recital, Kapell was invited for dinner and approximately at 1:00 am William looked at the pianist who was playing a pop repertoire of that age. And without have been requesting, suddenly sat at the piano and played with the other pianist, an improvisation about "Tea for two" that according the present witness was simply amazing. Imagine what it meant that experience.  William Kapell pianism fifty two years after this unexpected flight without return, will be inflaming the soul, spirit and heart of millions people around the world. His legacy remains among us and it must be a personal imperative to communicate his grandness and transcendence to the new generations who in last instance will become future Ambassadors in which concerns to preserve his memory.                    Kapell was considered for the most exigent critics the most gifted pianist of his generation and the most complete pianist born in USA.
