 GG 's vivid performances in this decade revealed the presence of a sparkling and free joy of living (Gould was in his 26). He specially had a fascinating admiration for Mozart 's Piano Concerto in C minor (the tragic tonality for definition) and altough he plays the work a mite lighter than other references recordings of this score, he knows to extract the essential spirit of this piece.  In which the Sonata No. 31 concerns, there is something to comment about it. This is a work feature by the memory, it is fundamentally a nostalgic, contemplative and introspective work, where the famous fugue in the last movement sugets us the evasion out of this world. And Gould was a true master to remark this aspect.  Recommended for all those who still remind and admire this singular pianist.
