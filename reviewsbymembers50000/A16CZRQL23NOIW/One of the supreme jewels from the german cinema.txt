 Bitter metaphor abou Oskar a three years old who decides by himself not to grow anymore just when the Nazis take the power in Germany . He beats in his drum and cries in a fierce loud crashing the windows every time he's in an anger mood. Gunter Grass literally broke the walls about the dark shadows about Germany's literature . That thought was in the mind of too many people after finnishing the WW2. Therefore this novel reveals not only a deep conviction about the role of the artist in the world but it became a big slap in the face to many people . The artistic movement after the WW2 in Germany was born with the guilty's syndrom . Think in music , literature and cinema world . Karl Heinz Stockhausen, Heinrich Bll , Fassbinder , Alexander Kluge and Wolker Schlndorff among other important voices and artists had to carry that weight on his shoulders and his mind .  However the art reacted in a brave way and gave important statements about their spiritual wounds. This film deserved widely the Academy Award as best foreign film , being the first german movie that got it . Besides this work won the Palm'd or prize in Cannes Festival 1979 . Add to this long list of triumphs, the splendid acting of the twelve years old actor David Bennent and countless reflections all along the film . Simply mesmerizing!
