 This film is unique. De Palma was in a efervescence creative in this decade as fery few directors in the story. I think the next film in his career Carrie made the people forgot this one, who in many aspects  goes beyond Carrie due his artistic character and innovative resources. Once more De Palma accepted the challenging duel to adapt this classic version but set and described from another perspective. This film also allowed him to follow his bliss without the powerful presence of Hitchcok .  In other order of ideas , something similar happened with Chabrol , the french master , but the difference in the case of Chabrol is his major versality.  De Palma has reached the peak with this one. You feel Sisters and Phantom as his major achievements in this decade. Don't forget one film that in a way was a twisted wrench of this one : I'm talking about the rocky horror picture show. This was a decade in which the concern about others ways of expression were in the minds of many film makers. Think in Ken Ruseell with Tommy , Jewison with Jesuchrist , Robin Hardy with The wicker man , Dario Argento with the cat with nine tails , The clockwise orange , Badlands , The harder they come , Pink flamingos, Walkabout , Don't look now or the honey moon killers. You felt besides the desperate spirit of the german cinema Fassbinder , Wenders (Paris Texas) , Herzog , Hauff  and the french cinema under the kingdom of Truffaut , Chabrol , Molinaro Pierre Granier Deferre and Claude Sautet . This decade experienced an authentical creative and innovative tour de force in what concerns with new themes and proposals. That's why this film wins, because it kept his level and status and still remains. Watch this one and it will become one of your favorites!
