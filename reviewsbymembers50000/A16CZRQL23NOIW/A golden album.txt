 Debussy' s Prelude performed by Michael Tilson Thomas not only is superb performance of this well known Opus. I would rather to remark we are in front of the most luxuriant version ever made until now in all the musical story. Tilson Thomas sealed his name with Boston in four historical performances; the legendary and unexplainably out of print version of Stravinsky `s Rite of Spring; Carl Ruggles Sun trader, the majuscule version of Tchaikovsky `s First Symphony and this one.          Debussy ` La Mer in hands of Giulini is sumptuous, imaginative and profoundly engaging. Maybe if not for Toscanini magisterial interpretation with the NBC orchestra in the early Fifties, This would be securely, the most pyramidal performance of this magnum selection.
