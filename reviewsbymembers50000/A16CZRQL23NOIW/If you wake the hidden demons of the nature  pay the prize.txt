 What it really likes me more of this movie is the fact the horror comes from the undecipherable Mother nature at the moment you decide break the nature rules, in the name of science or whatever the reason be. A group of scientists run afoul a prehistoric man-fish inhabiting in depth waters in the remote backwaters of the Amazon.   The picture explores the recondite mysteries of the Nature that still live inside. The horror in this sense is a debt you have to pay when you open Pandora 's box. It is a supernatural force, unpredictable where the creature will establish the expected ancestral link that connects with King Kong for instance.   Once these members discover it, the fight for surviving will take its place and the hunters will be hunted. It is worthy to remark the fact there were three films that rode the same path The fly, Them and this one in what it respects to describe the horror from the inner Earth and not from the outer space: Can these manifestations be considered as aliens for our established social status? Or worse still are not we the aliens for them in the sense of invade its territories?   If not ask for Spielberg, who applied the same formula in Jurassic Park with spectacular stages but with the same paradigm; the employed device does not matter: it is the rupture of the laws of the nature; it 's Alberich stealing the Gold in Walhalla what, in last instance, determines the logic and expected reaction: it 's Wotan 's punishment when he transgressed the norm. All tragedy implies the violation of a limit; natural or human. In the first case we have a tragedy, in the second we have subversion.  In Halloween 's month it is more than an obligated reference to acquire this icon of the Horror genre.
