 Schumann 's Third Symphony is filled with Dionsyian elegance.Giulini gives an arresting reading of this one.  I don't know about another version above this one.  You'll be shocked by the living joy this work will raise in you , thanks to this master of the batoon.  The Eroica is conventional. You'll find better readings in the market, but Schumann is the winner.
