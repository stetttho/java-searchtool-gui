 This sensitive artwork, definitively is by itself a hitherto in this genre. I don't see of any other movie who can match with this in this plot. The intimate world of an actor backstage dealing with all the kaleidoscopic issues around his circumstance.  Albert Finney is one of my top favorite actors. He has a special and fine eye to chose underground but fascinating characters, and in this time this could not be the exception. If you are a hard fan of the theater world, this film is for you.
