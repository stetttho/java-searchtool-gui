 It's just to recognize the invisible ties between Mravinsky and Shostakovich . In fact , from the first notes not only that record but any othr one , you feel a dramatic background and teluric forces that lay underneath the score. In this special case , the Fifth is a powerful work , loaded with dark shadows about the horror and the political nightmare that surrounded the URSS at those times .  The second movement in which you listen a macabre evil waltz , is underlined by Mravinsky with the highest idionmatic accent . Mravinsky never uses this work to make fireworks or exhibition manners about the possibilities of this ensamble which , has been always the best of the USRR , but he emphasizes rhe inner demons the opression , the hopeless and the anguish scream that seems to come from all the different orchestal voices . The last movement is a tramp for the most of conductors. tHink in Bernstin's version with the New York from th last fifties , for instance . You can never to start with kinetic outrage from the same beginning , because if you do , you have nothing tio express in the dramatic climax . Mravinsky , literally builds progressively the dramatism , keeping in mind the sforzandos and avoiding all kind of effectism . This is the key , because in the right momnt you feel all the wildness and fury falling with all its force , creating the essential intention .  Acquire this version. And compare with others . Obviously you have several options : Termirkanov , Stokowski (fifties), Howard Mitchell or Rhodesvensky , but this is my favorite , by far.
