 Many people remained astonished after the film . Confused perhaps because they had tought this was a sequel but this is a wrong appreciation.  In fact Hannibal is free in this case and precisely this fact makes the things turn around .  The artistic gaze is a crude and brilliant exercise of superb good taste . Think in Florence the ancient memories of Hannibal in his prison 's pictures , and besides the nest of the Reinassance .  Think besides in Dante , Pazzi and consider his death as poetic justice .  You may argue the film is gore , but what do you expect from Hannibal?  The cast is splendid . Oldman made a glamorous tour de force as an invalid hunger of revenge .  The erotic presence of Julianne Moore makes Clarence Sterling a little bit altered respect to Jodie Foster .  The first entry is a pshycological thriller. This part is a hard multiple chase from Pazzi and the FBI and simulateously all of them seeking Hannibal , superbly played by Anthony Hopkins possibly the best actor in the world who just was working in Titus Andronicus .  The default perhaps resides in some minor aspects such as : How can Dr. Lecter to travel from Europe to USA being one of the ten most dangerous criminals and how could Clarence penetrate in the Oldman ' home with such easiness ?  If you let these questions to the random you may enjoy of a very clever and intelligent drama which will face you against our particular dragons .  Brilliant artistic direction , superb photography , memorable acting of Giancarlo Gianini (nominated in 1976 for his breathtaking performance in Seven beauties), Ray Liotta and a bit of Francesca Neri .  Not recommended for squeamish tastes or sensible viewers.
