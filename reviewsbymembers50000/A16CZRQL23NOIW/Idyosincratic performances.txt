 Boult's planets it never sound a showpiece-spectacular version but solemn. If you take the essence of this work you may consider it such a set of Symphonic Variations but with an ineffable premise: the English roots. Think in the lyric polychrome of every planet, there is joy of living, fierceness, tenderness and noblesse but never a bit of late romanticism but a robust sense of imperial dignity. Think in enigma Variations for instance, a work that surely must have influenced in the similitude of the formal construction.  If you lack that vision, forgetting perhaps this a huge solemn sidereal poem with slender tints of effervescent fierceness in Mars, exuberance tonal in Jupiter and restrained melancholy in Saturne.  And it is not a mere hazard that Adrian Boult be an Elgar champion. That' s why he brings such eloquence, elegance and nuance this masterpiece.   In what Enigma Variations is very interesting but there is a real master performance: Leonard Bernstein and BBC Symphony simply unbeatable.
