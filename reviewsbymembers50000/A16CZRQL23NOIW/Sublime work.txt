 The intolerance has not political color , identity card and it has not related with a specific nation.  Bad day... is a dark and bitter story in a small town about a murderer . The victim is a japanese citizen , killed by a leader who hated all men who came from the Eastern World . Far beyond the horrors lived in WW2 , the hate still remains in the heart the soul and the memories of this little community who decides "to clean" the town from this japanese disease. Spencer Tracy will be sent to investigate the sudden dissapearance of this japanese citizen. Knock out performance of Spencer Tracy and unforgettable punch from Robert Ryan. Lee Marvin plays a little role.
