 Consider this cast : one of my beloved middle sixties actress  Julie Chritie, the superb actor Alan Bates , the implacable direction of Joseph Losey one the most powerful Enfant terrible of USA and the screenplay of his assiduous collaborator  Harold Pinter (The accident) this is a real milestone in the British cinema of the early seventies. A little boy unwittingly becomes in the go-between for the daughter of a wealthy family and a neighboring humble farmer . This unequal encounter between these two lovers will lead unavoidably to the tragedy . The dark and bitter visual poetry of this film will be displacing in your memories and your mind years after you watch it due its profound personality and artistic stature.   Dominic Guard as the boy is electrifying .  A Cannes winner film and to me one of the three movie gems of Losey next to The servant -his masterpiece- (see my review) and Mr. Klein. I really expect its release in DVD format .
