 By all accounts Haydn, has had an admirable legion of interpreters but just a few of remarkable ones.    If I had to pronounce myself for the most competent and eloquent directors, four names would have to be mentioned: Hermann Scerchen and his milestone recordings with Vienna Symphony during the Fifties, loaded of opulence and Imperial dignity; the legendary recordings of Tomas Beecham, the successful approach of Bernstein- New York and finally these invaluable treasured jewels with Davis and the distinguished and resonant sound of Concertgebouw. Ddavis is competent director who has been particularly fortunate with other Orchestras, such Boston (His Sibelius cycle is a must-have for most of serious collectors) or Bavarian Orchestra. Davis not only plays a superb Haydn, but besides, having deciphered the Haydn code through a zealous and rigorous analysis of the score produces admirable filigrees with these Symphonies.   Go for this set, without dilation.
