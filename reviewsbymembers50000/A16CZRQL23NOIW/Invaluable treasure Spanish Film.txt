  The legitimate pride of  Huelva -Carlos Saura- reached a cosmic height with this unbeatable artwork in a theatrical stage around the last days of Goya in Bordeaux. The picture elapses in two well definite times and spaces: the young Goya and his love affair with La Duquesa de Alba, his beloved and unforgettable love Cayetana.  The cast is incredible. Francisco Rabal that monumental actor got perhaps his most admirable feature through his memorable career. Jose Coronado as the young Goya is impressive, and the sensual Maribel Verd ignites the screen every time she appears. An introspective portrait in which the memories are the invisible fellow partners, despite he is surrounded and supported by her family until his last breath. All the Prizes for this film were deservedly won. Consider this film as one of the best ten Spanish films ever filmed. A superb masterpiece.
