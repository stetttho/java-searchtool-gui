 Regardless of the era , some business sectors seem never to receive a fair shake in the movies . Their seems to be an internal process of restriction in which the movie is simply evasion and it does not exist the power of will to go beyond the message exploring just only the boundaries . The authors present us an interesting set of movies related with the Management . Undoubtedly you may argue the proposal is not enough and you are right but the important is the first step , because never before no one saw the enormous world of possibilities hidden a simple movie .. Hoosiers, Wizard of Oz , The Bridge on the River Kwai  and Moby Dick were in this case the selected ones . This initial release might be well the enormous gate to explore another items in different topics .  I would suggest from hawk gaze three different sets of them . First set : Bounty mutiny , Rashomon , King Lear (believe or not , there is a huge lot of issues) the authority never be delegated only the responsibility and Tunes of Glory Second set: Master and Commander , Twelve o clock high , Command decision and Das Boot . Third set : China Syndrome, L'argent des outres (The money of the others) , Blow up and Character . The idea is extraordinary and very original . In my personal case i `ve shown some particular issues who illustrate widely different approach  to teach the organization in different levels , specially the High , Media and Low Management . Excellent initiative which I expect keeps and acquires a major impulse and importance to the Managers because if it is certain the movies do not reflect the same life , this reasoning may be valid for films with low scope but never can be accepted to foot letter .
