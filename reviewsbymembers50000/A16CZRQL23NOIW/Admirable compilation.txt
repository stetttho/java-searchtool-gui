 There has not been any other case more emblematic of close affinity with the Brazilian music than Stan Getz.  His velvety tune, his unerring musicality, prodigious sense of expression and astonishing emotiveness make of him one of the shining stars I at the moment to make the account of the giants sax players in any time.   These selections are remarkable compilations with outstanding soloists, which constitutes by itself the best testimony of his notable grandness.  Getz must be remembered far beyond Desafinado and Girl from Ipanema. And maybe we would need a full documented biography which reflected his multiple skills.  Summertime is a very personal and authoritative version; the musical support of Gary Burton in the vibraphones is fantastic.     Absolutely recommended.!
