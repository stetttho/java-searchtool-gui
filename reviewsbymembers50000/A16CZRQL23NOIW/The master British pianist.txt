  Clifford Curzon means the finest British pianist in the last Century and shares this privileged throne with Myra Hess and Solomon.  Every one of them owned a particular repertoire but somehow, Curzon's scope in my opinion was even greater than both of them. To my mind Ccurzon is one the most brilliant interpreters for instance of Liszt' s  Sonata in B minor, Franck's piano quintet , Schubert Sonata D. 960 and Beethoven's Emperor with Knaperstbuch. Those arguments reveal the wide range of his playing and further musical concerns.  That doesn't mean to underestimate at all the virtues of Hess and Solomon.  Far from the rigid conventionalism of the British school,  Curzon's the fertile imagination, aristocratic refinement, magnificent technique,  and captivating approach allowed him to develop, an amazing cantabile line, overcame perhaps by Wilhelm Kempff, Edwin Fisher and Dinu Lipatti. His Mozart is so eloquent, convincing, fresh and idiomatic outer the standards in those days.   His collaborations with Kertesz confirm once more the illustrious musicality and rapture phrase. Bring near this notable and powerful pianist whose artistic powers still are unfairly neglected by the great audiences actually.   Between you and me, all this new generation of talented pianists of the Post war such John Lill or John Ogdon, among others were bewitched by his undeniable magnetism.
