 This issue is hard to find but try to find it . The Helio 's overture is played with sucp power , majesty and conviction that it is unbeatable and results almost impossible to get a substitute . The Royal Dannsih plays too the first and fifth symphony. The first conducted for Jenssen is very idiomatic and convincing .  Erik Tuken conducts the Fifth and the rapport is unique . Obviouly , there are worthable performances in the market such as the cult recording of Jasha Horenstein , the Bernstein recording and more recently Pekka Salonen but the epic spirit (this invisible musician behind the score) involves all these works with that fervent and dyonisiac mood of the Dannis Orchestra playing the most remarkable musician of Dennmark . Fundamental issue if you are a hard fan of Carl Nielsen .
