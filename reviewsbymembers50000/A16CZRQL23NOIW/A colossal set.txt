 Keeping in mind these performances may be placed in a triumphant third place after The Budapest Quartet (in their forties) and Vegh (both performances from the fifties and early seventies) that is by itself an extraordinary ackonwledgement for that ensamble. The articulated voices and the rhythmic pulsations is first order, the Beethovenian harsh dissonances are expressed with absolute conviction and artistic commitment. Highly recommended.
