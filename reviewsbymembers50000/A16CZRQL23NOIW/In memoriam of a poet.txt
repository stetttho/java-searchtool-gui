 Bill Evans constituted the great exponent of the lyrical jazz, expressed in the intimacy of small Halls (as the Blue Note). His inspirational mood and captivating expression created an atmosphere of ineludible seduction.   He was a true poet and remark this epithet in the sense of creator of new possibilities and lyrical hues. His early loss left many unfinished projects as to record a whole session with Oscar Peterson (imagine that dream come true);but at least he left the best of his craft for the posterity.  Waltz for Debby was  arguably, his best referential card, a sublime work loaded of exquisite lyricism and sumptuous refinement.  An album to treasure.
