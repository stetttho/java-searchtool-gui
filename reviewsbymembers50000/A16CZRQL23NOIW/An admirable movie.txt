 Pitifully certain mental maps tend to assign into steel patterns to certain directors . The innovativeness and unmeasured ambition are definitively seen with disdain. The case of Coppola in this sense (as Spielberg with The color Purple for instance) is emblematic. Coppola lived his own golden decade in the seventies with two sagas of the Godfather, Apocalypse now and The conversation. And then this superb filmmaker decides to undertake a personal vision absolutely inscribed inside the "author Cinema" .  Rumble fish is the name of an aggressive fish from Indic ocean that, in captivity just can live isolated from its similar ones and does not even tolerate its own reflected image in a mirror. So taking into account, Coppola elaborates an essential metaphor with the accurate transposition of paradigms. All the archetypes are ambivalent and so the human nature too.  Since that premise, Coppola will impress his own stylistic treatment. The reflected image in the mirror can be noticed through the claustrophobic universe of Rusty James (Matt Dillon); in this micro cosmos where the gangs, territorial strumpet , crime and punishment, fugue from the reality, Eros and Thanatos will become the main factors that will support this drama            Of course we are talking a film deeply enriched by autobiographical memories. And again, the sequence of the stopped watches suggest us the frozen time; those youth dreams, the obsessive of narcissist leaderships, the tragedy of disconcert  have remained isolated and covered by the time `s patina.   That' s why this film must be watched with extreme attention and analyzed with expert nippers, because otherwise the fixed idea around what we wish to get from Coppola has nothing to do with his own intentions; so this frustration may induce us as the Rumble Fish to see a distorted image of our own hopes.
