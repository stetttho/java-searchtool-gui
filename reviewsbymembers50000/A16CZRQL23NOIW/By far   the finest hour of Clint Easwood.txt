 Eastwood made a real gem with this delicate , haunting and powerful portrait around this living legend : this pioneer of elusive sound sax : Charlie Parker . Forrest Whitaker played a superb role (the best of his career to date) with this acting . The photography ; the shot angles , the painful script which never falls in the melodrama soap . Eastwood reveals with a supreme maestry his masterful technique as atmosphere creator . Since he was obviously  a hard fan of Parker , he left for the eternity this deep insight to the emotional mood of Charlie who died so young (34) and whose early loss still shocks the world jazz . Can you imagine the glorious solo between Bird and Miles Davis for instance with Bill Evans at the piano? . Too beauty to be true , indeed . Thanks Mr . Eastwood for your double rendition ; to Jazz world and the Cinema . It is useless to recommend the soundtrack of that film .  Do you know another Laura version which can match with this one ?
