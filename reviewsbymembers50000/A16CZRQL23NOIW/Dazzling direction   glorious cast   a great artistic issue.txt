 Amazing and kinetic script since the first shots . The special rapport and the essential sexual chemistry between Warren Beaty and Faye Dunaway was instantaneous . Since the erotic sequence she goes down in the upstairs to make her first appearance is one of the sexiest scenes ever filmed .  The plot deals around these two outlaw lovers ; he has nothing to lose and she is opened to new experiences and therefore without any kind of restrictions , made a punch in this decade .  Artur Penn knew ensamble a essential film noir and even enriched it with smart and funny situations .   Furthermore the ending sequence is anthological and since its first release became a cult issue .  This film overthrew Faye to screen and supposed a great triumph to Artur Penn one of the icon directors in the American cinema .
