 Andrei Gavrilov was a protegee of Svaitoslav Richter . This colossal pianist has given to the immoratlity one of the most sincere readings of this so difficult to play Piano Concerto No. 3 of Beethoven .  Gavrilov shows a wide repertoire of surprises , he is a well gifted pianist and even the tenmpo of the first movement is too fast to my mind , the Second Movement is played with a high level of noblesse and conviction . I had this version as the best in the market until I found the key Moravec - Neumann Czech Philarmonic dated of 1989 two months ago ; the best performance I have heard in all my life . So try to find this version before it dissaperas of the volatile market , excellent sound and try to forget the nasal sound of the russian orchestras (except The Leningrad  and abominable percusionist due its poor sound and above all demanded expressiveness by the composer just before the cadenza of the First Movement.  The Brahms Second Symphony is OK , but my choice still favours Walter NYP 1954 simply unbeatable .
