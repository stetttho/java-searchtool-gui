 Antal Dorati figure has been frequently associated with Hungarian and Russian composers, but he possessed a superb good tatse at the time to conduct notable pieces of the ballet repertoire. This Giselle may be well considered as a notable example about what I am talking about.   Lyricism, grace, and absolute sense of serene charm make of this recording an absolute must for all those who love this ballet.   Totally recommended.
