 This mature and off-beat movie anticipated for years the awful and painful consequences about the reinsertion of a man in the civil life after having been in the War. This neo realist picture would be marked for the Moral League, believe or not winning a dark notoriety, with a young actor named Marlon Brando making his debut with this Opus.  Zinnemann was preparing another hidden Ace, even more penetrating and acid work: "From here to the eternity."   Previously this raising promise of the direction had filmed "The Seventh cross", an epic War picture, and the best would yet to come.  Interesting and potent existential drama, that illustrates as a few the unsaid.
