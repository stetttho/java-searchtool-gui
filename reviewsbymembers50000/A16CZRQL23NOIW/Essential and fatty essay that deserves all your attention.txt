 The figure and transcendence of Faust in the Western Civilization has only been surmounted perhaps by Grail 's Legend. Under this interesting perspective the author establishes important evidences. The search of the eternal youth combined with wisdom of the golden years was always a dream. The personal drama of Faust must be judged and perceived as the final result of a host of important feats in a set of disciplines, that challenged and proclaimed the premise about the man as the sublime measure of all things. As smartly the author establishes: "We can proceed to find out what the poem means, without first having to worry about what it means to us." Following this reasoning line, it you scrutinize the full significance only under the reason lights - in search of an untold relief - and just state it is a febrile product of a fevered imagination, you definitively would isolate conscious or unconsciously from the powerful mythic that would seem to underlay beneath it.    The search of the immortality in a controlled world featured for pacts and agreements could lessen the value and work out as a mental trammel to realize in its wholeness the essential core of this superb work. We should keep in mind Goethe wrote the most apology to Prometheus ever written. So, if you link the fact the tragedy in its whole transcendence was seriously diminished and almost reduced to ashes for two very different currents: the religion and the reason. The first of these pacifies the terrible consequences derived from the breakthrough of the rules and its deep cosmic impact  and submits the cosmic designs to a divine will, annuls totally the cathartic experience and pares the redemption significance. The second one, the reason, always find out a hidden reason or would reduce the fatalism to a statistical circumstance. If Oedipus was victim of a fatal celestial nasty trick, Faust was victim of the memory or to look behind, searching the ashes of the past to live in this warmth matrix.       Goethe was a true free man, knows about these limitations, but never gives up and creates this towering work.             Jantz makes a conscientious analysis to put us in context about the manifold implications and influences of this personage in a convulsed historic moment.                   Go for this substantial, ambitious and absorbing essay that undeniably will contribute to expand and understand still more the enormous significance of this literary legacy.
