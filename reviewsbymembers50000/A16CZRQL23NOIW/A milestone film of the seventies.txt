 If you take a look around in this prolific decade you will realize the name of Artur Penn was a real turning point in the American Filmography. Penn walked to the sun with this legendary picture. He literally was a risky director. Indeed it's difficult if not impossible determine the winner step of his artistic approach. From the miracle worker, The chase and Bonnie and Clyde to this giant film that somehow means the hithherto of an existential Western.  It has been said the Western symbolizes the particular mythology of North America. And Penn employed all his efforts,supported by a witty script, to reveal the growing up process of a simple man from the innocence to the experience: the painful but necessary step to reach the beloved pearl. Hoffman was simply superb in this film. I still remember in the interview made by James Lipton (Inside the Actor's studio) that Penn said to Hoffman how to face the decisive sequence in which he is sent to a secure death: he proposed to assume in a deep and challenging proccess of ancient memories how he would feel in case to find in the Concentration Camp just before to be exterminated. So Hoffman kept this valuable advise in mind and produced that overwhelming facial expression hard to forget in all the Cinema Story. This work is included among my 200 top cult movies in any age.
