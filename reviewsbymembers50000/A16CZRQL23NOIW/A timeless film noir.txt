 The european narrative of John Huston previews somehow the famous Rififi which two years before that film would be made . In this case Huston focuses his attention around four men without destiny ; each one with his personal dragons , fears and troubles .  Emmerich , the handsome and master brain of the great robe is a double life husband ; good manners, refinement but he is broken and needs this robe to pay his debts and keep his missed status . Her lover is Marilyn Monroe . In the other hand we have to Sterling Hyde a man without any illusion in th life but to gamble in the horse races.  The third of this quartet is the meticulous pioneer of the idea . He will make all the theoric plan and will hire the required personal. And finally we have the nasty and weak double face thief : he is accustomend to pay some members of the police and he regents a house of games . This quartet will experience a real twist of fate and the human factor will lead them to hell . The notable and descriptive description of every single character will be closing the circle till the end . You may argue a certain romantic touch If the end would have been opened maybe the sum would have been a full circle , but anyway the depiction of the fall of all these four man and his respective social circles sustains the interest of the viewer to the end . Good film but not a masterpiece !
