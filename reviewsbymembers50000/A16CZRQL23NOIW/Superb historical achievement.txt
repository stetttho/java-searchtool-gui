 Emil Gilels temperament has always been at least to my mind extremely cold and even analytical. His powerful phrasing is first rate, who can deny it? .   However, he recorded for the posterity two emblematic works; this album and Brahms Piano Quartet Op. 25 with Amadeus Quartet(see my review).  Gilels was at top form that historical evening with these Grieg pieces. This miniaurist composer deads from the player a sensitive imagination as well as a warm approach to win. Gilels made it and so he achieved one of his three best recordings in his life.   So please do not miss this album.
