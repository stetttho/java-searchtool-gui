 The admirable artistic personality of Akira Kurosawa had never allowed for himself a minimum expression of self pity or self indulgence, even the end was close. Moreover, his undeniable talent allowed him to write two script, he never reached to conclude due the death avoided it.   Curiously, Madadayo is a simple chamber work; an intimate portrait who rejoins with the little details of a sturdy and devoted life. Their pupils love and admire him perhaps even more than their respective fathers. They enjoy his enviable humor sense, his single wisdom, his smart fearlessness, his magnetic charisma and engaging personality. Every birthday they are present to express him the solemn gratitude and fondness.  In spite of the fact Kurosawa was in his 75th anniversary, his untiring handle of camera will be subject of constant analysis for newcomers, viewers of the future when all of us are absent. The love for life and sensitivity expands itself around the loss of his beloved cat. What else can I say about this extraordinary jeweled film?  Go for it and please, treasure it for the moment you and I are lucky to arrive to those golden years. But meanwhile take your time and forget about all the previous comments. This will be a never before experience for your senses, soul and spirit.
