 Despite the fact this is a remarkable adaptation of the famous saga The seven Samurais. You must watch it without major pretensions. It's a fabulous entertainment that allowed to Steve Mac Queen, Charles Bronson, James Colburn and Robert Vaughn be widely know all around the world.  A kinetic cinematography that inflamed the screen with a great doses of black humor and graphic violence.  Martin Ritt is not Peckinpah, pitifully. But the film keeps high caliber tension and it is a good entertainment.
