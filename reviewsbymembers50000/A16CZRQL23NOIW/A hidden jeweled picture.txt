 When the name of Jonathan Demme had not reached the stardom that years after would confer for him The Silence of the lambs, this movie surprised me kindly. Underneath this is a corrosive spoof of our society. A film that gives you much more you are usually to receive, so I recommend you to check it out again, because unfairly, it was overneglected in those ages due perhaps, of major fireworks films that you know but I won `t mention them, by reasons attained with the wise discretion.  I watched it again two weeks ago and definitively improves with the ages. Mary Steenbrugen deserved this Prize. And what else can it be said about the geniality and talent in excess of Jason Robards featuring Howard Hughes?  From any angle you want to examine this picture has not any fissure. Go for it.
