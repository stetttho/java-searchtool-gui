 The English Suite No. 5 has always my favorite one in this set . And the version of Horskowski is deeply played . He goes to the roots , the essential nucleus of the work and offers us one of the most wisdom readings that I have ever heard before . The nuance and brightness of his playing is simply unique . He got so close to the cosmic levels of Rosalyn Tureck , or Tatiana Nikolayeva and Wanda Landowska who as you well know are the supreme Goddess in which state of art of Bach playing concerns . In the other hand his Chopin is extraordinary dramatic , not romantic . He knows the real mood and never will allow a tearful note . His aristocratic playing makes the difference that makes the great difference. His Beethoven performing is tastefully made . Horszkowski as Schnabel is not interested at all in the fireworks , just in the insights of the work . Listen to M.H. you will get close to one of the last genius of the keyboard . Pitifully there are actually so very few pianist who still keep that freshness , wide scope and rapture as these keyboard giants of the past . The majority seemed to get funn with the music , and this triviality weakens their recordings , loaded with engrossing technique but absolutely lacking of commitment for the spirit of the work behind the score. What a pity for the rest of piano artisans, who are the great majority .
