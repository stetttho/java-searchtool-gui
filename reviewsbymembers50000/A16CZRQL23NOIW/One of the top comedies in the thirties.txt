 This famous film plays hard thanks to the wonderful handle camera the powerful direction of Capra , the fine cast and a jiggy script . Since a dizzy society girl flees from her father and for these weird casualities he finds a reporter in a cross country bus . Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable are simply engaged and the script will reveal very funny and smart situations . Stunning classic made with broad gusto .
