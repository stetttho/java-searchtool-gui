  The tragedy focuses precisely this point. The raising and vertiginous career of an artist and its later decay in every little detail. The abandon and the moral wreck in what this lovely star sometime meant for the audience, her addiction to alcohol and drugs are explored with masterful approach by Rainer Fassbinder . this real icon of the Post War West Germany generation. With the visible influence of Douglas Sirk, you can link certain parallelism with Sunset Boulevard, despite this picture goes far beyond in what a human being can become. The last masterpiece , not the last film (Querelle) of one my favorite directors in any age, deserved for him his definitive signature in the Holly Pantheon of the top directors in Berlin, 1982. A must see!
