 This a film that must be watched at multiple layers. You can figure out a multidimensional prism, where every face deals with a particular character and diverse approach about the existence's hard reality The impressive edition work and the increasing rhythmic tension can be imagined as frame that progressively shrinks and eventually struggles to every member of those four families whose lives are interweaved.  The dramatic reality evasion experienced by the isolated young boy with his Barbie doll goes beyond a simple metaphor; the miscommunication between father and sons are explicitly shown: the TV as Marshall Mc Luhan stated once, works out as the XX Century babysitter; in the other hand we have a mother breathes loneliness in its purest state. She is in good shape and is powerfully attracted by men much younger than her. Close plays perhaps, the sharpest and painful role, dealing with her son in vegetative state, and her daughter who has true nightmares with a terrible secret you that will be revealed at the end.  The complex narrative structure is not any obstacle for the viewer, due the life is precisely on this way; an unpredictable, voluntary and randomness events chain. In the other hand we have a surreptitious statement about the futility of material goods as one of the story's multiple dramatic basis; the amazing fact to maintain your hands on a car during three consecutive days just to guarantee a huge audience is a hard critic to some reality shows, and so the traveling around the market journey to carve in relief some unusual behavior patterns consumer.   The cast was simply extraordinary.              A winner, though may be a not easy going watch film for some viewers.
