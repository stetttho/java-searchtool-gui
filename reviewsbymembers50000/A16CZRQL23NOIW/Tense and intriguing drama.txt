 If Z was the champion movie dealing with the Authoritarian regimes, there were another two: Battle of Algiers and this one.  Powerful political drama focused on the repressive regime of Doc Duvalier. The script is intense and realistic; the cast is glorious; Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Peter Ustinov and Alec Guiness. A team very difficult to get in those times.
