  This work belongs to that elite of perfect artworks. You will never find just a little fissure in its construction. Not only it contains one of the most memorable ballet sequences in any age, but also is a mature film in what its purposes concern. Would you sacrifice the love of your life or would follow your bliss through the art?  The ever lasting question has been formulated internally for so many artists. The special case of Frau Teresa Carreo, the renowned Venezuelan pianist faced the similar challenge. And it would be the right time for reminding you this is precisely the central conflict in Ingmar Bergman's Autumn Sonata for instance.  This lovely artist will face the painful choice. And please ignore all the relative comments around the movie about the overdramatic tone. A decision of this level will involve your whole life, so you make your choice. The art for not dying of the truth or the obvious loneliness leaving behind you all the affective universe of your beloved couple.  Monumental masterpiece of Michael Powell one of the most prominent British directors in any age. He shares honours with David Lean, Carol Reed, Laurence Olivier, Anthony Asquith which talks by itself about the level I mean.
