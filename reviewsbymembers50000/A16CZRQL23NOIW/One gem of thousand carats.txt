 A chapter dedicated to the romanticism from that remarkable Keneth Clark's Civilization shows us the Pastoral Symphony with a sea torment as background and suddenly you listen the first of Brahms with a painting representing a torment. Thats the difference. The Pastoral Symphony , written in Fa major reveals as any other work in any age the most complete and sincere ode to the nature. But warning Im not talking about Thanks giving song ; but a mythical rendition to the nature. Frtwangler reached the peak with this performance. He got the "pathos", the real esence , he caught the soul of the work and translated with eloquent way , if you conduct this work seeking the romantic mood , you made the wrong choice .  May be you disagree but this performance shows the paganism  rapture and the wild side of the nature with its beauty and its cruelty. Please dont forget the nature doesnt know anything related with feelings or justice. Once more we must to remember we created all this word world and we have repeated ourselves so many times that we believe in its real existence. Wrong choice. The Vienna Philarmonic , his glorious winds and string sections , give a knock out achievement. You may listen another performances well made ,  but feed with the religious approach or just lyrical or merely contemplative mood. May be you accept this approach but I think  Beethoven looked the cosmos instead the nature. Acquire this ; never it will dissapoint you!.
