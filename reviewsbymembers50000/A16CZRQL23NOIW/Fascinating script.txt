 Clive Donner directed this singular project with three singual and talented actors. Donald Shuterland is an old derelict who is invited to spend the night in a rundown London house with two neurotic brothers.  A promising chamber work which explores the dark corners of the human soul. Think about; we are talking about Harold Pinter this true scalpel of the human psyche. As curious fact this work was financed by Noel Coward, Richard Burton. Elizabeth taylor, Peter Sellers and Leslie Caron.
