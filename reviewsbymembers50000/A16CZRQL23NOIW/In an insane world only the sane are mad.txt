 This lyric jag was a crude and sinister metaphor about Vietnam Hell and all the unimaginable consequences  The book was published in 1962 and reveals the distorted state of things .in those years . A convict -I mean an outsider- is committed to a mental institution for examination. And from that dark place he will find his bliss when he becomes a leader and stimulates his companions to develop an awakening spirit of self worth and  rebelliousness  against the rules which configure the Status Quo in the hospital . The image can not be more descriptive . Curiously? an European film maker specifically Czech who really understood what the slender and the cruelness invasion meant for the free and untamed  western spirit derived from his emotional memories in 1968 : Milos Foreman who played hard and without making too much concessions practiced and incisive surgeon to the social body conceived such as micro cosmos in itself through the pretext of using a mental institution. This attitude will represent for him the beginning of his end when Louise Fletcher the implacable nurse guess his game . She will detect he is normal but ... she has the power to avoid he abandons this sinister jail . And now the struggling tension will raise and turn in a real catastrophe for every insane member.  Finally he will suffer a lobotomy and the circle of terror will close . Masterly performances of Nicholson and  Fletcher who won the respective Academy Awards as best actor and actress respectively . Foreman won the prize as best Director and so the film did it . Since It happened one night you there was no other previous film who made this glorious feat. Watch this superb masterpiece of the American Cinema but do not ever forget Shock Corridor - see my review  - and consider the impressive points in common . Twelve years ago was the interval between Shock and One flew .
