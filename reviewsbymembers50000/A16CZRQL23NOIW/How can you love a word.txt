 This sentence is told by Bess when she gets into the church just in the right moment when a preacher man talks about love and almost materializes this concept . She continues stating that we can love a human being , a pet , but never the concept by itself . As you can see this little speech can give you an idea about the relevant meaning of this powerful film of Lars von Triers who shows once more his enormous talent, following the glorious heritage of Carl Dreyer , the most important dannish film maker ever . In this case , the film deals with a complex drama as the background . Inmersed in the real essence of the most ravishing puritanism and sense of religious behavior , Bess and Jan get marry .  Buth the fate in the middle of the Baltic Sea will turn around the real state of things . Jan implores and begs her she finds a lover since he is uncapable due his accident in maintain this physical flame . The half of the sin is the scandal and you will suppose the ethical barriers and prejuices this fact will produce in the soul of this virtuosi community .  I want to talk about the cinema verite style employed by von Triers . This method should never be a formal obstacle to you if you are really commited with the film . I accept this narrative resource because it adds dramatic tension to the story .  Emily Watson  - one of the thirty best actress in the world actually - makes a tour de force acting . She won in 1996 the European Film Academy and the film won too the Award as Best Picture . Besides she was nominated as best actress in Cannes for this role and won the New Generation Award for the L.A. Films Critics Association . After all these evidences do you need another proof to acquire this jewel film ?
