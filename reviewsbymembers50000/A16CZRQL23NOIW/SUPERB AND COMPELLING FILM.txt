 A mad scientist has lost the power of dream and kidnaps children in order to steal their dreams.  Once more the innovative minds of Marc Caro and Pierre Jeunet could make it possible this weird but poignant story .  You may consider this movie extremely fantastic , only if you watch it with rational eyes abandoning the dark poetry involved in it . A triumph of the fertile imagination of these two creative authors . If Hans Christian Andersen lived in this age, perhaps could not make it better. Bravo for this team who, six years later would produce that one thousand million carats jewel : Amelie. Inmensely entertaining and visually stunning!
