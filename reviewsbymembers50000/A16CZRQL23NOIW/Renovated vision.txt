 The musical world suffered an irreparable loss with the early death of this brilliant director. The overall story of the Berlin Philharmonic would have been very different if he had not died so soon. The genial baton as well as his superb talent of Ferenc Fricsay will fortunately remain for future generations of new listeners and music dilettantes, through his enriching legacy.  This CD is an another additional evidence of this testimonial. Fricsay always elevated the rank of any piece he conducted. The Fifth Symphony so confirms it. He always searched beneath the score and always found a new perspective, a valid approach.  Ferenc Fricsay' s true dimension enhances exponentially day after day. So I don' t think to sound exaggerate to affirm that you should acquire all what you can from this gifted Hungarian director(1914-1963).
