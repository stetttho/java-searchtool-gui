 Asertive statement pronounced by Guillaume (Jean Marais, the unforgettable Jean Cocteau Orpheus) just in the minute 75 of the film. Since a nineteen years old, the lovely and ultra beautiful Liv Tyler decides to visit Tuscana, she will experiment the gradual transformation from her ancient crysallis to become in a real mature woman through those impresive months. She will exchange important encounters with a true caleidoscope of human beings. The art remains and even matchs with the sumptuous landscapes as the huge frame in which the seduction, the pleasure of the good food, the art, the ancient memories in search her dark mother past and her early childhood will lead her to a real grow up process. All the cast is exceptional, but the specia touching acting of Jeremy Irons one of the major actors all over the world plus the admirable directorial work of Bertolucci and his overwhelming employement use of the lenses will astonish you from the start shot of the picture. So considering the sum of all those merits I would say it is imposibble to pretend ignore and least to avoid to fall in love with this supreme artwork.  To my mind one of the best twelve films of 1996.
