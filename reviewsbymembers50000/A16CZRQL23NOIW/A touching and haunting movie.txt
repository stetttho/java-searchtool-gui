 From time to time we feel with evident relief, that fortunately not all film makers bet for break necks, breathtaking car chases, burning streets, flying corpses or extreme violence as a tenet to get audience and a brief fame. This script falls apart these common places to tell a story; a poignant portrait of a weak man who is connected to the outside world through this device.  A penetrating and captivating story that it will you make think about the life' s values. Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. make  top-notch performances.
