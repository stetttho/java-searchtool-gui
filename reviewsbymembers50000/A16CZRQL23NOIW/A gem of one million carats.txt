 Amelie is a song to the life. In many aspects this film reperesents what Jupiter (Symphonie 41) of Wolfang Amadeus Mozart means in the music; the supreme freedom. Not only its a oda to the savoir vivre , (its a free film) but instead it has a deep sense of no matter what; keep going and go ahead, that sooner or later you win.  Its literally impossible not fall in love with Audrey Tatou. Her beauty, charm, shyness,charisma and sympathy let you amazing.  One overwhelming script; written with a fertile imagination , it contains a lot of delightful situations and enjoyable moments. Ive seen at least ten times from 2001, and it shines by itself like a diamond; it has too,  a lot of countless virtues, the prodigious camera makes lovely travellings, fluid dolly, and the photograph is unique. Besides you have other depicted characters that support the story and never let you down. A film made and surrounded by a supreme good taste; more you can expect and much more. Havent you watched it? and what are you waiting for? A must for you.  This film didnt win the Oscar. But this eternal mistake will never make this movie grows and grows with the time the supreme judge, and becomes from 2001 a true modern classic.
