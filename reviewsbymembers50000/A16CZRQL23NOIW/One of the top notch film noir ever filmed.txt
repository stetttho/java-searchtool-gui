 If I had to give my personal list of the ten greatest film noir ever, this one would be one of them. Delon reached one of his peaks as actor with this one. His sense of the betrayal symbol and above all the decadence moral symbol is what precisely makes an universe of difference with Matt Damon in Langhella remake. Damon is just only perverse, not decadent. Maurice Ronet was always a prominent actor. Though his major achievement as actor was Feu follet from Louis Malle in 1963, it deserves a perfect balance with Delon. Rene Clement was one of the most gifted french film maker from the post war generation. His major works were Forbidden games (1953)and this one. The growing tension in this film invades you psycologically, slowly the film compells you and carries us to an unexpected ending, in that unforgettable sequence in front the sea. Dont miss one of the golden gems in any age of the film noir. And remember Patricia Highsmith (Strangers on a train and the american friend) was the writer of this monumental work.
