 This Machiavellian reflection seems to fit exactly in this funny black humour picture around two women obsessed with a same man and her countless traps to catch him. The film is visibly inspired by The Witches of Eastwick but with an intelligent twist, transcribing an universal desire surrounded for the most infamous devices that will include plastic surgery, the last innovation in the expected dream to reach the eternal youth.  Original entertainment and admirable tragic comedy.
