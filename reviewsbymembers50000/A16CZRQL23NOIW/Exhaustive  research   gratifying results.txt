 This an extraordinary and best documented compilation of five generations of pianists. From Hans von Bullow to Ivo Pogorelich . Since the book is from 1990   Schoenberg makes an exhaustive , passionate and reflexive analysis of the greatest virtuous of the keyboard . Schonberg differs from the ornaments of the technical language and goes to the heart of the music . Even if there are points of disagreement respect to several considerations , this work is recommended for its informative richness. The only little default - to my mind - might be well in the little data about some renowned European and even American pianists who had less prominence in America but equally deserve a special place in this singular book. Some examples are : Yves Nat , Samson Francois , Ivan Moravec , John Lill , Leonard Hokanson , Clifford Curzon , Myra Hess , Vlado Perlemuter , Paul Badura Skoda , Annie Fisher, Selma Kramer, Walter Gieseking, Joaquin Azzucaro , Andrei Gavrilov , Maria Yudina , Tatiana Nikolayeva , Bianca Musulin,  Edith Farnadi , Horacio Gutirrez, Ely Ney , Jean Marie Darre, Gabriel Tachino , Solomon , Dino Ciani , Jorg Demus, Friedrich Gulda, Michael Ponti , Mikjail Rudy and Vladimir Sofronitzky among the most representatives .
