 This film recalls the British defeat in nothern Africa by Arab tribemen circa in 1833 .  And the fine actings of Olivier as Mahdi and Heston as Gordon are not enough to hold the slow paced script .  There are terrific edition problems . Notice for instance the previous moment to the attack at dawn and notice the landscape , in Gordon side we have night but in the other side we have a radiant sunshine . Basil Dearden was a talented filmmaker but not in these waters . Since Lawrence de Arabia became a hitherto in what desert movies concern , you should wait a real twist of road to avoid be compared with that David lean's giant film. Dearden gives a theatrical approach to this film and the dialogues are very slow paced ; there are unforgettable moments as the the speech between Mahdi and Gordon in the first quarter of the film and it seems the film will fly , you feel an uncomfortable sensation of incoherence through the script . Gordon is in a real trouble with the reduced scope of the Minister but the film lacks expression and force .  You are capable to experience the absence of the organic flow in the drama ; the battle scenes are too short and so far to be credible . The climax ending is extremely cold and predictable.  The film will be reminded in the future as a clear management default , but definitively it is not a great film, due its inner weakness.
