 Lili Marleen was far beyond an emblematic song; it was an autumnal ballad which perhaps, inspired and nourished countless hopes and even could have been the last song in the life of thousand and thousand people in the WW2.  The untiring zeal in what Fassbinder was sunk around the affective and emotional labyrinths in this drama around two lovers joined and eventually separated for ideological and ethnic reasons, the prize of the fame, the fact that any glory is far to be free, the abrasive psychological torture in which Roberto will be subjected, the admirable edition work, the dramatis personae so well narrated and the opulent acting of Schygullla and Gianini make of this film one of my eternal works of the whole cinematography of Fassbinder.
