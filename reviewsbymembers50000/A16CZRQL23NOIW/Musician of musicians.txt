 Thirty seven years after his death from a heart attack. Wes Montgomery still sounds so fresh, innovative and warmth. His arrangements allowed him to express his feelings with such originality and expression. Certainly you may establish analogies: Wes is in his jazz idiom, what Segovia meant to classical form and Hendrix t electric guitar. His velvet tunes and pleasant melodies loaded of joy, sadness but above all perpetual commitment. It is notorious his influence on "musicians in process" or "musicians to come". Georges Benson, Pat Metheny, Peter White or  Russell Malone still possess a huge debt with that legendary artist who left us in his forty five, when the world waited for more and more of this charismatic and talented guitarist.
