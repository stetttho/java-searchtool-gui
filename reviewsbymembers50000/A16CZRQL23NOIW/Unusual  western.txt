 You may argue True Gift , The Alamo or the Searchers were films where the charisma of John Wayne was never better shown , but to my mind this is the most complete performance given in the screen for that western veteran of one thousand battles . Playing the role of Nathan Brittles and supported by a extraordinary script and wonderful camera of John Ford he goes beyond the hard guy and shows us his human side giving us a management and leadership lesson about what is going on with the role of a leader days before his jubilee . One of the most unforgettable westerns in any age , and the third western buy of my personal collection.
