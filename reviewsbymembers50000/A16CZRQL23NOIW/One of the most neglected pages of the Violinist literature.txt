 From the moment Beethoven wrote his admirable, and monumental Op. 61 in D minor, the audiences around the world seem to have closed the curtains. I must admit this Violin Concerto is the Violin Concerto per excellence, but that would not be impediment to become inflexible respect other notable works and let 's insist, minor projects that nevertheless possess texture and melodic richness.   To my mind, the intransigence veil has accented specially around three notable works: Dvorak, Schumann and Hubay. I would even affirm that the D minor 's syndrome   empowered of the musical taste 's great audiences: Tchaikovsky, Brahms and Mendelssohn and Sibelius. And there has been a major receptivity in what concerns to listen new  Concertos for other instruments. (How many people do really know Korngold, Enescu, Prokoviev, Shostakovich, Busoni, Bartok and Berg `s Violin Concertos? Just to name some few)       Dvorak 's Violin Concert seems to have been sheltered by the eminent Isaac Stern since the early Fifties.  Somehow this notable soloist found the key to get inside to the core of this nostalgic breath that permeates almost the score. If you add it besides, the presence of the most remarkable strings section, ever existed in previous or later American ensembles and the notable contribution of Eugene Ormandy, you will have all the available terms of this decision matrix. If you want, just listen any other random version and compare by yourself.     You may find perhaps, sumptuous performances and expansive performances like Johana Martzy-Fricsay in 1953 (my second choice), and a live recording hard to find recording with Zino Francescati in the early Fifties but both of them never overcome this supreme status.   The Mendelssohn to my mind is the most incandescent and noblesse performance ever recorded.  Recommended without hindrances of any genre.
