  I don't have any shadow of doubt that Prometeheus and Achilles were the real patterns in Beethoven's attitude for facing life. There have been countless proofs and additional testimonies that his head bed books were the most famous Homer's books. This composition reveals the best and most productive period of the Heroic stage in the life of this genius. Prometheus shaped the man from earth and water, gave the best characteristics found in all animals, gave him his soul from the sun.  Prometheus comes from a period of Beethoven's life which combines retrospective and future thoughts . His mind in an absolute state of creative effervescence and epic ardor. Despite the fact that many pieces remind us of Haydn and Mozart: No. 7 (Grave) , but other sounds foretell the coming of Schubert.  If you want to explore the spiritual and soul essence and the joyful of living in its maximum splendor , go for this work.   Being first and foremost a thinker besides a musician, Beethoven knew to mold as any other composer the fierceness and  spirit force. In this fortunate period you can perceive as any other else the astonishing conviction and the certainness supported in the will and not exactly in the faith. Beethoven bet to the will flattening the destiny. So it's very hard to find a tragic mood all along these works.   I have ever heard this work as a Theme with Variations instead a ballet, the reason is very simple as Mozart's  Magic flute that is much more than an opera, The creatures goes far beyond a simple ballet.  After you listen this energizing and bravura piece you will understand better the world and even condescend with it.
