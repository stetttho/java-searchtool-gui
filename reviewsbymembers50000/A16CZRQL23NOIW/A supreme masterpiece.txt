 Following the distinguished traces of his previous six generations literary herald: Henrik Ibsen (A people's enemy) and a smart blending with an amazing and enrapturing vision of the purest spirit of the Greek Tragedy, it is not a mere casualty that Lars von Triers had employed a theatrical stage, to induce the viewer to add the necessary amount of febrile imagination; even in the simplest actions as open a door or cultivate flowers in a non existent garden.  The monumental process of overpowering crumbling of the artificial bonhomie, good will and superficiality of this peaceful and apparently inoffensive community of Dogville, will be falling down in a anguishing dropping of improper actions, false promises, tantalizing situations that culminate with that brutal rape. Under these considerations we will become silent witness of  abominable corporal abuses and physical sadism, double moral behaviors, acid comments under the holly blanket of dogmatism and religious fervor (the sordid sequence in which the bells mask the aggression is simply magisterial). Triers, to my mind is one of the most gifted directors in the world actually: In my previous review about Zentropa (1992) I remarked his visual and storytelling innovations. And Dogville represents (at the present moment, because with the genius the definitive statement is never possible), the supreme summit of his original career. I hope you agree with me when I say that Triers reached the cathartic state at the end of the film, without stylized concessions or intellectual pretensions. And considering the fact the elapsed time is 170 min. the wholeness of the human soul (with all its imaginable and glittering morbidity and rotten nakedness) was showed with all its tempestuous rage with a minimum of resources, but talent in its highest level. The spirits of Sophocles, Shakespeare, Victor Hugo and Ibsen were present without any exaggeration drop.                Nicole Kidman after her appearances in Eyes wide shut, The hours,  Moulin Rouge, Cold Mountain and The human stain has consolidated herself as one the most respected and expressive actress in the world. Her wide spectrum of emotive features allows to watch her since a tragic nymph to a merciless Lady mobster ordering the final orders. Special mention to the reluctant performances of Ben Gazzara, Lauren Bacall, Harriet Anderson, Stellan Skarsgrd, Phillip Baker Hall, James Caan and John Hurt (narrator) who overcame the rest of a very exceptional cast.   One of the Top Four Films in this year, if not the best among them.
