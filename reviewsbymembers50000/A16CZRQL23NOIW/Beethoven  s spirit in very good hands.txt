 This is very illustrative set that proves the vertigo and he mercurial approach given by Toscanini "The Maestro". All of us we love these Overtures we have in this legendary master the essential clues to enjoy and delight the force and delirious energy.  From my most beloved Overture Leonore no. 3,  this perfect example of a symphony in miniature to Egmont or Coriolan; the result will ever be the same. Admirably well phrased and better performed.   Go for this memorable historical register. The Maestro is in vital shape giving an electrifying proof of his unnerving Dionysian fury and his dazzling vigor.  Grandness, frenzy, rapture, intensity and emotion. Three elements that would seem absent in the actual musical scene.
