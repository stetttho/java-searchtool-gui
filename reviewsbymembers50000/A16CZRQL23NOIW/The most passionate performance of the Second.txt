 Try to find this CD . I know this well may be a tour de force for you , but try to make it . I do not know about other version performed with such level of passion and dyonisiac mood . Collins was a master director in Sibelius and he got with the Second his best achievement . The Third is extraordinary and the First is interesting , but De Sabata , Stokowski National Philarmonic in the seventies and Maazel Vienna are hard to beat . I was very lucky to get in New York in 1995 this jewel. You will always rewarded with this version.
