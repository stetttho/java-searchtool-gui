 This colossal artwork remains as a true giant star in the astonishing universe of the best Latin American achievements ever made.  A man with a dark past, who is living his golden years finds nothing to do in Buenos Aires and then a magnific opportunity comes for him. He gets a job with a North American Company and one Saturday night, he will  meet a man who works in the same company. After several drinks, this man will propose him a curious bet: this minuscle man has watched that the inssurance statements the mudeness is typified as a cause of indemnization: so the idea is to argue mudeness by derived wounds from a simulated work accident: that sum is equivalent to half million dollars, but the prize to pay is extremely high, you will have to live with this fact for the rest of your life.  By obvious reasons I won't tell you the rest of the story, but with all those variables you will understand why this movie has been so awarded in the rest of the world. A suspenseful and chilling script that will grow with such intensity level as few times you have experienced: I mean, you will not watch special effects: you will assist to a legal conflict and an terrible way of living for the rest of his life: to support this lie.  Not only a masterpiece,  but one of the top five Latin American films; besides one of my top two hundred cult movies in any age ever made.
