 Glenn Gould was always an outsider in every work he played . This position has its risks . Sometimes , (mostly of them) it worked out . In this particular case , we must to recognize first at all. that Hindemith piano music is built on wide cromatic lines hold by violent armonies and fierce counterpoints . And Gould handled this technique as the Gods . From here his succesful result. In the third sonate , however I miss the nostalgic eloquence given for Paul Badura Skoda in an old vynil recording from the fifties. I think Mr. Gould lacks a certain level of expresiveness , seeking a striking effect . However in the First Sonata , Gould plays with powerful conviction , giving a fresh reading and deeply idiomatism. The Second Sonata, probably is the jewel of the crown . The staccatos are played with clearness . And the whole conception of this work is perfectly translated. This is another example of the briliiant craft of this extraordinary artist.
