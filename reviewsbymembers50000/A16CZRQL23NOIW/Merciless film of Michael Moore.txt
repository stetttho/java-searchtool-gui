 This film plays hard. Moore has become in the rebel voice and one of the most irreverent personalities in USA . His brave position deserves him many admirers . The dramatic documental turns around a lot of things but he emphasizes the cruelty , the insanity and the corrupt atmosphere in certain minds . The handle camera goes from the catoon to the awful drama in just a second . The inquiring position lets to many interwiewed without much to say . He makes himself the questions and tries to find the answers . Mostly the answers simply don't exist and other you deduce for yourself . Even I don't agree in all his opinions,  this documental is an important reference for the future of the story in USA.
