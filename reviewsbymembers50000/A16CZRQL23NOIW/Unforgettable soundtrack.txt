  One of the last and most memorable soundtracks I have ever heard. The moonlight, sung by Sting is a very stylized piece with a visible Bossa Nova influence.  The album is very comfortable and easy listening. The highlight piece is in my opinion, the lovely chained set mixing admirably immortal songs of the popular memory such Stella by starlight, Call me irresponsible and the Shadow of your smile. Pollack with the humbleness of  the world wanted to pay his quote of admiration to Billy Wilder' s original version.      In the moonlight is a very elusive piece with touch of memories. The main theme of Sabrina is a very charm piece that rides between tenderness and the mystery. Growing up in Paris is a beautiful melody which describes the slow awakening of a blossom  In sum, a gratifying CD that will fill those special and required special moments.
