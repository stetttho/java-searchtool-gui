 There we have a well remade from the James Cain's novel . It's good to remind that Visconti made a superb film in 1941 with Ossesione but without this cast and this atmosphere ; Visconti is concerned about other issues and abandons the clues of the film noir. Nicholson is hired to work in a gas station ; the seductive Jessica Lange (who lives a ficticious live with an alcoholic and inhuman greek husband) establishes the chemical and sexual rapprot with Nicholson and become lovers.  There will be too much to watch in this sordid , nocturnal and bitter tale ; but the dazzling direction of Nichols , the ravishing acting of Lange and the cold blooded mind of Nicholson make a team hard to equal . There are smart twists about Macbeth and his wife in this one (a man without ambition is not a man) . I've always thought the film noir is the last son of the greek tragedy: any happiness is innocent ; and only under this gaze it's possible to understand and to discuss a film like this. Excellent and fundamental in your golden collection. A cult movie and a classic sample of the purest film noir. It's remarkable to state that the best trilogy of films noir in the eighties were with this one ; Bad timing and Body heat .
