 This original work is an arresting feminist tale about a middle aged woman who rejoins with her forgotten sensuality , performing a ballroom dance known at the danzon.  The hidden codes immersed in this typical Latin American rhythm will become a reborn of the affective world of this woman , giving back her new reasons to live and love.    Interesting premise to explore the intimacies of the beloved  and few times unspoken feminine universe.
