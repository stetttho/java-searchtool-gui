 Ozon is one the most gifted directors in this moment in France . In this film , Ozon handles with admirable perfection the ancient Hitchocknian traces around a lone female writer (Charlote Rampling won the Cannes Festival 2003 as Best Actress for this role) who decides to rest in the wonderful home of a friend to seek inspiration for her next work .  She will meet a girl with whom will experience a real train crash due her several and different points of view around a lot of issues . The suspense will be increasing gradually till an open ending . Superb photographed and wonderful art direction . You may argue the script is slow paced but it is part of the narrative style . Recommendable.
