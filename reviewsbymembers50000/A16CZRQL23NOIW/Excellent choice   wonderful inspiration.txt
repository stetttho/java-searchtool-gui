 Without any doubt , the best expression you can find after you listen this album is Vow! The repertoire is loaded with high caliber mood . Ravel made atractive arrangements (Love is in the air) and above all he could combine the beat with the musicality without boring you in any track .  I am not an expert in Smooth Jazz. And from time to time I enjoy this music with a friend of mine . In this opportunity this discovery was casual . Once more Earth, wind and fire still keep producing fortunate echoes . Acquire this issue and you will be widely rewarded.!
