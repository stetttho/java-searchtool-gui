 ... And to my mind one of the twenty golden rock live recordings ever done in any age . Just for In a gadda da vida (with one the best drum beats ever made) -though in another order of ideas, Ginger Baker is the winner obvioulsy search for Politician with Cream and Do what you like with Blind Faith-  the CD is a jewel , but if you add In the time of our lives , and Soul Experince you will obtain the minim facets of that outstanding band . Iron forever !
