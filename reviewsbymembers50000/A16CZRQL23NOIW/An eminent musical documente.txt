 Mozart is the composer who engages me with the joy of living, faster than any other composer.   Karl Bohm was in highest spirits as web as all he cast. The famous Nozze di Figaro found that evening of 1968 the sublime elegance, the joyous nuance and one offbeat performance throughout these Four Acts.  Fisher-Diskau displayed all his undeniable talent and charismatic expression as Il Conte di Almaviva and Gundula Janowitz as la Contesa di Almaviva is fantastic. Her formidable modulation and perfect phrasing are joined with the fine humor and superb charm her character demands. Hermann Prey as Figaro is terrific too.  Go for this treasured version.
