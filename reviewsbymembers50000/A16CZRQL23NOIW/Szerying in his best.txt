 Henryk Szerying never played best. He seemed to be in front a comittment beyond the music itself. He followed his bliss. You may compare without any shadow of doubt , these interpretations at the same level that Casals and his Sonatas for violoncello , or the Sonatass Cycle?s Beethoven by Schnabel, or Mozart Sonatas for violin by Szigetti. We are talking about a status of performing that surpases all type of adjectives, because it surpases by far, the standards. Szerying made also another important readings (like Vitalis chaconne ), but somehow, what he made with these violin gems from Bach was much more than all the words can express. Buy this set. And if you want consider wholl win the second place , then risk for Vegh or Milstein.
