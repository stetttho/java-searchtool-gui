 This is one of those legendary films that will surmount it own time. And this is possibly the main feature of the immortal masterpieces, works which acquire an independent life and excel far beyond the crowd of bombastic epithets and remarkable adjectives.  Not only it is worthy to remark the visible conviction of his director:Richard Attenborogh, from the initial shots, the splendid script, the superb artistic direction, the sumptuous photography, but I must insist around the performance of Kingsley as Gandhi; he surpassed the levels of the excellence. He became Gandhi; his colossal role broke the barriers of the perfection, that fact produced in the viewer an admirable and few times astonishing perception of sensorial vertigo. The camera achieved the perfect equilibrium between the intimacy and the grandness, eloquence and  transcendence, permeating literally your soul, senses, spirit and intellect.   Gandhi was the most prominent mystic leader in the XX Century and his thesis about the non violence still is subject of discussion. The concept of disobey understood as attachment to a majuscule irreverence, reached a status that exceeded by far, the frontiers of the injustice, domination and oppression, getting a supreme feat without just one shot: a sample of how the intelligence is a more effective device than any other weapon.    My final advise: after you watch this film go for the famous Robert 'Payne 's biography about Mohandas Gandhi, this apparent single man who said once: "The impatient waits twice."
