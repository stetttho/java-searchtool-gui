 This poignant story is told between the WW2 hell . Two strangers who meet casually in a train in the middle of the hopeless , the uncertainess and the agony of an unending war . I really expect the producers and headquarter who made it possible this transfer , watch carefully the enormous meaning and talent of this french director , who made several important films such as The Chat (Medal silver for best actor to Jaen Gabin 1973) , A etrange affair (Medal silver for best actor to Michel Piccoli 1981) , The veuve Clouderc (Simone Signoret and Alain Delon).  He really deserves this honor .  It's a question of fairness for a worthable career . Superb performances of Rommy Schneider and Jean Louis Trigtinant .
