 I must recognize that from those ancient times of The chase, The Day of the Jackal, Midnight express and Marathon Man, I had never seen so spectacular and struggling human chase like in this movie.  Jason Borne is an expensive mistake that it must be found and exterminated. He worked out as a failure human experiment but something goy out of control and now the things are getting worse. The whole locations and handle camera are first rate. Joan Allen shines as the implacable hunter, following every little step of Bourne through several cities.  The main character leaded by Mark Damon I found excessively overacted. But the kinetic script makes you forget this little comment. Somehow this is one the few sequels that overcame the first part. The car chase in the coda of the movie is a real visual tour de force, extraordinary well made. Recommended without reserves.
