 Emily Wharton's play is the source of inspiration for this adapted film placed in the early 20 th Century. The story deals with the life of a beautiful woman in the propitious age to get married and her several flirts with some pretenders.   But the life goes on and her game debts will lead her to unsuspected labyrinths that will seal her fate. The crumbling state of things will make of her an impoverish woman in search of her lost past. Betrayal, greed, ambition, moral double, envy and loneliness will be part of this claustrophobic landscape in the middle of this urban and promising city: New York.  The film may be overlong for some viewers. Personally I was engaged from the beginning of this visually arresting story, filled of glorious illumination and sublime good taste in the costume designs and make up.  Disregard all the negative critics you may have read or even listened about it. Try on and may be you agree with final result where the sum justifies by far this enrapturing film of visible European taste.  Remarkable performances of all the cast.  A visible homage to the unforgettable master: Luchino Visconti!
