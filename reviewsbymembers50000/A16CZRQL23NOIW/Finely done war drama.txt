 The script is extremely poignant . A British officer killed in action and without knowing a letter from his wife goes to a Czech officer who decides to keep alive the dreams and hopes of that happy wife who still ignores is widow . From the ashes of the hell , from that dark concentration camp a little spark of love  will born since they exchange letters .  One superb film of Basil Dearden magnificently  played by Michael Redgrave .
