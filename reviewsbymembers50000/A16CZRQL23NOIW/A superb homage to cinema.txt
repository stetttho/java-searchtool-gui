 The haunting story of William Friese-Greene the inventor of the motion picture camera is described with a sense of pride and profound respect. Supported by a sharp and incisive script, the film deals with the hardships and disillusions through his life, the infinite patience of his wife and the epic sacrifice of his sons when decide to go to the Army to avoid him a heavy burden  to maintain.  The towering performance still remains in our memory days and days after the lights are off. The notable contribution of so many heavy weight actors  is an additive merit of this intimate chamber work. Magnificent direction of John Boulting.  Here, between you and me. I am still amazed to be the first reviewer to comment that hidden gem. Do not miss it.!
