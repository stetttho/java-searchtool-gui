 This work is an impressive and crude testimonial that would seem to have been extracted from a Police chronicle. An awful and traumatic fact in the early years of an anonymous, unknown and humble child will determine an anomalous, bitter and comprehensible but not justifiable sickness behavior. Hate and rage; deception and spiritual penury join to that hopeless environment, where the violence is the main ingredient to survive will spark all your interest once you start to read it.
