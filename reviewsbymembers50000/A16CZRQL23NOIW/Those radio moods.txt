 Woody made to my mind one of his best entries with this autobiographical portrait of his childhood, impregnated with those family anecdotes that in major or minor grade all of us keep on our memory too. From the initial shot when the thieves visit his house, Allen handles these psychological and engagements hooks keeping this delightful charm and joy pf living.  His religious irreverence when he maintains his bet for the Lone Ranger in a funny dialogue with the Rabin, to his beloved aunt who wishes to get marry, the absurd discussion about the oceans to the daily conflicts with their neighbors.  W.A. interweaves these unforgettable forties when the TV was just an unthinkable idea and there was time for falling in love through the voice; the ear and not the eye was the vehicle to suggest your favorite star.       A funny and smart entertaining and one of the most relevant works of Allen.
