 The whole significance and special transcendence of this band in the musical universe is still a fascinating subject of analysis. Their inspiration was always characterized by a febrile search of new expressions and careful experimental treatment. They experienced the last sonorous possibilities, achieving and molding a very impressive trademark. Carmine Apice was one of the most important musicians of his generation and definitively would give Cactus that special feature that became of them another cult rock band.   Their mood is nourished by a visible classic influence, they explored the limits of the vigorous sensation of void through their impressive silences, when the scales reached unsurpassable decibels in search of a very dark mesmerizing trance. Listening Some velvet morning can give a very close description about the slender combination of lyricism, and articulated ensemble of voices, where the bass and drums played a decisive role.  They opened paths for future bands to come. Pink Floyd was still a blossomed flower and Emerson Lake & Palmer, Yes, King Crimson or Gentle Giant were not in stage but were so deeply influenced by this top-notch ensemble who has become (through the years and thanks to the admirable register of memory 's depuration and the natural fragmentation of musical forms in progress) an authentic heraldic band of audacious proposals and very but very anticipated to its own age.
