 Walter Huston as the devil gives a knock out performance in this classic film. Filmed in the middle of the WW2 , the film is a well made adaptation of the famous Fausto , but set in a little town, where the greed and the ambition transforms the soul and the character of a very good farmer. The script turns around the hunger for power who lives in all  human being. He makes a contract with the devil and the promise will allow him seven years of richness . Suddenly he changes his old habits and becomes cruel and insane mood , he becomes in a no mercy pawnbroker and he reachs the peak like the most hated man of the town. The story will lead us to a twist of fate about a famous politician (who else?) who will have his verbal duel with the devil in an unforgettable and surrealistic place with a weird jury. Wonderful defense with a powerful reasoning. This picture became in a cult movie due his expressiveness and his flamboyant rhytm . This one may be the best achievement of Willam Dieterle as film maker. The ending sequence is anthological!
