 This film through the years improves progressively and his cult status has been deserved to it all the honors and thinkable acknowledgements. Not only constitutes an admirable epic effort and artistic portrait but besides it's an artwork never equaled previous or lately. This gem of 1922 deals with the hard conditions of Eskimo life: the walrus hunt sequence or the ice bath still remain in my memory. One of the sublime milestones in the whole Cinema Story, and obviously Flaherty's glorious masterpiece!
