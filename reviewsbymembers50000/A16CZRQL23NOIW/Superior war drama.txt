 During the French resistance, a fighter escapes from Gestapo headquarters; he returns to Marsella just to find there is traitor between the group. he finds and throttle him.  They decide to go to Lyons to rescue another important member, but the attempt fails, his partner dies and then he is captured again. But a female partner is forced to confess; otherwise her daughter will be sent to work in a Nazi brothal; but the Resistance in the apparent merciless but implacable honor code has to kill her for revenge the death of the members. A complex vision of the French epic resitance. A potent and somehow forgotten film by the great audiences.  The cast is splendid and the director is one of the most distinguished Franch filmmakers: Jean Pierre Melville; the same director of the red Circle, Bob Le flambeur, Le doulos, Le samourai, Les enfants terribles and The silence of the sea. Don' t miss this gem!
