 This is an anti war picture that reminded me in many ways to that glorious Billy Wilder 's film of 1953 Stalag 17, which chooses the comedy to unmask certain hidden vices. Kubrick ' Dr. Strangelove somehow marked the pathway this satiric genre that culminated with Norman Jewison 's The Russians are coming.  Paddy Chayevsky 's skillful screenplay is adapted from William Braford Huie 's book about a Navy officer whose man job during WW2 is to supply his superiors with creature comforts including girls. On the other side of the bridge there will be a widow portrayed by Julie Andrews who despises Garner 's non heroic attitude, but can not help falling in love with him.  The final is funny but there is a lot of cynicism that runs as corrosive acid throughout the film. Admirable work of Arthur Hiller and in many senses this could be his masterpiece.
