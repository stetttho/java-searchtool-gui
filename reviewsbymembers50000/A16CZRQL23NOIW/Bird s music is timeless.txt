 Charlie Christopher "Yardbird" Parker left us a sad day on 1954, but his musical bequeath still is modern, in spite of the fact fifty two years have elapsed. The way he stamped his phrases, with an accurate blending of sophistication, audacious, sentiment and intelligence made that he went beyond his own age, to fly in the wings of the legend.   Roy Hargrove counted with the genial support of Christian McBride, Bass and Stephen Scott, two hyper talented who decided to concur on April 12-14 1995 to make one of themost expressive ever made on Bird' s memory.  No matter you are not a big fan of Parker's mood. Just listen the first bars of any track and let your imagination flies in this extraordinary and enlivening musical document, that certainly exceeded the limits of the best to become a cult record.
