 Indeed. The cynical argument is far beyond a tongue in the cheek. When A Russian submarine runs aground on the shore of Nantucket will originate a delirious sequel of unimaginable and unexpected situations, as a cordial grimace respect the Cold War and the recent incidents.  From the times of Dr. Strangelove we had not watched such delirious and good taste comedy around the psychopathology of the war, but interweaved with fine humor and brilliant occurrences.  A formidable movie that resists certain misconnections in its narrative.  This is an additional and efective ocassion to invite you to watch for an old but sensational movie related with this subject; the classic Whisky Gallore, a true gem of the Fifties.
