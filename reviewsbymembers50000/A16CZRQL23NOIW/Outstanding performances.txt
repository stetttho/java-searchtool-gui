 I have never been a fan of Wilhelm Backhaus. But I must recognize his impeccable performance and unbeatable reading of this overwhelming piano work of Joseph Haydn: Andante with variations has never treated with such masterful level.  The Piano Sonata is admirably well played. It owns humor, grace, ingenious musicality and fineness.  Conceptually speaking his Chopin is excessively intellectual and somehow the emotion never emerges. It lacks of this special light and shadow images.    Excellent and admirable musical tresure.
