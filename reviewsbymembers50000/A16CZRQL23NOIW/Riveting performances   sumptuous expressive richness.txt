 I have not any doubt in stating that this set means a great legacy about the enormous talent and musicality present in Carlos Kleiber , who pitifully died a days ago .   These performances with the Vienna have noblesse and majesty . Despite the fact that very few conductors in the globe (Barenboim among them) are capable of playing Beethoven with authentic commitment about the inner values underlined underneath the score .    Kleiber was a musician gifted with great talent . I knew about him through a video in a Beethoven program with the Concertgebouw of Amsterdam in 1986 .   Since this recording was released I acquired it almost inmediatly , convinced as effectively I was , Kleiber had something new to say about Beethoven .    In fact these performances are loaded with magnificent deepness. The Vienna Philarmonic as you know is among the top orchestras all around the world .    The fifth is filled with histamine and conviction . Kleiber never was an effectist director , and he was gifted with wide vision about Beethoven . When this happens the musician play and create a different sound because they know they are guided for a leader .   The seventh is really good , you will miss the powerful Furtwangler version of 1947 , for instance or 1943 , but anyway there are worthable for a new listener or well a veteran in the field . Both of these works are really winner . Try with this album and you inmediatly feel (since the first bars) that idyisoncratic difference .     Carlos Kleiber : In memoriam!
