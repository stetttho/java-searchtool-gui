 No other cellist in the story has even got closed to G.P. in what this artistic perofrmance concerns under John Barbirolli conducting . No one but him was capable to equalize the fineness and the filigree job who made of him the maxim exponent of this romantic and flamboyant concerto . Piatigorski played the cello with such magnificence and artful elegance as a few . His performances were gifted with lyrical inspiration and deep musicality . To me Piatigotrski was after Pau  Casals the great cellist of the XX Century.
