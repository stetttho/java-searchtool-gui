 First at all , I am not a Claudio Arrau fan . I recognize in him a notable thinker and a living witeness of the XX century . In this book, Horowitz established an inmediat rapport with Arrau and obtained an excellent result. Arrau will make a journey in the time and will reveal interesting details about his life experience . The analysis made for him about the Sonata in B minor of Liszt , for instance , his recordings sesions with Colin davis , her dhildhood memories , his memories when he saw Busoni playing the Hammerklavier and an unending amount of remarkable issues will make of this book a must reference for any viewer specially if this is a hard fan of the music . Recommendable all the way!
