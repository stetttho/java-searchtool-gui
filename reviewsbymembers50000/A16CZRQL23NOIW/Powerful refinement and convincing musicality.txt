 Few pianists in the story have been capable to play Brahms in a classic approach . It seems there is an invisible statement about Brahms scores that titles : play romantic . This is the secret of this winner album . Gould playing was never romantic , but aristocratic , irreverent and deeply idyosincratic . Gould had no pre - conceived ideas about a performing in particular .  I think the majesty of Gould performances follows the path : soul-mind . I mean emotion , enthusiasm and intellect . The rhapsodies for instance, are played with universal thinking , forgetting the specific locations and the narrow minded musical conceptions.  Gould is always seeking the precise sound , the definite articulation , that meticulousness which allowed him to play mezzoforte or pianissimo . I guess he felt every little bar as a part of all a complex puzzle and his commitment went in that way . In the Intermezzos , the result are more than surprising . The first characteristic is the intimate atmosphere and clean transparency of the arpeggios . His octaves never punish the instrument ; he does not want to sound energic and imperative but suggesting and eloquent .  You as consumate listener must find out the intention behind the score . And many times you will have to change your mind about that old fashioned concept which turns around the respect for the tradition . This may be well a serious obstacle for you to get involved in Gould mood . Have you really ever heard the Intermezzo Op. 117 No. 2 played with such deepness ? This album is very important for you to acquire because it convinces about the hyperkinetic mind and outstanding wholeness of Gould as pianist and far beyond , as a real artist .
