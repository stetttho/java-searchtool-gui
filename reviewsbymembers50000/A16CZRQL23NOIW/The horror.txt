 We are possibly, in front of the bleakest of all the Noir films ever made. Aldrich surrounded this magnificent work of struggling and anguishing atmosphere, and bringing back to the antipodes of a true Greek tragedy, where the hero is absent.  An actor in abrupt slope due alcoholism does not want to renew his contract. This problem has estranged from his wife. His producer Stanley Hoff is in absolute disagreement with that decision. And because of this after having exposed all the arguments, decides to blackmail him, under the threat  of denounce arguing he killed a pedestrian in drunkenness state in presence of Dixie. But Stanley is very suspicious and to avoid any possibility of jeopardy he eliminates her. This violent death and his wife's final departure joined the fact she will stay with Hank Teagle after the divorce materializes is the last push for this tormented and defenceless   human being. Aldrich' s extreme angles and short lenses distort even more the perspectives of Charlie' s world , externalizing with visible morbidity Charlie' s frenzy.       Aldrich with this film and Kiss me deadly belongs to the reduced Pantheon of the Noir Film `s Godfathers.
