 Birch wood is one of the most sensitive, intimate, poignant, haunting, tender and fascinating films in any age. The story focuses around the relationship among two brothers: one of them is dying from tuberculosis and however, he is who still possesses this savoir vivre; the fine eye to appreciate the little details, a dawn or a walk in the forest, he plays the piano with febrile intensity with artistic mood and refined poetry, the tense relationship will engage the viewer from start to finish. Beautifully photographed, with admirable game lights, and the arresting images from Poland' s woods. Wajda made one of his superlative works of his brilliant career.
