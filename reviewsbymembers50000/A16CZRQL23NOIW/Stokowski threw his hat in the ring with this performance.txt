 This performance is supreme . It is literally unbeatable in all the possible corners. It intense , its fierceness and wildness has no enemies in all the previous or next recordings . I may recommend in a second place an extraordinary version of Mravinsky but the distance between both is so great that you may state the second is in the tenth place . This symphony is very exciting and rich in thematic ideas and virile in sheer energy , its formal construction and colorful scoring allows and demands too a ranked conductor to win the numerous challenges in dynamics and rhythmic tension ; the sforzandos and fevered attacks result in a very complicated puzzle for any competent director . But if you do onot own the scope sense as Stokowski did ; sorry you are out of combat . This recording through the years has became in a cult status and seems improve with the age . A must for all the hard fans of Shostakovich.
