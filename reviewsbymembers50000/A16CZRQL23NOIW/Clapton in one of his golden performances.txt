 Definitively Eric Clapton is like the good wine . He improves through the years, with his admirable personal style , fresh and innovative . He knew to get off from the rock sound in the late seventies keeping a personal profile and turning carefully to the musical roots of Lee J. Hooker - the God Father blues -, incorporating impressive lyrics , following the traces of his spiritual guide : Bob Dylan. The presence of giant musicians such Steve Winwood and John Mayall , to name just two of them has allowed to experience and enriching the visions one each another , between the new country sounds with good taste and easy to sing themes .  Since his immortal presence as solist guitar in Cream in those far sixties to the actual times Clapton has walked a long and winding road .  Tears in heaven is undoubtedly his no time legacy ; shows the divine muse the unconscious call from this rapture artistic loaded of sad inspiration : I mean poetry in its most intimate feature .  A soft voice not necessarily potent has allowed to conquer five generations of listeners . From the Yard birds , to the present Eric Clapton may be well considered the last English bard of the music .  His message not only concerns with the urban issues , he as a real poet, searches beneath the epidermis of the things and due his undeniable charisma has become in an authentic icon , a living legend.         Furthermore , the fact this album has been released twelve years ago and it has not aged just a little bit confirms the thesis the genius is always contemporanean.
