 At the moment you decide by yourself a lofty list of the great exponents of the rhythm & blues, you will necessarily should take into account the name of Al Kooper. He literally provided of new enterprises and renovated vitality the reloaded atmosphere .He knew to blend the essential roots of the jazz, pop, rock, country, producing a new musical speech.  From those distant years in which he was part of the renowned ensemble Blood, Sweat and Tears, he reached by himself a special status level. Creativity, expression and feeling of a whole generation, avid for new sensations, in search of innovativeness.  The story of the Pop would be unfinished if we should not include his notable contributions with Mike Bloomfield, his support to raising promises like Shuggie Otis, and the composition of themes that remain underneath our epidermis and now are part of our musical memories, such Seasons of the Witch or I love you than you ever know.           That sudden return was a very appropriate pretext to rejoin the old masters of a relative brief past, to prove us there is still Kooper for a long time.   A remarkable album that you could easily and without any exaggeration should be among the five albums of the decade. The emotional burden, explosive outburst and creative flame still live in this man with soul: Al Kooper.  I have my most profound conviction that through the years, this will be considered a true historical recital, even though the elapsed time is too brief, but it's a personal presentiment.
