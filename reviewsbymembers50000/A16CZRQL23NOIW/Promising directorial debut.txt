 Sean Penn in his opera prima as director was very succesful. He developed an interesting approach about two brothers in a small village. This movie has a strong influence mythical; two brothers work out as the alpha and omega. The atmosphere is loaded  with reflexive issues. I saw this film in 1992 and I suspected that this one would be a cult movie and for selected audiences. Penn made an artistic work with very well depicted characters supprted  with a solid script,filled with sugestive visual methapors. Vigo Mortenesen revealed himself with this film as a young promise ; Denis Hooper as always, shows his actoral skills once more in a very brief appearance. Watch this one. A rewarding film.
