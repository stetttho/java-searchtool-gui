 The legendary and authoritative baton of Fritz Reiner and the superb musicality and twinkling pianism of Rudolf Serkin joined the best of themselves to produce one of the most striking and incandescent versions ever made in the story of the disc.  This Brahms reading is simply epic loaded with virility and dramatism. The Hungarian Rhapsodies don't find a close contender in the market. Precision. histamine, accuracy without a simple drop of nostalgy, loaded of paganism and exultant mood. I recommend it without any restrictions. A true musical treasure!
