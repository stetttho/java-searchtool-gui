 The astonishing legacy of Pau Casals confirms us and returns us the role of the ART in majuscule. The genius is a long patience. I can guarantee you that every time you listen these admirable recordings you will reconcile us with the life and will appreciate those admirable concepts of Andrei Tarkovsky: "The art is possible due the world is imperfect. In a perfect world the art would be meaningless."    Milestone recordings.
