 Jean Martinon is the last director really inmersed in the impresionist mood . His performances are deeply inspired and above all idiomatic . Marie Claire Jamet in the Sacred Dances is absolutely comitted with the elusive forms and pagan enchantment. Martinon belonged to that hard to find status conductor who really know to engage with the composer mood . So when he played his music the results were overwhelming . He had a enormous gift to suggest . I still remind The Prokoviev seventh symphony with the Chicago Symphony and I can not get another first movement so well performed , for instance . Back to Debussy he combines the charm and nuance with that incorporean and elusive approach that Debussy and Ravel demands . I state a parallel (if I may) between Martinon - Debussy and Beecham - Delius in what idiomatism concerns . When Martinon performs Debussy the paintings of Matisse , Monet and Manet seem to awake and come to our mind . The prientemps and the children 's corner are absolutely of first rate . The clarinet rhapsody is the best in the market . In the images I prefer the Ansermet version , but the whole set is fundamental if you enjoy the orchestral music of Debussy.  Notice I have not mentioned Ravel works . I have another name in Ravel : Andre Cluytens . But this is out of context.
