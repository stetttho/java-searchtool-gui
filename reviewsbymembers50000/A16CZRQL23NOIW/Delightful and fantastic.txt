 After an absence of four years  ,Sean Connery returned to make his sixth entry of the serie after a curious and disappointed movie whose starring was Georges Lazenby and the most statuesque of the Bond girls : Diana Rigg . This is the first of films to utilize American locations Reno , Palm Springs , Los Angeles and Las Vegas . This is a funny entertainmet and even the script is one of the most escapist  , Jill St. John acting as the Bond girl ( Pitifully Jacqueline Bisset , Elke Sommer , Virna Lisi or Samantha Eggar were never hired as Bond girls) and the fact you do not have an enemy with heavy weight impact as Gert Forbe (Goldfinger), for instance , the movie is visually stunning , specially in the sea locations. This is the most enjoyable entry , the least serious of all the previous Connery . But it is absolutely saved by a excellent soundtrack , and original situations perhaps. Personally I am almost sure that there is an underground tribute to that fifties film "The gentlemen prefer it blondes" and the emblematic song : "The diamonds are the best friend of the women"
