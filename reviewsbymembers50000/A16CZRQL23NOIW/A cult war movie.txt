  Impressive, absorbing and fundamental film during the Nazi take over in Norway. Lewis Milestone was a great director but when he decided to make a war movie something happened. He was provided by a special spell touch. It's happens the same when John Ford made a Western or Hitchcock a suspense picture. He was possessed by an inner call . There is a Spanish term previously used by Federico Garca Lorca when he meant that special phenomena. He talked about "to have hobgoblin". And precisely this is the appropriate term designed to L.M.  An efficient cast completes the whole work.
