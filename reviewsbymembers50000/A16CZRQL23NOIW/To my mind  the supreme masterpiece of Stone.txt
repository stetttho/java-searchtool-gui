 Oliver Stone has not been precisely my favorite director, but it goes far beyond any other reason not to acknowledge the undeniable virtues of this superb movie. A treasured picture that will be increasing gradually through years, once the actual generations or the previous who lived and witnessed the sordid JFK `s assassination and all the set of dark events hidden backstage.  Stone recreates through a superb edition work a true sinister puzzle of unknown mechanism, disproving the pretended and infantile argument that argues Lee Harvey Oswald was the only brain master and executor of  this horrid fact. Kevin Costner starring Jim Garrison will be the assigned spokesman to reveal step by step, the immense tangle and multiple circuital web of facts and characters evolved. The thesis of the self will bullet that described a curious path is a trick that hardly could be managed by the same Dave Copperfield.  Intriguing, sensationalist if you want but extremely passionate, systematic and exhausting rebuilding of the events that make you reconsider -with Executive Action, a previous film of 1973 sincerely recommended- that not all what it glitters is gold. Towering performances by Pesci, Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones and the brief cameo by Sutherland.  "Commit a crime; and the world is made of glass." Ralph Waldo Emerson.
