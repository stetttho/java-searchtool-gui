 Anthology of ghost stories adapted from Lafcadio Hearn , American writer who lived in Japan . Visually stunning. The third chapter is the best. It turns around a poet who must create a epic poem about an ancient battle dictated for the leader of this dead regiment, killed  in action, who emerges from the ashes to find out someone who reminds always the echoes of that bloody combat. Extraordinary!
