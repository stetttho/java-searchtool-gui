 This film is powerful and stunning.It deals with the question about how to deal with the human being when he is arrived to the golden age. The movie shows no mercy about that. The rules are very clear.when you are seventy ,you must go to Narayama. We live in a world that avoids talking about this point. James Hillman in an interview talks about the fact that in our process of growing up we do not want understand that to get it,we must lose things to reach it, and this is unboreable for many of us because we are accostumed to win always. Watch a film called the sudden loneliness of Konrad Steiner from the swiss filmmaker Kurt Gloor, 1976 and then return to Narayama. Two different gazes, but basically facing the same question. Since I was seventeen I read a thought from an italian writer-Giovanni Papini- who said:   Will I have to remember that the time is like an army of no shoes army who spies behind the door of every day of our life ,making us less strongs and much weaker? Imamura is among that selected elite integrated by Mizoguchi, Kusorawa, Kinugasa, Ichikawa,Ozu. He is the most prolific,original and best gifted director of the Japanese cinema.We expect much more about him,Watch also the eel, Black rain and Eijanaika and you will understand why he is so beloved in Cannes, Berlin and another important festivals all around the world.
