 Based on a true story , the film is a real challenge whose principal message is to face the life with all its obstacles, prejuices , evilness , injustice and cruelty . You have to fight and trust in yourself no matter what . Cuba Gooding Jr has played the most prominent role to date in his raising career as Carl Brashear. He will have to face the painful racism subject since he enlists to the Navy . And the search of the honor will be the real motive for his continous improvement . Robert de Niro looks a bit overacted and his facial expression reminds too much to Al Capone in the Untouchables . High raising situations and good special effects through the film and since the movie lacks of dramatic punch and gives too many concesions to the great audience , retains however the interest . Watchable work.
