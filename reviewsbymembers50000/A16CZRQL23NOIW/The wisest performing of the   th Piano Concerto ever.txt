 Never before I had listened such kind of rendition , with a deep vision. Myra Hess belongs to the dinasty of Madame Tureck,Tatiana Nikolayeva,Frau Carreno,Rosita Renard, Jeanne Marie Darre, Clara Haskill,Lily Pons and Guiomar Novaes. The first conclussion you pitifully arrive is that actually,no one ' with some living exceptions like Daniel Barenboim,Badura Skoda, Sandor ,Volodos,Michail Rudy,and in certains ocassions Plentnev' plays the piano with that special kind of comittment passion. And this statement is not just a nosthalgical opinion. Think about in Schnabel, Casals, Cortot,Busoni,Kempff, Kapell,Richter,Segovia, Zabaleta,Landowska, Thibaud, Fournier,Szerying and you will agree that something happened with the performing craft and not precisely positive fact.Something missed. An atmosphere, an inner conviction,a comittment.  I have eyes,not points of view, was told once by a venezuelan poet Rafael Cadenas. And that is the key. Actually it seems prevail the skill above the expression,the charisma over the poetry. When Glenn Gould refused to make more public concerts, was stating to his own style, the fact that we go to the great halls to make everything except melting with the score.That trascendental experience that you should feel when you were part of the mise in scene of the greek theather, now it is absent.You do not feel the extatic experience.  Somehow,Hess made it in this public appearence with Walter conducting the New York Philarmonic. The conception of this performance is not classical, and less romantic. It is cosmical. And that is not related with the fact that the Kv. 466 is the greatest piano concert of Mozart and one of the supreme piano concerts ever composed. Listen this version and thank to the untired explorers of hidden treasures like Music and Arts for making us possible revival that experience every time you listen.
