 Most of the great audiences consider that Brahms -the late heir of a tradition initiated by Bach and followed by Beethoven (Goldberg and Diabelli)- reached the hitherto with the Variations genre. That obligates us to remind once more this sublime work, to my mind the most ambitious, robust and pyramidal piano work of this Swiss composer. Based on a "Tempo di Minuetto" theme from the B flat major suite in Part III of the "Tafelmusik". He wrote a huge sequence of 23 variations, uninhibited with technical difficulties and notorious effectiveness. The variations are arranged in growing order of importance. Dedicated to the pianist James Kwast and introduced to the public on 10 March 1915 in Berlin.    Hamelin did it again. One of the most pyramidal, relevant and talented pianists in the world.!
