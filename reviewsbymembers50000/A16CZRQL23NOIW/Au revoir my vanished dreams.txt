 If you thought everything was said about the childhood universe with Willy Wonka , Wizard of Oz , Mary poppins or Fantasy , sorry you made a wrong choice . The circus world is one of our invisible links with our childhood . And no one as Fellini free spirit to make a glorious homage to the clowns and the circus meaning in our lives .  Haunting , beautifully filmed and exhilarating script will amaze you over and over again. Fellini showed once more why he , Tarkovsky and Bresson were the freest filmakers in all the cinema story . A thousand carats gem !
