 In this kind of movies you miss the presence of a giant film maker . And Monger is a talented director but he lacks from the greatness sense , that absence of scope .  Think for instance what would John Huston , David Lean , Franklin Schaffner (in the past) or  Jim Sheridan , Mike van Diem , Bertrand Tavernier , Kenny Loach , Aki Kaurismaki or Werner Herzog  would have done with such material - to name just a few examples of directors who seek the real esence behind the script - ?. These are one of the weird cases one misses the absence of commitment to appreciate the real impact which a film like this could become . The script , however , is excellent . To get a community inspire  by themselves to make all the possible efforts to reach the goal ; sixteen ground feet tall to become a hill in a mountain was an issue which really deserved something much more than a funny entertainment . Nevertheless the story is so original and strong that it remains by itself above all .  Watch this little but unvaluable gem .
