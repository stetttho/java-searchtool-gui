  Minimalist film in which the beloved Bjorg makes a poignant portrait of an introspective girl with serious affective , emotional and visual problems which visibly affect her relationship with the outer world.  Eventually she will be unfairly accused ; the things will get worst to her and eventually she will be executed for death.  A great homage of the cinema for itself.  Impressive film of Lars von Triers.
