 This is a fascinating psychological exploration, and unflinching statement into man 's hidden dragons of the human being and the always unstoppable tendency toward the self destruction. Four people, a desert island, will interact showing their fears,insecurities, frustrations, emotive status and personal bunkers.   In a very similar way employed by Bergman in Persona, he maintains an increasing physical tension with his accustomed and inimitable style.   Personally, I recommend to watch the following tetralogy in this order: The hour of the wolf, Persona, The passion of Anna and finally Shame, because as you know Strindberg 's influence is more than obvious.  An unforgettable film!
