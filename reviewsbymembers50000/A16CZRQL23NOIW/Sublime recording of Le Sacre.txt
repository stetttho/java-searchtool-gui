 To my mind there are just five superb and unbeatable recordings of Le Sacre du Prientemps each one with its own personality .   The first one with Pierre Monteux , Boston Symphony dated from 1958 .  The second performance belongs to Antal Dorati in a mono Mercury recording with the Minneapolis of the fifties .  The third reading (my favorite one) is a very hard to find recording of Michael Tilson Thomas and the Boston Symphony of 1971 .  The Fourth is a superb performance of Fricsay with Rias in the Fifties.  And finally this one of Markevitch and the Philarmonia Orchestra .  The trademark seal of this version is the pagan atmosphere , superb sonority and bitter disonances carefully underlined for this masterful conductor .  In fact Markevitch was -together with Ernest Ansermet- a real pioneer champion playing almost his entire repertoire . His harsh harmonies work out splendidly in Stravisnky .  If you really want to feel a real sensorial experience acquire this golden gem recording .
