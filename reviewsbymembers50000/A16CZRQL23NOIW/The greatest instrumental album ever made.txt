 Michael Legrand threw himself to the eternity with this album. All the tracks are first rate. These delightful thirty six minutes are made from dyonisiac enthusiam; the orchestal sound is pure gold. Since I was a child I listened this album (and I still keep the old fashioned vynil) . But when I acquired this record in New York in 1998, I found a milestone gem in the music. By any circunstance let you misss the opportunity of buying this record. You dont have any possible excuse. Youll be rewarded always.
