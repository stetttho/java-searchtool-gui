 In the golden age of the brittish comedy through the last forties and the middle fifties , this little jewel was one of the best proofs to exposse . Imagine this incredible cast the legendary Alec Guiness with his funny teeth , Herbert Loom and a young raising promise named Peter Sellers .  This death quintet will rent the house of an harmless old lady who will be the crucial axis for a lot of laughable gags but told in the english way and spiced with that black humor dosis  all along the film . This unforgettable work , together with Whisky Gallore , Hobson 's choice, The man in the white suit , Kind hearts and cornets ,  and The lavender hill mob  (notice the presence of Alec Guiness in the last three works) may be well considered the set of the cream of the black humor and fine irony in this unique and creative decade .
