 Dangerous curves is a punch song . It has swing all along the way and since Droptop is another triumph , it sounds terrific with an outstanding rhythmic section  Mister magic is a funky theme . easy to listen and a good reason to listen after a hard day . No two ways about it is one of three best tracks . The acoustic and smooth guitar of Golub is delightful and persuasive . Gone but not forgotten to my mind is the best track . Sugestive , with lights and shadows , the latin mood surrounds the piece . The curtains are brilliant and the rhythmic section works out admirably . Tastefully inspired and best played. And finally we come to the second best track :Till we meet again . This smooth piece is a real hit .  A must in your collection .
