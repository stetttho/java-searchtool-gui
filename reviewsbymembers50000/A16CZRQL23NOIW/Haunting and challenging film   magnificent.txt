 In the early sixties it's hard for you to get a film so brave like this one. Bogarde is a homosexual who lives in the closet. And this fact will be sparkling point , thrugh he'll be blackmailed . In one of the excellent lines of this amazing script Bogarde staes: The fear is the oxygen of the extorsion. Watch this brave film . Bogarde shows us he was an actor of depth and substance . After he would make The servant (see my review) where he would play a top notch performance under Joseph Losey' s direction. This movie may be well considered as the masterpiece of Basil Dearden.  And remind that Advise and consent , that unforgettable film of Otto Preminger deals with similar argument. Both of them belongs the same year.
