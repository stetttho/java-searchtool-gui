 This movie like no one before hits in the midle of the soul, no matter how old you are. If youre a teenager (like me in 1973 I was 18) it became a shocking experience, but through the years, this film witha remarkable trio (Moravia, Bertolucci and Brando) altogether inscrbed their names and melt the real essence of the existencialism (beyond the stranger from Camus) , exposes with no estetic considerations the nakeness of the human being. Loneliness , hopeless, desesperation, two persons existing before living each one to their own way, sharing an apartment where they can be true for a while. And surrounded by a silence`s veil. The story is told by a shy camera, who spies like a peeping tom, all the corners of the room. And that finale in the dancerroom is an antology. The huge scream of pain couldn`t be told in a more dramatic style. The tango that certainly represents the hopeless and the blooded memory of that tha could have been and wasn`t, and the contrast with the nuance and touch of class that Paris means top us, it can be too heavy and awful for many viewers. But if you are able to go beyond these estetic obstacles and exploring the deep of the soul . You`ll be rewarded forever. A landmark in the story of the cinema. Brando will never reach that peak like this performance.
