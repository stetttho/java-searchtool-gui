 This seminal, absorbing and arresting picture preceded by far, the famous ones Zinemmann `s The Search (1947),  Joseph Losey 's The boy with the green hair (1948) and Rene Clement ` s Forbidden Games(1953). And comparing in what stature artistic concerns it with Andrei Tarkovsky `s Ivan childhood is just one echelon bellow, equaled with Forbidden games. . I have seen them all these in the last two months and I can tell you with all the possible objectivity. This is another magisterial masterpiece of the Italian Realism. There is no way out along this struggling and gradually increasing tension. A true slap in the face that will make you think around a lot of things. An ethic deficit, perhaps?
