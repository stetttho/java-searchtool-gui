 With this movie Roger Moore debuted for the pretended rescue of the previous saga. Perhaps it does not sound exaggerate to affirm that we are before the weakest Opus of  this agent. It was certainly, a thin service to his Majesty.   An anthological hodgepodge, that counted with a very famous soundtrack and the undeniable presence of the angelical Jane Seymour, but there are infamous car chases, and a visible turn and twists of character around this Secret Agent that almost remit us to a surrealistic circus. The crocodiles sequence is one of the major absurdities ever filmed. It was a serious reverse, a terrible jab to the admirable good taste and imagination of the previous films, that reduced ostensibly the well deserved status of 007 to become a cartoon network.   Give me a break!
