 Aidan Quinn was magisterial in this poignant story about a children correctional in Ireland 1938. He comes to this singular place ruled namely by a weak director who knows obey and respect the holy world of the Bishop who named to Father John, a true disturbed mind and emotionally castrated: He in the name of preserving the discipline above any other considerations infringes cruel and abusive punishments to this young community, integrated basically by orphans, rebels without cause and twisted behaviors. A real micro cosmos human. Quinn will have to face against this challenge, and searching for the consequences of this terrible conduct he finds the answer; they are hunger for love, consideration and warmth human. He gets from them the best they can, his classes are sealed with the imagination seed and the enthusiasm: there will be serious encounters with Father John and his stupid rules about territory delimitation, censoring in the name of his dogmatic precepts what's right and what's wrong.   But this rotten and hypocrite attitude will reach a dramatic climax. The teacher award them in the Christmas Night and become an unconditional allied when the abuses be perpetrated against their fragile humanity.   Based in real facts, the film also describes through sharp flashbacks the background of this teacher who lost his wife in the Spanish Civil War; he knows about sorrows, but despite about it he owns a noble heart and simply doesn't accept any injustice.   Impressive acting of Iaian Glenn in the role of the satanic and distorted mind Father John. Striking film that will leave you thinking a long time.  This film won the Sundance Film Festival in the category of Women in Cinema Lena Sharpe Award for Persistence in Vision 2003!
