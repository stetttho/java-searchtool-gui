 In the whole life there is nothing serious that it can not be expressed through a smile. The terrible marriage crisis in a middle class family, will turn on the light to tell a story loaded of affection and hope. A father will make the impossible to conquer and recover the love and warmth of his kids when the breakthrough of the divorce appears. He will navigate against all the odds till the time comes for this genial masquerade plenty of funny situations that make us to forget the dramatic nucleus around it.     Mrs Doubtfire was a real punch and seems to improve through the ages. Somehow this film was the funny side of Kramer vs Kramer. The solid performance made for Robin Williams to my mind has been his second best achievement after Fisher King to date. The rest of the cast was impressive with Sally Field as the merciless wife and Pierce Brosnan as her fiance.   The corporal expression, the Irish accent was so convincing that I guess any other actor in the world in these ages can play this role.
