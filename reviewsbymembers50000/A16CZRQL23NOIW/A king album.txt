 This work remains by far among the loftiest of the whole collection of the Liverpool' s boys (and perhaps the best of all them). If you analyze carefully, this album finds Beatles in a colossal leap, an undeniable musical progress.  Starting by the lyrics, the conciseness of the themes, its various motives, the full sense of inspiration and happy mood of all the ensemble. Here comes the sun is a gentle summer breeze, stylized and filled of inspiration all the way.  What can it be said from Oh darling?. A true tour de force, with a vibrating guitar and ravishing approach to the "white blues", a surpassed test thinking about the genial voice of the bad white guy of the blues; his majesty: Eric Burdon.   Something is one the finest and sublime ballads written anytime. Come together is an amazing track. The originality and innovative freshness, the blended cross between the different instruments and the assertive vocal support makes of this theme one of the best of the group. Because, is to my mind, one the most complete and mature songs of the Beatles. Its formal construction, is much more complicated than Yesterday; perhaps it' s not so easy going song as this last one, but its strong autumnal character is a farewell hymn for the future. All the world knew about the intense problems lived by all of them, at least that was my reading when I listened this historic record in the early seventies.     In last instance, the whole work has not aged a bit. It contains that genius touch, so typical of the great albums: that invisible difference that makes the difference. LONG LONG LIFE, ABBEY ROAD!    Pd. It is not a mere casualty this is the best seller album in Amazon (Check the ranking sale)
