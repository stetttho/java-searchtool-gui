 It should be noted that George Szell is not exactly one of my devoted and favorite conductors. But I in this case, I would affirm that we are in front maybe, of his best musical achievement: these Variations on a Theme by Hindemith simply can not be played better. Not only is the majestic sound of this emblematic Orchestra but the magnificent approach and total euphoria you may perceive around all the ensemble. Szell was in a superb mood, conferring it the necessary presence, musculature and stamina to the score.  In what concerns to Ormandy 's Mathis Mahler I differ from other reviewers. The Philadelphian strings were out of this world; and constitute almost a nature 's force. The tempo is slow but effective, Ormandy gradually maintains the rhythmic pulsation preparing us through the inscrutable mystery of this emblematic score, one of the most remarkable and possibly the best entrance gate to approach Hindemith as I did. There are two interesting performances about this score that I love so much as an almost forgotten reading of Paul Kletzki with the Suise Romande and obviously the incandescent version of the own composer conducting the Berlin Philharmonic.  In the Symphonic Metamorphoses, there is just a version: Rafael Kubelik and the Chicago Symphony.
