  This album is a true and essential document that draws with absolute honesty the artistic path of this unforgettable ensamble. The work of edition is extremely intersting due includes some poems of Morrison that work out as introduction for the late song. You will watch to Morrison in high spirits more than once.   The DVD is a compilation of several concerts, but also offers you interesting interviews where you can test the real approach of the whole band and evry one of his musicans. Robby Krieger, Ray Manzarek and Jim Morrison were basically the soul of this band.  Interesting album that must be preserved for the future generations. Maybe I would have wished a deserved farewell to Morrison in his grave in Paris, but I guess sooner or later, this hearfelt rendition will be made.
