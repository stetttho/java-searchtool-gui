  From the glorious mind of George Du Maurier and the assertive direction of Archie Mayo this film to my mind constitutes one of the best films in that decade. The famous Cabinet of Caligari, Metropolis, The crowd and The Golem were  monumental masterworks which anticipated clear and metaphorically the horrible nightmare of the possible consequences of an oppressing State against the individual. Both sinister characters Caligari and Svengali employ the hypnosis device to reach their pretended objectives. Dementia, mind suggestion and intense mental domain; the irrational behavior crowd before the leader. In such short interval of fourteen years these five films were capable to foresee the awful facts derived of the manipulation of the will with perverse goals.  John Barrymore with this acting proved once more why he was one of the giants actors of those ages. Miriam Marsh is absolutely credible in this struggling picture. Fine direction of Archie Mayo and one of my favorite cult movies in any age.
