 In a not very distant future, the improvement of civilization will allow to install a camera in your brain that will allow you to watch minute after minute the suffering, horror and progressive hell around a very sick woman in the last stages of her life.  This is possibly, the most compelling, ferocious and accusing film ever made about the manipulation and non ethic excesses of the media in search of news.  Demolishing, corrosive and relentless picture that will shock you due its impacting crudeness.  Another additional triumph for this master director: Bernard Tavernier, one of the most solid French filmmakers of the last four decades. Rommy Schneider is unforgettable, Keitel and Max von Sydow shine with own light in this towering script.   Go for this without dilation.
