 The first concerto piano fhrom Johannes Brahms is one of the most difficult to play and obtain a deserved triumph. To face with such a lot of difficulties ; as pianist the score demands of you the apex of your skills; as conductor to avoid falling in a boring performing, due his length and inherent lyricism. Brahms must sound epical ; you must convince yourself and then you play under this conception. If you dont , you can sound extremely heavy ; your meditative approach is not enough: and that reminds me a couple versions of two remarkable pianists, one from Germany and the other from England; its a valid conception but it lacks emotion and rapture. Szell, Fleisher and The Cleveland orchestra gave us a unique performance filled with fire , passion and interpretative force. The result was amazing. The strings from this orchestra may be lack the musculature of Philadeplhia but the whole sound gotten by Szell and the supreme commitment given by Fleisher threw this recording to unexpected levels. In fact I just remember three other versions with similar approach; Kapell Mitropoulus from 1953, several steps before  Serkin Ormandy Philadelhia, and finally an interesting recording at ending fifties, with Ogdon Stokowski from the seventies. From beginning to end this recording is a hit. It has an internal state of tension and histamina that keeps you awaken, without loosing his deep musicality. A great achievement in the case of Fleisher and obviously for Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra. The Second Concerto is OK , but it never rreachs the level of the first and the Handel variations is played worthly. Dont miss this set!
