  Since I listened for the first time this monumental Symphony I have considered this was the seminal seed of inspiration to Gustav Mahler. Somehow this work the main ingredients of later Mahler's works.   The existential pathos, the struggling presence of the death, the unavoidable and sometimes unbearable shadow of the anguish moves on underneath the score with this obsessive and exhilarating frenzy of apparent calm. The strings and woodwinds announce this troubled First Movement superbly depicted by this director. In honor of the truth there is a comfortable sign of tense peace that reminds me to the last moments in Werther. This work is the best built Symphony, the epitome of the late Romanticism echoes : a real transient stage between the last echoes of the classic Romantic age and the new musical conceptions of Mahler. The sad noblesse of the Second Movement for instance is one of the most relevant examples of the loneliness without any faith's particle: the man and his circumstance, not in the classic desperation of Pyotr Illich Tchaikovsky, visibly immersed in another anguish level, but with the gaze placed in a real  premonition of the future.   The genuine expression of the desperation and the lack of any kind of salvation device as the faith must be exposed without merciless if you want to win with this hard to conduct work. The Third Movement is written with a sharp autumn scream . the composer is just looking behind and suddenly the vision comes back the strings work out as the mother's arms : if you don't remark this aspect you are absolutely divorced of what's going on in the deepness of Schumann.            Finally the last Movement pretends to emerge from the ashes to announce a redemption , but it's too late and you feel it. Despite the doubtless optimist song of the strings and the fierce attack of the whole orchestra: the destiny has sealed the ineluctability of the death.      Acquire this superb reading of this fundamental work of Robert Schumann.  The rest of the three Symphonies is worthable but the set shines thanks to the Fourth approach!
