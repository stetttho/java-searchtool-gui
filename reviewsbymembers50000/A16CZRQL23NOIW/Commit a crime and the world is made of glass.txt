 This devasting Emersons statement works out in this modern film noir with stunning accuracy. Ed Harris falls in love with a femme fatale (the seductive Madeleine Stowe) . She is a married woman and obviosuly all the consequences derivated from this affair will be a real elevator to the gallow. The surrounding atmosphere is dark and the dramatic nucleus of the picture with the rain as a background seems anticipate the demons that will get out from the Pandora box. Ed Harris is superb like the policeman who slow but progressively watchs how his efforts for avoid to be discovered as the cover woman become ashes.  The somber role of this double face cop played by Benicio del Toro was a hit for him. Madeleine Stowe is perfect. She is still one of the most beatiful actress in the cinema , but her shame gaze shines with amazing realism. She reminds me too much to a spanish actress called Ana Torrent (Thesis) .  Its hard  to forget the long tradition of the film noir in the american cinema . The two most remarkable triumphs given in the eighties were Body Heat and The Black Widow. However, the director John Bailey assumed the challenge and won the match with this film. Excelent atmosphere though I feel too much enlightment in certain sequences. If not for that detail, I would give this film five stars.
