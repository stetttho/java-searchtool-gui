   Based on a Benito Perez Galdos's play , the ineffable, irreverent and caustic Spanish director  Luis Buuel made a crude portrait about the hypocrisy , the cross eyed moral, and the double speech of the good manners emphasizing his attention on a fervent and old aged man - Fernando Rey - who has to his charge the custody of Tristana a very beauty young woman - Catherine Deneuve -  with a serious physical limitation.  According the weather and other special convenient situations , she will be her lover or even his daughter in custody and he will have the sacred duty of keeping her isolated of the other men who just dare pretend her .  But fortunately a painter - Franco Nero - will appear to break the rotten moral and stupid roles of that nasty and devoted man who goes to Church every Sunday as the beloved father, of course.  This film is simply overwhelming and constitutes one of the most prodigious and fascinating psychological study but also sociological exploration of the human being in the Spain of those days and the human nature too.  Superb gem. A must see!
