  Enrique Granados piano music is still a wasteland for  a great number of people who love the music. Understandably this fact has prevailed until perhaps the arly seventies when finally the interest for  Albeniz and de Falla's  music have expanded and allowed to get close to the moods of this particular composer.  There are so much gems you can imagine if you make the effort.   Try it and you will be amazed.   Dosse is marvelous with these performances. Absoluteluy inmersed in Granados mood.
