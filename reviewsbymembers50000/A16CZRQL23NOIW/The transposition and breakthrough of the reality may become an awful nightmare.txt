 What would it happen if you break the neck to logic, conventional social principles set out of context and play with the sense of the words meaning? What if you bet to exchange certain components of our quotidian way of thinking, becoming a messy puzzle? How amount of truth are you able to bear?    That far premise that enlightened the mind of Luis Buuel in The exterminating angel, reappears with major vigor, irreverence and petulance. This genial Spanish filmmaker simply disorders the rules that govern our real world through dreamy, cynical and surrealistic vignettes, where the Status Quo can be demolished with a simple lash of fingers. Costumes, moral, ancestral codes, elemental logic, pattern behaviors are broken with impeccable cold blood, perhaps to intend us to convince us we can live another different world , just rearranging the basis that support the enormous building of our normal behavior.         The initial shot comes from a Goya  painting and finalizes with the astonishing feared ostrich trying to hide from us in the zoo.   Knowing the heavy burden of surrealism that always accompanied Don Luis, and being perhaps the lonely Ambassador in the Sixties of that discolored flag, many elements might escape your solid and logic perception, just turn around it and think it over.  A glorious imagination ` s triumph.
