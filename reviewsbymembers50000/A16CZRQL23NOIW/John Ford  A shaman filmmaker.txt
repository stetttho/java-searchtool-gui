 The exceptional grandness and the singularity of his genius resides in that unique approach dressed with mythical breath, which origins hi Westerns remains in our memory with such intensity level. He knew as any other filmmaker the Western constitutes the true American Mythology, and that is why his characters are always depicted with this certain mystery 's aura. They do not seem to obey exactly the rules of the establishment, but seem to merge with the inner passion and natural commitment, that in certain moments may agree with the state of things but not always fit; there is something out of context in their attitudes. They fight following their own codes.   This is a clear example: Fonda like Icarus decides to confront the Apaches, despite John Wayne 's wisdom so typical of Athena 's prudence who advises not to make it; once more face the mature wisdom and the irreverent epic mood, which eventually will clash with the expected consequences.   An admirable saga and the First part of his Trilogy.
