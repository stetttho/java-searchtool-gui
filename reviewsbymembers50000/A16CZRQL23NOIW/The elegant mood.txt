 Music like other fields, has its fads. The "arpeggione" would be in the vocabulary of the most eminent musicologist were it not for the lovely Sonata in A minor penned for Schubert. Indeed, represents the only composition Schubert ever wrote for the cello or any related instrument. The powerful melodic invention, as well as the use of the musical color with that characteristic typical tunes of  the pastoral Vienna.         I loved this work from the first time I listened in that pocket theater in 1972 In Caracas. The harmonic colored and the sense of he span is present along this legendary performance.   Daniel Schafran is a very talented and passionate soloist; who has achieved persoanl achievements as Shostakovich Cello Sonata in the middle sixties.  Recommended without reserves.
