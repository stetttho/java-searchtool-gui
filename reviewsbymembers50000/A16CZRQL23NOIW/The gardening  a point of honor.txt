 From time to time the British Cinema shows us treasured pictures where the superb inventiveness of solid and original script shake hands with the British scent and the glamorous visual seduction.  It `s useless to talk about the prestigious level of acting. The most notable feature of this engaging movie resides precisely in the ambiguity of their characters. It is far to be a lineal story; you may realize every one of them is absolutely persuaded and even convinced of the secure triumph in this unbalanced handicap at the moment to establish originality and presence.

Helen Mirren once more, steals the show, Clive Owen is superb and Natasha Little is a young promise to take into account in next films. Do not forget her  name.
