 Fascinating portrait about a man whose biological rhythm presents an unusual contrast .   Robin Williams in one his finest performances, makes a sensible performance about who enjoys every day of his life with major intensity than most of us. His terrible illness will avoid the necessary and required time to experience and enjoy every stage of the human life.  This is the most touching film of Coppola.
