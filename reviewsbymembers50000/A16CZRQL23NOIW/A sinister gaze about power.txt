 Orson Welles returns once more (after his previous and winner and acclaimed work in Cannes Othello) about the fascinating and passionate theme : the power and its extreme consequences. An industrial magnate hides a terrible familiar secret and beyond that unpleasant connections with the underworld.  A magnificent journey throughout the disturbing power's web, seen under Welles vision and totally immersed in the most genuine spirit of the Film Noir by then.  Fascinating script, arresting use of lights and shadows and a fabulous cast complete the circle of this powerful movie that revaluates itself through the years.
