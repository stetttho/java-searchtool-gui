  From the initial shots of this picture you can feel the sincere attitude of not letting  fold by the twists of fate. Two brothers fighting even harder than his father did it when died fighting against the fire. They never will get back and reach their goals with this proposal. Going to the last consequences.  Interesting film even for all those Industrial Engineering and firemen aspirants: the film underneath the conventional premises explores many interesting aspects of the combustion process, few times focused in previous films. Kurt Russell to my mind has never been in the screen like this time. He played an absolute role and if I may I would say this was the most celebrated role of his career. He became in a model, leaving behind the rest of the cast as actors. That was the excellence of his performance.  Obviously Howard made a very well film , superbly built and detailed with shocking scenes loaded of dramatic realism. Jennifer Jason Leigh made the worst performance in her career, absolute anodyne and no transcendent. I don't know what it was going on with her in this role but you feel a certain disengagement with her role.
