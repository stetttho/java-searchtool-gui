 I must confess I am not a Brendel fan , but I must recognize the only composer he plays with interesting approach to my taste is Schubert and certain pieces . His Wanderer Fantasie is the best of the set . And notice we are talking Brendel in his thirties , There are best Musical moments Paul Badura Skoda and Schnabel. The Fantasie at four hands with Schiff is by far too much better . And the set of Impromptus has in Artur Schnabel, Edwin Fisher, Dinu Lipatti and Badura Skoda better performers. Only recommendable for Brendel fans.
