 Franz is a man with penal antecedents for overtaking and and go-between . He refuses to enlist to a crime syndicate because prefers acting by himself. He lives with Joanna a naf prostitute who expects living with a bourgeois home . Bruno - the chief of the syndicate- will live with them and eventually will try to convince Franz to join with them . After several overtakes , the day comes ; Joanna calls the police and finally Bruno dies and Joanna and Franz will escape . This Op. 1 of Fassbinder is a clear tribute to the film noir . In this film Fassbinder seems to emphasize the individuality above all the honor codes established previously in the mob . We are in the seventies and the things change with all the implications which this decision involves. There are certain edition problems in the film (Remember Fassbinder is just twenty three years old) but the script is very incisive and direct .
