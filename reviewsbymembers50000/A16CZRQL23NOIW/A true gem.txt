 The wild bunch is areal masterpiece.The deep ideas involved in this film makes it not only just a cult movie, but even it`s absolutely necesary watching to understand why the western is the own mythology of the northamercan spirit. Holden, Borgnne and Ryan are in their best. The angles of shooting, the photograph, the grafic language and that epic final makes that film probably the most original western movie in the story of the cinema.
