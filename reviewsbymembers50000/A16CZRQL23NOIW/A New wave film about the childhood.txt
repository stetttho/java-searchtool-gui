 I do not believe in children ingenuity . They do not know it . This bitter but sensate affirmation belongs to Gustav Mahler . And so this film, with the astonishing imagination of Louis Malle -a promising and famed director by then with previous notable works such Elevator to the gallows and The lovers-   literally dives in an unknown ocean : adult's world satire (but without the bitterness of the 400 blows this giant film of Francois Truffaut filmed just two years before) through the eyes of a child with the New Wave condiment . The result was a joyous film . An exceedingly funny picture , delicate, outrageous , vulgar nightmarish way. From start to finish a winner film .  And please realize and make an imaginative journey : this film clearly precedes to Amelie in its giocoso and joy of living spirit . Do not you ?
