 A man is wounded in his head. His memory remains in zero atmosphere and the disyunctive is overclear: the challenge waits no more; the police has to resolve the case but needs too much information that only can be given if he recovers from this brutal attack. Reinhard Hauff is a real master film maker. Every one of his films are loaded with that existential anguish, so difficult to understand just today sixteen years after the Fall of the Wall. But in those desperate years in the middle of the terrible presence of the Baader Meinkopf,1 the terrorism in Germany was extremely hot. Just remember the painful memories of 1972 Munich, and the frenzy around the whole German population in that decade. Somehow the seventies meant as any other decade previous or later the real awakening and true explosion of controled demmons in search for an answer. If not, go for the titles of Wenders, Fassbinder,Margaret von Trotta, Alexander Kluge and Wolker Schondlorff to realize how the depressed spirit and hopeless soul of the german people was.  If you get a decisive film of Hauff of 1975 Franz Blum, try to get it because to my mind this is his true masterpiece. And since Hauff is a master, his minor artworks are above the average by far. Now it is time to revisit and explore the great and still unknown German filmography of those ages.
