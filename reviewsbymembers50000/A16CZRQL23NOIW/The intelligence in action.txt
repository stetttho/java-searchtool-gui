 Taking a certain advantage about the well expected humane male condition , a tough , sassy working girl tries to get her award in the middle of this state of things . Excellent dramatic comedy around the exploitation of the woman in Japan. A critic said once an interesting point of view about Mizoguchi presence in Japan ; he compared him with Bch while Kurosawa was associated with Beethoven. And if I may Mizoguchi is to me the visual equivalent to Tiziano . Kenji was always worried for the sense injustice and cruelty exerted over the woman in Japan . A good proportion of his films shows us over and over this unfortunate state of things in his homeland .  Try and get close to Mizoguchi universe .  You will be shocked and engaged immediately for his craft.
