 This film is unique in all the american filmography. You may exhibit several examples about the question of the loneliness , like Sunset boulevard, Midnight cowboy, the naked kiss or even Butterfield 8. These films are worthy. But no film before and even thirty six years (with the exceptions of Paris Texas and American beauty) had approached the question in just so brutally dramatic, showing the naked soul of a mature man in a suden decadence. Perry had the Midas touch when the story goes through all the swimming pool of Kentucky.  An intimate portrayal,a collage that describes like a few, the roughness, the cruelty the indifference of the human condition around a man who lost his center, his eaning for living, and surviving just by feeding his memories. His ancient friends, his old love affairs , show us with no mercy the unboreble loneliness of this man who was once and now hes just a post card human, a colection piece , a lost specimen from an old tale. Lancaster gives us an unforgettable performing. I{m absolutely sure that the character of Lancaster in Atlantic city, was so easy to Burt, due he applied the emotive memory, apart his notable skills. The swimmer is a cult movie. Its a acid view about a society who doesnt accept the failure, which runs from a lonely man who doesnt have to say excepts his memories. Do you remember the sequence when he tries to get into the swimming pool in which he must to clean his feet before to get in? . The metaphor is so absorbing and fascinating that you can not forget easily. And the ending is very close to a horror film. Please, dont forget this ending and try to tie with the end of 21 grams.  Momma dearest was made several years after. But in my particular opinion. Frank Perry will be remembered by this unvaluable gem of the best artistic expression american cinema.
