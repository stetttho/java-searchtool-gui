 This is a surrealist story. Vargas Llosa 's adaptation novel was taken to screen by Francisco Lombardi. An immaculate and extraordinarily capacitated captain's army is hired to install a brothel in the middle  of the Amazon jungle, hiring prostitutes under the masked term of visitors to arouse still more the febrile patriotic feature of the trop.        The recruiting process, the building of the local, the serious reports informing about the advances and the strategic planning is a ravishing tour de force comedy, plenty of ambiguities, and double sense jokes around the project. But Olga (La colombiana) stared by the exuberant and monumental Angie Cepeda will turn the plans, when a love affair spout among them. But the tragedy will remain behind the door just waiting to be invoked by dark facts the reason just can not explain.  So this tragic comedy is one of the best examples of that so well known literary current named The magic marvelous ( Lo mgico maravilloso), an imported term designed by Alejo Carpentier a Cuban writer. Go for this picture if you want to laugh about the singularities and way of thinking of  certain power statements.
