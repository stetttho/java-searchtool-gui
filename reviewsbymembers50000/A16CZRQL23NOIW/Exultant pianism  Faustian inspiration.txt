 The monumental Sonata No. 2 is possibly the most complete work of this genre emerged from Russia until this date. It possesses that effluvium and nostalgic gaze,contemplative lyricism and arresting expression that invades the listener from the first bars. Involved in the classical Romantic heritage, with a strong Lisztian influence and the majestic and elusive introspection so typical of Robert Schumann.   The celebrated Non allegro: Lento expresses this sad melodic flight where the meditation and farewell sense seems to shake hands. What it seduces me from this version is its maidenly approach; Horowitz understands the core of the work as anyone else, given this similar condition of exiled Soviet citizen and explores with acuteness and refined eloquence the inner folds, those enigmatic pianissimos and sudden outbursts of fevered poetry make of this performance the most genuine and best achieved versions that I have ever listened never before.  The Third Piano Concerto despite the fact is not my first choice is incandescent and superbly phrased. In addition we have Reiner making a sharp collaboration and showing the Russian mood underlined beneath the score. Horowitz unexplainable does not play the Diabolic Cadenza and that 's probably one the disillusioned aspects that I dislike; this Cadenza is a true firewall that  stigmatizes and accents still more the febrile passion and enraptured flame of this monumental score.   In this sense no other pianist in the history has been able to reach the level of the unsurpassed, resplendent and delirious performance that William Kapell did it in 1952 in a live Concert pitifully non available in CD, due it was a live register, that I could get it thanks to a friend of mine who got a copy in Washington of a hard fan of William in 1988. Since I listened this version, became automatically in the parameter per excellence at the moment to compare some other recording.
