 Undoubtly this version has the Glenn Gould 's signature . But if you think about the circunstances that surrounded this last recording , the fact that The Goldberg Variations  are so associated , you would consider this recording as a farewell of this canadian artist . Since its release this performing hasreceived many critics . Firts at all I would recommend you to watch the Video (available in Laser Disc and CD) . Obviously the version doesn't have the young fiercy of the 1955 , but it owns wisdom and rapture sense . The slow tempos involve us in a most reflexive mood and provides us of a new vision . You may agree or not with this challenge performance but it 's undeniable its deep interpretative values .
