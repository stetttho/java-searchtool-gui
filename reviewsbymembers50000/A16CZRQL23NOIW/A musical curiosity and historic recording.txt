 Completed in March 1911 and conducted its first performance in a concert of his compositions given in Helsinski on 3 April that year, this work appears as the most introspective and disjoining at first glance.   In 1908 in Berlin Sibelius was operated for throat cancer. But though the operation was successful, he lived in constant fear of he tumor recurring and from 1908 and 1913 and the shadow of the death lay over his life, it results evident these fears can be fel through the work.   The fiords and forests of his birthplace suggest us menacing phantoms and it may well considered a tragic Pastoral , like if the forces of the nature would mourn his sorrow.  Sibelius was driven to create musical techniques that articulate undoubtedly a clear advance respect his previous Symphonies, a new found thoughtfulness and seriousness.   Curiously this surprising work seem to presage the dark clouds of war above Europe 's skies and in the same way that Carl Nielsen and Claude Debussy this was the final result of his standpoint about it. The work 's power and intensity.  Even Toscanini can not be considered a master champion in what it concerns to Sibelius, his impetuous style worked out specially in these selected works.   I must appoint my favorite three versions are: one recorded in the middle Fifties with Tomas Beecham, a magnificent and recently achievement of Segerstam and finally Kajanus.  Lemminkinnen 's return comes to Toscanini as ring to finger. It possesses that epic breath so loved by the Italian master. Kousevitzky , Tomas Jensen, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Horst Stein have given us excellent readings of this page too.  Respect Swan of Tuonela forget about it: Anthony Collins remains alone in the Pantheon.
