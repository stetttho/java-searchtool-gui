 Barbet Schroeder is a very talented director. His main concerns have always been related with the dark side of the human soul.   This singular movie is a very careful analysis of the human psyche seen under a prism. Schroeder would have minutely followed the traces of "The crime considered as one of the finest arts" , the smart essay of Thomas de Quincey. Hitchcock, certainly inspired himself to make his famous movie: "The Rope".  But if you analyze the smart script with major intensity, you will find clever clues, like the first shot, in that enraptured camera movement that came into the hall window reminds us to: Psycho.  But there is still more, the well known mechanism of oppression and subjection between this weird couple is expressed with genuine fineness through expressive narrative ellipsis.  On the other hand we have to Sandra Bullock' s character who decides to investigate them through the night with a camera; which suggests us a modern Peeping Tom; I mean: James Stewart's role in "The rear window".  And finally we have the climatic sequence is another glorious tribute to "Vertigo". If you take into account all these hidden traces you will have to admit only Schroeder avoided this thriller had reached so higher peaks.   Perhaps, the only default of the movie resides in the limited scale of psychological grimaces of Sandra Bullock, but this is a minor failure in this intelligently unusual thriller.
