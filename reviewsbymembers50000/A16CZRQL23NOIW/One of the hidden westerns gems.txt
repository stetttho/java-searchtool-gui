 Cain and Abel once more work out for this western. Stewart works for the railroad and his brother belongs to a gang which is planning to rob train payroll.  This story turns around the ancestral myth of two brothers who live exactly opposite proposals.  Stewart made a credible role and Audie Murpphy is unforgettable too with this plot. Believe or not this western - to me - has been underestimated, but it well deserves for you a sight. May be you 'll be surprised.     The climax is superb and towering.
