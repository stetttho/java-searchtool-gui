  I guess there would not be any doubt that the British humor was never so well articulated and expressed in this country. In the fifties U.K. reached the peak in the comedy genre. It would be said that the Pos War catharsis worked out so well that suddenly the British understood and absorbed once more the War consequences, faster than any other country. While the American Cinema was in a self exploration of the emotional state and analytical introspection, this side of the Atlantic simply eluded that position and decided to turn on the page.  Charles Laughton in an outstanding performance is a very worried father by her oldest daughter's singleness. But the choice is not so easy he is owner of a little enterprise and wants as all good father to trespass his patrimony to the best candidate. But you know how it is: the father and the son have always different perspectives. The smart dialogues and funny situations will lead to Laughton to understand at last, he was wrong, after all. The cast is simply overwhelming and glorious Lean's  camera will invite you to a delightful comedy plenty of intelligence and good taste humor. A classic. Excellent performances of Brenda De Vance and John Mills.
