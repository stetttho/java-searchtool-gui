 "As certain as the pain payment I receive is inferior respect the value of my sublime work, is also that my name will take across to posterity as the one of the greatest genius of the painting."    El Greco is one of the most controversial, admired and weird figures in the story of the plastic arts. From Crete, he takes across to the Renaissance Italy; he will meet Ticiano; and eventually with Tintoretto, being in contact with Miguel Angel.  This brief but fruitful influence will constitute for him the basic training to get start his primary genius.  His particular style, consisting in the use of stylized figures to remark the spiritual tension, the use of cold colors (blue, green, metallic gray and a very clear yellow) the use of the human masses, volumes and colors to underline dramatic aspects.  To my mind, El Greco' s portentous dimension must be seen over and over again, to understand even more similar approaches in the Gothic art and with minor exuberance in the Byzantine art. The employment of lengthened figures was even more important than the same reality, because it was equivalent to a plastic language, able to express spiritual values with genuine grandness.    The text is relevant because it explores with minuteness fundamental, determining and clever aspects of this genius.  Go for it without dilation.
