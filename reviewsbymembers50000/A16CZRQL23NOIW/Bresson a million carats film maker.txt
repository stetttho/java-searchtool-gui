 Helene (Maria Casares)is a passionate but also a cool woman who falls in love with Bernard . The sad day arrives when Bernard confess her he no longer loves her. This is the starting point of a careful revenge from the inner depths from her soul against Labourdette and her mother. The script is overknown. But in hands of Bresson it became in another masterpiece in his career. Bresson was a man concerned around the huge possibilities of visual expressions; so you may consider all his films as mude films with unnecesary subtitles. Bresson belongs to a reduced category of giants filmakers such as Dryer, Murnau or Renoir but gifted of poetic atmosphere since the opening sequences of any of his previous or next films. If you 're really interested in his filmography you'll find out such hidden treasures that you'll convince by yourself that Bresson is not  only enoughly known even today, but he's a genius in the caleidoscopic sense of the word. The minimalism is a concept that I disagree in Bresson's case. His spiritual concerns hardly may be entitled ; the genius is always contemporean and that is why he escapes to any reduced category. This film must have been a true revelation in its age. Jean Delanoy for instance won a deserved triumph in Cannes with the Pastoral Symphony, for instance , but you feel that Delanoy is in a lineal level ; he's just a storyteller without the bliss of Bresson.
