 The artistic commitment of Bela Bartok is absolutely extraordinary. His architectural sense, his deep concerns about the man and the cosmos has been never best expressed but through his Quartets Cycle. There is certain superficiality when it is affirmed he is an atonal composer. That statement is apparent; his inspiration arises from a fantastic melting of Hungarian folk music, but also a cosmic gaze. There is fullness and grandness extremely hard to put in words context. In this sense his concerns are very similar respect Bruckner; that is why the outer space inspiration certainly, does not reveal human motives and a total breakthrough with the ancient musical forms.   If you want to get close to Bartok 's world, please acquire this invaluable set, that remains just two echelons bellow both versions of Vegh Quartet; the most recent version of the Paris cycle in 1954 (My first choice, by far, from Music and Arts) and the other (Auvidis).
