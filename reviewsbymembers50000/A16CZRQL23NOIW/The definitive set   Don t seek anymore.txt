 There have been very good teams around this set. Consider Fleisher-Szell in the sixties  But the remarkable aspect is the happy combination of the craft singing piano of Wilhelm Kempff still in his sixties, with a conductor so underestimated as Paul van Kempen (died in 1955).  Van Kempen and the Berlin Philrmonic had a very close relationship in the fifties and reciprocal admiration. van Kempen a frequent director of the famous Concertgebouw of Amsterdam, could combine the sublime and powerful of the Berlin Philarmonic, who certainly lived its golden age under the unique Wilhelm Furtwangler. In these conditions , the happy meeting of this trio made it possible, a result who goes beyond all the worthy efforts that Kempff repeated a decade after but lacking expresiveness, power and sense of bliss. All the concerts are played with powerful elegance, poetry,comittment and a sense of cosmical gaze. Dont miss this set. It's unvaluable. The best results are the second, third fourth and specially the fifth concert, Emperor.
