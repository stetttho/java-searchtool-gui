 This was the best entry of a gifted filmmaker, who suddenly seemed to vanish of the screen. Alan Rudolph' s cinematography and concerns have always been influenced by European style. Refinement and touch of class shots, with seductive scripts.   This crude movie turns around the presumed murder of an abusive, drug - addicted and foulmouthed husband with a visible influence of Stephen King `s scents. On the other hand the central line of the script would seem to work out as deserved homage to Georges Cluzot `s Les Diaboliques.  Demi Moore, Glenne Headly are simply superb and made possibly theior best appearances on the screen until this date.
