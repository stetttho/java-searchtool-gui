 Many people consider this work as the best of Bond series . And to me it has very interesting and enriching issues that makes it totally apart from the others . The locations in Istanbul are gorgeous ; The presence of outstanding actors such Pedro Armendariz and Lotte Lenya the wife of Kurt Weill as the unscrupulous villain plus the ravishing and statuesque Bond girl Daniella Bianchi my third choice behind Claudine Auger and Sophie Marceu makes another winner point . Besides there is a human sight all around the film and even it runs slow paced in many moments and lacks of the accustomed kinetism, the highlight aspect to remark is its deep realism . Worthable film , though ny favorite film of Bond is Goldfinger and Thunderball this work is to me the third in the list of the great Bond series with the best Bond ever ; Sean Connery .
