 If you have ever heard of any other pianist who has made to sing the piano as Kempff did it, please let me know it. The captivating and spelling idiosyncrasy of a musician who is always seeking to express what lies bellow the surface and the will to discover and recreate the meaning of any musical work. As Wilhelm Frtwangler stated once: " I actually the true interpreter is who identifies himself with the work and who improvises it all over again...I try to communicate my vision rather than my will and I prefer the reasons of the heart than all others...When technique becomes the only purpose, we are in fact losing the sense of the form". And that's why the interpretation was not merely a matter of  execution for Kempff. W.K. has said of the piano: "No other musical instrument is as wonderful as the piano. You are alone when you play."  "The record is a creative product, a little piece of eternal life" His honesty, artistic commitment and wisdom are not exhibited as additional ornaments of his playing; but under the service of the performing. His lyricism is not preconceived, it comes from a natural consequence of his personal vision. Here you have, briefly some of the reasons that convince me Kempff musicality are so hard to find. I wish to conclude with a brilliant observation of  Frtwangler: "The art of fixing without congealing whilst respecting all hazard, this is what fascinates me. Interpreting is to conceive a music in its superior coherence."
