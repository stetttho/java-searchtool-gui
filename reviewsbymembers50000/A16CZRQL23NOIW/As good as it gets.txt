 These Berlioz overtures will never find a best performer than Munch: This Alsatian conductor had that sublime taste, eloquence, absolute domain of the thematic material, presence and hard to find conviction as any other conductor previous or later. Besides, if you have an Orchestra of such level as the Boston Symphony in those ages, how can you loose?. Magnificent performances and the best made rendition for Berlioz music.
