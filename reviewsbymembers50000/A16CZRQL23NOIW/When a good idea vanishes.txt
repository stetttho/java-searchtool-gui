 Sans souffle would be the most appropiate title to intend describe the efforts made for Godard in this film built with a very good proposal that soon it decays in the boreness due the lack of intention .  Imagine a flight without any plan . This picture describes the merciless behavior of the war , but Godard emphasizes the insanity of this social phenomen abusing of cliche .  The script is extremely flat and predictable . And really nothing happens . A dissapointed movie in the filmography of one of the New Wave pioneers who gave with this issue the first signals of lack of creativity concerned with the world in that age .
