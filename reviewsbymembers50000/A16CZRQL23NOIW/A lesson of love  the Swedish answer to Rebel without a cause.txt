 This picture finds a very young Bergman (still in his 34) dealing with a very agile and fascinating psychological portrait of a family who is passing through a very serious affective and emotional crisis. With a great doses of humor, Bergman draws an admirable semblance of the youth (through Monika `s character) as well as the identity crisis of  a married woman who must decide between the well known marriage `s traditions instead of follow her primary instincts with a renowned sculptor.  Far beyond of the pleasant ending,  mature and disturbing reflection nestle in this peculiar film, who must be watched with the considerations of those times.   Watch it and maybe you and I agree respect the fact this has been possibly the main inspiration `s source to Woody Allen `s films such as Interiors, Hannah and her sisters, Stardust memories and Husband and wives.
