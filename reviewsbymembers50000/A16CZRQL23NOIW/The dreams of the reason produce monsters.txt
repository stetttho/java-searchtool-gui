 The writer against his own ghosts and fighting day afterday with this dragon . The hallucinations and the otherness of the human being (Van Gogh , Goya , Faulkner , Rimbaud , Shakespeare , Proust) are present in this intelligent puzzle recreated with credibility and depicted with surrealistic moods . This adaptation of Stephen King novel has only a little default . It reminds us too much to The shinning . There are very common places ; the isolated writer , the loneliness , the creativity absence , the letters on the Lap top and the pages in the typewriter , the similar resources from the outerworld to our disturbed writer . That sin makes the film became very predictable .   It just to recognize the amazing role given for John Turturro (The Luzin Defense) . I missed the role played for Maria Bello to Naomi Watts , for instance .   Depp is credible in this role but the script didn't help too much in this case.
