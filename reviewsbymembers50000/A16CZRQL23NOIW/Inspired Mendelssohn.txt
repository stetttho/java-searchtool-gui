 Consider these four joined variables: Eugene Ormandy ' prodigious baton, the excel and overpowering sound of this superb Orchestra and the presence of such artistic status: the legendary Isaac Stern and his supreme tonal register, filled of imagination and splendid vibrato, giving what to my mind is the most exquisite Mendelssohn ever recorded and finally the succesful contribution of this one thousand carats pianist: Rudolf Serkin.  I must insist in the fact both soloists were permamanet guests in Prades. And that, by itself, established an axiomatic enhancement in both of them. All the musicians in Prades became still better performers; there was a special and enriching atmosphere that undoubtedly permeated the psique, spirit and bliss of all of them.  In what Mendelssohn Piano Concertos, I shoulkd name just two other interpreters: John Ogdon and Rena Kyriakou are fundamental recordings that would integrate the reduced collection in this particular genre. Serkin plays both scores with brightness, transparency and fluency; his distinguished pianissimos and superb fingering crown these works, supported, evidently for this glorious ensemble.  In what Violin Concerto concerns, Stern illuminates the score. This hard to play piece is far to be considered just a simple and essential romantic piece. Stern goes toward the flame and core of this brilliant work with his cvharacteristic and admirable expressiveness.  This is a succesful and more than rewarding acquisition, due there are not so many performances that can include so many merits.
