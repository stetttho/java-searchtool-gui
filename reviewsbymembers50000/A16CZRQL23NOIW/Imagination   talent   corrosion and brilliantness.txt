 This is the best meeting card to refer one of those weird and artistic films . This is the second work of Greenaway , conspicious and polifacetic as his own movie.  Summer XVII . In a community of a recent rich family in the english village , a dare painter accepts to make some drawnings of the elegant mansion of Mr. Herbert . Since the husband is absent there is a condition in the contract ,in which the lady must satisfy the sexual apetites of the painter . But this will be just the sparkling point for a complex web in which the two main ladies of the house are involved ; an evil and perverse plan thought with the meticulous and mathematical perfection of a chess player . This will become in th beginning of the end for the artist . The figure of the bufon servant is employed for Greenway as the ancient shakesperian device (King Lear, for instance) , he is mude witeness who will have his painted latin pineapple. The great triumph of Peter Greenaway consists in mixing levels of interpretation or estetic facets (pictoric , musical). He shows an unusual artistic ingenius , merciless and wild . This film is important because it will work out as a reference for later works . Greenaway has added to the cinema art , new expression possibilities , in the best tradition of Visconti, Jarman and the visual magnetism of Nicholas Roeg . His films are loaded with eccentric cynicism and sometimes overtone black humor as you know . The multiple , sinister and macabre behavior of most of his characters are practically a constant in every work with the notable exception of The belly of an architect , for instance . Recommendable for you if you like this mood .
