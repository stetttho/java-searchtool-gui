  Herman Melville was an avid admirer and exhaustive reader of William Shakespeare. This fact somehow fed the febrile imagination stating an obsessive chase between the nature's forces represented by Moby Dick the assassin whale that destroyed the existence of Ahbab.   This passionate conflict overcomes by far the limits of the anecdotic character and places us in the big stage: the man against the nature; the will facing the fate. The presence of Prometheus emerges clearly in this singular challenge.  Visually stunning, admirably played by Peck in one of his most smouldering performances ever made. And the additional presence of Orson Welles as the preacher in the first third of the picture and the masterful and inspired direction of John Huston make of this one of my 200 cult movies in any age.     Another point to remark resides in the fact this movie was chosen as an example of Leadership in the reviewed book: Movies for Leaders with these other films: Hoosiers, Bridge on the Kwai River and Wizard of Oz.
