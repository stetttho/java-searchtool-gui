 This artfilm shares to my mind  the honorable place of being one of the most intelligent , sublime artworks in this raising Century . Lynch made his sublime masterpiece : a glorious and tastefully film with smart ellipsis , sinuous illusions , double cross , visual riddles  and circular dreams . With this superb movie Lynch reached the artistic peak of Alain Resnais (The last year in Mariembad) and Raoul Ruiz (Three cornets for a sailor). According to Jorge Luis Borges : "The night imposes us its magic task : to unweave the universe" so we will be the ineffable witnesses  of this memorable picture and extraordinary puzzle ; a tale of disillusions , jealous , betray , infidelity , absurdity and laceration of self esteem. A troubled Canadian girl (Naomi Watts) loaded with the illusion to be an actress in Hollywood will experiment a chain of  bitter misfortunes and disappointments . In this magic shining universe her light was not enough intense to shine like a crazy diamond.. She will be displaced from her maxim dream and her only love : In other words Dante 's hell  paradigm revived in Mulholland Drive.  The revenge will be the next step which will lead to an awful climax . What will the undecipherable future dream?  It will dream the forgetfulness and the memory can be voluntary acts , and not random aggressions.
