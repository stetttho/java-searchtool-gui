 I must confess I have never been a special admire of Arrau. It' s just  a question of temperament. But that evening in Lugano, Arrau was filled with highest orders spirits. These Hndel Variations were a fortunate encounter and rejoining with the kaleidoscopic approach it must be given to this immense, exuberant and giant work. The showy pianism of Claudio Arrau appeared with that fervent energy and astonishing mystery, each one of these variations has its own specific weight and temperament. Well, he got it. With a convincing understanding of the Brahmsian mood played with inspired impulse and refinement. There are introspective and arresting moments; memorable rubatos, joy, and enrapturing passages. The final fugue is played with amazing eloquence, giving that required counterpoint without losing expressiveness and autumnal noblesse.  To my mind there are just five supreme versions that own magic, versatility, expression, character and idiosyncrasy, genuine elegance and rapport: Julius Katchen, Michael Ponti, Lincoln Mayorga, Rudolph Serkin (in Lugano, 1957) and finally this one.              The rest of the album is OK, but these Variations are by far, the jewel of the crown.  Live performance recorded in Lugano 20th May 1963.
