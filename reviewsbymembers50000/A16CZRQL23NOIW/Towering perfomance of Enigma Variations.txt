 I' acquired another edition of this version . I've always loved this work of Edward Elgar . In many ways this might be the second nathional hymn of England . This work is sublime ; has such ciclopean dignity , sublime greatness , powerful eloquence , arresting melodies and overwhelming sense of majesty . Bernstein conducted this piece as he was a english citizen . It's very hard for any serious lover music to be indifferent after listening this version . There are been great versions just before this one . Toscanini's NBC was very emotive ; Boult 's reading is interesting ; Stokowski's version is OK , but Bernstein makes literally a cosmic journey . There's a variation in which Elgar pays a beautiful tribute to Holst (The planets) . You may forget the rest of this CD if you want , and you won't miss it . In the CD item I own , there are Pomp and circunstance , extraordinary played too. To me, this recording may be part of the ten best performings all along the career of Leonard Bernstein !
