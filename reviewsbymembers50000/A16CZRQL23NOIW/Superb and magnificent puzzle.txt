 Alfred Hitchock never created emblematic characters . For instance , an adultery commited for the wife of the intellectual murderer is the starting point to the story . Through the film runs we tend to forget that initial premise and we defend the victim . The same mechanism is used in Psycho or Strangers in a train . The remarkable point is interesting since it demonstrates that nobody is innocent , but less guilty  .  Ray Milland is superb as the cheated husband , he will build a complex plan to convince and ancient schoolmate who actually is not a winner , showing him a picture from his school times (where we see once more to Hitchock in this , clear , funny and very often device from the suspense master)and persuades to him to murder his own wife . All in theory seems to work out in a perfect level , but as always the human factor appears struggling the neck to the anticipated destiny. Grace Kelly is extraordinary and to me , she never was best in any other Hitchcock film . The movie is loaded with ironical bits and the typical english clever humor .  And once the camera working around the hall in almost the eighty per cent of the film is another remarkable aspct to celebrate . The close up resource is perfect . Hitchock was always a master in this sense .  One of my timeless favorites .
