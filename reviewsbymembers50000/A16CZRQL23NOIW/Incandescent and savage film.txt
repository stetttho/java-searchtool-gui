 The tension state and the indignation will involve you and all your senses with this unfair process when an innocent Joseph Condon and his father are blamed of a murder they did not commit .  based on real facts and designed with superb artistic and art direction and a kinetic script , the film is simply ravishing . Emma Thompsom makes an unforgettable role and Daniel Day Lewis confirming his masterful magnetism and his charismatic presence , and showing his Academy Award was not a random fact . Jim Sheridan has made until now a real masterpiece ; and the Hollywood attitude with this film was another unforgiven mistake . But the time which is the supreme judge will put in order that unhappy decision . Remember for instance , Citizen Kane against The grapes of wrath , Dr. Strangelove against My fair Lady or the Judgemnent at Nuremberg to name just a few .  A classic film!
