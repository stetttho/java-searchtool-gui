 This Denver rock quartet , Sugarloaf broke the walls with his emblematic theme Green eyed lady in August 1972 . His leader Jerry Corbeta infused an original sound combining the guitars and the organ in a special blend . Tongue in cheek was another hit . But you will be amazed when you listen that interesting fusion with the piece Bach doors /Chest fever which works out such as a musical bridge between the well known organ work Toccata and Fugue in  D Minor and impressive variations to chest fever . Perhaps the band lacked of creative breath or in the best of the cases could not survive to the Disco Music invasion .  This was a difficult decision for many bands . Guess Who , Credence and other easy watching ensembles preferred to abandon the ship instead of keeping against wind and tide as Chicago or the Bee Gees could make it; though that step signified a turn financially clever but musically weakened them .  It was the question between surviving or disappear. Nevertheless this band is a must have for you in case you want to know the different options chosen for one of the most interesting bands who cultivated the rock with interesting turns to jazz sounds .
