 Measure by measure this album -to my mind- occupies a predominant place among the twelve greatest live rock albums ever recorded. The other eleven would be -without any specific order-: How the west was won , Made in Japan , Live at Leeds , Hendrix in Woodstock , Uriah Heep live , Humble pie performance ,Iron Butterfly live , Allman Brothers in Fillmore, Pink Floyd in Pompey , Woodstock and Cream live .   The ravishing moods of all the band headed for that monster musician and living legend Ian Anderson are present in this historic performing . Consider Aqualung the best version ever recorded by them since its release , Thick is a brick is superb ; and so A new day yesterday , Crossed eyed Mary , Songs from the wood , Haunting girl ; Minister in the gallery or Too old to rock' n' roll. Thnks to Ian Anderson , Martin Barre, john Evan , Barriemore Barlow , David Palmer and John Glasscock for this album with out time and obviously a classic among the classics albums in the rock story . The transfer was glorious fortunately for that generation and the new listeners who will never be able to deny the virtues of that icon band of the last sixties which so many glories and good moments offered us .
