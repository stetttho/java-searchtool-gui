 Who can deny the wonderful edition process and set up in this picture ? But seen in sincere perspective the film seems to be a video clip of long duration. The presence of the ever-smiling and inexpressive Tom Cruise with his partner Kelly Mc Gillis reveals an absolute presence of sexual chemistry . It is a film without dramatic structure and you feel the rest of the dialogue is forced to show the aerial gun fights and the overwhelming acrobatic scenes to satisfy a furious audience in that decade hunger for the magic of the Video Clips. However Anthony Edwards stole the show  , Val Kilmer and Meg Ryan in their ascending careers .  Do not search a profound drama . It is absent . But it is a feast for your senses . Good entertainment for the family.
