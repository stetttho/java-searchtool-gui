 The captivating conveyance of this outstanding conductor elevates the rank of the performances, the London Symphony and the London Philharmonic are by definition, two superb ensembles. It is not easy to obtain so rewarding works, because Mr. Ozawa simply is out of comparing. The musical stature of Walter Weller has not appreciated yet in his fair dimension, by unknown reasons. He is beloved widely in England but unexplainably in the rest of the world.    With these notable exceptions, this album deserves a special honor seat in your library. The first Symphony OP. 25, well known as Classical Symphony finds in Sergei Koussevitzski, an unbeatable performance, since its first release this version has became a reference standard. There' s a notable recording (not released in CD format yet) of Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra. The Fifth Symphony under Antal Dorati's conduction is another historical issue. And finally there is a memorable performance of Jean Martinon conducting the Chicago Symphony.  So if you can get all my recommendations plus this set you don' t have to worry for finding any other performances in the market.  The sound is excellent and the Second, Third and Sixth are probably the most idiomatic readings that I know until this date. Go for this rewarding set.
