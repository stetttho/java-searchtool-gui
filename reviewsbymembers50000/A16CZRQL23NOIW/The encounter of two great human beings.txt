 Leopold Stokowski 's  warmth association with Rachmaninoff was evident. They performed together more than twenty fives times in concert and on recordings, and the conductor entrusted Stokowski with the premiere of four major works, as well as the first American performance of "The Bells".  This composition is the perfect evidence about the composer 's ability to ingenuously develop small amount of thematic material. There is visible inspiration based on the Russian Orthodox chant; and that should n' t surprise us; Tchaikovsky had previously employed in many works (The famous 1812 Overture). The premiere of this work found to Leopold conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra on November 6, 1936.         In this sense it is very difficult to find another example of major commitment and absolute domain of the thematic material. Maybe Walter - Mahler get close to this unusual encounter.   This recording is simply extraordinary. Stokowski knew to extract the maximum expressive possibilities of this Orchestra, with whom would make another superb performance of Sibelius ` First in 1977.   Rachmaninoff died on March 28, 1943. And the most eloquent and touching eulogies was precisely from this distinguished conductor: "The musical personality of Rachmaninoff is unique. His music expresses the intensity and nostalgia, the vitality and the vivid coloring, the dramatic rhythm of the Slavic art. The emotional and imaginative side of his music is rich in the mysterious and the intangible- those remote moods of the spirit which carry us far from everyday life and open for us visions of the heart which completely transforms our existence."
