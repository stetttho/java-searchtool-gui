 Since I had the opportunity to watch this album in a very famous and renowned store in New York in May 1998, I couldn't believe what splendid engineering effort, to remaster this sound of these recordings, was made for this new generation. This record is a must and a real tresured album. It presents to the great Ferrucio Busoni playing a cosmic Chaconne and a very personal Liszt. I found his Chopin extremely intellectual and less expressive.  Nevertheless, this CD is an important historical reference. Don't miss it under any circumstance!
