 In those sorrowful of racial segregation, this film was finally the final result of a significtaive number of previous works concerned with this issue.   Norman Jewison directed this compelling and intriguing plot around a homicide and a black detective who will undertake a careful analysis around this dark murder.  Rod Steiger as the sheriff of that little village is flawless. There are not fissures along the way and the suspense runs paralel the horrid drama.    Recommended without any restriction.
