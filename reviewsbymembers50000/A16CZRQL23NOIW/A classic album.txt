 You will find to Joe Cocker in the peak of his powers . With that unmistakeable and grasping voice , and incredible energy loaded in every track.  Leon Russell- that living legend - support in the keyboards, the rhytmic section and the chords were absolutely outstanding . Consider the Letter , Feeling alright , She came in through ... , Delta Lady or Cry me a river and listen them again in studio version . Once more you will notice that the great majority of the rock artists adcquired an additional histamine and powerful resource inspiring to perform and Joe got to me his masterpiece album . Search the extraordinary and unbeatable version of Rita Coolidge singing Superstar.This performance is by far, much better than the Carpenters version , it inner mood is so much introspective , warm and deep. An album without any hole . A timeless classic specially recommended for Cocker hard fans and for all those people who are reall interested in knowing what is going on in the two golden rock and roll ages : the sixties and the seventies .
