 Witold Malcuzynski decided to live in Venezuela in the last stage of his life. And I watched him at least a dozen times. He was an integral artist, devoted and consecrated around every little musical phrase. I still remember his notable contribution in 1970 with motive of the second centenary of Beethoven all around the world.   His Chopin possessed that telluric expression, accompanied for those thunderous fortissimos in the Polonaises. His art still will remain among all of us, as well as the generations to come. At least this is my sincere hope.
