 Hendrix made an overwhelming work.  A rock gem, an original album , rich in rhytms, genial songs , gifted with a future vision that still shocks even the youngest generation. For those all you who are really interested in the rock as culture, for those who want to know what a masterpiece means, and above all for those who still believe the rock is unable to produce immortal treasures. This album is the proof. A must in your collection.
