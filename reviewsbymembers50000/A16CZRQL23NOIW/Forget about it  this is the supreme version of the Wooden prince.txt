 Every time a Hungarian conductor took the baton to play Bartok some sparkling and cosmic breath seems to crop out from the entrails of the director. The complex dissonances are even major; the expressiveness takes its place in the middle of these percussive and incisive sounds to enhance even more the roughness and robustness of this febrile imagination. Composed after WW1 (118-1919), Bartok writes as result of Count Mikls Bnffy, Budapest Opera 's intendant, vast dramatic score that will make of a simple fairytale, a psychological tragedy.   It seems to be obvious the war wounds influenced on him; since that composition was no more nor less a Divertimento in a painful portrait, invaded for macabre spell and sharp sorrow.      Dorati played a towering and convincing performance remarking as anyone else, the chromatic density  and tense and hallucinating atmosphere that surrounds the score.   In which it concerns with Music for strings, percussion and celesta, we have serious contenders: Dorati is simply superb in this interpretation. What it really distinguishes to these gifted conductors of the past was the absence of restrictions around the score. If the sound was not pleasant, lacked of total importance, because the expression weighed still more. There was much wildness and fierceness if you want, at the moment of playing. Dionysian mood dominated the Apollonian approach. Somehow this characteristic allowed to transmit the cathartic tension of the Greek theater; to sublimate the soul through the catastrophe.  So, you should acquire as soon as you can these legendary recordings, because the tendency to play Bartok has bee polishing the dissonances and reducing the intensity of the sonorous mass; I mean distilling the essence through the crucible of these aseptic modern times.   Historical performances that surely won `t be played so vividly never more!
