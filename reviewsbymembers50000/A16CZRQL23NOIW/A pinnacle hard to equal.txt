 Tureck owns such an immediate persuasive and engaging sound. Her distinctive playing is clear, eloquent and highly expressive. Her fingering is impeccable, impregnated with bright phrasing that seems arise from the deepest places of her immaculate soul and clarity of musical thinking. The brevity is the soul of the engine and the austerity in Bach allows us to admire the grandness and reach of his vision, without ornaments and major pretensions.   When you listen Tureck you will be immediately carried to another level of interpretation and musical conception. Pitifully this interpretative approach seems to be dated in these times where the Apollonian refinement and the astonishing would seem to prevail above the expression and singularity. And this a very bad symptom, because in music you can not play or sound in search of the gallery 's applause, you must to establish a language and a style within your soul, mind and heart, so forget about to pursue the pleasant atmosphere.   Bach is sublime and profound, anyone of the later styles as Baroque, Romantic or Classic refinement fit on him.   That is why Tureck sound is so enrapturing and absorbing. She connects immediately with the composer vanishing herself along the process.   Go for this record. You will be eternally rewarded with this genius of the keyboard.
