 At last from the East a new star has arisen: Uchida owns all the demanded requisites to triumph in this difficult career. She has a magnificent color sense and reminds me to Guiomar Novaes in this aspect, besides she has a very clean phrasing with an outstanding cantabile line that reminds us to Edwin Fisher and also a superior technique of the highest caliber. Even she is still in his early ages, I think her future is simply unlimited: somehow she has filled a sensible emptiness concerning with the raising stars of the instrument. Joao Maria Pires is sublime but Uchida is much younger and I feel she is growing up so fast but without frenzy. She has selected a fundamental repertoire and I really expect for her a colossal and convincing Schumann and also expect for her Bach. Think in the Goldberg Variations, for instance.  You have to recognize the enormous difficult to any serious keyboard player to play this Schubert's Sonata and win with that performance. And even if Uchida didn't reach the peak of Richter or Schnabel, for instance, I guess the time, and the expected maturity to play this work, that easily you may consider one of the five Giants pieces in all the pianistic repertoire. But Uchida surely must have read this famous Faustus' statement: I love whose who pretend the impossible!   My best wishes for Mrs. Uchida who may be considered from now a piano legend.
