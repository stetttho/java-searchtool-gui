 This film was the supreme test to Susan Sarandon and her best achievement in her career. In this role as nun she gave a masterful class of facial expression and body language , having in mind she had the camera very close the ninety five per cent of the time. Furthermore I guess the real intention of this approach was accent the dramatis personae between these two souls so opposite in principles and ethics.  The rhythmic pulse is extremely peaceful making the film was a bit overlong with unnecessary overdramatic concessions. Sean Penn faced to my mind the most difficult role in his career and his slow and progressive transformation through the clever dialogues will reveal something you anticipate.  This delicate theme about the death execution had never focused with admirable realism. And may be with the honorable exception of In cold blood , the American Cinema never before reached such status level in this issue.
