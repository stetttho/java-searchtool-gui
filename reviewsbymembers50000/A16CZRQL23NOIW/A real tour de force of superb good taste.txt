 This work is towering punch . There is not a track disappointed . Schon made a glorious journey through the different moods of smooth jazz , working with Jonathan Cain . Caribbean blue may be one of the best and sensual tracks , but Boulevard of dreams , Big moon or Zanzibar . No matter what you choose because there is no waste . Excellent buy and relaxing and refreshing moments that will reward you so many times that you will make of this CD one of your favorites . It has such magnetism attraction and meticulous sense of the harmony that personally I consider it one of the best albums in the nineties decade . A winner album .
