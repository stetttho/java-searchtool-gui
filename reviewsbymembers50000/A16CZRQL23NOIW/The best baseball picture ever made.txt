 This is the masterpiece of SamWood. Never, in the story of the American Cinema we will have the chance and delight of watching a perfect film, loaded with diginity, humanity and powerful human quality of Lou Gehrig like this one.  To affirm that Gary Cooper at least deserved to share the Prize as Best Actor with James Cagney it would not sound exaggerate.  Nine nominations to the Academy Awards. And winner in just one issue: Set up.  2130 games all the honors and the final speech, radiant humor, adequate balance and kinetic pulse , a splendid cast with Teresa Wright and that Super Nova actor as Walter Breenan was make of this film one of the one hundred American films in any age.  Touching, emotive and poignant portrait. And if besides you are a Yankee fan as I do, the pleasure will be the double.   A feast to the spirit.!
