 The universe Italian of female singers in the sixties was impressive . There were literally a real supermarket choice of  pleasant voices. From the far incursion of american female singers captivated by the Mediterranean Muses such as the greatest Connie Francis the best American singer who made unforgettable and overwhelming works with that special and beauty cantabile voice  to Petula Clark (Ciao, ciao) you also should remember those names : Rita Pavone , Orieta Berti , Patty Bravo , Mina , Milva , Nada , Iva Zanicchi , Catherine Caselli, Vilma Goichi , and obviously Ornella Vanoni .  She had a special charm , personality, charisma , presence and a clinical eye and a special taste to choose the right and heartfelt song and best inspired from the bottom of her heart ; more than singing she seemed to live every song . Io ti daro'di piu ,Casa Bianca , Mi piaci , mi piaci , Cercami , Abbracciami forte , Tuuta la gente del mondo , but the her most immortal themes in ascendent order were to my mind : Una ragione di piu and curiously it doesn't appear in this album this giant theme : Un'ora sola ti vorrei . Please my appreciated reader , acquire this CD and get close to one of the most prominent and expressive voices of the Italian canzone ever .
