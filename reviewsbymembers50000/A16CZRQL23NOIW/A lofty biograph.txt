 On March 14/1879 in Ulm (Wurtenberg) a very precocious human being was born: Albert Einstein, who left from this world on April/18 1955.  Carl Seelig, famous biographer and personal friend has written until this date the best and most remarkable biography around this true icon of the modern Sciences and the universal thinking.  Pablo Casals wrote about Einstein: "Certainly, he was a great wise man, but he was still more than that. He was besides, a pillar of the human conscious in the moments in which seems to fall down so many civilizing values...With his death, is like if the world would have lost weight and a remarkable part of its own substance."  Once you have read it, you will never forget it, Einstein, like Gandhi, Picasso, Casals, Dali, Borges, Gates, Faulkner, De Gaulle, Chaplin, O Neill, Camus, Huxley, Russell, Bejart, Fonteyn, Frtwangler or Cartier Bresson (among a great list of artists and scientists) are authentic beacons in the darknes, true heralds of the intelligence and the brightness, and every one of them contributed in less or major measure to illuminate and make much more livable, the Century of the fear or the Century XX.  Go for this invaluable and rewarding reading.
