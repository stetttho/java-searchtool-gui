 Horenstein and Walter as you know are two well distinguished Mahlerian conductors. So under this perspective this Mozart looks like so expressive, bright perhaps so revitalizing, filled of joy and histamine. The point to remark here resides in the fact that after have been exploring every little corner of the Mahlerian Universe, it seems they have much major propulsion to conduct Mozart precisely emphasizing the ravishing approach.  The Jupiter is played with fast tempi, but maintaining this sense of wholeness and total conviction of supreme Dionysian eloquence.  So please, when you listen these admirable and genuine treasures, take in mind this premise because it is a very important clue to understand and calibrate the specific weight of that vision.
