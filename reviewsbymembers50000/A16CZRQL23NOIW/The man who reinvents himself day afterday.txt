 The craftsmanship of  Stevie Wonder certainly obligates us to get back on our ancient memories. In the febrile turbulence of new forms of expression in the middle of the sixties, the British invasion through the Beatles displaced Elvis from the top of the Billboard, the rock movement literally defined the feature of raising American bands. But the racial tensions penetrated the intimate feeling of the black people who literally had built a refugee in the jazz music: in this ambits they were the kings: Dizzy Gillespie, Billie Halliday, Charlie Parker, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Charles Mingus, Wes Montgomery opened the Gates and somehow narrowed the distances and the feeling and the whole world acknowledgement for their undeniable talent. The Soul music precisely derivates from a complex variety of fusions; Latin music brought Tito Puente, Mongo Santamaria and Carl Tjader were the pioneers. The Soul knows about Wilson Pickett, Smokey Robinson, Otis Reading, Diana Ross, The Supremes and Temptations, allows the creation of Motown records; and in this state of things Stevie Wonder appears and his immense talent has allowed him to survive to ten generations, he possesses this special smell to feel the fashion musical and innovate and reinventing himself to remain always fresh and renovated. I think in so many young couples who meet and fell in love with My cherry amour, for instance, married and then his sons grow up under Isn't she is lovely? Or Superstitious beats to become in teenagers to complete the cycle with Ribbon in the sky (his best and most complete song to my mind) or the famous "I just called to say I love you". He owns this touch of genius who maintains him active. Consider the cases of three remarkable singers as Edwin Star in the last sixties,  Bill Whiters in the middle seventies and Lionel Ritchie in the eighties. They were famous but belonged to a decade. That is the real difference with Wonder           His songs always transmit optimistic mood even talking about sad issues, and his undeniable charisma have become in a true legend.
