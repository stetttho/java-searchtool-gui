 The Talich Quartet is the actuality, one of the finest and captivating chamber ensembles around the world. I had the fortune to watch them in 2002 in Caracas and the whole program (that included Shostakovich Piano Quintet) was simply towering. Back to this CD, i have to remark the penetrating conviction and engaging musicality. These Mendelssohn chamber works are barely performed . Go for this album. If you love the genre of chamber works, you will find Mendelssohn in the peak of his creative powers. A true collector item.  Recommended without reserves.
