 Werner Herzog made a superb and original work with this weird complex and struggling movie .  A dwarf population live in a camp closely watched for the Status Q guardians .  Herzog is merciless when he watchs meticulously the simple fact of drinking water . All the countless to put in eloquent images a normal event which becomes a real odyssey to them . Slow but progressively the inner tension will be increasing till the expected consequences literally will become in a rebelion .  They will declare the no rules state and the mess will prevail all along the rage and wildness you can imagine . All the demons will get out from the lower depths of their soul and his cruel attack will be focused specially to all issue considered of relative height .  In the last powerful and awful sequence you will watch the sadism in its purest and sincere expression . The laughs will be the obvious sustitute for the pain . Herzog began his unorthodox artistic career with this strong visually picture in 1969 . If you are a real fan of this brilliant german director and feverish follower of his golden creative years , this would be the first one for you to watch . One of my favorite cult movies of the sixties !
