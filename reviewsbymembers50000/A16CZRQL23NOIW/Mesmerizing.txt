 It was a wonderful idea relate two concepts that seem so far in a book that explores interesting aspects in the dynamics of the management. Ive been management years after having read this book and I`ve to recognize the huge help that the text gave me. A must for those managers who still consider the mythos is just a cultural hobbie.  Wrong choice! And I hope Mr. Harding you surprise with another book related with similar items.
