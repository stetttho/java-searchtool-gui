 Listen to Mr. Gould in these French Suites is rejoinig with the life once more. His fresh and free style overpowers me every time I listen them. My favorite Suite is the sixth. But instead my choice you know that he was a very clever artist deeply honest and convinced above all about what hes playing and how that sound must be. His authoritative maestry on Bach let him several raptures accents that you always admire and hardly you find in otres performers.. The status who GG reached above all on Bach playing, has his support in the rhytm ; the rhytm is the form in movement, and thats why Bach sounds so nature and lyric in his hands. You may get in the market romantic, passionate and analytical performances of the suites; but Gould will reward you ever.
