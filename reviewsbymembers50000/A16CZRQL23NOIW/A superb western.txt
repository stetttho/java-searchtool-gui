 I have been a hard fan of the western movies. I think this genre constitutes the true American mythology. And even if you weave fine, may be you will agree with me there are very subreptitious links with the Noir Film, the surroundings may change but the stereotypes still remain; the bad guys and the mob; the corrupt sheriff and the double moral policial agent, the greed and ambition simply translate from the horses to the thirty vehicles. Consider for instance the case of John Huston; famous for Treasure of Sierra Madre and then by Maltese Falcon; or Anthony man with The Naked Spur and The Thin Man; Howard Hawks and Fritz Lang would be another two fundamental examples that would complete this statement. 3:10 at Yuma is a Western with multiple dramatic angles. We have to Delmer Davis in top form with an engaging and absorbing script, with wide references to the human behavior in the edge conditions. I will not tell you any additional information my dear reader, because I consider this is one of the best twenty westerns ever made, so to make any simple reference would be to private you from a giant film. You have to experiment by yourself this outstanding picture. Don't miss this fabulous and original film!
