 Jasha Horenstein is the only conductor that owns the great honor in being succesful performer of Bruckner and Mahler . This brief introduction is the most powerful prrof that reveals the sense of noblesse and spiritualness which allowed him to play a Bach with a sound fresh and smooth textures without falling in sound effectisms . I must confess my favorite Brandenburgo concerts are not these but Karl Haas from the fifties , but this is very worthable and exquisite recording . My reduced list of the best Brandenburgo in the market are briefly : Haas , Casals Marlboro , Muchinger , Harnoncourt and Trevor Pinnock . Anyone of them are extraordinary .
