 The musician involved in these performances belonged to the String sections of the Vienna Philarmonic and these recordings are of the middle fifties . And notice this was , perhaps the golden years of the Vienna Philarmonic . Erich Kleiber , Clemen Kraus , Wilhelm Furtwangler , Karl Bohm , Bruno Walter , Istvan Kertesz and Carl Suricht are not precisely directors you can finf easily in these actual ages . I got these recordings in vynil and I must confess that besides the enormous and complex knock out performances of Chiringilian Quartet , the nuance , the elegance and the aristocratic refinement interpretative of this ensemble is just years light from the others performers . To play these quartets demands from you to be involve for the most enchanted mood of what Schubert means : you have to be inmersed in his landerers , in his last works , the Quintet op. 163 and the posthumous sonata D. 960 . You have to emphasize the fresh air , the nuance , the lyricism , the tenderness , the arresting presence of the nature and above all to remark the freshness in the performing .  It is a real challenge for any ensamble to translate every little deatil in this sense , and unless you are member of the Italian Quartet , Lindsay Quartet , The borodin Quartet , The old ensemble Amadeus Quartet , The Buadapest String Quartet or the Vegh ensamble it seems veru hard for you to pevail in the musical memory of the listener . Acquire this whole set . It is outstanding . And adittionally you will feel the Schubert idiomatism through every one of these performings .
