 I had the enormous fortune to get two vynil records of this supreme pianist in the middle seventies and I am still amazed why his name means less than nothing for a great audience. This case is possibly unique in the music, when in the middle of his raising and promising career, he simply decided to vanish in the early twenties to re appear in 1973 with two admirable recordings.   From the first moment I listened him playing Liszt's Third Rhapsody and his own transcription about Lisz 's Sinfonic poem: Hamlet I never believed the monumental status, the powerful expressiveness , enormous musicality and above all an outstanding sense of the span he got.   No other piano artist in the music has made to sing the piano as Wilhem Kempff did it, but Nyireghihazi was very close to him; owner of a refined technique and his octaves literally will invade you and never let you indifferent.   Thanks to the efforts of notable voices and supreme authorities in this subject -as Harold Schoenberg for instance- has been possible to us , to enjoy and admire the supreme excellence of this singular pianist.  Please run and ask for this recording, because Erwin has been to my mind the greatest Hungarian pianist never born after Liszt, and one of the keyboard giants of the past Century.
