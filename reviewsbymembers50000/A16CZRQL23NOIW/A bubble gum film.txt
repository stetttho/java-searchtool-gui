 A merciless murderer highway. The birth of a expected revenge will remain for five years later . A casual encounter between two similar lives which will make join their efforts to catch the brutal killer . This is the dramatic triangle in which this film works out . Jim Caviezel gives a fine performance , very real and human since the plot has serious lows along its development . Good sequences of night crash chases . It will be forgotten very soon but it is a fresh and original entertaining  Its only sin may be the lack of deepness in the pathology of the murderer and the psychological insights with some supported flashbacks .  This film is extremely related with two previous road movies: Mad Max, and This man must die and the famous cult movie Peeping Tom.
