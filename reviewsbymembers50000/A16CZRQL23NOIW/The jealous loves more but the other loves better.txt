  This is one of my beloved films of Luis Buuel. He makes of this simple story a real tour de force between the drama and the comedy showing the sardonic side of the human being. A man obssesed by his wife, inmersed in a world so unreal , castity and all the gallery of spectres absolutely divorced about the real world and the magic of love demands.  This desperation will lead to the madness; the expecxted result for a sick behaviour; a real slap in the face of the Moral League of those times and an irreverent film which will dmand of the viewer all the possible atention.  Excellent picture and supeb description of a psychologic profile. It's useless to state that Arturo de Cordoba has been by far, the best latin american actor in the XX Century.
