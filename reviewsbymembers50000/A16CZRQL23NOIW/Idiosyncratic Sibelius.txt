 De Sabata gave a splendid even monumental reading of this inspired work from Jean Sibelius. De Sabata with the genius touch he always had gave an epic approacn to the Symphony, and produced an incandescent performance. The New York Philarmonic in his best. A directorial triumph. Dont miss this issue. A historical document.
