 The presence of Julie Stiles gives to this movie a fresh summer breeze she is gifted of an aplonene beauty , who reminds me to Anna Karina (a french actress of the sixties). The film is a rendez vous to Cinderella obviously . Since she is simple but convinced and good student of medicine who decides to work and make the grade as soon as possible in Wisconsin .  Meanwhile a TV commercial will turn the fate of this couple when the son of the king f Denmark watchs a sexy advertising about the girls of Wisconsin . The inner homagge to Shakespeare when they pronounce unforgettable lines of Romeo and Juliet give that film a respectable height and shines by itself . Certainly it won't be a classic , but it gets its purpose . It's funny , very well acted with wonderful locations and dazzling script . I really wish all the possible and future recognizement to that young , beauty , sweet , and charismatic actress who earlier than later will give too much to talk .  I had the same feeling with Sandra Bullock twelve years ago .
