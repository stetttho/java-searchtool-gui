 If you are not involved inside the gothic world of Greenaway , I recommend you to know his previous filmography . You can start with The belly of an architect , A zed and two noughts and The draughtman contract (watch my three reviews) . The crewness in his female characters ; in sucesive order ; grandmother , daughter and niece who decide murder his respective husbands according the numerical rhythm from one to one hundred is told with dazzling poetry , sugestive coldness, opressive atmosphere and merciless behavior .  I love this film and certainly this is one of the three best works of this irreverent and powerful and creative film maker : le enfant terrible of the british cinema .  Somehow , Peter Greenaway signified for U.K. in the eighties what Ken Russell meant in the seventies and Joseph Losey in the sixties and early seventies . A cult movie all the way .
