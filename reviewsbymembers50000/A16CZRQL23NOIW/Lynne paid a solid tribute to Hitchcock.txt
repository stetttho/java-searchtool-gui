 Adryan Lynne is a british director deeply interested for the emotional trouble couple and the absence of harmony in the relation , no matter your condition be . Think in 9 and 1/2  weeks, or Unfaithful (his most recent issue) . More than the 90% of his films are related with the disturbing causes and effects around the couple , and obviously this work turns around the effects than a simple weekend affair can bring a virtuosi and solvent moral patter family when he decides to enjoy the clear opportunity given for that accidental but happy life casuality. The consequences derivated of this choice will be the sparkling point of a human chase of unpredictable consequences . Lyne obviously was inspired for that ancient film of the early seventies Play Misty for me (directed by Clint Easwood) , but reforced with a major number of problems all the way . The central nucleus in both films is the fevered obsession generated for the female loneliness but told with a major sense of scope in this case and in the other hand the nuightamres of a single man with his fiancee in the case of Play Misty are nothing compared with the complex web of implications in the private life of Douglas as executive and married with man . The toimes change and the problems too . The Hitchcock touch made the difference in this particular case , and Lynne got with this work one of the most fulminating and hair raising works in the last three decades . Glenn Close made the best role of his career with this performance and Anne Archer and Douglas were extraordinary with this hyperreal script . Mesmerizing film all the way .
