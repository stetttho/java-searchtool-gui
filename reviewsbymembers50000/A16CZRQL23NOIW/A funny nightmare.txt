 Employing all the possible charm , feminism and eroticism of Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas `  trademark expression as the troubled man  , De Vito sketched a sparkling and bloody fable about a marriage who simply reached the point of no return.  Curious parable of slender significance in the most promissory decade in which the female liberation was in its peak , De Vito explores with admirable minuteness the most intimate details of the marriage , their disillusions , disappointments . There is a hidden homage to Divorce-Italian Style that old film of 1962 but with a major grade of sociological acidity .  The initial mockery is like the first movement of a Symphony : it would mean the Allegro Giocoso .   But through a well planed script the laughs diminish progressively , you and me know the things are out of control and now belong to the irrational lands composed among other ambassadors by notable names as the rage , fury , jealous , betray , fury.  The imminent tragedy spies on backstage . And that increasing tension will make of that film an admirable talent exercise and refined good taste .  To Kathleen Turner - one of the emblematic actress who joined talent and sensual attraction of the eighties-  together with Theresa Russell, Debra Winger ,  Isabelle Adjani , Isabella Rosellini , Natasha Kinski, Kelly Le Brock and Gudrun Landgrebe ,  this film was an additional personal triumph if you sum Body heat , Peggy Sue got married and Crimes of Passion .  The handkerchief 's  opening sequence is a classic !      This is the masterpiece of Danny de Vito.
