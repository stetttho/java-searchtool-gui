 Lutoslwaski 's Concerto for Orchestra is a mercurial performance, the Czech Philharmonic was truly inspired. Britten and Kalabis works are not exactly accustomed pieces of the normal repertoire: in this sense constitute a genuine curiosity; besides they are brilliantly performed.    This CD is a little sample around the figure of this notable and talented conductor, who spent amost his entire life (1908-1986)linked with his birthplace , having to face hard times. His formal conception, and architectonically built of the orchestral mass, prodigious human condition and a wide repertoire made of him a true living legend. Pitifully his countless success had not the same level of resonance on this side of the Atlantic.  This is a maginficent opportunity to get close to the craft of this gifted director.
