 A conservative software programmer -Neo- will be designed for the master hacker -Morpheus- curiously the Greek God of dream as the saver of the mankind. The dialogue among them is the key. Morpheus: The Matriz  is everywhere . It is all around us ...It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind from the truth . And the truth is the answer behind Neo' s intriguing question  is : that you are a slave. Like everyone else you were born in bondage , born into a prison that you can not smell or taste or touch . A prison for your mind . Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is . You have to see  it for yourself. And the Agent Smith says to Morpheus: ... Billions of people just living their lives ...oblivious. But I believe the human beings define reality through suffering and the misery. The perfect world was a ream that your primitiove cerebrum keep trying to wake up from. Why is why the Matrix was re-designed to this: the peak of your civilization. Ignorance is bliss says the Cypher accompanied of a smooth melody played by a harp . The film has multiple readings but to my mind you have to go to Dostoievski and the Great Inquirer - the free will- and William Blake can give us important references to understand the real state of the things in which we are immersed. This clever puzzle of images and illusions where you can be living the otherness of yourself and not your real bliss and unless you do not realize,  you can wake up easily of this dream at seventy when nothing can be done . Beware if you are not a centered people , because you can be damned to turn around a fashion style of living . This is a film intellectual stimulating.
