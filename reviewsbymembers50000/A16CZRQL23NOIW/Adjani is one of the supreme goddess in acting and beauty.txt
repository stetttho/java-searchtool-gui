 Isabelle Adjani has been blessed by the Greek Gods . She has an enormous talent , sideral beauty and radiant magnetism in screen . She has been nominated just for two roles in which the madness has been a common denominator : The story of Adelle H and this work. Adjani plays the role of a sculptress and the film tells about the slow process of decay and madness of this artist . Depardieu as Auguste Rodin is magnificent but she literally steals the show and really convinces us . Consider this superb sextet : Simone Signoret (the best french actress in the XX century) , Catherine Deneuve , Isabelle Adjani , Isabelle Hupert , Natalie Baye and Fanny Ardant and you will have the complete team of french top actress in the seventies and middle of the eighties . The film is wonderfully directed with a superb artistic direction and even best photograph .  One adittional proof the cinema is the seventh art by far .
