 You may argue there is a bit of exaggeration in this affirmation, but the explosion of musical creativity in the Sixties until the middle Seventies was fortunately accompanied for unusual voices of all the imagined timbers, tonalities and shades.  You might find all kind of hues: from the grasping voice of Janis Joplin, to slender and fascinating canorous larks such Mireille Mathieu in France, Astrud Gilberto and Elis Regina in Brazil, Orietta Berti Italy, Mary Hopkins in U.K. to an authentic constellation of raising stars in the North American firmament. This has been an unique phenomena in all the story; consider in USA - to name just a few among the most representative ones- Joan Bez, Dionne Warwick, Diana Ross, the consecrated Connie Francis, Brenda Lee and Petula Clark to the raisning and new voices such Tammy Waynete, Bobbie Gentry in the country genre, passing by Aretha Franklin, Roberta Flack and Freda Payne in the soul genre and Lulu and Jane Birkin as the new raising promises   The particular case of Dusty Springfield is worthy to mention. She had not a deep voice, but her magnetic charisma and mesmerizing presence deserved her many ovations and true acknowledgements all around the world.   Son a preacher man was his winning card. But there was a special theme that immortalized her; her heartfelt version of The Windmills of your mind, song that can be heard in the famous Soundtrack of Tomas Crown ' s Affair.  Go for this album; I 'm absolutely sure it will enchant you, in case you don 't know about her, and if you do please tell me what are you waiting for to make a journey to your past?
