 This adaptation of Rudyard Kipling talks about directly in mythic language. A spoiled rich kid who falls from the ocean liner and is rescued by fishermen. In the road he will understand and know many things not written about the life; its true values.  A film of films; a superb triumph of the cinema and undeniably, the masterpiece of Victor Fleming. Tracy won an ultra deserved Prize as Best Actor for this work.
