 Once upon a time a film whose title was Rollerball; directed by Norman Jewison and superbly starred by James Caan.   Two generations after in 1998 came Future sport, a picture which remains in the middle of the road respect its final intentions. Witch such fragile script and stylized characters where the emotional coordinates are blended with some here and there violent moments, the film does not achieve even a median stature.        The presence of Wesley snipes was the only reason to watch it, but pitifully he was absolutely wasted in a secondary role.   Too much noise and few walnuts.
