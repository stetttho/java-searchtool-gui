 Casadesus was one of the most expressive pianists in any age. He had a deep sense of comittment and secret rapport with the composer . This statement works out specially for Mozart , Ravel , Beethoven and Chopin. Both of these Mozart concerts are superb played filled with inspiration and deep musicality. But I like to recomend specially an old recording I found in an antiques store in Caracas in 1990 in vynil. The recording is from 1947, (Columbia Records)in which Casadesus gives THE MOST OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE OF THE MOZART 21 TH CONCERT.  Imagine the incredible surprise and powerful combination : the aristocratic Charles Munch conducting the New York Philarmonic. I can't explain why the Sony Record hasn't made a transfer on CD of this unforgettable and historical recording.  Meanwhile the 21 of this CD is an extraordinary achievement : but believe me it never reachs the peak of that one. I really hope that this review can be obtained by any important important executive of Sony Records. It would be a wonderful treasure for the mankind!.
