 This is much more than a simply war film. Both fighters play hard in a huge chess game sea stage. The different logistic strategies and attack in the stunning minds of both leaders in every side . Curt Jurgens and Robert Mitchum are first rate . A fine script and cult movie that deservedly won an Academy Award by best special effects in 1957! This movie even will work out as a magnificent example of leadership and management ; the movie didn?t age a bit.  A must in your collection!
