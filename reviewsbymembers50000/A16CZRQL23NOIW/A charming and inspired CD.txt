 Imagine the blending between the Japanese music performed by the golden sound flute of Rampal. The combination was overwhelming . The CD is deeply relaxing from beginning to end and will give you the essential facets of this mostly unknown for us in the Western World. Hara no umi , Kono michi , Sakura and Hana are to me the most interesting pieces but all the CD is worthable . Acquire this work be a hard fan of Rampal or not because the triumph of this CD is the sum of their components.
