 Andras Schiff has possibly the best and most complete sense of the span respect Franz Schubert `s playing in the actual musical scene. W must recognize the presence of the young and so well renowned pianist Mitzuko Ushida but we will have to wait a decade at least to establish a fair comparing, Schubert sounds with such radiance, brightness, mercurial expression and scented phrasing that immediately evocate to the great pianists of the past such Schnabel, Fisher or Badura Skoda.    Many years ago around a kind meeting with a group of fervent music lovers, I stated the imperious necessity to establish a spiritual bridge between Mozart and Schubert and noticed them the enormous lack of expression by any pianist who played Schubert without crossing Mozartian universe. It is like to conduct Tchaikovsky and Shostakovich without a full knowledge of the Mahlerian ocean. It is not a simple duty but a simple question of enriching the score     Go for those works that will let you amazed after you listened. Schubert is in Forties and that 's a very good point to his favor.   Bravo maestro!
