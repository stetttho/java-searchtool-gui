 There are many aspects in common respect Fassbinder and his Italian homologue Pier Paolo Pasolini. Both artists became the fragmented mirror of a collapsed and miscarried society; both of them made devastating final Opus (Salo and Querelle); both were artistic Ambassadors of the Post War generation; likewise both were descendents precisely of two nations joined by contiguous ideologies and far beyond their sexual patterns, both were solid and deep thinkers, imbued and steeled by a invisible commitment that allowed them to expose and immolate themselves prematurely, a very curious aspect to remark if you relate them with other two emblematic figures of different latitudes: Mishima and Jim Morrison.   Twelve days after winning the coveted Golden Bear in Berlin with Veronika Voss, Fassbinder stated Querelle told the story "about a guy whose soul transforms in a crocodile `s one."  He repeated Genet `s words, but besides he referred about himself and who wanted to be. Querelle is a modern mythic personage; irremediably narcissist; opium dealer and murder, mariner and thief, the best and worst of both worlds.   Querelle filming was not fortunate, somehow the burden of the song repeated by Jeanne Moreau seemed to mold the general anima state: "All men kill those who love; some of them when are young; some of them when are old; some with passion; some with gold; all men kill those who love."               Fassbinder was inflamed of creative and febrile enthusiasm; perhaps in his wildest dreams the death smiled him, but he never gave up, he wanted to be loved and recognized . After Berlin, Cannes and after Venice said once.  But there are some hidden communicant vessels beneath the spirit that would seem to put in march some fatidic and clue devices to establish finally the unexpected ending of a hazardous life who risked and bet, but who inscribed his name in the Cinema with bloody words: Fassbinder.   It is absolutely impossible for you not to presage the bitter farewell taste, Querelle became somehow as the last host of a long list of previous guests. In that stage appeared ancient characters; a true parade of memories; because every time we remind Ali, Maria Braun, Effie Briest, Petra von Kant, Veronika, Lolita among so many others load the screen, Fassbinder will reappear masked behind his outrageous way of dressing and dark glasses, repeating us what he told once to a friend about his workaholic tendency, he responded clever or perhaps convinced of a secret precognition sense: "I will rest when I am dead."  Fassbinder made thirty six films in just seventeen years. And his death became a true void in the German Cinema, a place that still keeps, pitifully empty.            In memoriam (1946-1982).
