 Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli felt an obssesive fascination by these three piano works. This Chaconne performing maintains the perfect balance between the mistery and the elusiveness, in fact Benedetti gradually increases the tension level to unexpected heights. I got the Busoni version with this piece and Michelangeli gets very very close in idiomatic expresiveness. The Carnaval was his glorious triumph in the famous London Recital in 1957. He recorded it several times. And recently I got a new perfomance recorded in Lugano where he makes with this work an absolute journey to the purest romatic tradition and far beyond. Finally the Paganini Variations was another battlehorse for this legendary pianist. Benedetti remarks the dark side of the score with notable wisdom, and accents as anyone else the charming and rapture lyrical mood that Brahms knew to use so well. It's very difficult to play any Brahms variation due you must be inmersed in the real intention of every variation.  This Remastered album is a reference must for any serious collector item of refined taste and sensibility. An authentic file tresure!
