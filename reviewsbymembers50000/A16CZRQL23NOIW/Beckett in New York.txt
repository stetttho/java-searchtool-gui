 From the first time I watched this movie, came to my mind the absurd theater, so well expressed in the middle of the thirties when some part of the rationality in the world had just taken a rest that endured almost eighty years. The decision to steal a bank without any prevision state, where the Kafka desperation,  the Sartre anxiety and the Camus ontological loneliness, shook hands. The reflected  microcosms showed a city in serious mental, existentialist and spiritual wounds originated for so many failures. Vietnam and its circumstances,  Watergate, the ideological sons of Herbert Marcuse and Erich Fromm, the nostalgic gaze of Kerouac and Ginsherg,  and the oil crisis of 1973 became a true cresol that determined many living crossroads. Lumet decided to film a portrait of the most profound loneliness between a male couple. But this mistake thriller is a metaphor of the whole mess in those difficult years all over the world. The terrorism played pitifully a first rate role: the Munich affair in 1972, The Symbiotic Liberation Army, the racial conflicts in South Africa, the increasing migration to Europe, the intestine conflicts in the far East, and the spouted insurrectional Governments based on Marxist currents in Center and South America, conformed such collective tension state that practically there was not any little corner in the world free of problem.  That's why the claustrophobic environment that surrounds the whole film from start to finish. And forget the typical happy ending. If there was a decade in which USA reflected the crude reality in all its implacable and fierce nakedness was in the Seventies.
