 Listening the huge and admirable ability to create new harmonies and challenging improvisations of Mr Jarret in this Op 1 let's say one must perceive the first steps in his formidable evolution. Jarret is by himself an orchestra man. He creates atmospheres with such easiness that you will leave this performing absolutely amazed. All the traxks are the absolute proof to convince about his peculiar conceptions of the jazz. Go for this album, without reserves.
