 This picture narrates the efforts of a young actor to incarnate Jesus in a theatrical stage; this weird premise will arouse a wide support of all the community against the bureaucratic environment with the expected and ominous consequences this daring attitude will entail.  An immediate cult movie since it was released. A very original proposal that transcends the colloquial anecdote that made me remind this talented director. Hence it did not surprise me the  forceful, coveted and deserved Academy Award for Barbarian invasions. A personal triumph of Denyse Arcand.
