 The relatively recent releases of the first recordings of the young Bernstein is an invaluable document to appreciate the entire cycle of this distinguished conductor; the paino would be an ever lasting partner to him.  Bernstein felt a special predilection for this Ravel 's work, which remarks the narrow stylistic affinities with the jazz. Bernstein recorded - at least we know - twice this original Piano Concert. This is the first commercial register and the second recording was made in 91971 with the Vienna Philharmonic, released in a very brief stage to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Vienna Philharmonic. Bernstein played the score thinking about Gershwin. It has that visible Manhattan taste, (reminding us the visit that Ravel made in 1928)  and that autumnal vision in the preceded section of the final code. You can appreciate the enormous display of sensibility and dark lyricism that load all the score.  The American in Paris is certainly one of the most pyramidal achievements in the artistic career of Bernstein as pianist and conductor. Charm and delirious.   The rest of the CD is splendid with Copland's Statements for orchestra and his  Facsimile. For all those who are devoted for this remarkable director, undeniable the most charismatic who besides was a connoted and talented composer, this acquisition is almost a must. Go for this album that will enrich still more your vision around this American legend.
