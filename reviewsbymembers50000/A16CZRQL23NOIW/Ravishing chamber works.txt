 The genre of the chamber works of Carl Nielsen is still an immense wasteland for the most of listeners.   These String Quartets are another additional proof of the resplendent creative effluvium of this maxim Danish composer. Admirably  built and eloquently expressive.  If you are a profound admirer of Carl Nielsen (as I do) and still do not know about these works, it would be a great opportunity to enjoy and delight with these admirable String Quartets, that conform together with the impressive set of Shostakovich set one of the most towering works in this genre.
