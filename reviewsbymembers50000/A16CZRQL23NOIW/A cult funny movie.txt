 Consider this film among the greatest comedies ever made and to me , the second best after Some like it hot . Lemmon and Matthau make an unbeatable couple . Two grumpy exmarrieds who has taken up housekeeping together in New York .  But after jus few hours Matthau will know the real nature of his neurotic friend Lemmon .  The obsessive sense of pulchritude of Lemmon and the indifference of Matthau about this little detail will be one of the multiple of the laughable situations all along the film . Magnificent.
