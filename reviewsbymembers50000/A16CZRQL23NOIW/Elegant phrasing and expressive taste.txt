 Sviatoslav Richter according to Emil Gilels was the policeman of the pianists. His fecund versatility and wide domain of the tonal specter allowed him to draw a very original Mozart, without excessive ornamentations. His Mozart sounds intimate, introspective and restrained; he polishes the operatic accents and gives us a crystalline approach. His use of the pedal is discrete, virile building an invisible between Haydn and Beethoven. Richter's performs Mozart as Walter did it, with special emphasis on the clarity and sunlight radiant. Walter came from a long journey conducting Mahler and Richter came from the oppressive atmosphere of his birthplace; I mean both are concentrated to find the landscape after the battle: Mozart is the major approximation to the joy of living, without menacing shadows and struggling livings: the freedom in the whole extension of the word. Richter plays dreamingly Mozart a true organic and cohesive interpretation. The Andante of the Kv.333 breaths and runs with slow tempi more intellectual than emotive if you want but with astonishing results. The Sonata in B -flat major Kv.333 was recorded in Prague 25-11-1966 (Richter is in his 51).  So, considering the fact Richter didn't accustom to play Mozart in surplus, I recommend you to acquire this treasured document of this remarkable artist. Emotion without exacerbated sentimentalism. Here you have a very close approach around these recordings.   The rest of the album was recorded in Prague in 1956.
