  This film carves in relief with supreme eloquence the hazardous advertence about the everlasting conflict between the free will and the collective interest. An architect , a free creator of new spaces renounces to give up his ideals,  he even goes far beyond and decides to cross the frontier of the politically correct facing the public opinion .  In those times the phantom of the collective welfare fed the mind of so many people; some of them absolutely convinced and other portion fondled the romantic idea as a possibility: but King Vidor saw with this entry the magnificent opportunity to make his own statement defending the free will and the creative gifts of the individual initiative above any other premise. He had given us that sublime masterpiece The crowd two decades before, to remark this fact. The image of Frank Lloyd Wright is obviously associated when you watch the film carefully. Lloyd Wright is in the supreme pioneer and most ambitious architect of  new paradigms in the arcane tradition of creative spirits and scientist such Edison, for instance.  The speech given by Cooper when he appeals to the great Jury defending his most intimate beliefs, still maintain its actuality and possibly is the highlight of the film. The sequence in which we watch cooper leaving the office of Massey when he is hired to build the new see of the vanished Banner is simply exquisite and reminds once more the shadows of the German expressionism where the shadows of the betrayal and the triumph of the ideals are faced with all the merciless nakedness.  A personal triumph and a serious warning for those who still believe in the collective welfare as an untouchable Credo simply due the man is not redeemable.
