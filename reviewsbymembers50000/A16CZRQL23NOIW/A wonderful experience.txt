 The mesmerizing approach given by the sublime maestro Sviatoslav Richter is unique in the story of the disc .  I love this Sonata D. 960 . Somehow it represents a musical testament of this poet and beloved musician and to my mind one of the three greatest Piano Sonatas ever composed .  The astonishing musical ideas contained go far beyond the XIX Century and have served as inspiration to composers so distant in spirit as Arnold Schoenberg and obviously Gustav Mahler. Richter in this particular recording makes of this first movement meticulously played and extremely slow tempo to a limit in which literally the time seemed to float . A dimension level that I never had felt with any other performer. Despite Richter loved to play romantic composers , he never played under this mood . Behind the delicacy of his playing there was a careful sense of the expression and the meaning of every phrase .   The artist must be an invisible bridge between the score and the audience and he must vanish . These words come from Richter and  talk by themselves . This statement reveals besides , the absence of total involvement with the romantic expression because somehow the pianist would undraw the spirit and intention of the work .  The reading of this Sonata must be considered as a mythical journey ; the cosmic heights reached in the First and Second Movements reveal to Schubert in one of his highest peaks . This version is absolutely unbeatable . Richter recorded it again in Aldeborough in 1964 but the final result was never the same .  Acquire this historical performance before it becomes a status and hard to find issue among the conosseurs . Sviatoslav Richter : In memoriam (March 20 1915 - August 1 1997)
