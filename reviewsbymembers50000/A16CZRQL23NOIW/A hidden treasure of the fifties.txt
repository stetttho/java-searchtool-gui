 This is superb album . Westerberg might be well recorded his most inspired recording in all his directorial career. The Suite of King Christian II has no parallel in any other latitude . I've tried with Neeme Jarvi but this last lacks of that deep commitment and above all wide scope this work demands . This work is amazing . It reveals the deep spirit of Sibelius as atmosphere creator .  The Tempest is another succesful recording . Plenty of the neccesary turbulence and rage , the strings of The Stockolhn Orchestra made it splendily . Beware these two works were absolute champions all along the sixties and middle of the seventies , absolutely neglected by any unknown reason , these were the only available for a long time . Something similar you may find with The Humoresques for Violin recorded by Rosand in the fifties . The Suite Rakastava is very intense and emotionally suggestive . Passion and lyricism in its highest level . If you are a hard fan of Sibelius and still you do not know these pieces sorry but you have not known the other side of this well gifted composer : the glory of Finland . I still have the old vynil recording !
