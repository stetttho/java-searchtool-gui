 If I should mention the best four and fundamentals artistic achievements of this beloved and talented actress, this would be one of them (Sophie' decision, The hours and Out of Africa would be the other two)  Regardless the presence of this giant actor -Jack Nicholson-, we must recognize Streep stole the show for herself.  Mesmerizing and poignant portrait about two desolate and desperate human beings.  Marvelously directed by Hector Babenco (Pixote).
