 This film is one of the supreme achievements of Win Wenders .  Inspired story in which two angels are in the other side of us and can listen our thoughts but we - the adults - can not see them , just the kids . Complex and poignant , the movie runs between the drama and the fine humor . Arresting images and sublime script . Haunting metaphor about the human condition . Towering performance of Bruno Ganz . Filmed in glorious black and white till the love appears .  A winner in Cannes .
