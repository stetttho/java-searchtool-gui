 Lana Turner made a superb tour de force acting with this legendary cult movie as a greedy artist who neglects the love requirements of her daughter due the fame . This film might well inspire to Bergman for Autunum Sonata in 1978. But in the other hand we can follow the parallel dramatic line in which Juanita Moore daughter repudiating the heritage of her mother passes  for white breaking her mother's heart . Only the golden masterful craft of Douglas Sirk could turn the twist of this melodram soap in a colossal and yet watchable film in a special decade as the late fifties where the racism and the evasion to find out new places were in its peaks. The script is very credible and touching heart . Nobody must miss this fundamental icon of the american cinema . Douglas Sirk inspired to that giant german film maker in the seventies named : Rainer Werner Fassbinder and also to R.E.M. for their so well known theme of the same title in the late nineties .
