 The Second Symphony is a real issue of that overwhelming who was Thomas Schippers . Even if i do not agree with the timings due I consider extremely contemplative , it has personality and expressiveness . The jewel of the crown is the first symphony , one of the best in the market . The Sibelius violin concerto remains in the top list of the ten greatets performances in any age . Warmth and poetic rendition . Finlandia is irrelevant . So consider this buying worthable for the expossed reasons.
