 The inspired moods in which Morton Gould and his orchestra were inmersed when this recording was made was simply anthologic . Gould literally caught the perfect balance and the idomatism of Ernesto Lecuona , a cuban composer and author of Malaguea An emblematic song played for artists of the high of Paco de Lucia , Carlos Montoya , Jose Feliciano and the most famous orchestras of the world as Paul Mauriat ,or Frank Purcel  . This CD provides you a selection of well known and unknown pieces of that talented musician . It is a magnificent opportunity to know the high lyricism and latin flavour of Ernesto Lecuona .  Bravo for Morton Gould!
