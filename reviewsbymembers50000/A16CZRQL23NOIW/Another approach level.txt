 Curiously Tod Browning does not seem to worry by getting special effects or nightmare sequences about this character; instead falling in common places he is more interested to show the psychological feature and a social exploration around the emotive impact of his supernatural presence. At least I din 't experience horror in its straight sense. Browning would seem to emulate the traces of  Caligari instead to follow the accustomed mainstream.  Bela Lugosi is admirable in this role; but I insist: if you are looking horror conceived as ra material you may disappoint. In this sense it is recommended; more by the hidden facets than the usual behavior of the personage.
