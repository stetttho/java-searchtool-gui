 Many people tend to forget this memorable performance of Streep, who made, to my mind, her fourth best artistic achievement after Sophie 's decision, Ironweed and Silkwood in that order.  Powerful drama based on a true story around a woman judged unfairly as the murder of her own child when in reality was a wild dog the true guilty of this awful personal tragedy. Magnificent directorial effort of Schepisi backstage.
