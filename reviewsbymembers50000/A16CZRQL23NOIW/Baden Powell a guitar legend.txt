 The guitar is an orchestra in miniature; this sentence comes from Hector Berlioz. And this statement acquires all his expressive force when you listen Baden Powell. That musician is in my opinion, the best gifted brazilian guitarist in any age.  Beside his countless skill proofs; it remains his sense of poetry. Every note he played , you feel that floates: Consider for instance, his performance of Manha de carnaval ; who can play it better than him?. The sense of loss, the huge nosthalgy, the eloquent sadness and saudade this performance awakes every time you listen is the best proof of not only his fierce musicality; but his clear sense of the harmony and sensitiveness at the poetrys service. An inusual artist; undoubtly; Brazil still has a enormous doubt with him. I think that sooner or later one film maker will bring to the memory of this new generation the greatness and above all deep singleness that Baden Powell hold along all his career. You know as well like me, that the art has no boundaries. In this sense I recomend this album , because it contains the qunitessence of his craft. I really hope that in the case of Baden Powell as many other musicain giants from the past this Balzacs sentence be innecesary: " The glory is the sun of the dead ".
