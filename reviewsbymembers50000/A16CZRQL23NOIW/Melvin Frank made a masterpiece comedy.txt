 Its incredibkle this movie has been so underestimated. The plot is plenty of laughable situations. A well script and above all the presence of this wonderful couple. The unique Jack Lemmon and the lovely Anne Bancroft an extraordinary gifted actress. (Miracle worker) Under no circunstance you should doubt about the virtues of that film, because if you edit the twenty best american comedy films in any age, this film deserves to be in that list.
