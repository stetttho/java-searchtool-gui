 In the first years of the past Century the figures of Mallarme, Verlaine and Baudelaire represented in France one step ahead in many fronts. They represented the anguish, the febrile despair and expressed with absolute conviction their sarcastic and dark opinions about the future to come. Those diviner voices have always resulted unpleasant for a the most of people, because they are considered something like the uninvited guest, the unblessed angels, the lucidity of the conscious in its most cruel nakedness.  Truman Capote was one of these voices. His naturalness at the moment to express awful truths deserved to him the expected results. But he was not the only on. You should add this list names of the height of Sinclair Lewis, Faulkner, Steinbeck, Hemingway, Steinbeck, Alan Ginsberg and Kerouac.  This film portraits with admirable crudeness, those years in which the phantoms that still nestled in the mind of many people and permeated behaviors and attitudes of intransigence and repression as natural response to the recent wounds of the WW2.  You should notice a similar phenomena happened in Germany; two names are enough to prove it: Gnther Grass and Peter Handke.  It would be to remark the fact the 2006 Academy Awards turned around the past (Brokeback mountain, Good night and good luck, Capote and Munich) indicate a visible process of cathartic depuration and an obvious need to analyze the traces of a recent past to realize many hidden aspects of the collective unconscious.  Philip Seymour Hoffman has given securely the role of his lifetime. Regarding he is a young and talented actor, something inside me tells me he reached that genius trait, this sublime peak achieved for others actors. For instance George C. Scott with Patton, Anthony Hopkins with The silence of the lambs, Clift Robertson with Charly, Ben Kingsley with Gandhi, Broderick Crawford with All the king's men, Peter O'Toole with Lawrence of Arabia, or Jack Nicholson with One flew over the cuckoo' s nest. That performance level in which you may state he achieved the state of art and more than an actor he became a model.                              An absolute modern classic.
