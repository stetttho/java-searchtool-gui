   Far from previous narrative conventionalisms, this movie accents the memory weight around a very wounded and disillusioned woman who had a sudden love affair with an artist of the photography. But love hurts, specially when you give more than you receive. So in this state of things a very well puzzled script will lead us to presence an admirable crossroad, visibly remarked over and over with the poster of that unforgettable Noir titled: "Criss cross" that alludes the tensional state of Claire, cheated, haunted and supposedly murder `s suspect.  Juliette Lewis gave a jarring performance as this distorted mind woman without present and not even dreams of future; Gina Gershon as the cold blood woman and Mickey Rourke in a brief appearance of just fifteen minutes on screen make of this work a very recommended option at the moment to consider among the most interesting thrillers made that year. I would like you to notice you the related link with a cult movie from the Eighties: Diva.
