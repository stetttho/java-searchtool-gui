 Being a hard fan of this overwhelming artist I must recognize however the multiple complaints of this unnecesary use and even abuse of the vocal device to seal this performance. Both concerts are such true masterpieces that even resist this serious comment.  So, if you can forgive this real obstacle you will obtain enormous and rewarding results.  The Bremen Concert I feel it superior. Jarret is a true master of the improvisation. A real tour de force.!
