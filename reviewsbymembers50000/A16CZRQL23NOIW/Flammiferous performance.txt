  David Oistrakh, Leonid Kogan have always been in the tapestry as the best exponents of this igneous Violin Concert . Not only constitutes one of the most vibrating pages ever written for this instrument but also an extraordinary difficult work to play which demands from the soloist exceptional gifts.   If I do not know about an almost unknown but passionate violinist of Bulgarian origin named Julian Sitkovetsky who really signed his name in the immortality with this superb and astonishing recording dated 1954, I  would give to Oistrakh the first place in that glorious performance.    I swear it.
