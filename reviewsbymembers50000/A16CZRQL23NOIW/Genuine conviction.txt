 What is -in last instance- the slender difference between Beethoven and the rest?  The renovated energy and the untamed inspiration that reaffirms that memorable idea of the spirit noblesse, the epic vigor and the absolute commitment with the life at the verge of any other religious consideration.   In what Waldstein Sonata concerns, we may find out that infinite cosmic energy that spurts with renovated splendor in hands of a poet in the piano. I love this Sonata among other things because you reaffirm your personal commitment respect the humanity. Who can resist the undeniable charm and the suggested dreamy spring that as Milo `s Venus, awakes in the genial link between the Second and Third Movement to load us of sweeping epic breath present in the finale?   Just a very few pianists have been able to achieve in a prominent level and still better to express the imaginative rapture and vigorous creative flame with the well known final climax, and Barenboim is one the few pianists who has furthered in this sense.  You don ` t only need to be provided with astonishing technique, besides you must be absolutely committed with the score. Otherwise the final result would result a musical journey, and as you know there is no art without second intention.           In what Appassionata concerns, it's a very valid approach although I think it must be played with much more Dionysian passion.  The Moonlight sonata is a very convincing, honest and superb achievement.
