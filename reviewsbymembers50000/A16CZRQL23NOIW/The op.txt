 This album was the first title that I bought in vynil in 1968 . The impression is simply overwhelming . I put a spell on you is a nosthalgical blues with notable riffs and the strong voice of John Fogerty . I wrote a song for every one is a warm ballad .  But Suzie Q is the queen of diamonds . This version is extraordinary . Despite this piece has been played over and over , Credence knew give that Midas touch whicn meant their first meeting card in the world . If you are a hard fan of this fundamental ensamble of the last sixties ; acquire it without restrictions .
