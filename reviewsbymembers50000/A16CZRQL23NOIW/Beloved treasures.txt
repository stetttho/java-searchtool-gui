 One of the major disgraces suffered in the music during the second half of the century was the premature death of Jacqueline Du Pr . She and Cristina Walewska were the two most raising promises in the female cello world.  Du Pr owned that sound so pure and crystalline ,  lyrical warmth and dramatic boldness , majestic expression and superb articulation . She was one of the most beloved musicians of Pau Casals . This set is deeply ravishing and reveals the status of his craft as no other else . To face the serious commitment and triumph to play the Beethoven Cello Sonatas demand a scrupulous study and detailed analysis of Beethoven path through his different  stages . Since the first two Sonatas were written in 1805 , the third in 1807 and the the two latest in 1815 that involves three crucial creative periods of Bonn genius. The crown jewel in my opinion is the glorious performing of the Second Sonata loaded with aristos approach . You can notice however the honest virtuousness but hold by a visible force and  radiant energy .If you want to have an album which clasps the essential facets of that colossal artist , acquire these recordings which date from November and December 1970 in live sessions . Barenboim is splendid as partner , he never will shade her , both musicians knew the huge problems of balance these works contain .
