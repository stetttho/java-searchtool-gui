 Howard Hawks typified as any other western fim maker the multiple profiles inmersed in this north american mythology as the western was .  "The war is won only with the available you have , and not with that you would wish to have" , if you translate this statement to this movie , you will notice that it foits accurately .  Since all the allies forces under the sheriff ' s service are not the cream of the cream , that is the only you have for fighting . A clear example about the effective leadership and this film shows us through vignettes and rhapsodic moments .  Since I have been a hard admirer of Howard Hawks is above all his powerful capacity to rtell stories with a prodigious simplicity of resources . He directed a film like a great symphony and that 's his secret .   He was a very introspective man , very quiet but gifted with this clearness about the western meant as life experience . And that premise signed his films , the Howard's conceptual seeds still remain in the mind of so many actual directors . Notice for instance that Hawks was one of the few directors that won in every genre he filmed . since his famous Scarface (one of the film noir pioneers) to The gentlemen prefer blondes . His path seems suggest the enormous interest for developing the inner character and personal philosophies around the subworld reflected in every one of his works .  Timeless western movie!
