  Fernando Trueba initiates this heartfelt homage to the Latin American jazz pleasing to a friend who gave him a Paquito de Rivera recording in the early eighties. And so the picture emerges as a big museum with musical pictures at exhibition. Every artist's introduction is very sober, but effective.   There are several highlights to remark. The emotional encounter between Chucho and Bebo Valds, for instance playing in two pianos, the astonishing performance of Michel Camilo, the admirable living legend Gato Barbieri, Don Tito Puente, Chano Dominguez and his original performance blending the flamenco and jazz, the magic of Eliane Elias make of this musical  document a true reference work for the present and future generations, due the importance of the text and the intimate portrait in which every musician can express and without hindrances, his thoughts and considerations.  A fortunate handshake between a Spanish filmmaker and America and Africa musical expressions.       Fundamental treasure!
