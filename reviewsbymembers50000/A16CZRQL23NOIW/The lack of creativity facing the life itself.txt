 This film is ione the most satisfactory works in all Woody career .  Since a film maker privated of creative breath , seeks inspiration in the gangster memories . He will be his adviser in every detail concerned with the internal moods of an underworld guy , his feelings , the intimate behavior .  So , this incisive plot wil carry both of them to cretae an amazing four hands script , with the ironic atmosphere and smart gags as Woody Allen knows to get it . Funny premise , delightful and haunting dilema underneath the laughs . One of my ten favorite Allen movies.
