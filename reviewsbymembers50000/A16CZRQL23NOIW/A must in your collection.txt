 Let`s talk about Liszt^s maldition. Ponti creates a dark atmosphere without making fireworks.  In Bronsart`s concerto the piano flies and evokes us a true landscape of caleidoscopic images. It`s played with conviction and majesty. The last movement like many endings of Brahms`works concludes with gipsy tunes. In the romantic tradition, austere and honest. But Raff`s concert steals the show. What Ponti makes with these concert is melting with the score. The piano is played with such kind of histamina and also passion without loosing the "savoir vivre". It`s a  jubilee a celebration of life. Absolutely radiant. And in the finale Ponti makes a statement of elegant  bravura  and happy resolution. Raff was undoubtly not only a virtuoso but a gentleman drowned by the nature`s love so representative of the pures romantic tradition. In this sense Raff seems anticipate the echoes of Debussy`s preludes. In fact, he was a Liszt`s pupil but creating and suggesting ; and that`s the clue who carries to the musical impressionism. Ponti , in this sense attacks the work having this concept in his mind. Obviously, Raff is not at Schumann`s level, but that isn`t a sin. Raff altogether Mozart loves the life.  The orchestra an Mr. Ponti, that evening were absolutely convinced and engaged with this concert. The rapport is inusual.  The rest of the CD is worthy and you`ll be rewarded ever.
