 These works at last were released for Music & Arts , so all of us who never had the glorious opportunity of being there , at least we can celebrate having an issue of these unvaluable recordings . You must acquire the first volume too .  To talk about the level of these recordings means to be in presence of outstandings performings . As you know , Casals was to me (Furtwangler , Martha Landowska , Joseph Szigetti , Wilhelm Kempff , Albert Schweitzer and Frau Carreo ,too) the highest artist of the XX century And Pau Casals had the quality of elevate the standard level interpretation with every partner he played . Watch for instance the growth up of Rudolf Serkin , Sandor Vegh , Isaac Stern or Eugene Istomin  . Casals seemed to be gifted of an inner fire who literally loaded all the surroundings . Such level of interpretations is product of a deep commitment with himself and with his goal in this world . Every piece in every CD is a jewel . To describe all and every one of its inner virtues would be unending .  Compare by yourself .
