 The singular style of Bruce Beresford invites us to think once more, about a lot of issues that many times we tend to accept as valid, unless we look at ourselves reflected in that imaginary role.  The premise has been told many times. A woman is framed for a murder she did not commit and six long years will be imposed her, when the real guilty is her rotten husband. Tommy Lee Jones as the ineffable investigator does not make any but repeat himself respect his winning role in The Fugitive.   In search of the elusive truth she has to elude her parole officer and try to find the clues that leads her to set the state of things in perspective.   The sequence in cemetery is probably, a terrible insult to the viewer 's intelligence that demerits enormously the dramatic support of the picture, weakening it.  The singular beauty and talent of Ashley Judd and some moments of febrile tension maintains the dignity of a plot with holes that could have been better.  Perhaps Bruce Beresford `s choice could have been the slender difference. His artistic trajectory seems to indicate us he is much worried about the feelings of the human being (If not Driving Miss Daisy and Crimes of the heart seem to be a relevant evidence, do noyou?). Perhaps with Curtis Hanson directing, David Mamet as scripter, Jude Law instead of Bruce Greenwood and John Malkovich instead Tommy Lee Jones, perhaps...we would be talking about some other film. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.
