  Far beyond of your ancestral fears, unconscious collective and some other limiting factors deeply fixed in your values scale, the author makes of the will the real instrument for fight and win. The will is synonym of power and ability to turn off the accustomed expression so enrooted in the most of people: I can not do that because ....  And so the life escapes and you with it. Somerset Maugham invocated a famous statement: You can argue one thousand of reasons for not making anything but not a single excuse. Will phonetically is so related with wheel that it sounds more than logic to assume the sense of movement implies the fact of challenge and fight daily and constantly. And this is a smart point to remark, due as you know every day is different to another , and your yesterday's victory has nothing to do with your possible victory and the end of the day.  I mean the hunter paradigm must permeate your soul and conscious. Your abilities, strengths and weakness must compose a whole sum, your helmet and sword, with all the vigor and enthusiasm you have. Because the nature is not the world. And many times we tend to forget this aspect. The nature does not know pity, forgiveness, faith or hope. The nature claims by the surviving of all the species, but survive demands a prize: keep on fighting without any reward. That is why the happiness to my mind is not a special mood and is in nowhere, the happiness resides in the fight by itself. While you are fighting you must be happy: the absence of fight is simply the death and the death is the peace. The fight for surviving implies the absence of peace, because it demands you to take decisions constantly. Try for this book splendidly written and meticulously explained.
