 You must watch carefully this film. Never let you convince by other one. You mut face this challenge. Theres no promise land for you to be safe. If your approach is merely superficial, even if you are a trivial person in the sense that Mircea Eliade defined like the absence of internal tension psiquis, then you better not assume the proposal. But if you really are sincerely and above all free of all kind of ancestral prejuices, welcome. This a very clever journey far beyond some life aspects you avoid talking in a conference, for instance, not even a social meeting. This films walks minute to minute on the knifes edge. Its deeply disturbing. It bothers you, it inquires you, it challenges without a minute of rest. What are the final reading this film proposes? It depends on you. Do you like William Blake? Then welcome to the fight club. Nietszche stated once that smart thought: Do you want to clim? Then dont fera the vertigo. Thats what the film deals. A journey without restrictions. A movie just for free men. Brad Pitt shows once more his actoral gifts , and so well Norton and that natures force this monumental and versatile actrass Helen Bonham Carter. No other actress in all the world was so adequate like her for that demanding role. David Fincher advanced far beyond his first attempt when he gave us Seven, and in a less better build script as The game with the amazing Sean Penn. Fincher is a weird director that has decided walk by unknown territories. Istvan Szabo , David Lynch , Taylor Hackford, Alvaro de la Iglesia, Cohen brothers, Kaurismaki brothers, Lars von Triers and Francis Ozon at this moment are the only directors who seem to have the force and the talent for following these dark passages. Watch this film with people able to make an intelligent discussion after.  And remeber just once more, you must kill your inner dragons, because no one will make for you. No one. And welcome to the fight club!
