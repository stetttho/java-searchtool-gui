 Beneath the script, there is a claustrofobic enviroment . You feel that there`s no way out. The same feeling you experienced in that fifties movie named The body snatchers. The law pretends to make justice in a world who lives without knowing it. This return to the past in the mytical sense of the word makes that our private eye be less than a puppet. A unforgettable given by Christopher Lee and the narrative flow makes this weird tale instales in your memory for ever. Get his DVD and enjoy this film. It will let you too much worried about a lot of issues you assumed valid.
