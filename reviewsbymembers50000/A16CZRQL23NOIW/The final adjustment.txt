 This second part of the saga is by far less interesting than the first . I must confess however the two outstanding chapters ; the training process and the brilliant sword duel with Darryl Hannah .  Madsen reminded too much to Mickey Rourke look specially in Johnny Handsome . The script is very fine and sarcastic all the way . Thurman is one the most attractive actress on the screen in the world . she irradiates magnetism , force and credibility to the film as any other actress in this exigent role But think it over my kid reader To my mind  Tarantino might be well having made a film whose running time was three hours and a half  eliminating certain insipid sequences , unless certain market patterns have prevailed.
