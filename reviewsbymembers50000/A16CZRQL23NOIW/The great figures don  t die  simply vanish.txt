 The next May 14th eight years will have elapsed since the sensible departure of the major crooner; his majesty: Frankie.   This album just contains a reduced sample of his craft. The crooner per excellence, seeded in the heart and souls of all those who had the fortune to watch him in live recitals, but for the great majority who were children at his Golden Age and even for the new generations of listeners, who will find in his cantabile line a prodigious singer, an unmistakable style and bewitching spell.     Countless reviews have talked about this impeccable diction, his fierce interpretative sharpness, his charisma in the stage, his love affairs, his feats in the cinema. Sinatra was a true prot?g? by fortune God. His heritage is still subject of innumerable discussion, but the main question is his unique style, persuasive voice with that autumnal seal, with that undeniable evocation `s power and genuine domain of the scene not only deserved him all the possible epithets, but his legend will always endure in the glorious Immortals Pantheon.  Yes: it was my way!
