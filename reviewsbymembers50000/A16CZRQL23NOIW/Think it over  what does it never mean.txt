 This film was the perfect farewell to Sean Connery -The best Bond ever- . After more than a decade with Roger Moore, it was decided to make a funny remake of Thunderball with lots of finest humor and obviously double sense jokes.  The presence of a splendid cast : Max von Sydow and the third best villain of Bond series, Klaus Maria Bandauer and the glorious beauty of the talented and promising by then actress Kim Bassinger  who besides became the maxim sex symbol of the eighties-  the first Bond girl who eventually would receive an Academy Award, years before Halle Berry repeated the same feat, makes of this work a sympathetic evasion film who will remind Connery with an excess of free radicals and toxins.  Watch for the male villain: the dazzling and exuberant Barbara Carrera.    An unusual film a bit overlong perhaps, working out more as a tribute to Connery instead just another additional Bond entry.  I presume Kershner was the chosen director after having worked in Connery's first comedy in the late sixties: A fine madness.
