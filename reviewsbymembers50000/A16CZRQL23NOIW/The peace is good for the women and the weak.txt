 This is the brutal speech of Agamenon in the first third of the film which preserved the intense epic gaze of this immortal work of the greatest european poet Homer . Obviously Petersen is not Kurosawa . Nevertheless Petersen makes a wonderful camera work . The cast is not entirely homogeneus . The ravishing presence of O'Toole as Priamo established such rank level than literally he sent to the rest of the cast to a very worthable second level; personally I suppose O' Toole at last will win a prize of the Academy as Best supporting actor in 2005 (though between you and me we know he doesn't need it)  ; Brian Cox as Agamemnon and Brendan Gleason as Menelao are first rate . The very brief presence of Julie Christie as Thetis is unforgettable. Pitt looks a little overacted ; it is absolutely true that no other actor in this moment was more appropiatte than him ; but in my opinion I missed the presence of the inner mood in certain moments of loneliness of Achilles .  However the sumptuosity and the epic breathe are still present  all along the film. Orlando Bloom is fine as Paris . He embodies all the cowardness and lack of braveness , and Erik Bana was OK. But beware with Garret Hedlund as Patroclo ; there are certain twist of the real character of him and Hedlund gave a very romantic approach ; Kruger is a very beautiful woman but she looks extremely cool and geometric . The film experiments a visible decline since the Hector death and the Troy invassion . I reall do not know what was going on ; because these crucial moments are told so kinetically without any drop of dark poetry and the serenity of such tragical moment demanded . It seemed the producers would have considered this section of the story without relevance and the last sequences look like a fast account of the facts . Nevertheless it is a watchable and dazzling visual film .
