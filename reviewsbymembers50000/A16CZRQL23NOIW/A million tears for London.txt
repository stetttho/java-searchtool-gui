 I have always felt for this city a special affect and admiration. And I know this little acknowledgment in these painful moments of hopeless and desolation results less than useless but this nation has lived worse moments. This recording keeps the best of the British inspiration; that land who has seen to born to Vaughn Williams, Benjamin Britten, Edward Elgar, Henry Purcell and so many artists and countless contributions to the Western Hemisphere. Wonderful and unforgettable melodies on the genre of light music.
