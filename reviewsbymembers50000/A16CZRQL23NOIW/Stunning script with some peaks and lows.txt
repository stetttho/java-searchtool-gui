 James Foley has made a very interesting film around the well known bunch of sympathetic and high level ruffians who play hard for the money, product of a request of a major gangster.  Admirable and frenetic camera handle in the first third part of the film, acts a boomerang against the script because it permeates the drama 's intensity. Edward Burns was OK, but I think this character was perfect to Gary Oldman.  Rachel Weisz as the femme fatale is wondrous; and Hoffman pitifully does not convince at all in this role.
