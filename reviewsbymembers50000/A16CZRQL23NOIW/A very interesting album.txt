 Al Di Meola conferred this album a visible experimental treatment, that combines Brazilian inspiration and his accustomed acoustic innovations all the way.   So, from this approach I must recommend you to acquire this album, because it constitutes a crucial stage in the evolution of this formidable and talented musician, who likes to bet and innovate with new musical forms, and admirable aces under the sleeve such as Corea or Metheny, for instance.   Go for this one. It will never let you down.
