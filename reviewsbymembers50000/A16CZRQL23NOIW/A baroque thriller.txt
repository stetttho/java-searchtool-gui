  The elusiveness and the mystery; the violence and the surrealist  nightmares; the loneliness and the cruelty; the curiosity and the poignancy will be the crossed elements of that dreamy puzzle. A human ear will be the first clue in the crime scene who will lead to a couple of youngsters to make a journey to a restricted land. The slow agony of lonely singer, the abominable presence of a kidnapper drug dealer, a bunch of human specters, a bit of amylic anhidride and a bitter portrait of an agonic world will make of this picture a real cult movie that grows and grows through the years.  David Lynch confessed in a interview that four crucial sequences were inspired by his personal dreams. So, that' s why I respect so much  Lynch ' s aesthetics, he is one the genuine descendent of that so far German Expressionism Movement being Murnau, Fritz Lang, Robert Wiene, Paul Wengerer and King Vidor his more excel  ambassadors. So in my personal opinion I recommend you to take a ride by those important and decisive years to find the visual clues, the body language and the imagination force and then back to Lynch. Otherwise you may misunderstand or worst still underrate the underground labyrinths, fundamental trademark  of this original and innovative creator.
