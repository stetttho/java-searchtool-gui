 For all those interested in leadership lessons this is a singular jewel to watch and discuss it over and over.  It has been said very often that when most of people affirm: "Everything is under control, is precisely due they do not know what's going on."       An old marine lion (Gene Hackman), accustomed to deal and win in other scenarios, will be severally confronted in a double panel: first against a premise, based on the uncertainness about the true potential of the enemy. But there is still another obstacle to defeat: An officer of the new generations, trained under the concepts of asymmetric wars, emotional intelligence and that ancient Chinese legend: "Listen the forest sounds."           When the discussion reaches unbearable levels, and escapes of rational limits it appeals very often to ancient arguments, experience, patriotism, the voice tune gradually increases to silence perhaps you have not any cards to show on the table and once this occurs, the passion acts and your acquired instructions are ignored and verbal violence works out as a boomerang, degrading your previous status of maximum authority and relegating automatically your nominal command pressed and besieged under this unsaved circumstances. Remember Macbeth `s last moments. He has credibility and when this happens your weakness surge as a volcanic eruption.  It is a similar case when you are playing chess and know the end is near. You can move your supporting pieces to save the king but these are just desperate actions to prolong artificial or nominally an irreversible result.          Excellent performance of Denzel Washington. Hackman looks a bit overacted.  By far the masterpiece of Tony Scott.
