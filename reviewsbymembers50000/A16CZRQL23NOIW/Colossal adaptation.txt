 This was the first issue in what we should call the second age of Polanski . In this case his deep inspiration carried him to play this powerful work of William Shakespeare. Many people consider ths film too violent and bloody , but we are talking about Macbeth , and precisely this violence is part of the story. The visual language needs it, to express the raise and the decay of Macbeth. The greed and ambition feed his soul and will carry him to commit the required murders to reach his goals. This is a machivelian statement .  The art direction is eloquent . The cast is first rate , the atmosphere is by far convincing .  Polansnki developed one of the most fortunate versions in the screen , but keep in mind the previous releases of Welles and Kurosawa (Throne of blood) , however , this movie is fundamental in your collection. The hands are filled of blood!
