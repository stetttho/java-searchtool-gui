 The ominous musicality and powerful sensitivity of Jarrett does not let any fissure. It is a quiet album with a wide spectre of sublime melodies in the most intimate chandle light atmosphere. Jarrett and his colleagues made to my mind one of the most overwhelming persoanl recordings not only of that decade but in the jazz story. If you have not listened yet to Jarrett you are really missing of great moments to enjoy, because the high rapport and the warm enthusiasm is not so easy to find in other ensembles.Highly recommended.
