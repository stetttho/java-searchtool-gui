 A veteran in this hard job Robert Duvall, incarnates the wisdom experience, and a young man Sean Penn will be training in this underworld through the hidden face of L.A.  Though the script suffers a little bit of fallling in common places the formule engages the viewer. Duvall and the excellent camera work of Dennis Hopper. Maria Conchita Alonso makes an interesting performance in a little role. Penn as always splendid but Duvall stole the show. In certain way, he holds the sixty per cent of the film. To my mind this is the second major work of Dennis Hopper after Easy Rider.
