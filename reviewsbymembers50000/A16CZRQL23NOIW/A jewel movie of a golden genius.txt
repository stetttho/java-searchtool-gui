 Monsieur Lange is a simple story. It deals with an execrable human being who maintains a negative tension state around an office, until the walls of the human patience finally fall down with the expected consequences.  Fiction and reality will be narrowly bounded in this original script which concerns with the honor and self steem of all human being under determined conditions. Exquisite and ravishing movie that deserves to be considered among the most representative isues of this overwhelming French director.   Go for this , you will enjoy the whole script and besides the admirable technique of Renoir style.  Besides, (if any shadow of doubt it could exist about the grandness of Jean Renoir and his huge influence over so many major and minor future directors) you must always remember and not forget that Toni, a lost film from 1934 is the first issue of this movement named Neo Realism, mistakenly applied to Roselini and De Sica. This film was the first one and somehow the real Godafther of the later movement!   Hiram Gomez.
