 Perhaps this statement it may sound exaggerated, but in sharp contrast with his another remarkable composer as Aaron Copland, Ives remained as the loyal observer, who scrutinizes with admirable honesty and artistic commitment the non revealed aspects of the reality. Beneath the trivial vision, he composes music as Van Gogh painted, with a remarkable sixth sense depicted the recondite boundaries of the human condition, the changing nature and besides the undeniable interaction between man and nature. I must confess my admiration by Ives since my first years. Since I was a teenager, his Question without answer, his Symphonies are permeated somehow for similar visions you can find in Carl Nielsen, (though Carl's vision goes overseas); this dark lyricism and somber poetry is still a landmark in the American music.      Another directorial triumph of Leonard Bernstein!
