 The war with all its miseries may be had not found a film so engaging and terrible like this one . A place where the guardians and prisoners are confined to share their lives .  When the emotional lack of a high rank officer be revealed for a man without scruples , the hell is going to burn at your eyes . Well known as Furyo , this film was and still keeps the potent statement of 1983 , and it has not aged a just a bit. Superb performance of David Bowie and a solid script .
