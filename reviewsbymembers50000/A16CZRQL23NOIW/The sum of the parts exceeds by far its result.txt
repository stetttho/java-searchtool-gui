 We have a delirious picture. Filmed in the late years of the WW2, and after making the penetrating and Faustian "Devil and Mr. Webster", Dieterle decided to bet for this tongue in the cheek movie; inspiring in Budu saved from waters, the central character is a sympathetic and talented beggar who practices magic and decides to break the walls with just an intention in mind: to bring the expected happiness of his daughter who is love with a Caliph; but on the road there will be more laughable and funny situations.  Marlene Dietrich stole the show with her erotic appearance in an Arabian dance painted of gold (a pioneer device for Goldfinger, perhaps?).  Go for this version that to my mind remains several echelons respect the 1955 version. But in last instance you have the last word. My reason to maintain this statement is to underline the rhythmic precision and edition work that do not seem to faint just for a second.
