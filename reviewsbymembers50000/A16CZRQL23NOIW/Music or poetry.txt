  Those days of my vanished youth in the last seventies, I bought both albums in vynil format and I enjoyed every track.  I have been waiting almost twenty years for this release, and at last the moment has come.  Let me put you on this way. The album is fundamental set of the best songs of both composers, and Larcange's mood is essentialy adequate and sublime.  You will have one thousand opportunities for rejoin with the life and enjoy with your beloved couple or a happy meeting with your closer friends listening over and over again this legendary album.  Do not ever miss it. It's pure gold!
