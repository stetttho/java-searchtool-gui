 Horenstein gave us one of his most inspired performances along his brilliant career . Both recordings are admirable . The sense of musicality and the cosmical breath that you can feel after listen them are loaded of so level of honesty , purity and commitment that is hard for us to get some other versions that match with these .  The London Symphony was an orchestra that had no any problem in adapting to the director temperament . Think in Solti style , De Sabata , Adrian Boult , Barbirolli , De Sabata and so others batoon giants who had the inmense honor and pleasure of conducting it . That easiness became in its main strength , and allowed Horenstein triumph with such apotheosis level. The Eight is sublime , the last movement filled of interpretative force and histamina ,  invades you all the way . The sforzandos are first rate .  The Ninth is performed with introspective magnetism . Horenstein escapes to another dimension and the orchetsra flies with him . This is a historical recording. Do not doubt for a second and acquire this gem.
