 Dinner with Andre is a clever device employed by this smart director to exposse his multiple and deep concerns about the actual world . A dinner will be just the background in which we will watch the exchange of ideas and points of view about a lot of issues .  Extremely interesting ; this is a slow paced film just thinking about your good taste and intelectual refinement .  A triumph of the good taste .
