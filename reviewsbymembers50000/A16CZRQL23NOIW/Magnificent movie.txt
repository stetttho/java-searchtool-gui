 Brian Denehy is a superb actor. He always seems to elevate the quality of every film he appears . (Remember him in The belly of an arquitect or Bestseller, for instance). Gifted with strong character , and charimatic personality he reminds very often me to Broderick Crawford , a hard actor of the fifties (All the king's men). In this film he is an attorney who must to defend a man framed of murder.  The puzzle script is absorbing and deeply haunting ,specially in some sequences like instance that one in which we see stating the point that not all Vietnam veterans are murders by definition. Christopher Leicht has made a punch movie and we expect new works from this consistent director . He reveals himself as a young promise in this hard competing office . Jill Stuart Masterton gives a credible performance.  Acquire this one and please: the title is not related with Agatha Christie novel .
