 Enjoyable picure where you will fid to Tracy in one of his best performances as the suffered father who is conducting all the issues related with your daughter`s wedding . His wife - Joan Bennet - is magnificent . Elizabeth Tayor and Don Taylor is the happy couple . This is much more than a simple american comedy of the fifties . Fifty years later still keeps its freshness and rapture .
