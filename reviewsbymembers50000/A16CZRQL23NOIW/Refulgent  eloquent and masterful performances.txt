 Mozart `s Symphony in A major K. 201- the second in this key that he wrote in Salzburg, marks possibly the sublime initiation of the great Symphonic cycle of Wolfgang. And as well as the sublime Ninth Piano Concert constitutes a sort of breakthrough with the previous influences and the true edification of what we should might denominate the Mozart `s style. There was just another magnificent live performance of Sandor Vegh in Caracas 1992 with the Salzburg Academic Orchestra that still vibrates in my musical memory; loaded with special brightness and diamantine opulence.      Harnoncourt `s towering inspiration at those ages and the presence of the radiant and opulent sound of this prodigious Orchestra conform a must-have CD not only because we are commemorating Mozart 's anniversary but besides, you won't find quite easily such vibrant and mercurial conduction.  The only version of the 29th I remind which contends in sumptuousness and solemn phrasing is an old version with Erich Kleiber and the Concertgebouw that has not been released yet in CD. format.      "Paris" Symphony is simply fabulous, expansive and mercurial.
