 Above the incandescent and vivid performance of Sigourney Weaver, the primatologist, whose overwhelming devotion to the once nearly extinct mountain gorillas of Central Africa led to her eventual murder. The storytelling is ravishing and let the viewer with the absolute conviction she crossed the border line around the investigation and the self experience in many issues.  A magnificent and disturbing movie, hard to forget in years.  A winner film!
