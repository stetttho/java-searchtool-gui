 Oscar Peterson was probably the most famous jazz pianist in the world; more important, he was also, in the opinion of many, the best there has ever been. Perhaps, the name of Art Tatum could compete in what respects to inspiration and mood. The classical training, his full command of the piano was simply awesome, but however his most admirable gift was the overall range of emotional frequencies, that included from the most reflective poignancy and subtlest lyricism to the most effusive joyousness and ability to make roar the piano. He always played with the piano instead of play the piano. That astonishing easiness of his voluptuous phrasing and perpetual lyrical expressiveness constituted one of his multiple personal landmarks.   The fortunate association with Ed Thigpen and Ray Brown between 1959 and 1965, led perhaps to one of the most brilliant, inspiring and fruitful period in the impressive career of Peterson. After you listen this overwhelming trio, you will proudly to affirm this trio has been one of the most solid ever formed before in the whole Jazz Era.  This is - without exaggeration - one of the most valuable musical documents of this Jazz giant.
