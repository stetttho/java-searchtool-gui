 This Shakespeare drama in particular has had sublime adaptations: in the screen Ran of course of that japanese genius:Akira Kurosawa of 1985 ; the version of Peter Brook of 1971 and at last , this colossal adaptation originally conceived for the British TV . This is a full blooded , credible and superb playing , the camera work , the characters and the illumination worked out in the highest level . Olivier was simply overwhelming as Lear . All the cast was in the top of the line but deserve apart mention : Diana Rigg as Regan ; Anna Colder Marshall as Cordelia ; Brian cox as Burgundy ; Jeremy Kemp as Cornwall , Robert Lang as Albany and John Hurt . You will be rewarded always with this superb production , fundamental story of a king torn apart for the ambition and treachery . Lear shows till the saciety that you must never delegate the authority ; just only the duties .
