 This is one of the most admirable and illustrated reference guides around the insights of the extraordinary French filmography. A true gallery of unforgettable films, supported by a minutely account of valuable information aorund every one of the exposed films.   To review the films of the Great Masters such as Jean Renoir, Marcel Carne, Robert Bresson, Julien Duvivier, Henri Clouzot, Rene Clement, Jean Delanoy or Jean Pierre Melville represents a journey through the dense brumes of the memory and one the most important chapters of the genre.  If you are (as I do) a profound lover of the French Cinema or even the Cinema in its broad meaning; this book is recommended.   Do not doubt it just for a second and try to find it.
