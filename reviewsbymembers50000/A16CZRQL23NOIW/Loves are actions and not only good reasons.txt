 This Spanish statement fits so well with this movie. Filmed in the middle of the Bosnian conflict, this original idea suffered a serious collapse. The initial sequences in which the nuclear weapons are stolen are magnificent.  But suddenly the story falls downstairs through the employment of ultra known resources. There is nothing new under the sun: it's hard to believe that group of trained and convinced political fanatics act so predictably. The final sequence is possibly resumes the lack of ambition I mean. This work could have been a dramatic warning, a real possibility in the actual moments we are living: a film that could have surmounted the anecdotic character and inscribe itself in the line of major works such Fail Safe for instance, Dr. Strangelove or the hunt of Red October, concludes such a histaminic movie with a happy ending and a laughable explosion.
