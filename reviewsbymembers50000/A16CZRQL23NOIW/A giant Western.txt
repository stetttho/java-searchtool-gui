 The presence of Randolph Scott (Pat) and the masterful direction of Budd Boetticher guarantee you a fabulous and rewarding cinematographic experience. Rancher Pat loses his horse in a bet trying to buy a bull, and for these destine ironies he will be lifted by a friend in a stagecoach when the future dramatis personae will develop with dramatic intensity.  Greed, ambition, betray, double crossing, so characteristic of the low paths will face with the presence of a coward husband who tries to save his life establishing a plan with Frank ( the  leader of the bad guys) persuading him to make a ransom due his wife `s family has enough money to pay the ransom.  This story gradually will converge and expand in a true dramatic explosion of violent characters that will lead to a very cathartic ending.  Well acted with superb handle camera and a versatile script that will catch your immediate interest along the way. A little classic, a cult movie and one of my twenty favorites in any age. Watch to Randolph in another original Western five years later: Ride the high country.
