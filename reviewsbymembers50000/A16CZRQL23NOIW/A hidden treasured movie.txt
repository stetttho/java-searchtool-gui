 The mission is to rescue the besieged American ambassador to Yemen, and the responsible will be the highly decorated Marine Terry Childers. His decision to open fire on the crowd of seemingly peaceful demonstrators will cause the death of almost eight people. Is he guilty or not?  William Friedkin once more made a satisfactory film, thinking securely in the acclaimed film Rashomon where the eternal disjunctive between the ancient concepts related with the truth and its relative significance according your observation angle or personal perspective. The elusive, relative and ephemeral about what truth means to you or me makes us think the truth is just another illusion.     A magnificent cast and intriguing plot will tie to your seat from start to finish. A neglected film that well deserves its place in the list of the best films in 2000.
