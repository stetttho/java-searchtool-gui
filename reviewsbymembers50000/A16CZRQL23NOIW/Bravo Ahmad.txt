 Ahmad Jahmal is one these artists whose capacity of evoking reminds us to tat expressive piano poet, Thelonius Monk. And I think this comparison is not exaggerate. Jahmal ' s phrasing is a true invitation to make journey into the deepest roots about precisely jazz term means. He possesses that joy of living touch, an incredible display of color, an exuberant range of melodic vein that has deserved him the most eulogizing epithets.   This album "Live in Paris" talks by itself. Go for this rewarding album in which you will find all the vivid imagination and evocative mood of a sincere artist.
