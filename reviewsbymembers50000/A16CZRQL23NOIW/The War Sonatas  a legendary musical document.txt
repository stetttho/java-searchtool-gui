 I have been a hard fan of Sviatoslav Richer. His enigmatic pianism,  his technical endowment, his   portentous sound, his absolute empathy each time he played a musician's score can not simulate however his erratic approach, capricious tempi and even a certain superficiality and lightness in determined composers. His repertoire was immense but when he played Prokoviev, literally you can figure a lion on the keyboard. I have almost one hundred recordings of Richter, and if I was inquired about the composer that transformed absolutely Richter's mood in the keyboard, this was basically Segei Prokoviev. These war Sonatas are fundamental documents for any serious collector items. Nevertheless I must underline the Eighth Sonata recorded in 1968 is far superior than this performance.  The bitter treatment, the grasping arpeggios, the cynical gaze beneath the bars and this uncertain atmosphere, the sharp phrasing, the sinister, elusive and mysterious elegance is simply a very special trademark of Richter. Nobody does it better. The Sixth Sonata was a true battle horse for him Remember for instance his inclusion in the celebrated Recital on Carnegie Hall in the early sixties. If I had to name about other pianist gifted of similar approach there is just one: Gyrgy Sandor who recorded a superb Seventh in 1967. Go for these golden treasures before they vanish from the market.
