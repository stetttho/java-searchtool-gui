 Sinclair Lewis literally made a spiritual surgeon around the human being with his disventures and trivialities . This merciless story must have been schoking the most advanced minds in that age . The scandal raised for this work was the clear signal about its inner qualities . My kind reader ; I believe that any creation process somehow implies the destruction of the established previously order. Think about the scandal generated for Le Sacre du prientemps in 1913 , the Marcel Duchamp works , The Eroica , The Sixtin Chapel or The Citizen Kane in movies .  If you are an artist and nothing happens beware what you are doing .  This book somehow broke the walls in the early thirties and allowed to Sinclair Lewis to throw his glow to the eternity with this masterwork .
