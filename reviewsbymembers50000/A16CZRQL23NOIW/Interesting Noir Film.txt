 This remake from the Reckeless moment has many points to wein. The interior drama, the triple crossroads feelings in this mother, and the outer intrigue of the pressure exerted by the blackmail, plus a superb photography and good cast conform to my mind a film above the average. The picture is far from being another explosions and special effect picture. It's a challenege to the viewer and maintains its force till the unexpecetd end. Recommended without reserves.
