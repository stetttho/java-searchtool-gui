  This rewriting of the famous Jules Dassin 's Night and the city is an explicit homage to him. At those times Richard Widmark and Gene Tierney played the stellar roles in London surrounded of a visible violence 's atmosphere, desolate and pathetic.  The camera incurs to my mind in an excessive attention focused on De Niro and somehow missing the rest of the plot, those slender features, the low depths around the box. It is more a chamber work than a Noir film and it seems to be more interested about the personal ambition of social ascending, and not paying attention about what 's going on around the frame.  This is its main capital sin.
