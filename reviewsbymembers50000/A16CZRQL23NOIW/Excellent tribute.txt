 Elaine Elias is an excellent jazz keyboardist . She is engaged with the real spirit of the saudade ( a clever term employed in Brazil to design something more than a farewell , you may consider it nostalgia but it goes far beyond this meaning) . Anyway his magic fingers and velvet voice carries you to Rio de Janeiro and evoke the smooth mood and the seductive rhythm in every track . Elias made a sincere tribute not only to Brazil but all his talented composers Vinicio de Moraes , Milton Nascimento, Jobim these pioneers of the bossa nova and glorious and timeless themes such Garota de Ipanema , Agua de beber, Chega de saudade , Dindi , March waters ,Brazil, Black Orpheus or one note samba are some of the most emblematic titles of that febrile land so filled of charm and mystery .
