 Is it necessary to say this is mude film with almost unneccesary subtitles. The superb eloquence in Bressons language supported on Bernanosstory give us the most intimate portrait of a priest in a lost village. The poetic images are enriched by a precise dialogue. The multiple reflections derivated from the story are so many that you must see this movie several times , a priest with epic sense in a dark neighborhood. The methapors are everywhere, in the images, in the suggested ideas beyond the visual language.  In this sense nobody could give a best homage to Bressons art that his friend Tarkovsky, who after knowing him said in Paris these wise words: If we admit that Bresson is the biggest filmaker in the world, then the filmaker who is in the second place, really is in the tenth". I sincerely recomend to get one work of Andre Bazin titled Whats is the cinema? where Bazin (who belonged to Cahiers du Cinema) offers an amazing and exhaustive analysis about this film.
