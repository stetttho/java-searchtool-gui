 This double album keeps for you interesting findings. Fantasy on Ukrainian themes is a magnificent musical work, expressive and deeply emotive; the Russian steppes, the Caucasian spirit, the exotic melodies. Reminds us so much to the overwhelming kaleidoscopic mind of Nikolai Rimsky Korsakov, undeniably the boldest and sophisticated composer in this genre.  Mili Balkirev 's piano Concert is extremely emotional composed by clever nuances. Michael Ponti has a percussive sound that fits appropriately. The jewel of the crown may be this Nikolai Medtner Piano Concerto, a Russian composer that kept isolated from the musical flow in those ages. He was securely a potent source of inspiration for Alexander Scriabin. A difficult score loaded with dark poetry and elusive lyricism.     Christian Sinding is a worthy piece, and somehow is an extended Chamber work. Sinding was extremely influenced by Edvard Grieg, but there are curious involved motives.
