 At last, from those far sixties - when the crooners seemed to be something easy to get even in the most discrete tavern - appears this young artist, who must be in his middle twenties whose charismatic presence has surprised pleasantly the entire world with this sinuous but equally expressive voice and nice melodic timber, filling a visible void in this genre.  To my mind, Bubble has became the true musical revelation this year. He possesses everything a crooner needs to triumph and win.   I just hope through the years, his maturity allows him to keep growing up. The world was orphan and ( why not? let 's say it clearly) even tired of listening so mediocre singers who need avid and desperately the support of the Video Clip and great special effects to promote themselves.  This young gentleman, fortunately does not need any of these devices.
