 This celebrated and so may times listened Concert has seen many performances of all kind of conceptions. Even there is a curious transcription for harp by Nicanor Zabaleta, not available in CD format. In this case we have a warm performance. John Williams in the peak of his powers performs to date the most successful and expressive Aranjuez that I have listened ever. Ormandy shines too throughout his accompaniment with the glorious strings sections of the Philadelphia. Fantasa para un gentil hombre finds in Williams an acceptable reading, but the full acknowledgement goes to Andres Segovia. who recorded an unsurpassable recording in the late fifties. Giuliani Op. 30 is a lovely piece as well the famous Vivaldi 's  Concert, altough I felt this last work with extremely fast tempo. A golden recording for your collection.
