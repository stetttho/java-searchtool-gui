  Robert Bresson stated in his notes on the Cinema: "The important is not what they show me but what they hide me, and above all what they don't suspect that is among them"   Precisely in this demolisher drama Anthony Quinn makes one of his supreme artworks, playing the role of boxer in free fall. The progressive process of decadence and moral wreck is shown with impeccable precision and convincing dramatizing mood.  To my mind Ralph Nelson shaped this minor jewel in the Pantheon of the immortality. It will never be reminded among the Greatest Films in any age ever filmed but its inner honesty overpasses by far, many superior films.
