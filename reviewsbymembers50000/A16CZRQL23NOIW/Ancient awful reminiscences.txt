 Two women: One of them a  female writer -Lillian- feels and professes a profound admiration by Julia, a very illustrated woman, art lover and first order intellectual.  Through a very smart device, the story is told in two levels: Lillian is passing through a serious lack of creative breath and due her sad memories, we'll know about the political activities of Julia who has bet for the hope of a better world, inflamed by her antifascist ideas. Lillian has been designed as a free lance collaborator along the train travel. They have a brief encounter in Berlin and Lillian feels the coldness of her old friend: the war face sharps attitudes and dissipates standpoints. Poignant drama , wonderfully acted by an impressive cast: Jane Fonda, Vanessa Redgrave, Maximilian Schell and Jason Robards, four winning Awards actors under the impecable direction of Fred Zinnemann ( The day of the Jackal, High Noon, From here to the eternity)
