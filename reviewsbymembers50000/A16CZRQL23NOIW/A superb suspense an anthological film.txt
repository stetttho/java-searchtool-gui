 Wages of fear is one of the milestones in all the cinemas story. The lives of two men engaged in a mission that you qualify as no sense. And so thats precisely the most relevant point. How far can the greed, the ambition generate such tension state when you accept the special condition of carrying this special delivery? Montand an actor that grew up with la port de la nuit, years before makes an outstanding performance. The film, far from being dated, it revalues with the years. Maybe this film is the masterpiece of Clouzot.  And it constitutes one of the eleven best french films of that ddecade, together with Rififi, Forbidden games, The four hundred blows, Elevator to the gallows, The amants, Bob le flambeur, Les cousins, Diary of a country priest, Pickpocket and le travesee de Paris. Buy it this DVD. Youll be always rewarded.
