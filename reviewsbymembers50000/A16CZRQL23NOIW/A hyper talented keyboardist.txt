 The enormous imagination of Saisse can be felt since the first bars of the track you choose. My preferred tracks are Prelude, Images, Masque, Will you ever know and Proke-Groove  but there is a lot of pieces that will be waiting for you. His album is like a true kaleidoscope of treasures here and there. So go on and search by yourself.  Additionally, consider the contribution of Marcus Miller, Chris Botti., Andy Snitzer, Kirk Whalum, Jonathan Butler and extract your own conclusions.   A winner album that deserves a special place in your collection.
