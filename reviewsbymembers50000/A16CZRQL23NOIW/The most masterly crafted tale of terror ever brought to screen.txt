 Robert Wise made a gripping, harrowing and mercurial study of alienation in the human physique. A surprisingly and perfect film in its genre, there is a lot of hidden tributes to previous movies such as Beauty and the beast, The fall of Usher. If not for a champion  picture that would arrive just two years later - Roman Polanski ` s Repulsion - this film would have shared honors with Sance on a wet afternoon and Woman in the dunes  among the most remarkable films of that decade or any other.  If you add the impressive performances of Julie Harris and Claire Bloom. The male characters work out as support.. finally we have to acknowledge the astonishing camera work, the use of lenses that deform the reality and the fabulous artistic direction, blended with a perfect script, you will have to admit there is not any hole in this treasured jewel of this gifted director, who made his debut in this genre: Robert Wise.      A true masterpiece.
