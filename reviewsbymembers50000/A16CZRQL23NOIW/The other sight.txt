  This is a delightful who demands from you to be prepared for a prime time with a superb script plenty of humor, fineness and radiant freshness around certain Shakesperian insights. You may consider this film in musical language as set of Symphonic Variations in which Gwyneth Paltrow gave her best portrait to date.  A tour de force film with all the magnificence of the Great British tradition.
