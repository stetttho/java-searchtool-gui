 This DVD restored for the posterity, the craft of this notable pianist of aristocratic presence and elegant phrasing: Samson Francois who played a superb performance of the celebrated Ravel' s  "Piano Concert for the left hand" , dedicated originally to Paul Wittgenstein the Austrian pianist who lost his right arm in the WW1. Grieg' s Piano Concerto is played with such artistic imagination, revaluating it.  As bonus Maurizio Pollini plays three Chopin's works.   Go for this DVD, totally rewarding.
