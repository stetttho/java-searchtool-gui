 Ingmar Berman(1918) established a challenging premise a chess mate between a knight from the Crusaders and the Death (Bengt Ekrot). If he wins, hell live ; otherwise the Death will claim him . And this original duel happens after Sydow has left behind the misery, the plague and an unending war. Hes deeply dissapointed with God and certainly he concludes that it doesnt exist. This game will let exchange , scrutinize several ideas concerned with the faith , the silence of God and its own existence. God is a comfortable idea for the mankind ; it keeps them warmth , besides the man can dream with the hope of a celestial Paradise after this journey through this awful and miserable world. The ending sequence with the Dance of the Death is one of the most captivating and fascinating images in all the cinema story. Many people state this is the Masterpiece : and obviously to me its one of the three major achievements ; Persona and Cries and Whispers would be the rest . But Ive watched almost forty films of this brilliant swedish film maker and in his particular case ; a minor film from Bergman is above the average . So my advise is try to find out and watch all you can from this outstanding director. This film won the Special Jury Prize 1957.  A timeless cult movie.
