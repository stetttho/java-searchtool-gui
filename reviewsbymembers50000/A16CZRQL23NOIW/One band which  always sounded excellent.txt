 Traffic was a golden band. The deep and advanced musical ideas were far beyond the standard sound in that age. Since the first time you listen them , you feel that existed a huge rapport about the meaning point in his music : their originality. All the songs released were always one step hehind the rest ; consider for instance , the emblematic Heaven is in your mind , this song literally signed the psychodelia age. Togeteher with Fire (Artur Brown), The white room(Cream), Born to be wild  (Steppenwolf) and Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Beatles), these songs quartet inspired to a whole generation and became status themes , this music literally shocked the world. Feelin' alright is a visionary theme where the inner rhytms were inspiration motives for Santana , and late Eric Burdon & War (Spill the wine) , there's a obvious latin taste in that piece. And consider Empty pages , the most widely known theme from them. This piece has the immortality trade mark. It sounds fresh , even today ; try to make it listen to a teenager, for instance (I did it with my nephew, and now he's a Traffic's hard fan ). Dear Mr. Fantasy is so great, outrageous beat , so filled with challenging musical ideas, that it becomes one of the treasures of this band. And finally we arrive to The low spark of high heeled boys. I think without any shadow of doubt ; that this song is one of the top ten pieces ever recorded in any time.  It's a timeless piece ; in a certain way,  these musician were in a mood state literally dyonisicac , this rapture state you may find for instance when Miles Davis made A kind of blue , or when The Doors played Light my fire , Smoke on the water from Deep purple or July morning from Uriah Heep. These are special moments. Do you need another argument for acquiring this album from a cult band?
