 Petulia is a brave film. It is not a picture easy to swallow, because it is a demolishing portrait of moral human beings in a decadent world.   Every one of these depicted characters has something to pay, because all of them are incapable to realize his or her potential, in search of the total fulfillment of an ethic compromise trying to satisfy the whole expectations of those people whom they love.      This awful disorientation process obeys to a sorrowful and probably unconscious self destructive impulse. Lester would seem to underline the terrible ethic abyss between the undeniable advances of all order in an opulent society and a hunger soul, lack of communication, affection and love.  Petulia represents the new order. She wants to live several lives in just one; Oliver is his personal hobby, she intends desperately to find the perfect man, and through this self convincing, tries to join the pieces of a messy puzzle, with the best of both men. There is self indulgence, compassion and a serious stage of ambitioned change but without risking. That state of mind only can lead to assume the life as impersonal experience, because you are not able to face your own demons. She possesses the force enough to change of mind but not the necessary courage to give the final leap. That fact is underlined dramatically in the last lines of the film, when she pronounces the name Archie before falling asleep. Somehow you can realize certain similitude with Rosebud, admitting the sleep is a brief evasion, where the happiness in case of being absent, you have to invent it by yourself through the most common of devices; the conformism, that represents a symbol of inaction or renounce.         The rest of the characters are subject to life 's fluctuations, and this brief encounter of vanished illusions comes nowhere but it simply transform.   But finally the time has come for this film to rescue it and conferring its genuine value as one of the most mature films of the American Cinema in any age, proving this way Ingmar Bergman concerns through his relevant career do not seem to be so distant from this border of the Atlantic. This is undeniably Mark Lester ` major artistic stature film ever made!               So consider this film as well The swimmer( see my review about it) as the best exponents of the Author Cinema in 1968. Go for both of them.
