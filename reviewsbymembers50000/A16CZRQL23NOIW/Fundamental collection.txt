 Since this album is an excellent compilation of several previous albums, from the first bars of every track you feel automatically the flight to another musical sphere . Davis was a poet with intense sense of the rapture and  Bacchic  expression  all the way . I fall in love too easily is a love statement. I thought about you is simply a landmark in the jazz . The smooth warmth and the sliding sound trumpet of Davis prepares to a encounter with Venus . You feel the one million per cent commitment of M.D. playing this milestone piece. My ship is an amazing piece .It was composed by Ira Gershwin and Davis is simply floating in this aural atmosphere. Someday my prince will come is a theme with variations . Dynamic flows and wonderful mood. And we come to one of the highest peaks of the CD: Stella by starlight does not need presentation. Any medium melomaniac will enjoy with sublime joy this golden version . But the jewel of the crown is definitively My funny Valentine one of the three best themes in jazz any age .Recorded live in Lincoln Center New York on January 12 , 1964 this version simply has no equal in its style . Davis in the peak of his musical powers . But the rest of the team is : Ron Carter in the bass , Herbie Hancock in the piano and Tony Williams in the drums .  Expression and ravishing inspiration make of this theme by itself more than deserved the buying of this album. A must for any lover jazz music .
