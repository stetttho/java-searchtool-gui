 Ridley Scott is one of the top directors in the world. That's undeniable , but what happened with this one? The plot is boring , even ridiculous . Nicolas Cage is perfect in his role but the script goes to nowhere . This film seems inspirated for House of games and a moral lesson for fathers. And the film remains in the middle of the road. I couldn't believe this film carried the signature of Ridley Scott. A minor movie for a status director . As you see the marriage can not result in a happy ending.
