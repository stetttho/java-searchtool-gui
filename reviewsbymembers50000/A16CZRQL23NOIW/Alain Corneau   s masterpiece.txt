 This sensitive and well gifted French filmmaker has given us one of most sensitive and remarkable films of the Nineties. In 1660, Sainte-Colombe, a renown musician, consecrates his life to viola da gamba study. His pupils and possessions suffice to satisfy his necessities, living without luxury in a great residence, far away from the Court that is so underrated by him. Since the recent death of his wife, the composer lives separated from the world, in company of her daughters.   Possessed by the memories of his wife, the musician feels her presence when he plays a fragment composed by her. This appearance will be continued by others, every time more recurrent, that h e accepts without care if he is getting close to madness.  A superb film with a towering acting of this Giant : Gerard Depardieu. Sumptuous photography and extraordinary soundtrack by Jordi Savall.
