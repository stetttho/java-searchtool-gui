 James Cagney made according my personal opinion, a tour de force performance and his most superb artistic achievement, personifying the leader of IRA. Through the innocent gaze of a nave student who sudden and accidentally becomes involved in rebel activities, Cagney will exert on him a spelling influence but gradually he will realize the core of the human being behind the mask: a murderous fanatic.     A ravishing jewel of Michael Anderson, one of the best and remarkable British filmmakers ever.
