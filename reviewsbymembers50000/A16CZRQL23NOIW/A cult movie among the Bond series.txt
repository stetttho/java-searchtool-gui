 It easy to guess the multiple reasons which many people has this work among the Bond favorites . George Lazenby is an Australian actor which worked worhtly ; and perhaps he never had the charisma of Connery , the male presence of Dianna Rigg one of the icons of the sixties and the prence of Telly Savals as the main villane saved the film from drowning . The locations in Switerzland are amazing and despite this is the longest film of the Series you never realize this detail . To be honest the plot is not totally polished and in the other hand you are before the most human and painful picture made for James Bond .  Since the facts you know the work has a noir taste and in this sense it was an original event . That reason may be well the hidden cause which makes many Bond fans do not feel comfortable with it due the sad ending . Another special credit : the soundtrack ; We have all the time of the world sung by Satchmo who died a few months later is another sad motive for watch it ; the rest of CD is specially listenable .
