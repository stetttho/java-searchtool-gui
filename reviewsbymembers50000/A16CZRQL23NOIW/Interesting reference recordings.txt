 Les Noces constitutes possibly Stravinsky' s most edifying work based on the ancient pagan Russian myths . Inspired in the nuptial rites . Stravinsky seems to withdraw of the pure fauvism of The rite of spring . He evades to utopian and fantastic universes to a world of impossible returns .   Eventually you will associate similar echoes of   Orff ` s   Aphrodite `  s triumph .  You may realize the oversimplification of the sound mass . And the whole plot begins with the laments of the bride for her girlhood's departure ; the familiar scenes with the consolations of her new experience as wife and finishes in the Four act with the bride and the great desire of all the guest for a their eternal happiness .  Ansermet conducts this work with notable precision and absolute domain of the score .  Ther rest of the CD is worthable but Le Sacre is weak with abolutely non understanable slow tempos with the required histamina .  The firebird is interesting with dyonisiac moods. Petrouchka has its peak with Ansermet in the historic performance of 1947 with the London Symphony .   Excellent sound !
