 Based on a Stephen King's shot novel, this ambitious film has several levels to analyze. But there is a Montesquieu ' s  clever statement that I would remind for you; "I `ve been noticed that if you want to triumph in this world you have to look like a fool , but without being it". Watching carefully this picture, we have to underline the remarkable and wise election of these two giant actors: Tim Robbins as Andy Defresne, a successful executive who lives in own flesh the shame of the adultery and besides has been sent to prison being innocent. Once he installs in prison he decides to bring hope airs to that hostile and inhuman environment. He will befriend with Morgan Freeman, and the time elapses from 1949 through 1966: three generations; three portrait Goddess: Rita Hayworth (Gilda), Marilyn Monroe (Seven Years itch) and Raquel Welch ( One million years before Christ) that will cover his passion for the beautiful women but also his dreams. His perseverance, patience and goodwill will transform the inhumanity and soon he will sculpt not only chess figures on rock, but the respect and tender of every man in the prison. Thanks to his experience in the Finances World, he will create a solid reputation and special status among the prison's highest authorities. And in that state of things, you will understand there are two suggested, deserved and  beautiful homage to Robert Bresson's A man escapes, and Alejandro Dumas? The Count of Monte Christ but complemented with a more terrene vision, even the circumstances not necessarily be the same. Stunning film and one of the most important American pictures in the nineties.
