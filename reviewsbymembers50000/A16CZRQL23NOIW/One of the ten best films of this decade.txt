 Malle made a superb picture in this autobiografical tale about the horror around the insights of a religious school in which a jew child is hidden with a false name . But the time has its own velvet steps and the tragedy will come.  The bitter atmosphere you breathe under the nazi regime in the France of the forties is depicted with superb realism supported by a richness narrative and fine dialogues. Don't miss this supreme achievement of one of the most gifted french film maker in any time: Louis Malle! I really expect the DVD release !
