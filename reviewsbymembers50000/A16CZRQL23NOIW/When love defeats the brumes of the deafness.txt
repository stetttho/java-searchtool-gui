 Singular and poignant story between a teacher for the hearing impaired and a deaf woman. A magnificent tribute to the originality and boldness to face such delicate and painful issue. Inspired direction and refined performances. Matlin won an Academy Award morethan deserved by her ravishing acting.   Recommended without reserves.
