 In the Gay science ,  Nietzsche  states : Every great human being exerts a retroactive force; for his sake all of history is placed in the balance again , and a thousand secrets of the past crawl out of their hiding place ...into his sunshine ...Perhaps the past is essentially undiscovered .  This Concerto is in itself a revelation ; one of the most original creations of the second half of the nineteenth century . The abundance of its melodic richness seems no equal in the  literature for piano through those fifty years .  With the only exception of the Franz Liszt ` s Sonata in B it makes for any serious analyst to find such similar work . The epic and epicurean ; the fantasy and the imagination ; the obsessive lan and wealthy incandescence of contrasted melodic lines conform a work which may be well associated with the stormy and enraged waters of the best Turner paintings .  Alkan was called "the Berlioz of the piano" . Its opening and fascinating bravura theme is repeatedly such a magnifique obstinate  is accompanied by bravura tremolos and sparkling  sparks of fevered pianism . There is grotesque humour and sinister tunes ; eloquent charm and unsurpassed shimmer .  In the Adagio the cynicism appears disguised under dark tonalities and gloomy arpeggios .  In the Allegretto alla barbaresca Alkan once more , turns his moods , and writes vigorous tour de force bars plenty of vibrating emotion . If you pay special attention you will distinguish distorted notes of the Hungarian Rhapsody No. 15 .  Only the masterful pianism of Mark Andrea Hamelin and his prodigious musicality made possible this performance resulted an undeniable artistic triumph.
