 Spike Lee made it . This film is a brief account about the last freedom moments about a dealer who will be sent to prison the next day . These last moments are clearly selected for him to do what he mostly loves . He meets with his friends and decides to celebrate his last traces as a free man . Spike Lee could to elevate the rank of this simply tale making a glorious art direction through unforgettable sequences without falling in the soap melodram . Lee is very smart director but his approach to tell us a story employing skillyfully all the european taste and sublime expressiveness meant for him one of his most recognized works . Bravo for Lee and Edward Norton who gave a top knotch performance.
