 From its publishing in 1929, this book acquired a status reference.   Indeed; if you take a retrospective gaze around the Venezuelan of the XIX Century, you find simply sketches without major importance.  What it really constituted a true landmark in this novel was the perfect characterization of those personages, so emblematic and representative of a country who emerged from the darkness and provincialism faced with the new generations of professionals from Caracas.  Santos Luzardo represents the civilization and Dona Barbara the barbarianism( you may easily associate both phonetic terms). Gallegos displays an powerful portrait inspired on a real story.  As a matter of fact my great-great -grandmother told me when I just was a child about the distorted legend that slowly was altering the real facts.   Gallegos made a journey into an unexplored territory and interviewed an old lady who met my grand-grand-grandmother. He just added some arresting topics around it but the essential dimension of this pretended imaginative story was real.  Eventually, Gallegos became president of Venezuela in 1948 and that old lady came for him to ask some financial support since she was extremely poor. She traveled from the High Apure, a state which is distant from Caracas approximately 1450 Km. (900 miles) and finally he gave her the laughable sum of $30 .  I just cannot deny the solidity of the novel, but beware at the moment you mistakenly consider this was strictly product of his inspired imagination.   Thanks to Amazon, at last I could express the naked truth behind the legend. All the protagonists of those facts are dead. And believe me, I consider it's an ethic must to tell the world some new and undiscovered topics around this famous novel.  The truth sometimes hurts. Once more, the reality surmounts the fiction.
