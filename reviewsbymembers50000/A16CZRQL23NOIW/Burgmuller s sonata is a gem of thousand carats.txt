 What talented musician was Norbert Burgmuller. Since the first time I listened this sonata in vinyl in 1976, I still wonder this musician is so underknown. This sonata reminds us to the best pages of Robert Schumann. Remember this work belongs to Op. 8 . So consider Burgmuller was developing his huge potential musicianship. His early death was a great loss for the musical world.This composer ownwd the greatness sense, deep musicality and above all a powerful conviction. Far from being a musician for the galleries he would have been able to clim higher peaks in the story. The performing given by Adrian Ruiz is honest, austere and felt heart. Buy this CD , because this work deserves being more known for all who loves the great music.
