 This admirable Noir explores the dark side of the human psyche until its final consequences.   During the first twenty minutes, there will be a sinister parade of prostitution, promiscuity, gambling, double cross, greed, ambition and sexual obsession that really defies any sort of logic and places on the crude and sorrowful perspective of living those hopeless years, of visible frustration, lack of reasons for going ahead, an impressive world of sordidness and hyper kinetic unbridle without limits.         From the clever sequence of the casino, where both lovers will met for first time, Wise handled the camera with astonishing clearness to evidence with a special emphasis for underlining the fieriness among this out of this world couple.   Both of them pursuit the same objective, but every one according particular codes, he is violent, temperamental, aggressive but extremely slow minded. She on the contrary, is cold, distant, calculator and evidently superior respect intelligence and domain of the human behavior. Both will be engaged in this web of passion, jealous, cover up and double cross in search of a pretended happiness that only can be made over midnight hours, where the jeopardy spies on in every corner.   Both of them will manipulate every one, sentimentally to their respective couples. An investigator will dare to show his jaws but he will retire himself - just in time -  when he is aware the hazardous sea of sharks in which he is swimming.   A memorable portrait of a rotten underworld, where nobody is safe, a room with distorted mirrors, everywhere you look at. One of the most shocking pictures of this genre, that will lead you the extreme consequences you can reach, when you accept to bet and challenge the broken limits of everything you can imagine and even beyond.  Fantastic and extremely recommendable. Brutal acting of Claire Trevor, Walter Slezak and Laurence Tierney. Excellent direction of Robert Wise.
