 Carlo Maria Giulini has been to my mind one of the most aristocratic, intelligent, wisdom and remarkable conductors in the last Century. Born in 1914, Giulini owns that special touch of genius that has been proved in several ocassions. There are several works in the Symphonic repertoire whose meaning depends in last instance of your personal world's approach. The list wold be extremely long but briefly I would name five classic works: The Eroica, The First of Mahler, The Ninth of Bruckner, The fourth of Nielsen and this work. What do you demand from this work? Fireworks, nostalgic approach, musical musculature,effectism or tonal poolish? Besides a great amount of recorded versions, there is however, a relatively small number of succesful performances from the early forties with Arturo Toscanini, Guido Cantelli and Igor Markevitch in the fifties, Dorati in the sixties and then Markevitch again and Giulini in the seventies. Giulini gives this work a remarkable stature, enriching the score with sumptuous details and rubatos, smart accents, inflexions, color sense and above all a noblesse spirit that personally I haven't listened in any other previous version. Go for this golden treasure recording. But do not expect great fireworks exercises. Giulini never searched the gallery' s applause. He was a honest and original master by himself: his personal landmark.
