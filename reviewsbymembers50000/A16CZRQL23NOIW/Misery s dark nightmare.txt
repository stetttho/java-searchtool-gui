 You may consider a bit exaggerate this statement but with just only six notable exceptions in all the story's cinema I had not ever seen such portrait which showed with dramatic precision the real essence of the human misery.  Thanks to an admirable cast and an overwhelming and realistic, you will feel since the first shots the portentous camera work and the sordidness of this underworld in the same heart of the sacred Rome.  This movie is supported by smart Fellinian devices  the black humor and the unfinished irony in this unusual family where the fight for surviving will seal its own codes.  Nino Manfredi made one of his best performances ever.  Watch this powerful movie to realize how far can the reality surpass the fiction.     One of the top Italian films ever made!
