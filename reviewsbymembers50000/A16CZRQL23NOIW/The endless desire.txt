  The difference between a caprice and a passion which endures the whole life is the caprice endures longer . This statement belongs to Oscar Wilde and it fits for this film as a ring  to finger. Since two couples decide to go dinner , that simple issue will turn in a bitter nightmare with innovative ideas and distorted state of things .. Reality and illusion blended  and linked by superb surrealistic situations all along this journey . Consider as an endless puzzle joke . The conceptual basis of this original film nevertheless you can feel in his previous film The exterminator angel .  Another masterful jewel of this unique director Luis Buuel.
