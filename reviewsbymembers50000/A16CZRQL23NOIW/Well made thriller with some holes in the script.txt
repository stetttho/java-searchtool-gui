 The first aspect to remark about this singular intrigue movie and psychological riddles is the sumptuous camera of this promising director.    The terrible moments of woman in disgrace (Jodie Foster) has become widow and her only desire is to repatriate her husband `s ashes from Berlin to USA. She will fly with her daughter. In spite of the minimum valuable information, we know she is a famed engineer in Aeronautic Engineer.  There are reasons to assume she has been termed the human bait in order to obtain Fifty millions dollars through hidden motivations that finally are not revealed ( and this is possibly its major default) a dense brume around the script that let the viewer unsatisfied at the end of the movie.
