 Gabriela Montero is an outstanding artist. She possesses the Dionysian touch, an imaginative romantic flight and careful phrasing. Personally I've been at least in twelve Concerts and Recitals during the nineties, and I had the immense honor to meet her and exchanging several standpoints.  Her Chopin reminds us to Rubinstein' s  approach, very slender and romantic. I have problems with Rachmaninov ' s Second Sonata; I feel the First movement extremely restrained with very slow tempi with a certain lack of idiomatic expression in search of the romantic vein.         The Preludes well articulated and so Liszt `s Paraphrase on Verdi's Rigoletto. This formidable Venezuelan pianist has a promissory future. She uses to make concerts in USA and for this moment (35) I'm sure she will display all her experience, undeniable potential and supreme musicality to shine in the firmament of the great pianists around the world.  Don't forget her name!
