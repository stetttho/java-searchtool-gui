 Youll find this movie a real tour de force with a script that doesnt seem get old, but becomes so fresh forty one years after being filmed. The presence of this mytical actor like Mastroinanni, giving one of his three best performances in his carrer. The charisma and beuuty of Claudia Cardinale (The italian image of Anna Karina), and the absolutely irreverent script supported by a cinematic progress in the narrative, the surrealistic elipsis that engage us with the different stages in the life of our undecided and troubled director. His dreams, fantasies of his childhood and youth, are described with elegant insolence. Together with Luis Buuel, Fellini makes a couple of directors who told all what they wanted without restrictions , with absolute liberty.  Amarcord in my opinion is Fellinis masterpiece, but its just to recognize that cinematographily is less border edge than 8 1/2. If you really want to have a real treasure cinematheque, dont think it over.  Buy this , because this film owns the landmark of the inmortality. One of the best one hundred films of any age.
