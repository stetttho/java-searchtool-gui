 It's rigorously impossible to make any list of the major exponents of the smooth jazz in those times without include this hyper talented keyboardist. Greg Karukas admirable musical talent is carved I relief once more with this successful work. He has not only a kaleidoscopic vision about how to ensemble and produce those engaging themes filled with fantastic musical curtains and expressive moods.  This was my second album acquired after Blue touch, and my recommendation is absolute: go for this amazing album.
