 First at all , the warmthness , the musicality and the virtuosism emanated from the soul of this reinassance man establishes a sutil difference with the majority of the violinists in the actual times . Rosand is superb . And take in mind his repertoire includes several unknown pieces of the musical literature.  He does not seem to have any problem with that , and the works recorded here proves this statement . Joachim and Hubay violin concerts are not precisely the battlehorses in the most of stages around the world . He made the world premiere recording of the Sibelius Humoresques for violin in the early sixties and the Rimsky Korsakov or Arensky violin concerts .  I had the great honor of appreciate his craft twice in Caracas in 1978 with the Sibelius violin concerto and in 1980 February with the PAganini violin concerto No. 1 . He is a charming human being , and gave us two unforgettable encores playing Bach partita No. 2 and a Paganini Capriccio No. 17 . Try to get as soon as possible this fundamental issue who will let you know much more about this legendary violinist and best person .
