 Ask any person with a passing knowledge of classical music for one name of a composer of Romantic piano music, and he or she is most likely to answer "Chopin"   Try to deny it would be very hazardous. Somehow Chopin is the epitome of the romanticism in all its extension. Even his life elapsed as a loyal image of his own spirit. His beloved Poland signed the crucial dramatic seed for his inspiration. And considering such issue you may argue the nationalism was the real breakthrough with the oldest traditions imposed by ruler countries. So it is not strange at all the Romanticism is the essential nucleus of the Nationalism fever in all the world. From Pushkin in Rusia, Shelley in Germany and Byron in England , to Delacroix, Chopin and Berlioz.   These pages contain the purest and incandescent nationalist fervor ever written. You have several intensity levels and expressions. My favorite one is The well known Op. 53 .   Artur Rubinstein made to my mind his greatest achievement with this works. He exhibits that heroic noblesse so demanded by the composer. And you do not have any fissure to the romantic mood. The Mazurcas may be well considered the mirror image of the Polonesas , due its intrinsic character: written for meditation and nostalgia. The Polonesas are action, without time and above all rage for the ruled land.   I have heard all kind of performances: insipid, overdramatic, extremely nostalgic, sentimental and even over ornamented without that commitment  touch and ardor free of any self indulgence.  These are in my opinion,  the most idiomatic and anthological interpretations of the whole set. Malcuzinky gave an excellent version of the fifties of the Op. 53,  Cortot made a sumptuous reading of the Op. 40 and Shura Cherchasky on the Op. 22 but as a whole , nobody can match with Rubinstein in this field.
