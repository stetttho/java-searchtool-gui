 Certainly  when Mahler wrote that his Sixth Symphony "proposes problems whose solution only will be able to intended only for a generation which have absorbed and resembled truly my first five Symphonies" demonstrated to see with clarity inside himself to be conscious about the undertaken path with untamed coherence and , at the same time to take notion of the misunderstandings about this new work.  Despite the fact the conventionalism of the first Movement , you can advert the demoniac timbers , liberating the fury and similarly to let opened the possibility of fine evocations -  The Andante is passed over by mysterious trembling announcing somehow the mortal paleness of the expressionist dryness .  The Scherzo is surrounded by furtive ironies .        And the finale allows to glimpse the most gloomy paintings of Edward Munch with the immense pessimism and murkiness .   In no other symphony did Mahler penetrate into the melodic part without any discrimination as here, in this raving and frenetic storm of memories, livings and fear about the cruelty of the destiny . It turns almost impossible to find similar visions in any other Art expression . This interior blended sensation of anxiety , vertigo and anguish .     That is why it has been called the Tragic Symphony and besides it proves why the well know film maker Ken Russell underlined the dark accords with special emphasis in his film.  To my mind , there have been three sublime approach whose landmark resided precisely in reveal this dark side of the man : Jasha Horenstein , Hermann Scherchen and John Barbirolli .  The best recording of this work , by far!
