Geoffrey Rush starred with honors this extremely difficult character with lucidity, dynamism and so far of the classic gestures so typical in some raising stars , he was possessed of Marquis' spirit , giving one of the best acting in years. Dark poetry, horror and claustrophobic anguish: you watch the film and through your mind are present not only Sade, but Rimbaud, Baudelaire, Poe, Verlaine and Artaud phantoms.  Excellent film and may be this was the masterpiece of Philip Kaufman.
