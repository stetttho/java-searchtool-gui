 This film deals with a simple concern : the feelings between the human beings . Ozu focuses his poetic eye in the increasingly Americanized postwar Tokyo . His unique style with the fixed camera at the kneel height is wonderful but it turns excessively steady and can result unbearable .  Nevertheless he created a vivid and poignant portrait about a father giving up his only daughter in marriage . Haunting , humorous and disturbing . This was the Op. 53 and the last one film of this giant japanese film maker.
