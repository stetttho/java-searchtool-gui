 To my mind the spelling charisma of Horowitz came from the heritage of the keyboard giants of the past. His kindness out stage had nothing to do at the moment he assumed his role of soloist. I respect him but in a selected repertoire of certain and determined composers. And Frederic Chopin is precisely, one of them.  The sublime and precise phrasing is still a matter of discussion around dilettantes and music newcomers.  In may latitudes of the world, his powerful style was profusely compared with the hyper romanticism of Artur Rubinstein, but we must admit his Second Sonata is one the best available versions in the market.  Go for this collection album.
