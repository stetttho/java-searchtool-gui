 This was the first vynil record I bought from this amazing pianist.Thalberg belongs to the last dinasty of an ancient classical romantic tradition; and he is a true master keyboard. Later I got in CD and believe me ; this is one of the most succesful albums of this super well gifted his skills are of first rate; and Wild knows as a few, to express technique and virtuosity without inflexions; when you listen Don Pasquale fantasia's Donizetti in a Thalbergs arrangement; youll experience of three hand on the piano; and this is possible because Thalberg divided the right hand , in which two cantabile sections are played by three fingers and another by the other two. Remember; Thalberg was one of the greatest pianists in his age; but there are another unforgettable thriumphs as Godowski and Rubinstein studio. Watch that issue , its a liitle difficult to get it but the final effort will be widely rewarded.
