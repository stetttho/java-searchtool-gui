 The adventure of just living obligates us to act and react in order to maintain a minimum  stress level. To face world in constant evolution and improvement in so many areas makes you consider the negotiation ability as fundamental device in your mental map.    We live in hard times, in which the concept of authority by itself is unable to resolve conflicts that concern disagreements of several levels, small, medium or big ones, that can affect the whole competitiveness inside your organization with your internal clients (employers) or outer clients (customers, suppliers, State issues, taxes) in which the concepts of urgency, priority, efficiency, efficacy, quality and productivity may suffer serious back strokes and undesirable delays due those little and insignificant details. You should not forget there are many things we use to forget because we consider them impossible to happen.  But the reality overpasses by far, the best team of Strategic Planes you may have under determined stages. To react fast and appropriately, making use of this unerring mechanism of persistent solvency, will save us many problems around your social, professional and even affective environment.
