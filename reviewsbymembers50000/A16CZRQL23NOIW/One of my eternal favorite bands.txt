 After the sorrowful, unexpected and sad vanishing of Glenn Miller, it would seem Ted Heath assumed with admirable humbleness and singleness a part of the immense void left by Glenn. The accurate precision in every little accord, the whole sense of rhythmic and expressive charm was a true blessing for that generation.         Since the first time I listened this glorious band, I became an instantaneous fan. It radiant, fulminating and loaded with persuasive eloquence.    Go for this album. It will be more than rewarding.
