 Since the times of Backdraft  we had not watched another acclaimed picture about firemen. In this opportunity Jack Russell invites us to invade the intimate emotional, affective and social world of these authentic and silent urban heroes whose way of living is not precisely a piece of cake. The script is solid, though there are certain overlong dialogues that tend to freeze the dramatic nerve. Told in flashback the script weaves the early times of this abnegate fireman, his marriage and a chain of painful events that will occur through his stage in the Institution.  A true homage to this generous Corp of men who risk their lives every time the alarm is switched on. Good performances of Joaquin Phoenix, Robert Patrick (the bad guy in Terminator II), John Travolta and special mention to this fresh, expressive and beautiful young actress Jacinda Barret.
