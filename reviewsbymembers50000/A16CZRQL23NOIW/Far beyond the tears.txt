  This is an admirable Italian artwork and one the most mature films of this decade. Three brothers, have decided to establish his own life and certainly the expected brotherhood simply doesn't exist. Due their father's death, they coincide in the Funeral and far beyond the grief and pain, this encounter will allow them to rejoin and somehow to contrast the ineffable differences and standpoints. Powerful and superb film!
