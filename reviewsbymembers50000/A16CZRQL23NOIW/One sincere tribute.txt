 This set has peak and lows. The second symphony has a hyper romantic approach ; that's its weak point. The third symphony is well built, besides it lacks the nature blow with its wildful force. The first symphony has always been a hazardous for many conductors. It has too much influence from Tchaikovsky ; and Bernstein knows it ; he avoids it , even the reading is warmth. The best achievements in the set are the four and the sixth . I've never heard a sixth so well made ; the woodwinds , the strings give that atmosphere that demands this complex work. The fourth is  unforgettable , but there's a performance of Beecham in the fifties with the Royal Philarmonic literally unique. The seventh is OK, but there are other options. The fifth is weak , and my favorite versiona are two: Segerstam and Koussevitzki. Anyway I bought this set eight years ago under The Royal Edition. I recommend you this set , Maazel Vienna , Segerstam and all you can get from Koussevitski. If you request me by Anthony Collins - London Symphony (out of stock in the most of stores) I must confess, Collins has no equals in the Second .   The best first to me is Victor de Sabata (New York Philarmonic)(See my review about De Sabata)
