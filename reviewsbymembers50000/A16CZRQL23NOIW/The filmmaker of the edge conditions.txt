 Werner Herzog has been possibly the most intrepid director I have ever known. He likes to drown in deep waters where the edge conditions are present to break the unthinkable limits. And this a powerful statement. Fata Morgana is a true jiurney to the desert's sands and still more. He filmed too a very special document around a vulcano just hours before to make eruption in 1977. So this is an important document; visual and existential.
