 When you live in an oppressive regime the human mind artist becomes a huge laboratory where the chemical reactions take place and one the most important ingredients frequently used is the irony , an intellectual poison which seems to work out to perfection levels in special cases . And this was one of the these ones . Once more in this special case and anticipating two years to the Russian tanks visit in Prague , Jiri Menzel made this brilliant jewel film about a young man on a first job in a small town station but eventually those twist of fate will become of him a tragic hero .   Bitter, acid , joyous and satiric film . And please remember: There is not any serious issue which can not be told through a smile .
