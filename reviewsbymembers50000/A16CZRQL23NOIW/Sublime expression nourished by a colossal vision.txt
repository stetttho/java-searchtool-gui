 Thanks to this immense and untiring activity in the field of the orchestral direction, his vision as pianist has enriched himself quite a lot: Barenboim performs these well known Sonatas with a splendid architectural construction; according Schnabel `s tradition.   And that is a very remarkable good point in this musical moment where the pianist technique is eclipsing and even annulling the personal approach in the most of pianists all over the world. Honesty, conviction, vision and commitment dress those interpretations loaded of expression and personality.   In the great tradition of the great Beethovenian keyboard giants of the past, Daniel explores and plays every little bar with that well felt intensity of someone who in Beethoven `s there is much more than simple music. In Beethoven the music is not a goal by itself; but a revelation superior to any philosophy; all his musical legacy possess values that are placed of the standards. There is not art without second intention and that is precisely what Barenboim has made with this fabulous cycle of Beethoven Sonatas.   If you really want to listen remarkable performances far beyond of the trivial conventionalisms, go for this record.
