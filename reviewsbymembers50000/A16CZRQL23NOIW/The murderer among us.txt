 This picture adds another superb guerdon to the well known artistic trajectory of this visionary filmmaker, who expressed the fears and the complex and profound state of desperation, anguish and hopeless in the Weimar Republic.  The extraordinarily well elaborated script begins with a precognitive burden: "Just you wait a little while/ The evil man in black will come/ With this little chopper/He will chop  you up". And this brutal murder of Elsie Beckman an innocent child is the undermost expression of insanity a sick mind can commit. But these terrified eyes represent a huge crowd of hungry souls that needed desperately to be fed by illusions.  The demolishing and dreadful human chase will include not only the one hundred per cent of the police forces but besides - and here Fritz Lang goes again with his admirable genius touch - the underworld participates too due the interference of the police in the affairs of the "legitimate crooks", using the "Beggars Union" which will be hired to watch any liitle suspicious movement.         Butt  the sublime irony has not finished yet. Once the murder is apprehended, he will be judged by a court of the underworld where members of the jury will include mothers of the murdered children. Make an instantaneous link with The Devil and Daniel Webster `s judgment and you will realize the surprising analogy.      In casting the role of Franz Becker, the murderer, Lang sought to use the accustomed stereotype criminal, when he saw to Peter Lorre, a young Hungarian, Lang didn't think it twice and offered him the role, ignoring perhaps Lorre would play the role of his career.  But  this character was even enhanced by the towering acting of Otto Wernicke as Inspector Lohman and Gustaf Grundgens as Schrnker in the role of underworld boss.    The rest runs for you. And please remember the final statement if there would be still any doubt : "We, too, should keep closer watch on our children."  Because in case you don 't, your children of the present may become children of the grave.  This is simply a Giant film soberly filmed and loaded of such precognitive significance. As the same Fritz stated in 1971 during an interview: "We force the one who throws the switch or pours the poison into the room...to commit the same crime for we kill another..."
