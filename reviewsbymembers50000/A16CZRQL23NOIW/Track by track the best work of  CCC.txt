 It remains on my mind that rainy evening when I listenes for first time that album. Those days on the vinyl sound and the experience was worthy. I had that feeling that I was in presence of one of the honest and expressive album in that momet and believe me. 1969 was a huge year. Cream, The doors, Steppenwolf, Traffic, Jimmy Hendrix, The who were bands beyond the standard. Something inside me told me that Green river, Conmotion, Bad moon , Lodi Write a song for everyone were songs made with the inspired touch of the genius. Its not a mere casuality that Win Weneders used this album in one of his trilogy road movie "Wrong movement". Because the whole work sounds so fresh like a summer breeze and a meeting among great friends. May be you find Born on the payou the most genial song of CCR ,or the amazing version of Suzie Q or even his eternal Proud Mary . All of them even  establish one step ahead in the long trip of this quartet. I have them all (in LP and CD) , but there is something youll never find in the other two. And I think its the deep unity, the cohesion expresiveness that seems exist in all the songs as a set. In fact , you listen the music and constitutes a delightful trip. This album contains like no one else the essential nervous that always surrounded that band in the last sixties.  Forever Credence.
