 The film initiates brilliantly; the first third part is reveals an absolute domain of the narrative technique, supported by a terrible disgrace and a hazardous decision. But, suddenly the script experiments a visible twist, when you remind an essential and strangely missed previous work: La machine a French film of Francois Dupeyron. Serious fissures in the script affect as a corrosive acid that weakens a formidable and promising story.  The picture is told frenetically, (who can deny it?), but there are too many common places: The character of Dr Wells for instance, was somehow wasted; he is the dramatic nerve of the story and the suspense and being the medical authority why did he have to wait so long to make such experiment? Obviously you may argue there is a tacit attraction with Rebecca, but you miss at least one or two flashbacks that may well work out as solid devices to emphasize the drama. This movie will be forgotten very soon from your memory. It was a fabulous idea but the relevant transcendence you might expect, died in the attempt.
