 Allen was in a surrealistic mood when he made this film. The powerful content about Zelig in the thirties is a bitter gaze about a disfunctional , a low level person , an example of the mass media rank can become. The film is abolutely delightful with countless laughable situations . But the remaining message after the movie has finished still turns around in your memory. Oscar Wilde wrote this funny but clever sentence . The fashion is easy to define ; it's what will become old fashioned tomorrow. This could be a smart joke . But I link with Zelig , because Zelig is a human being who wants to be accepted by the world , but lacks of center . So these countless characters mean a trial and error behavior , just for achieve this goal . And notice that Allen is original because he seeks and goes to the origen of the things.  And this film overcomes this limit.!
