 The forties , fifties and early sixties decades were somehow the golden ages of the film noir. However this last one had a major scope due the world's configuration . The Cold War `s phantoms (Crimson kimono, Manchurian candidate, Pick up on South Street), the fear for nuclear weapons (Kiss me deadly) made the scriptwriters turn their eyes for new profiles about the noir film. Even it found the criminal had his sensible heart -Rififi- and his weakness-Bob le flambeur- .   In this case, the legal aspects opened a huge gate for inspirational motives. Cape fear emblematizes as any other film in the fifties, the revenge in its purest and wildest fierceness. This brutal tale deals about a man who after being released from prison has not forgot who sent him. No matter if he was guilty or not; the point is he lost several productive years of his life and that issue has to be paid. Sadism and merciless punishment will be the cards he will display in this dark and fulfillment thriller. Mitchum stole the show as the out of mind criminal who will chase physic and psychological to the lawyer Peck till unimaginable consequences.   Chilling portrait, and febrile tension in this cat and mouse chess game. A must see, a noir film classic and one of my personal cult movies ever.
