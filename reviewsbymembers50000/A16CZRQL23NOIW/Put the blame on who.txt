 In Gilda we find several dramatic intersections that overpass by far, the simple title of Film Noir. It has many characteristics of this genre but it goes far beyond. Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) is an ever looser who suddenly finds the great chance of his life cleaning out in a Buenos Aires waterfront diver. Rescued by Ballin Mudson (George Mac Ready) from a thug that intends him to rob. Finally the expected codes of loyalty and friendship are established. The presence of the alluring and seductive Gilda (Rita Hayworth)not only will ignite the screen, but will constitute a true turning-point to Johnny due they were lovers in other times.  The game of domination will be exerted by Mundson when he knows about the relation and Ballin will make use of this fact to domain each.  On the other hand will make the best she can and through her erotic artifices and suggesting voice will intend to take revenge and make suffer both men. Johnny will marry Gilda when Ballin suffers a serious accident crash and then reappears to establish the ancient state of things. As you see this is an intriguing puzzle that combines cleverly betray, greed, wounded self stem, jealous feelings, and hidden emotions. Nothing is innocent and no happiness is free. You've got to pay a prize no matter how high can  be. Dark game of shadowy manipulations so typical of the low depths. A true masterpiece that has overcome its own times to become not only a status cult movie but a sublime and well positioned classic, maintaining its actuality and freshness despite having elapsed sixty years. All the cast was splendid. Masterful direction of Charles Vidor.
