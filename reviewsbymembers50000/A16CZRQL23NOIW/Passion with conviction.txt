These Quartets reveal themselves with frazzled sincerity and volcanic despair, his late affair with Kamila Stsslova. The programmatic set talks by itself.  It' s useless to affirm that as well as Smetana for instance, Janacek did not yield to the temptations of neoclassic sonorities; underlining with primary passion if you want his environment, preserving for the late generations the genuine roots of his country, creating in his entire work a well known pattern: a continuous repetition of few melodic designs, nourishing with the most fertile and purest colorist timbers of his beloved country.  This is a powerful and well acclaimed choice. Since I knew of this set in those late Seventies, this version seems to enhance through the time thanks primordially, to its vibrant expression.
