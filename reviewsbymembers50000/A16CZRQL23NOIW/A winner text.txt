 This book is a classic . With all my respects to the next authors , this book belongs from its initial release to a selected dinasty of works made with an unusual passion style , and that invisible factor seems to make the clear difference . The presentation , the precise comments and the appraoch given to every chapter where the essential concepts of Mass balance or Energy balance are so brilliantly shown that it is literally impossible for you not to win with this . And after you bought it you will wonder in silent voice of course ( Do we need a teacher for Chemical Engineering Principles? ) . If you acquire this one and then the Whitwell and Tonner (see my review) , How can you lose ? Fundamental for Chemical , Production and Industrial Engineering.
