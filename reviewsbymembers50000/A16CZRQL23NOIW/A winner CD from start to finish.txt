 This is a wise buy . This CD is loaded with rapture in every track you wish . Let's make a random choice . The version of warren Vach is one of the most expressive and idiomatic I have ever heard. Round midnight is the first track and obviously is a deserved homage to Thelonius Monk , this jazz legend . Charles Brown makes a very worthy rendition and wins . St Louis Blues may be well the jewel crown of this selection . Serenity, erotism and passion hidden behind the score . Blue in Green is terrific too and Imagination of Woody Shaw is an excellent for having a good fun and pleasant meeting no matter the nature of your encounter be. Rubby my dear with Hank Jones  and My ideal with Sonny Criss are unforgettable works . In sum this CD is a must for all jazz lovers and even you do not , acquire it too to get closer to this unexhaustive rhythm : the jazz in a rainy afternoon.
