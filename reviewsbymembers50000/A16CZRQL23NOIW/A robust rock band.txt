 Five important bands cornered the musical scene in the eighties: Metalica, Van Halen, Police and Marillion and Iron Maiden. . Of course the question about the fugacious appearing of groups as the Sex Pistols or the full musical development of others not necessarily born in the eighties are not included just because the relevance and late influence of new associations like Pantera, Alice in chains, INXS. That list my dear reader is not pretentious and is far from being definitive. It obeys simply to a particular appreciation about what's going on in those moments.  Van Halen constituted one of the heralds to bring back the rock new airs, after half decade of full heavy rock and a sort of taut in the most of the bands between 1976 and 1981 obscured by dense clouds of the now forgotten but intoxicating Disco Music that literally saturated practically all the conceivable spaces.  His best known and most commercial themes are Jump, Can't stop loving you, but Ain't talking' `bout love, Runnin' with the devil, Unchained, the riffs in Why can't this be love, Right now,  are superb and worthy of mention at the moment to consider the originality, expressive force and hard beating of this enviable well synchronized and balanced heavy sound ensemble. I regret deeply the exclusion of his well made remake of Pretty woman
