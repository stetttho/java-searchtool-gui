 Based on the hyper known last farewell of Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca, will emerge a fabulous, extraordinary and funny script that will allow Allen to lean  on Bogart `s spirit to guide him about his personal hesitations and tribulations around the bride of his best friend.  Surrealist and inventive; tantalizing and evocative that counts with an excellent cast. Do not miss it for any reason.
