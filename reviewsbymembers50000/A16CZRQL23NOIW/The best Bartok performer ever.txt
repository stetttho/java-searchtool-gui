 I had the huge privilege of watching Mr. Sandor a couple times in Caracas. One of these he played the third Concert of Bela Bartok and the second recital December 9 1982 Sandor played The funerailles of Liszt, the Marozzek Dances of Kodaly and that incredible performance given of Outdoors from Bartok. At the end of the recital he gave a brief interview and talked about his friend Bartok, a great man , very illustrated, and domained fourteen languages. I knew about him many years before those recitals. When you listen Mr. Sandor above all, you have the absolute sensation you are in front an exceptional artist; honesty, conviction and overpowered pianistic skills . This proteg of Bartok and exception witness of many interesting details about the life of this unique composer in XX century, gave the premiere of the third concert in 1945 with Ormandy and Philadelphia. Sandor owns a gift approach that no one performer of Bartok has. And believe me, Ive tried with Kocsis, Schiff, Anda, Perahia, Richter, among others. They are very good pianists but lack the wild conception and the roughness playing , they seem to be walking in a cloudy landscape, and his playing sounds OK but lack the idiomatic tone, percusiveness and incisiveness that Bartok demands for the performer. Sandor in the peak of his pianistic powers (middle of the sixties) gives the best of his craft in these five CD that resumes a whole life, surrounded and permeated of livings and experience that can not be taken to the score. Watch this set if you are a Bartok admirer as I do. And you can forget all the others performers.
