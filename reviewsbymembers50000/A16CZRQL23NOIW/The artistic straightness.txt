 Murray Perahia's musical integrity is unquestionable. Every time you listen this admirable pianist you feel the astonishing clarity of his impeccable phrasing as the final result of a conviction, a long journey that began in his soul and finished in his hands.  There are just a few pianists in the world who still maintain a musical thought (that has became an authentic rareness) far beyond the astonishing technique and refinement. Perahia playing is ambitious; that 's why he sounds so interesting and ever challenging the traditional canons.   In 2006 I really hope Perahia will record again Mozart 's  Complete Piano works. So keep in mind this formidable artist of the piano.
