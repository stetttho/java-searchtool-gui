 This western is absolutely unusual until you realize Robert Altman is the camera eye. The world of two outsiders, who eventually meet one each other to become a common society. To instal a bordhel in the West.  Robert Altman has been one of the most intelligent and enigmatic directors in any age. He works out with the camera was a true scalpel and disects the human nature from all the angles: difuse, violent, oscure and metaphoric. Through the years, Altman has not got back every single inch in this approach. He likes to work in the insanity's frontiers, surrounded by the  febrile anguish and desperation: in this sense, he is very closed to Werner Herzog, despite Altman is more urban than him.   Warren Beaty grow up as any other actor working with Julie Christie, one of the most remarkable female icons of the stardom in those ages. Go for this cult movie, so many times forgotten for a broad audience.
