 Nowadays, only a dinasty of talents plays like this band. An unsaid comittment missed.  Captain beyond was a legend in the widest sense of the word. His riffs, the evil rhytms, hard beatings and new sounds are unbelievable ; his fresh and original ideas are far beyond the standard in that age. Captain Beyond remained as Blind Faith, for instance , like a lone star in the crowd of rock bands. To be true the standard level in 1972 was very high , but the sound youll find in every track of that glorious work is unique.  In many ways this band surpased musically his own time as The Doors or Vanilla Fudge; in fact if you pay attention  to another extraordinary band as Rainbow ; you find common roots. THe guitar is just virtuosi , and the bass and drums are at his level. One of the most inspired rock album ever made in all the story.  Believe me when I say that statement: this is one of the best seven rock albums in any age. Get this one as soon as you can. And this advise is for the seven rock generations to date. A must in your collection.
