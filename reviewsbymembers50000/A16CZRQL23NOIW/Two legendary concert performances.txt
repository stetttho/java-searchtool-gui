 The Fifth Symphony was recorded on April 9 1933. The date is extremely important. His febrile temperament looks like the delicate and unstable state of the things in the world. The Italian Master travels constant and eagerly. And despite the genius blossoms, illuminating the score in every one of his musical tours, he is son of his Age and the dark shadows that waggle on the world do not announce limpid horizons. This reading express eloquently this supreme conviction. Beethoven 's personality added with this universal patrimony as the Fifth Symphony represents, has constituted much more than a simple device of artistic expression. The eighty per cent of the mankind still is far to understand the richness and the whole significance of this mythic work. The fierceness and sharp dissonances, the visible contrast between the verticality (fate) and horizontality ( the human will) are confronted over and over, and it is precisely the triumph of the will (in the Greek meaning) what it confers this Symphony its enviable and supreme place.  The Eroica recorded in 1939, remains possibly as my favorite interpretation of all the previous or later versions of the Italian Master. It is loaded of such visceral and mercurial conviction and steeled dignity in the Funeral March; filled with sublime expressiveness and energy that must be included between the supreme versions ever made about this colossal and milestone work.  So there is more than a reason to acquire this invaluable historic document. There must not be any single doubt about it.   Finally I would like to finish with the final statement written by Frtwangler to a friend in a letter:   "Will it be that Beethoven failed to us, or on the contrary were we who failed to him?"
