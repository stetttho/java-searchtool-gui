 This statement was told by Sviatoslav Richter - one of the members of the Jury - in the first Thaikovsky competition in 1958 . This performance is loaded of such energy and powerful bravura that literally lets you astonished . Notice there were difficult years in the political aspect ; the fierce competition for winning the spacial race was in its efervescence peak . Gleen Gould was sent for the canadian ambassador " to break the ice " and this tour made possible the choice of a very young promise as Van Cliburn was . The result was anthologic . Cliburn surprised a jury acustomed to listen this piano concert as his familiar battlehorse and virtuosistic features . Van Cliburn won the Prize with all the honors and meant for him his major achievement . After this glorious triumph Van Cliburn kept a low profile on the following years .  But this recording is absolutely necessary for you to have it and consider this one as one of the best five performances of this difficult and demanding concerto . In my personal opinion the other four would be : Richter - Wisloski of the early sixties , Richter 1955 with the Lenningrad orchestra (hard to get it) - and my number one favorite - , Horowitz - Toscanini of the forties and Ashkenazy Maazel of the seventies .
