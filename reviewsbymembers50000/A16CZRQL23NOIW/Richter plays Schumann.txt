 All of us who admire the supreme interpretative status of Sviatoslav Richter know about his variable temperament. That personal feature permeated every piece he played in his fruitful career. The Piano Concerto has been played for so many pianists in the most different approach. It is a piece of irresistible romantic ethos, who can deny it? .  This version remained indeed, as one the most prominent in the market for years; but there were many more: Lipatti, Michelangeli, Rubinstein, Cortot ,Van Cliburn, Yves Nat among many others, we should wait until the most elegant, expressive, eloquent and committed performance ever recorded : Ivan Moravec with the Czech Philharmonic conducted by Vaclav Neumann (a very hard to find CD).        That fact  established more than just a line; a true frontier, a reference pattern, very hard to surpass until this date. Richter 's performance is something inexpressive, he could make a major and best performance. But despite of it, remains among the ten best available and trustable versions.  The rest of the CD is absolutely perfect .I don't know about any other version of Introduction and Allegro capable to match with it. His Novelette is very expressive and sensitive with the only exception of the monumental version of Wilhelm Kempff and one register of Emil Gilels.  The Toccata is simply memorable; there are , however two very remarkable version: Martha Argerich and Vladimir Horowitz. The Waldzsenen Op. 82 is a a very genuine jewel.  Go for this, keeping in mind there are better options respect the piano Concerto.
