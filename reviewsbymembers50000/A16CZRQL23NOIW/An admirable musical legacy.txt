 The Vienna Philharmonic is one the world `s leading recording orchestras. Ever since his first recording of Beethoven `s 6th Symphony under Franz Schalk in 1928, work on studio has undoubtedly, taken up a considerable part its time.  As I have stated the historical encounter among Mahler and Walter in 1901 configured one of the most fecund and fruitful musical contributions. This fortunate encounter late friendship not only enhanced and widened the vision, but besides nourished the artistic personality and vigorous vitality of this reminded master.   And according this fact, Walter `s Mozart is so interesting and original; fresh and inventive. The serenity and cosmic dimension were always the main factors that enriched the score every time Walter decided to perform anyone of his works.   Walter had always a special and not hidden predilection for Mahler `s Fourth. That ` s a powerful signal at the moment to consider Mozart `s sound under Walter 's baton. This is one of the most emblematic evidences after this brief introduction. Maybe the only conductor who always saw the enormous tonal richness under the score was the great Sandor Vegh.  Most of conductors in the actuality seemed to disdain this aspect and prefer to concentrate themselves in the expansiveness or impregnate Mozart of Pre Beethovenian echoes. That may be result effective in a reduced number of works but it 's extremely risky and even mistakenly to pretend coloring Mozart `s musical texture under this perspective.  His Schubert is pleasant to listen , but there are better options. In what Haydn concerns it' s a noble performance.  Totally recommended.
