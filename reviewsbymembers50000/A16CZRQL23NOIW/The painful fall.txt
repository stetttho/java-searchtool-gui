 The historic scandal that literally embarrassed during a decade the highest spheres of the British politic, was not more than a simple reflect of a state of things originated perhaps, by the collective reaction to forty years of war. The social behavior works out as a big pendulum: it can prove its huge ability to resist. Along those hard years, four generations gave the best of themselves but the fifth generation simply said no more and somehow the pendulum took the opposite direction: in fact having reached the peak, the psychological answer was evasion and funny diversion, breaking the rules vertical and horizontally. It is not a mere coincidence the presence of so many good movies in the comedy genre. That  is a remarkable evidence and somehow it reminds the same behavior of the last period of the Greeks or any other example. The comedians appear many times at the end of the expansion of any society: epic, tragedy and comedy. Profumo's scandal was perhaps, the last downstairs push, a real shock for the Victorian gaze, a slap in the face of the body social that curiously assists to the birth of the British rock & roll.  Michael Caton Jones made to my mind his best achievement to date with this movie, revealing carefully the most intimate insights and details around this scandal that overcame the politic sphere to become a very hard punch, not only for the Conservators, but besides all the British citizenship. Fabulous performances. John Hurt as Stephen Ward and Ian Mc Kellen as the Primer Minister fallen in disgrace are simply overwhelming.
