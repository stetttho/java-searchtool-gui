 This compilation is very interesting . To my mind is just a little evidence of the gold songs recorded by this outstanding guitarist , the man who really gave the definitive impulse to this instrument . If not, think in George Benson , Lee Ritenour , Pat Metheny and this young generation with Chuck Loeb , Peter white and Craig Chaquico among others important legends of the characteristic jazz sound  in the nineties .  Wes in one of his freshest and funny works . Renie is an admirable swing and joyful melody. Summertime is a fabulous version with gratifying effects . Wes respects the essential spirit of Gershwin and keeps this pale atmosphere under the swing melody and creative curtains whose principle figures are drawn by the piano.   In this superb CD you must consider Stranger in Paradise is one of the most beloved and wondrous songs . The extraordinary swing , the drumbeats and the magnificent guitar of Wes practically make of that ballad a funny sounds game .   If you admire the art of Montgomery , you know how it is . It is very difficult to lose with this genius .
