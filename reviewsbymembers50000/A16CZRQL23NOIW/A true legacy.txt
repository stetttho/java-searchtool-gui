 The Beatles experienced an overwhelming twist of fate and undeniable grow up process in their career. Now that the psychedelic roads have been transited, they decide to turn aside and explore new possibilities into the classic lyricism. There is something in their minds about the uncertainness and riddles about the their future as ensemble. Every one of them has grown up by his own way and the differences seem to be major than their collective ambition. All of them know they established a road, and the first signals of rivalries begin to appear in the horizon.  I was just a middle teenager when I had that dark presentiment listening these songs. They seemed to be preparing to their big audience all over the world, that the end was coming. It' s hard to express in words to all that new generation who did not live that age, but I beg you to imagine the circumstances without looking forward; and for those all readers who lived those ages, may be it is easier to guess what I mean. The obscure sensation of Farewell remains as a quiet and stormy cloud, above us.  On the other hand, the themes of this prestigious, simply are emblematic and flaring: "Get back", "Let it be" and "The long and winding road" are reasons (just by themselves) more than enough to acquire this historic album.  What else can I add?  The rest is silence. And let it be!
