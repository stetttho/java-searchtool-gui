 Russia can be very proud in what concerns its keyboardists; it has given us true remarkable pianists. Most of them are absolutely unknown to us by reasons that do not deserve take into account. The basic point is that for better or worst, that insulating process permeated several generations. From the ashes of the WW2  (1945) this singular pianist has emerged with own light. Mogilevsky 's pianism is crystalline and elaborated phrasing; even he does not play the Diabolic Cadenza, his reading about that complex score is one of the most expressive I have listened. Adjoined his fantastic technique you can note a versatile musicality, broad sense of span and admirable temperament. This performance is accurate, honest and convincing all the way. I really hope that someday we are beware about his musicianship and absolute conviction.             Kondrashin as you know has always been a fabulous conductor, he never acquires the first page at the moment to conduct a concert like this in which the piano is the absolute leader throughout the score. Meridian conviction and superb eloquence is shown by Mogilevsky in Prokoviev 's Eighth Sonata. Although Mogilevsky has not reached the deserved honor place that should have, you should meet him. This is a magnificent opportunity, with two remarkable pieces of Russian repertoire.  Wise choice.
