 Released less than three months before Hitler invaded Poland the fil is a real mirror image of the dominant atmosphere in those ages. Le jour se leve is a perfect example of artistic achievement , and the finest representation of Carne's poetic realism . The film is simply the poetic expression of the authentic human experience and one of the highest peaks in Carne's filmography . You can feel the struggling shadow of destiny surrounding the happiness' dream in every place you could imagine . The black atmosphere of disillusion and hopeless immersed in one the central nerves of the Civilzation is told with such of mesmerizing realism that clearly you will tie next films as Paisa or Roma open city with the social background but very close related in which lack of humanity and reason for living in the middle of the ashes . A classic!
