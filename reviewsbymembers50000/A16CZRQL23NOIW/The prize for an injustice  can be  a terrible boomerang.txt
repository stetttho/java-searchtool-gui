 This cult movie is based on a novel of Milan Kundera (The Unbearable lightness of being) . This ironic was filmed during the Prague Spring of 1968. A young man , a clear metaphor of the intelligent resistance to the Status Quo, writes a postcard with a humorous reference to Trostky and this is a wrong choice because of that crime according the stupid Cerberus criterion . He is sentenced to years of hard labor , but upon his release reminding us a reincarnated Count he takes revenge by seducing the wife of the Communist Party official who turned him in . As you suppose the film and the book was banned  in Czechoslovakia. It could not be of another way .  Nevertheless at the end of the film you will celebrate this personal trick and also will remind the clever statement: the revenge is a dish you eat extremely cold!
