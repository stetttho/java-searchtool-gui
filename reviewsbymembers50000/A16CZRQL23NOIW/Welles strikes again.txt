 This legendary filmmaker was in his late thirties (38) when he adapted to screen this colossal adaptation of Othello. The film is visually stunning and constitutes in my opinion his best achievement after Kane, despite the terrible acting of the worst Desdemona in any movie. Nevertheless the imaginative direction of Wisconsin 's genius and his performance was offbeat.    This film won Cannes Festival with all honors. Welles was briefly interviewed and asked about if he personally considered this was his masterpiece to date, he answered this pearl- that constitutes a permanent life' s lesson - "It 's an excellent work, indeed, but the next project; that will be my masterpiece."   This is precisely the attitude of a true artist; the embodiment of the hunter. Today we have a great working day, but tomorrow it 's another day for fighting and so create, without expecting reward, because the happiness is precisely in this process.
