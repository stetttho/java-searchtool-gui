 The problem of the history's meaning is the problem of the man's meaning. We are in a crossroad between Western `s annihilation and the unification of the mankind. This essay was conceived as a defense of the history . The positivism , the existentialism , the new criticism , the anthropology merely descriptive and above all the mode of a thought derived from Nietzsche absolutely all refuse the historic point of view.   The history is to happen , particular pattern of happening and the whirlwind that generates. If there is not happening there  is no history . The pure eternity if it can be thought has no history . Fundamental and indispensable its reading !
