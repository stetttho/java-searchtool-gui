 This artwork has been always considered an admirable musical breakthrough in the musical career of Franz. The epic breath, the free spirit of the Viennese spirit over passed  the formal precincts of the ancient academicism. Creative powers' Schubert  elevate to unsuspected spheres, somehow forewarned in his previous Symphony. His profound admiration for Ludwig van Beethoven established in his inner conscious the imperative need to abandon the previous restrictions of his previous Symphonic works. And he did it. There have been too many recordings in the market but ironically just a very few successful. To my view, Frtwangler's 15 the September 1953 with the Berlin Philharmonic is still a standout, but there are worthy readings such Toscanini's Philadelphia, Rudolf Kempe, Mengelberg's Concertgebouw  and Istvan Kertesz's Vienna Philharmonic          But Frtwangler confers this work, greatness, epic stature and cosmic breath. This recording is a true historic document.!
