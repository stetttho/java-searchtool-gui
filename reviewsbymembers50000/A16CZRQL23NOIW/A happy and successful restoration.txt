 Just to think the fact these recordings were not available since 1951 and understand in its absolute transcendence the historical and artistic value of these supreme performances is by itself a huge motivation to acquire them. These recordings were made between 1940 and 1942 and the transcription could not be more successful.   Budapest String Quartets is the quintessential of the Chamber ensembles. They consolidated and guaranteed musicality, flair, passion, conveyance and mercurial commitment with Beethoven spirit.  It is no a mere casualty they have been inquired by Casals in his musical meetings in Prades as permanent guests.   All the performances are of first rate and possess that cosmic sense of contemplative gaze and perpetual melting with the eternity. The last stage of Beethoven, signed by a Farewell without sentimentalism and self indulgence is remarked and accented. For instance I do not think the supreme Quartet No.14 can be better played.     If you have decided to make an extraordinary collection of invaluable musical treasures, it's time for you to search and buy these diamantine recordings, that will mean not only a formidable approach to Beethoven but besides to be owner one of the most admirable treasures ever recorded.  Additionally the impressive format and its programmatic material is outstanding, with admirable statements and references.     Do not doubt it just a second.
