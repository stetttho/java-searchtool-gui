 To face the whole Scraibin's piano music is a hard work. Ponti knows this atmosphere better than the most of the pianists. He has recorded all the piano music of Rachmaninov and Tchaikovsky , he plays Medtner and Rimski Korsakov too , so think it about the huge effort this fact demands . The remarkable aspect to discuss is the sense of the span the fevered lyricism , the originality in his proposals and the deep rapport he sustains all around this towering journey . The Etudes (specially the well known No. 8 Op.12, in which Ponti plays the repeats before the coda), Vers la flame , the mazurkas as well as some unknown pieces of the inmense repertoire justify widely your investment. I acquired this set in vynil and I got in December 2003 in CD . If you're really interested for knowing the intimate world of Alexander Scriabin , this set is for you . After you listen this set , then listen Prometeo , the piano concert and his symphonies and you'll be capable of remake the previous concept you had about Scriabin .
