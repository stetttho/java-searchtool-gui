 Hidalgo is undoubtedly one of the top films in this year. It has in every moment that epic seed you always search in those films. Based on a the real biography of T. Hopkins, I think it's absolutely impossible to leave the last ending titles without being deeply touched by this story. Hidalgo effectively is a beautiful horse with enough charisma to rise sympathies from the beggining of the the story.   The locations and photography are first rate: two thumbs up!. The script never suffers of tension, the race across the implacable Arab desert, frequently remits us to Lawrence of Arabia.   This film focuses around the essential principles of dignity and honor, the hard competence will involve to just one hundred noble horses that will initiate the race though just three be able to cross the final line. There's a hidden homage to Raiders of the lost Ark and some bits of fine humor that works out as a true Adagios between Allegro con brio and Scherzo expressivo.  A singular film that deserves all your time to enjoy every frame with increasing interest.  Sublime!
