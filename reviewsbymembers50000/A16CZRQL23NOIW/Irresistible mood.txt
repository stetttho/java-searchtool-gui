 Jackie Gleason was more than simple name to become a status reference. Somehow this ensemble was the American response in the 60's to Frank Pourcel, and Paul Mauriat in France, Norrie Paramor and Acker Bilk in U.K or Bert Kaempfert from Germany. The musical legacy of this fabulous ensemble will be a milestone in the music. The magnificent arrangements and the exquisite good taste will endure as long there is passion for the light music in some corner of the planet.
