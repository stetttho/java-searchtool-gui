 This Rumanian distinguished conductor ` main feature resided in that admirable eloquence at the moment to remark the cantabile line with such expressiveness fluency and enraptured breath.   In spite of his accented and notorious predilection for the Mediterranean repertoire, product of his birthplace, he possessed that special affinity and easiness to engage with this wide kaleidoscopic.   His May Night shares honors with the famed version of Ernest Ansermet; his Ravel Spanish Rhapsody is carefully ornamented, accurate and musically solvent. He achieves to join the Impressionism with the Spanish roots with precision in the attacks and enviable phrasing.  His Elgar is refined and pompous in the great tradition of his champion conductor Sir Adrian Boult.   In what Dvorak ` s Eighth concerns, we have a very interesting performance, plenty of radiant elegance and persuasive idiomatic language. It is far to be compared with the incandescent version of Charles Munch but I include it among the best six versions ever recorded.   Russian and Ludmila as no enemies with the vibrant performance of Arturo Toscanini. Prince Igor is pleasant surprise; florid exuberance and outstanding vitality interpretative.  And finally special mention deserves this well known Op. of  Tchaikovsky; it 's refinement and distinguished phrasing in spite of lack the mercurial approach of Koussevitzky, the introspective mediation of Bernstein Vienna or the mathematical precision of Wolfang Sawalisch with the Concertgebouw, has its own profile and personality.  This is a rare album that allows us to know with major emphasis and thoroughness in that notable conductor who having died at 56, had still much to say in this competitive field. I would add his collaboration with Samson Francois with Liszt ' s First Piano concerto and his overwhelming Enescu `s Rumanian Rhapsody, that constitute definitive achievements.
