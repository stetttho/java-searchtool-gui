 This is an ambitious and harrowing drama around a mad housewife who belongs to the lower - middle class in search of her own identity . Gena Rowlands is one of the best fifty american actress in the XX century . She gave a devastating role in this deep and complex script . An unforgettable artistic achievement of John Casavettes and one of the twenty best films in that decade, without a bit of doubt.  Casavettes as all we know was one of the most irreverent and rebel film makers in all the cinema story . His concerns always focus on the human being and its demons who eventually seem domain . So his style is really disturbing , and he may be well considered an american director with european roots . The influences of Bergman and Antonioni are more than obvious . Widely recommendable!
