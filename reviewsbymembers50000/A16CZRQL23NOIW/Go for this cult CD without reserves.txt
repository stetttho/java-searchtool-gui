  Kenneth Gilbert made an excellent performance about these practically unknown Handel 's suites.   With refinement, serene eloquence, nuance and aristocratic charm, Gilbert goes to the musical nucleus of every piece and literally extracts all its virtues.   Go for this recording and enjoy it always.
