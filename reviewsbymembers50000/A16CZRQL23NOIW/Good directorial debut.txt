 This picture works out as a real modern fable. And this atmosphere is maintained all along the story through the eyes of a simple child who observes both universes: two opposite visions about the life. His father is a honest man who works hard to survive driving a bus and Chaz Palmitieri a charismatic mobster who bets and plays hard in his domains, a violent man who is captivated by this boy in a clear allusion to his frustrated paternity and the inability to establish himself as a normal husband. Somehow he assumes to Calogero as a protge.  The time comes and others problems will appear when Calogero is in love with a  black teenager. The racial issue will be other tension element in this well built movie that seems improving through the years. De Niro made a honest and convincing tale about the options in the life: easy money or hard work.
