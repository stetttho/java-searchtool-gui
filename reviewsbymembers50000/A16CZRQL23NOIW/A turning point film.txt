 This monumental cult movie established a before and after in the genre of the Film Noir. The project is ambitious, the characters are so well depicted, the dramatic nucleus has maintained through all those years. Burt Lancaster made one of his five best achievements in his career: the other three to my mind would be: Elmer Gantry, Birdman of Alcatraz,The swimmer and Atlantic City. In the other hand this colossal picture stopped the extended belief of the great audiences to consider a simple handsome face actor to Tony Curtis, who previously in The Defiant ones had proved his artistic skills. Another interesting aspect of this pyramidal artwork resides in the fact to portrait the bleak side New York City with such intensity level that we had not seen it from the times of On the Waterfront. Two remarkable films would focus similar premises; Orson Welles' Mr Arkadin: Confidential Report and Martin Ritt's Edge of the city.          If you think it over you may link this evil character of Lancaster with Michael Douglas in Wall Street. This man embodied the greed, the febrile fight for reach the highest power spheres, without any ethic consideration and a single scruple particle. This wholeness, and the multiple obtained readings from the deep insights of the human soul faced to the ominous presence of the Big Apple conform a true document, a must have for any serious hard collector of great movies of any age.  "The cat is in the bag; and the bag is in the river".      The masterpiece of Alexander MacEndrick!
