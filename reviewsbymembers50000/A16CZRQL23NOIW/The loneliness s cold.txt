 This is a painful and devastating portrait about a marriage  immersed in a profound affective , emotive and existential crisis;  in such state of disintegration there will be much more even.  Liv Ullman and Erland Josephson are superb throughout this intimate and merciless story.And despite the movie runs far the two hours and a half, you will not realize a bit due the spelling and absorbing dramatic structure.  A perfect gem of a five stars filmmaker. One of the ten giants directors in any age.     A mature, outstanding and major film.
