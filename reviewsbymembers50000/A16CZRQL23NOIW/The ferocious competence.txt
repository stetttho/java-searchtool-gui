 A humble and discretely poor woman , starred by my beloved Italian Actress in any age: Anna Magnani, will make the best she can for her daughter wins in this attractive competition.   Since this very simple anecdote, Visconti will compose an admirable canvas of the Italian Society of the Post War, where unsaid interests will remain behind this apparently innocent election.  Once more the artistic personality and the sumptuous style of this master Director is carved in relief in this magisterial film, one the most reminded pieces of the Italian Neo Realism.  A must-see.
