 Seeking desperately by all means Woody Allen will boost career over the hill singer Apollo Forte. This decade finds Woody immersed in high creative spirit. If the seventies consolidated his irreverent and caustic profile, he turns inside the human soul trying to understand, scrutinize and feed the most intimate desires. If Woody has to place across the frontier between the struggling reality and the illusory universe on the screen, he will cross that line and bringing back to real world, supporting them, and showing us those characters also live, suffer and have to fight against their particular demons.   In this dreamily circumstances the reality 's  terrible weight seems to diminish, when it' s faced against the pretended inaccessibility and assumed invulnerability of the fiction characters. Somehow Woody returned to the mythical meaning and psychical roots of the cinema understood like the possible land and not only a Fantasy land. He opened a new gate and in that is why I consider it as one of the most creative proposals of this unexhausted filmmaker.  Splendid cast and innovator script. A resonant triumph.
