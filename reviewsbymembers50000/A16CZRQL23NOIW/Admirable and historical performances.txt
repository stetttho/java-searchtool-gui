 These exquisite chamber works acquire notorious relevance in hands of this ensemble. Julliard Quartet is widely known around the world, and the presence of Rudolf Firkusny as one of the most important Czech pianists of his generation produced a such fortunate combination, that even the elapsed years have not parallel. Perhaps the only version you can equal in which imaginative flight would be the famous recording of Richter and the Borodin Quartet. I just have both recordings and believe me when I tell you that the same Rubinstein with the Guarnieri quartet can reach such level of majestic brightness.  This is a true file' s treasure.
