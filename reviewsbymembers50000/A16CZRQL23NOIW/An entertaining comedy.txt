 I must confess the exuberance and radiant sexual magnetism of Salma Hayek is possibly one the highlights of the film, wonderful photography, sumptuous locations, arresting sunsets but what terrible script. Woody Harrelson saves the film from drowing; undoubtedly Pierce Brosnan shows his charisma and Hayek is convincing in her role but the film is in the middle of the road. it is a simpe divertimento and its only aim is to have a fun without any other pretensions. Brett Raner camera abuses of the first plane shots and close ups. The argument is almost imported from the Thomas Crown Affair but lacking the stylistic elegance of Norman Jewison. If you want to have a good time and evade the reality during two hours it is OK. , but please do not expect too much about the script solidity.
