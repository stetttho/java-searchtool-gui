The unbridled rhythm , the prodigious musical score of Bernard Hermann and superb locations plus the adequate use of the colour deserved for this washed face cold war film a nomination to Original Script (Ernest Lehman), Set up and Decoration . An original and unforgettable film from the Supreme Suspense Magician. And please don't forget the known statement of Schopenhauer : About what it is said in society , the important is to be funny , the lesser aspect is its veracity .
