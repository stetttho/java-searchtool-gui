 These golden recordings now belong to the legend ; in fact this set of Cello sonatas are played with sublime commitment and deep sense of muiscality .  Casaland Serkin made an immortal couple .  As you know serkin was a very special guest to Prades Festival and since this continous relationship a great and productive friendship was born . The result for us was one of the most admirable and top ranks readings of those Cello Sonatas . All of them are remarkable but the two, third ,and fifth are simply unbeatable . Fundamental issue in your collection.
