 This is one of the most intelligent, provocative and lucid films of the Indenpendient film genre in years. Two very lonely human beings meet one each one another. The revenge for him will be a powerful spring to keep going ahead.  A slow moving picture that defines certain emotional coordinates, told with a minimum of resources but with firm pulse.   A valuable gem, a genuine and emblematic work of the IFC.
