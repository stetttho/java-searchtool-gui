 This is a disturbing and gloomy portrait about a man immersed and obsessed by demons living in his mind jail .  Albert Finney made of this character to my mind , one of his finest performances as the alcoholic diplomat in Mexico 1930's .   One of my top cult films ever made in my personal list of two hundred cult movies.  A genuine gem work of John Huston.
