 Four previous films have dealed with this similar subject: Dead again with Kenneth Branagh, Groundhob day of Harold Raimis, Butterfly effect and Sliding doors of Sidney Pollack.  Jennifer Love Hewitt and Paul Nichols make a perfect team in this poignant story. If you remind for instance, the dramatic crossroad that occurs with the tragedy of Verona ` s lovers you might interweave very fine and establish a certain relationship with the butterfly effect in which a simple fact becomes the spark of a set of overlapped events that eventually, lead to a fixed result in a sort o inexorable  whirlwind that apparently was nourished by random facts but that maintain an incorporeal straightness, no matter what you strive to change some parameters. Under this premise of somber fatalisms unfolds this single but well built script with overindulgent episodes that tend to minimize the emotional burden. Jennifer exhibits her charisma and sympathy that constitutes a suggestive hook for the viewer.     What if you had the gift to change the awesome call of the destiny? Must we accept beforehand the call of the fate far beyond our will? Or on the contrary are we simple circular puppets, hoping to be called? Is the love a natural force strong enough to face that premise?   The nature of life itself, has to be realized in acts of life. In this sense, it would seem the destiny, considered barely as a conjunction of spattered events, has inside its perpetual transformation and only allows itself certain concessions with strong wills.  Wilkinson is superb in his secondary role.    Many questions to solve, many items to discuss after the show is gone.
