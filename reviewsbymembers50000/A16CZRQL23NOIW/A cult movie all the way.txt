 This magnificent work is an admirable evidence of the multiple possibilities of facing the elusive character of the truth is what it beats you more.   We have a Spanish Jesuit in search of conversion; on the other side of the coin we have a hunter slave whose nasty behavior is an act of instinctive reject. But as I told you previously, the truth is a capricious lover. When Spain decides sell the colony to Portugal this mercenary fights bravely against the common aggressor, and then suddenly we tend to accept him. This fabulous picture, far beyond its intrinsic virtues, such as memorable photography, superb cast and splendid edition work focuses around the unevenness of the so well know absolute statements. Who is the bad guy and who is the good guy? Is the human justice or divine justice which must prevail at the end of this dispute? Are you able to accept the violence in name of God and reject another kind of violence, because of the truth must impose, but what truth: yours or the enemy `s true?           Admirable film that still remains shining with radiant energy.
