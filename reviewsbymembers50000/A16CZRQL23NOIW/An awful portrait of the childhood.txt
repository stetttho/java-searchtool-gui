 Based in a adaptation of Jean Cocteau, Melville explores with all the possible realism, the incest between children and their adult behavior. Those human beings in progress act and show the so many times exposed in adult dramas, but it is a difficult mirror image to watch because it reveals us the abominable repulsion and painful distortion of values.   Extraordinary and unforgettable film that has endured and remained as a rock in the middle of the storm.
