 This movie is breathtaking . And once more Sean Connery stole the show . His ravishing acting literally gave the required dosis of reflexive , inquiring and chess mate mind who will allow him as the effective antihero to win his particular challenge and personal when he must face the master and commander leader of this renegade corp of soldiers who decided to menace San Francisco if their demands are not satisfied. They are looking for the late recognizement and economic benefits for the family of those soldiers who fell in the war . The film is hyperkinetic ; the action scenes are loaded of high tension thanks to a credible script it keeps your interest till the end .  Even the formal considerations are a question of fairness , the main reason who led these soldiers to act by themselves will vanish progressively , looking for the action instead the dramatic nucleus . Nevertheless the film deserves its own place . It has personality and character and that is a triumph by itself in the actuality.
