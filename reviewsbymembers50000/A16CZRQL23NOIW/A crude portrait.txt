 Charles Dickens was the social surgeon . His eye focuses on the misfortunes  of a penniless boy who will fight hard , so hard against a money mad scheming uncle. This familiar portrait , obviously is a reflect of the English social body in those years where the opulence was in the edges . The proud is the reason to live to many people ! Excellent film and one of the most remarkable movies of the last forties though it lacks the punch of the Great Expectations, to be fair . This is by far , the best version you can get of this superb social portrait.
