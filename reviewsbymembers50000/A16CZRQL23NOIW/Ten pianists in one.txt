 In this time we find Mr. Ponti playing in Horowitz' s piano in Schwerin Theatre,  June 16, 1994 an interesting program: Chopin and Liszt. The Four Ballads are perhaps, the most notable example of passionate and virile pianism after the Four Scherzos.  The First Ballad is one of the most sublime compositions of Chopin. Pianist of the artistic stature of Frau Teresa Carreo, William Kapell,  Alfred Cortot  or Robert Casadesus used to include it inside the repertoire. It's a strong and declamatory; combines poetry and sensibility; fire and shadows and demands a demonic technique, articulation and triggering fingering. The Second Ballad (1840) on the contrary is resigned, almost sad, contains more than a lullaby, the lashing that shreds the quiet, liberates clamours that only exhaustion brings back to the initial melody in gallant mode. Afterwards the tension will gradually build before finally embracing the tumultuous and resurgent episode.  The Third Ballad is the most gamboling of the set. It's gratifying and its waltz echoes make for many listeners its favorite.           The Forth Ballad is undeniably the most introspective in character. Pregnant of reminiscences and memories, bathed by melancholy shadows and elusive dreams, demands an exquisite phrasing and nuance from the pianist. The imposing character and the stormy whirlwind of rage and fury containing in the left hand echoes of the first theme, leading to an authoritative end.. Ponti made an overwhelming performance, with dazzling imagination, very idiomatic and frenzy. The Nocturne Op. 27 No. 2, is played sober and  austerely, without mannerisms or excessive sentimentality, but filled of sentiment.   Liszt 's Ponti is loaded of febrile tension, earnest phrasing and passionate lyricism. You should remind that in the Romantic tradition two names: Earl Wild (almost retired due his advanced age ) and Ponti in his 67 still continues amazing us through his towering pianism. The jewel of the crown is the impressive performance of Reminiscences of Don Juan , a true de force. A very rewarding album hat will allow you to know about this legendary pianist whose low feature in the market has nothing to do with his supreme eloquence and powerful musicianship.   I have the entire collection of these Un-edited performance. Thanks to Amazon (U:K: and Germany).
