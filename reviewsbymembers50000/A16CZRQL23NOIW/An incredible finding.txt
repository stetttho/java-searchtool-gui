 Before these historic recordings were released for this label . I had in my personal collection the Piano Quintet Op. 81 played by Rudolf Firkusny accompanied for The Julliard Quartet as the best available reference. A precognitive sensation of triumph came to my mind when I saw this work in the CD store. Even I bought without any reserves . The result was simply overwhelming . Richter made a sublime tour de force with this Quintet . Furiously played but without lacking the sense of the exquisite refinement and panache. The Borodin Quartet was forced literally for this incandescent pianist to make one of their most expressive recordings . The slave flavour must be underlined beneath the score . And nobody as the astonishing capacity of Richter to create this suggestive atmosphere. Acquire this gem recording as soon as you can.
