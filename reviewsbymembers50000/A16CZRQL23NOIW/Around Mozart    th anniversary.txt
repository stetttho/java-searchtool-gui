 These two live concerts under the spellingbaton of themaster Casals, finds the perfect blending around two emblematic and fundamental Piano Concertos ever written.  With the 20th Mozart undertakes a fabulous musical journey. The gloomy character of the First Movement of the 20 th Concerto, its intrinsic introspective mood and the harmonic richness and modulations becomes of it an universe in its own. Lefebre made a fine reading, even I still convinced about the supreme performance given by Myra Hess under Walter baton in a live performance (Music and Arts).  In what concerns Serkin 'approach, he makes an accurate and precise performance lacking perhaps, the underlined humor so typical of the last Movement. A very recomended acquistion, being my favorite recording Edwin Fisher playing and conducting the Royal Danish Orchestra.
