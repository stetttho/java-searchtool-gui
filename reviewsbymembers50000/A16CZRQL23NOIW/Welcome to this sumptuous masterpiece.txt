 At last we have been lucky for being able to have this artwork in PAL format at least. This story about a middle aged married woman - Jeanne Moreau - devoted only to her duties as mother and wife but visibly love orphan in a little town will be perturbed when a night scream in the opening shots of the film be the start of immense parable of abandon, hopeless , loneliness and search of a reason to live.  Moderato cantabile is a true gem of this brilliant director Peter Brook and also deserved to Moreau her only Prize in Cannes as best Actress in 1962.
