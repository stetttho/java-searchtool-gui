 This is -under any perspective you analyze it- the bravest and boldest film around the lesbianism. But this approach will allow you to explore the most dark corners related with the feminine loneliness and ontological desperation.   Magnificent, mature and until now simply unequalled. This picture anticipated years light to its own age.   Not only a towering cult movie but also a must for you to watch it. A treasured gem of countless carats. Go for this without reserves.
