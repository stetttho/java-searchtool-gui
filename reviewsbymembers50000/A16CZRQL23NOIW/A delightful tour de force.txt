 Alphaville is a film that maybe result a little weird for many people, but it constitutes a valuable contribution to a sub genre if I may; a sci fi picture blended with surrealism scents.  Of course, the results are far from being predictable but somehow was a true stepfoward respect Barbarella for instance. The possibility of dealing with the multiple funny posibilities of this genre may be considered under the perspective of the most profound irreverency and besides the most sincere admiration for this well known archetype.  Through his admirable essays, Godard has showed us he is an incisive critic film, and his elusive nature reached anotable peak in the Sixties. You should take into accpount the presence of the ominous figure of Federico Fellini, Luis Buuel and Garcia Berlanga in the international scene in order to find the clues to decipher it. The narrative codes definitively cannot be incorporated with our 21 Century glasses, because we would miss the historical coordinates.   A must-see.
