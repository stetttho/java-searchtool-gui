 Casadesus is one of the three major champions of the French keyboard ever born (the other two are Samson Francois and Alfred Cortot).  His accurate phrasing and sublime cantabile line still remain s subject of analysis and deep admiration for many listeners and musicians all over the world.  This set contains an admirable selection of the kaleidisocopic musicianship and majestic elegance of this outstanding artist.   I recommend two sets of Mozart (with George Szell conducting) just available in Sony France by Amazon France. They are historical jewels.  Go for this one, too!
