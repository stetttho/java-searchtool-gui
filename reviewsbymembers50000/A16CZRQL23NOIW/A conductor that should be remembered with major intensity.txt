 The seminal roots of the whole significance of this emblematic symphony can be felt along this performance. The Eroica is far beyond a simple symphony. It is by far, the most mythical of any other work you think about. In this work the cycle of the mankind is expressed with absolute eloquence and clarity. The genius of Beethoven reached an extraordinary creative flight of towering proportions and epic dimensions. And this performance communicates it outstandingly.      Unfortunately, Weingartner `s style seems to have been relegated to forgetfulness, perhaps by fad `s questions or worse still, because the spirit to communicate a sense of real contact between composer and audience has vanished, but if you consider it carefully, you will notice how conductors of the status of  Thielemans, Barenboim, Asajina, Vegh, Giulini, Pekka Salonen, Termirkanov have dealt with this approach, even those examples do not represent exactly the vast majority. The conclusion seems obvious: popularity and charisma are elements that may work out in other disciplines but not precisely in this field.  He was a forceful writer on musical subjects, but all of us know how difficult may result this activity when a conductor has to conduct one hundred concerts for season. Neophyte and connoisseurs must get close the interpretative art of this old fashioned director that had much to say and so did it.  This album, specially reveals these facts we are making reference. Pitifully, the homogeneity in the interpretation has hidden the expression, the personal approach, stylizing and reducing the scope of the thematic material; this awful vision has trivialized and even confiscated the cathartic experience a concert should produce. That 's what happens when the concepts of art and spectacle are blended, because a considerable sector of the great musical audiences simply are completely unconcerned about the music is an universe by itself and has something to say, but only is assigned to certain composers.  Beethoven is one of them and if we do not beware ourselves about it, Beethoven will mean les than nothing, but certainly Beethoven is not the guilty.                Go for these golden recordings of an old fashioned but admirable director.
