 If there was even a particle of doubt about the craftsmanship, the huge talent and the portent of these two acclaimed directors, this film would dissipate it. This work became not only one of the best films of this year, but it was considered almost automatically a cult movie, and constituted the best entry of the Film Noir genre since Road to Perdition.  Plenty of singular details, with a prodigious camera handle, magnificent photography, a splendid cast, and an increasing suspense script, this artwork focuses around the minuscule world of an insignificant man, a barber who is cheated twice; in his personal honor and financially. Both failures are extremely linked and will work out as wrenches  and existential crossroad that will wait for him at the end of the road. He is a quite introspective man a misogyny who watches the world go round. His decisions and life project are clearly determined by others, so he is simply a leaf beaten by the wind an instrument of his extremely closed social circle. It's convenient to remark the presence of an invisible character: Beethoven's piano music. In this sense every time Scarlet plays the piano, there is a allusive and clear reference between Patetique, Appassionata, Moonlight and The Sonata No. 32 that underline , (specially this late one who accents the dissolution final process of Ed Crane) and besides the intimate mood of our main character. So beware, if you are not yet familiarized with the spirit of every one of these works, you can loose important suggestive clues.    Billy Bob Thornton makes an impressive performance as well as Frances Mac Dormand, the consented actress of Coen Brothers - Blood simple and Fargo - . I recommend specially this work, because to my mind it has been absolutely neglected by the critics and the great audiences.  Extraordinary.
