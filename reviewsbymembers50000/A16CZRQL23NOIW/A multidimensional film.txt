 This ambitious film has too many angles to scrutinize. The main dramatic line deals with the affective lack of both sides, the commander in chief (De Niro) of this Empire (once more the power and the love seem to be irreconcilable partners) and a trivial girl (Sharon Stone) who seeks the best of both worlds: the freedom she enjoyed and the financial security of her new status. But besides there is another aspect much more relevant to my mind: the awful fact the human being is not redeemable; this is a disturbing statement that may strike the sensibility of many beautiful souls.   Both worlds are simply divergent: De Niro falls in love with an ideal, (Pygmalion effect) and overlooks the real woman and her personal convictions, aspirations and horizon of life. She is much more convinced than him about this union; to her the marriage is a convenience act, a revalorization of her social status and a reinsertion in the new social spheres, but as you and me know, sometimes the past is a heavy chain of livings and memories.  On the other hand we have Joe Pesci, a newcomer who has been invested of pretended authority and love for power. Excess and lack of scrupulous dictate his steps and only the long arm of the fate will be able to stop him with the expected consequences.  Casino is last instance a modern fable; a film that reveals nobody is either absolutely happy or free of innocence; it? s a smart metaphor of the life. Once more the arresting narrative style is another of the golden guests of this movie; the fabulous stages are told with a beating intensity.   At the moment you consider a reduced list of the top Five films of this talented filmmaker this is securely should be included in the most of the lists.
