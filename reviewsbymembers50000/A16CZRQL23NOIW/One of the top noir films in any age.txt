 Raymond Chandler focused his story in Los Angeles ; so beware with this title , which goes far beyond its simple significance . The opening sequence in which we see the Gen and Marlowe talking in the winter quarters and the sweat we can see in the private eye's  shirt will introduce us to that complex underworld of intrigue and corruption .  Vivian Sternwood has walked two steps ahead Marlowe in this sense and she will become his personal redemption . The sexual tension among them is clearly underlined  by a clever dialogue (Marlowe: "You' ve got a touch of class but I don' t know you ` do over a sterch of ground" or Vivian: "A lot depends on who's  in the saddle"). But when Vivian concedes to him   that' s there's nothing wrong , with her that he can ` t fix , all has been said .  To many people the film perhaps romanticizes the original Chandler' s concept but Hawks knows the literature and the screen have common points but slender differences . And he underlines the irony through the visual and corporal language with sublime perfection . And their happiness is not free they stand near a bloodstain and the ominous siren encroaching the romantic siren will remember them and us the secret agreements will be part of their lives , perhaps reminding us that smart conclusion of the Greek tragedy : there is not a happiness absolutely innocent .
