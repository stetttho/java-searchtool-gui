 If not for the high caliber tension of Toscanini and NBC orchestra with Barber Adagio , this would be the best performance you can find in the market . But fortunately there are good news. The Tchaikovsky Strings Serenade is unique and flamboyant . The strings of the Boston Symphony were in one of their best days . Inspired in the highest level they made a terrific , superb and sumptuous reading of this little Tchaikovskian jewel. In the case if Elgar Introduction and allegro , the result is extraordinary , though it lacks the royal majestic breeze of that sixties version of Sir Adrian Boult , this performing is great but not the best . This an album for all those hard fans of the Boston Symphony-  the aristocrat of the Orchestras- , who under Koussevitzky , Munch and in lesser level Erich Leindsdorff batoons, elevated this american ensemble to the highest peak in the music . Thanks for this Alsacian master conductor , and his elegant and radiant magnetism , he impregnated the Boston with extreme refinement and exquisite sonority , and this is actually a devaluated term , and missed achievement in the rest of the Orchestras with very few exceptions , pitifully .
