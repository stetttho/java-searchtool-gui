 Ataulfo Argenta made an outstanding performance with this Fantastique ; the demanded atmosphere , the fairness in which the arresting mood is played , means a meticulous study of the score .  Since the first bars you notice the difference . This symphony is hard to play due his multiple temperament frecuencies . Since the onirical mood in the first movement , for leading us to the incorporean waltz which behaves much more as a macabre scherzo than a happy encounter . The third movement deeply reflexive is the key , the suggested background required for the composer is git to a perfection level .  The fourth movement is played vigorously with histamine and sinister elegance . In the last movement the orchestra leads us to a real catharsis , the demmons must be present around the hall and Argenta reveal them . Try to get this record and with all fairness , this version matchs with Munch Boston (fifties), Ormandy Philadelphia , Markevitch Berlin and Muti Philadelphia . Fundamental document.
