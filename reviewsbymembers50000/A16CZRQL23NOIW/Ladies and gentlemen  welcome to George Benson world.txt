 The guitar in jazz found in Wes Montgomery his most genuine exponent until his early death in the middle Sixties. Fortunately, George Benson became his most direct musical heiress. The astonishing register, the stunning easiness and superb phrasing of this master has become the most versatile guitarist of his generation.  This is a without time album. You will enjoy over and over as I have done through all these years; the album contains choice instrumentals cuts from his early years. The standards like Theme from Summer of ` 42, California dreamin', Summertime, Take five or I remember Wes are simply a must-collector.
