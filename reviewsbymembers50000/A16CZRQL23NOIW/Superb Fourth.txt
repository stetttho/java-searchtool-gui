 Paul Kletzki has been a neglected and forgotten conductor for a wide audience . And that is a real injustice . He was a gipsy conductor as De Sabata , Carlos Kleiber o Paul van Kempen , since they never had a full time orchestra . Once more , the London Philarmonic gave us another master class of how must sound an ensamble ; this orchestra as The New York Philarmonic engaged with every one of the famous conductors . Think in Boult and the Edgar and Holst sound ; the Stokowski and Mahler Second (1964) ; and Jasha Horenstein of course Kletzki in particular , made an interesting approach with this performance . Since I still consider Bruno Walter performances with the New York Philarmonic (1947) and The Vienna Philarmonic (1955) as the most expressive versions , I must confess my deep admiration for this one . It is loaded with sublime imagination and lyrically introspective with that special underlying fact of emphasize the ambivalence of this work which works out as a pendulum between the dream and the nostalgia ; the yin and yan . The transitions are part of the journey ; you must reinsert the nuance and the pain ; the sorrow and the joy of living ; the tenderness and the passion; the elegance and the hopeless without falling entirely in one of these moods . Acquire this version .  It is a gem .
