 The silent voices of the golden masters of the american literature (Dos Passos , Sinclair Lewis , Nathaniel Hwathorne and William Faulkner) seem to emerge as dark and invisible ghosts in this poignant and supreme jewel film . The dazzling direction of Bodganovich and his golden touch as atmosphere creator is simply admirable and breathtaking. A golden issue in the american cinema .
