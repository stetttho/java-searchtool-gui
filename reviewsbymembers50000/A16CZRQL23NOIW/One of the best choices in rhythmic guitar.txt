 This duo is simply gorgeous . It has such freshness and vitality in their expressive rhythm that you engage almost immediately . . Heat of the sun is a very appropriate  example ; Chincha is a peruan piece ; and Earthquake is one of the most moving and happy songs of the album , Selva is a piece whose character comes from the jazz and reminds us to Al Di Meola ; and last we come to the crown jewel of the album : Dark Fire : an erotic piece loaded of a dark poetry and suggesting light and shadows melody and clear Spanish influence . Bola is a frenetic piece filled with Flamenco airs while Anaconda is the  longer piece and gifted of experimental character, Twilight at the Zuq is a very  Spanish work very expressive and Zapateao rhythm . Jardin is my second choice , vivid piece filled of love for life and exquisite beating . Americas is the last piece and it is the fussion piece the only of them not instrumental . It a cross between the latin mood and Spanish rapture .
