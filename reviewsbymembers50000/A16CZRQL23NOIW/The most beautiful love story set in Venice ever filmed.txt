 Katherine Hepburn and Rossano Brazi gave a tour de force acting and won in these wonderful locations . She will be loved with passion but above all with flamboyant sensitivity  and powerful imagination . She is searching for affection and will find her bliss in hands of this artist .  Once more the masterful mind of David Lean elevated this slender story to cosmic heights. The charismatic presence of Hepburn - who never was so natural in any other previous or later film - and the touch of class of her Italian pretender made of this film a real classic all the way .   A must for you to watch it !
