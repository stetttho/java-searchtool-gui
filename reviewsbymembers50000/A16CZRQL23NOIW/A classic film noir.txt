 This work was the most powerful movie of William Friedkin . Supported by a very well elaborated script , high caliber tension and first rate cast .  Fernando Rey this unforgettable spanish actor plays the role of the master brain of the operation . Gene Hackman was in his second best film (after The conversation)playing the role of Popeye dole who sounds a little ridiculous but that worked out . The car chase in New York city streets is a classic.
