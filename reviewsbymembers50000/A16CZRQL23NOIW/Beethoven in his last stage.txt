 With regard to Richter' s Beethoven I have to make restrictions. In this sense I 'd like to begin with a succinct comment about his "Hammerklavier" performing. As you know this Sonata finds Beethoven in what we can denominate his last years a period far beyond the Crisis Ages that we might locate between 1813 and 1815. Written between 1817 and 1819, this work coincides also with the beginning of his last Symphony. These are times of major conceptual density and limited creative fecundity . Beethoven looks for spiritual guarantee and his regard turns inward: contemplation, reflection and introspection. They are wisdom expressions, mythically speaking the hero returns in an ascending journey in search of redemption, the wise innocence and the reencounter with the cosmos in search of integration (that' s very typical of the Oriental religions: the dissolution in the wholeness, what it equals to the suppression of the individuality) and there is not a better musical form to express that anima state that the Fugue form.  Richter seems to be more interested to remark the ontological loneliness rather to underline the profound existential crisis that means to be ignored and relegated in Vienna. The echoes of the French Revolution have reached them. The most of people considers him as a part of the aristocracy; on the other hand his personal audience has reduced. He is not young and due the fugacity of the memory in the most of cases, the great audience wants evasion, triviality and want just a good fun, and they know Beethoven was not born to be a circus ceremony master, that 's why the mass bet for Rossini.   In this sense I think to play this last cycle of sonatas, there are more important issues than the score at the time you regard to perform. Beethoven is deep inside a hole. And that hurts, but he is far to be self indulgent and eventually (in my personal opinion), he composes his Choral as another proof he can propose also a pompous symphony, a popular Symphony in strict sense. But if you realize the fact he invested seven years to compose it, definitively something serious is happening, if you consider the four years spent in composing the Fifth.                  In sum, I don' t have any regret to affirm that Richter was not totally committed with Beethoven spirit, and that fact confers of idiomatic vulnerability around these interpretations.
