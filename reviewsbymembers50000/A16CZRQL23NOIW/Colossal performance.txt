 This recording dates of Dec 1985 . It is a live recording from Avery Fisher Hall and it constitutes a true musical document . Bernstein , conducting the N.Y.P made a penetrating version of this fundamental symphony of this notable composer. The wonderful and expansive presence of the strings , metals and woods are demanded requisites if you want to win with this work.  Solemnity ; grace and fevered passion characterize this idiomatic performance .  The last movement, the well know Fanfare for a common man is played with such dignity level that it will let you amazed .  In spite of his fervent wisdom and noblesse , though it lacks the ardour of the version of the sixties but you can not always what you want . This performing is by far unbeatable if you dare to compare with anyone you choice .  Memorable portrait and distinguished recording.
