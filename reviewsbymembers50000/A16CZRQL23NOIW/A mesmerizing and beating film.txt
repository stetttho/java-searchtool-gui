 It is not exaggerate to affirm Jessica Lange has been one of the most gifted actress of the last quarter of the century. She has the inner force of Bette Davis, the sinister mood of Joan Crawford, and the shining radiance of Greer Carson. But she is still more; her capacity to live a role with the most overwhelming naturalness makes of them one of the few Goddess of the acting.  In this movie Lange reached such artistic stature and conviction power as any other film previous or later, the fact resides in that she is so magnificent that many of my readers may disagree arguing other roles, but the question is simple and its answer may lead us to an absolute silence: Can you suggest about another actress (apart of her) capable to play such demanding role in that moment?   The awful film is based on a true story and tells us about the life of Frances Farmer: his ascending and fall in a mental Institution. A monumental portrait, superbly directed with an exceptional cast. You don't have any pretext to acquire this towering film, one of the ten best in the eighties.
