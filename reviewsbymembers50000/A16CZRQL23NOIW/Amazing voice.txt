 That Brazilian voice has emerged with own light and personality. She possesses presence and charisma. On the other hand the musical arrangements are simply formidable.    If you listen for instance, Wanderer heart (a composition of Caetano Veloso) you will notice the essential roots of the Bossa Nova, but expressed with such flair and distinction that literally engages you. This is my favorite piece of the album. Ao identificado is a soft nocturnal breeze. Her voice has many hues and inflections. London London is a very sensitive homage to this seductive city. So louco is a very poem. Barato total is one of her best known songs, it's a soft samba, ornamented of effusiveness. Sua estupidez  is a true love 's statement; a heartfelt moonlight theme; one of the best ballades of this album. Falsa Baiana is a very sensual samba, very appropriate to test the admirable resources of this singer. Vapor barato is a haunting, tearing and sensitive theme. It 's a chamber piece for guitar, bass and voice, one of the most remarkable themes without any doubt. The final piece is one the unforgettable hymns of that land: Aquarela do Brazil, in a fabulous version.   Go for this album. I recommend it with special emphasis.
