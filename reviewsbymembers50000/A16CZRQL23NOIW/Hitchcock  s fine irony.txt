 The clinical eye of this hyper gifted director resided in his avidness for avoiding to remain petrified under the simple label of Suspense Master. He loved to convince us the suspense is everywhere, and even in the most unexpected places.   An American couple vacationing in French Morocco ( a hidden tribute to Casablanca, perhaps) will experience the major disturbance of their secure lives when, due that trickeries of the destiny be involved in a complex web of assassinations, murder, kidnapping when accidentally James Stewart listens the last words of a dying man.  Doris Day `s charisma and the well elaborated script will allows us to know the affective interiorities and enjoy of pleasant tour in that seductive and mysterious land, nest and witness of so many historical events.  The evolving humor evinces the successful experience he had respect his previous work "How to catch a thief", (a work visibly influenced by Rififi) although the Cold War environment and the impressive filmed material of his colleagues induced him to turn his eyes around this plot, the first of a Trilogy completed by Torn curtain and Topaz.  The climax sequence is brilliant; don 't miss it.
