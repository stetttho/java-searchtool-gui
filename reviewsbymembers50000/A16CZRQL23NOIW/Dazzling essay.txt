 The tragedy has lost its real dimension in the modern times . The triviality understood as the absence of psychic tensions. We hardly are capable to experience this state due we have found the immediate solution : the therapy , and any other way of easy activity allows us to escape . We want to know about our micro destinies reading the horoscopes .   In the other hand all the religions have confined its real meaning to spiritual designs and literally has invaded its territories . Shakespeare appears after centuries of silence in this sense . But the XVII century was a trivial century ; you only find cynicism and tedious.   "All the men have conscience of the tragedy in the life but the tragedy as theatrical way is not universal" Steiner makes an intelligent study about the tragedy ,and goes far beyond . Excellent text all the way.
