 I must confess I was a hard fan of Nikolaus Harnoncourt in the late eighties, and the early nineties. Nevertheless, I recoginze this version of the "Jupiter" is very interesting without reaching the glorious heights of Beecham and the Royal Philarmonic of 1956, N.H. really experiments with satisfactory results, there are ceratin additional scores in the coda, sooe extaravagants rubatos . He is able to do those alterations due he conducts one of the most remarkable world's orchestras: The concertgebouw of Amsterdam. From time to time I really enjoy this artistic contribution that enriches the vision of these outstanding of Salzsburgo's wunderkid; Wolfang Amadeus Mozart.
