 Diabelli variations in the hands of Serkin is the greatest artistic triumph made fro Seerkin in all his brilliant career . Every variation is played with supreme authority , poetry and majesty.   Remember that Serkin was another proof of what Prades meant not only for the entire world but for all those musicians who worked wioth the Maestro Casals . Alexander Schneider , Istomin, Vegh, Szigetti , Kapell , Grumiaux more than supremes and excel artits , had much more in common . they were provided of an invisible aura : an invisible passion for the timeless commitments. Back to Serkin , besides the technical complexities of  the Variations, you have the additional element of the grace, humour and fine irony in certain passages .  The pianissimos , staccatos ,  and slender arpeggios are played with such level of passion and conviction that hardly you will ever find in the wide options market . Put special attention in the sliding and progressive change of mood and almost visble shadow light games made for Serkin who literally illuminates the score as a real film maker. The floating notes , the special emphasis above all in the slow passages of the last Variations is a tour de force experience . The special treatment given to the pianissimos remind us to the last movement of the Piano Sonata No. 30 .
