 This film combines wisely comedy and an original dramatic plot. In the middle of the WW2 during the Nazi occupation in Paris, two men will take great risks . What is the point with that ?  The result is one the best films ever made in this crossed genre with Jean Gabin the supreme master acting in the XX Century and Bouvril one of the icons of the French comedy ever . Acquire it and if you find Le vache and le prisoner (The cow and the prisoner)- a film directed by Henri Verneuil- and Fernandel unforgettable performing , you will have in your personal collection the best two comedy films of that sublime decade in France . Extraordinary and magnificent film!
