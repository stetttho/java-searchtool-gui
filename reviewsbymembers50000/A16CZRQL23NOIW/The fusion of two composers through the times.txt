 Pulcinella: a "ballet with songs" in one act and eight scenes, was composed in 1919-1920. The relation between both composers Pergolesi and Stravinsky is far from being obscure. There's an admirable blending process: The instrumentation is purely Stravinsky and the melodies are all by Giovanni Baptista. Even the forms of the individual pieces sometimes have been lifted whole and without change from Pergolesi, but other times they have been expanded or remodeled to a very considerable degree.  Stravinsky remembers the production of Pulcinella at the Paris opera in 1920, as one of his most theatrical experiences. Imagine the prodigious spectacle: scenery and costumes by Picasso and Ernest Ansermet conducting: A true God's dish. In this recording we have to the composer in front of one of the most dynamical orchestras at that special moment. Recorded in December 14, 1953, Severance Hall, Cleveland. The exquisite cast included Mary Simmons, Soprano, Glenn Schnittke, Tenor and Phillip MacGregor, Bass. The kiss of the fairy has other superior readings such Ansermet Suisse Romande for instance and I guess The Symphony in C is interesting but without dazzling spirit. But the collection is important for all hard collector that wishes to follow the traces of the music in the XX Century. A historical issue all the way.
