 A Congo mercenary is hired with a double goal: to rescue a group of citizens in a besieged twon and bring back some valuable diamonds with ulterior proposals.  There are several highlights worthy to mention; the action sequence on the train, is filled of histamine: The ominous presence of the hated officer (superbly played by Peter Carsten) who still carries the Nazi symbol will radicalize the conflict and will originate crucial dialogues along the train journey, the first one concerns with the inquiring answer of Jim Brown about the final destiny of Congo and the other is the extraordinary fighting between the Nazi officer and Taylor: the anger displayed for Taylor have been one of the top rage expressions in years. Ad all we know the mission will be unfinished without the expected conflict between these two wills. After a long sequence of explosions and murderers, there will be a passionate bet of Brown trusting in Taylor words, when the gas jeep is over and the rest of the group must remain in the middle of the jungle waiting for the promised rescue once Rod arrives to the final destiny. Jim Cardiff made an entertained and vibrant picture without major pretensions but leaving opened doors to a further discussion, the honor sense believe or not will be present in Taylor's soul, that eventually will become his particular redemption in the modern times: A War Council. Above the average.
