 If you inquired me about the technique equipment at this moment the list would be numerous; but if you go on respect to the musicality behind the expression and the employment of the technique conceived as a toll and not a goal by itself in which Bartok's piano music concerns, I should name just three: Zoltan Kocsis, Andras Schiff and Mijail Rudy.   Schiff stated on Sunday March 7, 1993 to New York times. Bartok `s roots are strongly based in the soul of his country, but he was a great humanist, trying to unit cultures. When I listen to Bartok, I'm proud of being from Hungary."   Despite the warning of the unmatched and celebrated musical gems recorded by Gyrgy Sandor in the middle sixties (see my review about it) this is a magnificent option to feel the greatness of Bartok in his deserved stature without fireworks or eccentricities.
