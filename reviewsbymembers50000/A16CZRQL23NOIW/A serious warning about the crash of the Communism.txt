 This movie owns that golden touch which characterizes the immortal masterpieces . Wajda made a superb film against the double moral of the struggling Comunist system . A lost statue in memory of a revolution hero will be the mysterious device to search the truth behind the nasty tearful au revoir of the false homage around a serious disturbance for the Status Quo .  You know as well as me the Totalitarian Regimes hate everything which works out of control because the free will is obviously a clear danger for the State surviving . The statement is very simple : Everybody must be inside the average . And you know what this means : the average always equalize but to bottom , if you are very good in a special field you are beyond the average and this is considered as a deadly sin for this Govern System .  Rememeber those words of Millan Astray : Dead the intelligence . Or Goering sentence : *When I hear the word culture I show the gun *. And that is what it happened in this case when a extremely naive man deeply convinced about the Regime kindness decides in the name of the State to show how he and his team are capable to built a house in just one day . The man becomes a popular hero; a raising mass symbol but without the support of the Governement ; so this may be well a double edge weapon . So the dark arm of the establishment will turn the fate of this man in the great day with a merciless and casual? accident . This brave film is really absorbing from start to finnish , and you will be involved step by step with this haunting story . I have not a shadow of doubt this remarkable work was one of the multiple red light signals which would carry to the Perestroika a decade after . Sublime, terrific, poignant and extraordinary film of this outstanding polish filmmaker.
