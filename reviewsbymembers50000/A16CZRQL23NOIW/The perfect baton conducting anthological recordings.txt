 The early and unfair departure of Ferenc Fricsay (49) not only left the world in an orphanage state but deprived it of one of the most perfect and extraordinary conductors of the XX Century. Mr. K would not have been director of the Berlin Philharmonic and the musical legacy of this sumptuous orchestra would have been absolutely different in a positive way. The wisdom, accuracy and genius of Fricsay would have permeated and even maintained the fevered temperament of Frtwangler who previously had adverted in Fricsay, let s say without preambles, his natural successor.   The tempos in the Triple Concert are slow, but loaded of fevered expressiveness and Beethoven ethos. Fricsay achieved supported by this outstanding trio and the grateful Orchestra an impeccable and magisterial recording. After you listen it you really feel a cathartic experience. Just the aristocratic phrasing of the last movement: it is amazing:  The Double Concerto is extraordinary too. Filled of charm, aristocratic profile and sumptuous musicality with opulence and distinctive flair. Class and musculature shake hands in this brilliant and unusual performance.  On the other hand think it over. If Deutsche Gramophone decided to include between the Great Recordings of its collection, that `s by itself, must mean something additional.   Go for this notable surprising and breathtaking performance. A true audiophile gem.  Eloquent musicality, sublime grandness!
