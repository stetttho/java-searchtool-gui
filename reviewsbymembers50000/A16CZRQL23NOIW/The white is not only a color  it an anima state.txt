 Kieslowski was the superb artifice of this curious Trilogy; White, Blue and Red deals with a delicate, mature and painful subject. The impossibility of a simple man to satisfy his couple will reach bindings of unsuspected turns; an unexpected journey from Paris to Warsaw, will become of him an energy outburst, the expected redemption has to be done in the middle of the corrupt battlefield.   The narrative style of Kielowski demands of you all the possible attention. His films possess conceptual density ornamented with visible visual metaphors; the tragedy and collapse of his beloved Poland appears beneath the absorbing script with unadorned realism. I would like to you recommend to watch previously his Decalogue. This fact will allow you to appreciate with major intensity the rat of this unforgettable genius. His sensible vanishing left a very remarkable void, which still remains, pitifully without successor.       The rest runs for you. There are many rich details to comment and the space is extremely brief to face this task.   Go for this treasure.
