 Andre Bazin makes a meticuluous and extraordinary analysis around the entire filmography of this famous filmmaker . There are many issues to know and we have to miss the fact Andre Bazin jus only lived forty years .  But in Francois Truffaut words , this is the most complete book about the greatest french filmmaker in the century . In my personal opinion only two directors overpasses him in this order: Robert Bresson and Marcel Carne.
