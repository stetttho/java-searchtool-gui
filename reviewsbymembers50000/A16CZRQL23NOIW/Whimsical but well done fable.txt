 Peter Yates `s career has had too much peaks and some lows . From his famous thriller Bullit in the far sixties to the Dresser ( his masterpiece to my mind) . His concerns have always turned around the inner dragons hidden in the intimacy of the most of the human beings . In this time he recreates a funny situation in which  New York ` s dressy guy will be haunted for two old specters in the New Year `s 1927 . Obviously he will be the one who watches them . Since the plot has many intersections with previous films , the masterful hand of Yates and this splendid cast gets to lead this film to a happy land .  Michael Caine , Maggie Smith , Marcia Gay Harden and James Spader and my dear reader as you well know I have not seen any film accepted by Mr. Caine fairly mediocre . So considering all the cards in your hand , how can you lose with this clever and easy going picture ?
