 Sidney Lumet confessed without hindrances his profound admiration by the artistic presence of Carl Dryer and how his films determined and affianced his vocation as filmmaker. This brief introduction can help us to understand much better (thinking in the memorable Dryer ` Days of wrath) the final decision who guided to Lumet to undertake this awful and brutal living nightmare around the members of a family: She is an serious drug addict, her son alcoholic and the other is dying of tuberculosis.  With such premise it is so easy to imagine and conclude we will watch a complex picture loaded of visible depressive character and disturbing sordidness. The luxury cast was decisive to arrive to secure port. Katherine Hepburn and Richardson are more than admirable in this classic adaptation of Eugene O Neil, the merciless eye, the speaking trumpet of bad news, the ineffable inquirer of a society in crisis, like Baudelaire in France, Papini in Italy, Becket in Ireland or Strindberg in Sweden who reveled the harrowing Expressionism literary, showing the rotten entrails without piety.  Mature, haunting and powerful film that strikes over and over on our spotted conscience with an only objective, to beat the soul through the catastrophe for reaching the cathartic experience.
