 Gary Graffman was, after the ominous presence of Eugene Istomin, one of the most prominent American pianists who lighted the musical horizon of the second half of the Century, the list included obviously to Leon Fleisher, Julius Katchen, Lincoln Mayorga, Van Cliburn, John Browning, Lorin Hollander and Leonard Pennario . His nervous playing was still even broader than Byron Janis, though with a visible inclination to the Slave repertoire. His steeled fingering, thundering temperament and leonine percussive tone allowed him to play without apparent effort the most exigent pages of the repertoire.  This is possibly one of the most intense and passionate register that I have ever heard about Prokoviev 's Third Piano Concerto. Accurateness, incandescence, Slavic exuberance, wild lyricism and fierce precision are some of the most relevant characteristics of this recording.
