 Bryan Gorbes (Goldfinger) directed this superb and eerie psychological thriller .  Kim Stanley  - in a glorious performance - is a neurotic woman trapped in a struggling and suffocating marriage and deeply haunted by the death of her only child . She will manipulate her meek husband (Richard Attenborough) and decide kidnap a child of wealthy parents , devising a scheme to rescue the child and claim the ransom and her wide fame due her psychic abilities . Dense script with a complex web of issues such as the public madness and the private fantasy . This movie is a real punch in a decade unfortunately not characterized for original and mature films like this one .  One superb film.
