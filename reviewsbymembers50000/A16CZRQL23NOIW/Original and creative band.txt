 Camel was one of the most imaginative bands in the seventies. I bought the vynil album and I havent been able to buy this CD yet. But when you are in the mood for Camel you wont believe the wide sense of harmonies depicted musically, the clever use of the spanish guitar in several pieces. Think in Arubaluba, for instance, and my favorite track Mystic queen , one of the most striking themes in all that glorious decade. And watch for the amazing bands in that age. Undoubtly, well always be in debt with U.K. about resisting the no mercy invassion of the disco music that literally struggled so many raising promise rock bands in USA, specially between 1975 and 1979. Buy that album. This was a true cult band.
