 Two scenic marvels : the Niagara Falls and the several states of undress of M.M. and since the script is very handled and quite evident , you have to recognize the emotive tension, the first rate direction and this overwhelming cast with Joseph Cotton and Jean Peters. This glorious film noir will show you the infidelity , the betrayal , the greed in its purest nakedness . May be the best film noir of Henry Hathaway.
