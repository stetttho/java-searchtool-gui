 Jack Nicholson decided to throw his hat at ring again with this sequel of Chinatown. There are many interesting aspects to remark. The dare camera angles, the locations, and the formidable cast overpass the only default of the picture.

But the whole result exceeds by far, the sum of its parts. Harvey  Keitel, Eli Walach and Madeleine Stowe are splendid.
