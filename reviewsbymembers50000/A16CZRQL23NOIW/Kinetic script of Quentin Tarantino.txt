 This film is violent but plenty of bits , thrills and surprises . It's a chinese box (Remember Belle de jour?) . The sequences of the chases are first rate , but the peak of the crown may be well in the dialogue between Chris Walken and Dennis Hopper moments previous to the murder in which both colossal actors make a tour de force that signed the film to status cult movie .  Christian Slater is fine , and Pitt is very credible as a dealer . Fine script and watchable film , filled with histamina! Dazzling direction of Tony Scott!
