 This winner of the 1975 Grand Jury Prize Cannes tells the story of an mysterious man isolated and found in very poor and miserable conditions . He can not articulate any word , since he has grown as almost a wild beast . Nevertheless , he shows surprising advances and an overwhelming intelligence during his adapatation process to the society and shows a weird sense of prophecy . His death still remains far from resolving . This bizarre and compelling film is very close to previous films such as The miracle worker (Artur Pen  1962) and The wild Child Francois Truffaut 1969). You can notice the echoes of this plot in other minor films such as K Pax , Nell and the unforgettable Nicholas Roeg work of 1976 The man who fell to earth . This artistic work is illuminated with dark poetry and atmospheric charm .  Bruno Ganz is perfect in this complex role . And since Klaus Kinki was always the protegee of Herzog , his hard features could mean a serious obstacle to the character , where the naifness and the sense of loneliness should be reflected in every movement . The direction was extraordinary . The influence of the german expresionism is undeniable in this sense . The movie is a gothic nightmare which involves this misterious human being .  This picture seems to improve with the age . Watch one the major achievements of this superb creator of atmospheres and edge of the knife situations ; Werner Herzog.
