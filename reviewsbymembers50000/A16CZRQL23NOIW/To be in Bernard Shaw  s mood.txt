 Claude Rains as Caesar and Viviane Leigh as Cleopatra star this dazzling story that rides between the drama and comedy. A splendid occasion to crown once more the corrosive humor that literally permeates a good part of the dialogues. There is humor but also a formidable description and bold personal statement of this privileged dramaturge. The movie ha its particular rhythm, you may consider something theatrical, but that does not diminish at all its intrinsic virtues.  Basil Sydney as the Caesar 's shield, Flora Robson as Totatita and Stewart Granger are particularly effective in this British gem, that I insist maintains a very special feature, that demands from you the major attention.             Delicious and admirable portrait of a very special approach around the emotional, political, social and backstage in this satirical, clever and always reminded adaptation of Georges Bernard Shaw.    Go for this. One of the most admirable British gems of the middle forties.
