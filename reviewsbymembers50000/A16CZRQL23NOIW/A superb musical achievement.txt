 This CD contains one of the best proofs that testifies by itself about the interpretative freshness and unequalled exacerbated mood of this outstanding Hungarian playing a national treasure as Copland was.  This is to my mind the only version that you might set joined with Bernstein' s New York Philharmonic in which musicality, nuance and effervescence concerns Go for this treasure. Five thousand stars rather than five.
