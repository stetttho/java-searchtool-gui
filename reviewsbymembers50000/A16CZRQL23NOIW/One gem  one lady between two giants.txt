 A Cannes' winner among other virtues, this film is like the fourth symphony of Beethoven: a princess between two power muscle men. In fact the godfather I and II literally absorbed and in a certain way detoured, (together with Appocalyse now) the attention about this movie. A genuine masterpiece that confirms the status of Mr. Coppola to the highest rank in the cinema's story. Hcakman has never been best.
