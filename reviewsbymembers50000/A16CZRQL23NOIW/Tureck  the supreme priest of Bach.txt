 Rosalyn Tureck belongs to a reduced kind of artists beyond the standard. She belongs to the elite of Casals, Carreno, Furtwangler, Busoni, Kempff, Neveu, Schnabel, Fricsay and Nykolayeva,Sandor Vegh, among others. His playing on Bach is so natural and fresh that lets you amazed. And that is a syntom of her deep commitment with the score. Her Bach bretahes, the sonority is filled with dyonisiac rapture, and sounds human even erotic. And Im not kidding with this last statement. In this live recording, Tureck shows us her high pianism level. One of the fundamentals aspects of the genius is the overwhelming singleness of its playing. The notes are not forced, flow, simply. Buy this issue. It is a gem for collectors.
