 The ineffable sound of Benny Goodman is now part of our collective unconscious. Melodies that immediately bring us back to these Forties, to Woody Allen, to those WW2 years when the jazz became cathartic entertainment and that necessary spiritual rearrangement and enjoy of the marvelous and very personal style of this inimitable soloist. The team who joined is simply first range: Lionel Hampton, who shared honors with Carl Tjader in the vibraphone playing; Teddy Wilson in piano and that living legend: Gene Krupa in drums.  The set as a whole is perfect, every track possesses its magic touch. If I had to decide for just my two first choices; I would bet for Say it isn' t so and I got it bad and that ain' t good. but my only complaint would be, the briefness of the album.  Go for this and enjoy it over and over!
