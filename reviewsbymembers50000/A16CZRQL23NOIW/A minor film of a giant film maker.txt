 To talk about Sam Peckinpah is to name one of the most complete and wise North American directors in any age . He is in the elite of the Giants film makers . It is easy for the cultivated and passionate movie fan to distinguish his style ; that special seal he printed his works . the violence aesthetical had in him one of its most highest exponents . Being this work the last Opus of S.P., and having besides a top cast : John Hurt , Burt Lancaster , Denis Hooper, Rutger Hauger it results more than unexpected the final product . The film is interesting . Who can deny ? But you leave the film with a bitter taste . There is lot of  action , and a credible story but something missed along the film .  It would seem the editing process , the excess of illumination in the night chase sequences ; the obsessive use of the first plane and the abuse of the close up ; the nervous camera and perhaps the fragile nature of the material based on Robert Hudlum made of this thriller just a visible film , indeed but without those ravishing pretensions of his previous films such Stray dogs , Ride the high country , The Wild Bunch , The ballad of Cable Hogue, Cross of iron and the Getaway . Perhaps the hidden reason remains in a painful reflection . Just a few amount of directors have been able to overcome the pass of the time and its sequels and say farewell with his last opus and sublime work . The time: that barefoot army demons hidden behind the door of our days .
