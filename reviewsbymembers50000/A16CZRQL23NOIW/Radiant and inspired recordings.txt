 If there is a more effervescent , idiomatic , innovative and resplendently performance of the Handel Variations , I have not heard it . Katchen emphasizes with colossal scrupulosity the wide doe and the diversity spectre of the orchestral instruments . You must marvel at the technical equipment of Katchen playing .  The other outstanding version of these Variations is of Michael Ponti (live preformance)  gifted with a major emphasis in the striking and color tone ; but the point to remark is that in both performings the approach is similar ; every one of the Variations must be played as a microcosmos in itself ; with nuance , grace , majesty, powerful imagination, sense of the span and above al ; savoir vivre . If you intend to play with authoritative precision without Mediterranean dewy and radiant mood ; you are destined to fail with these Variations and becoming unbearable for the audience and the listener . Lamentably , there are many of them in the actual market but I think you can guess them .  The two Rhapsodies are performed with the highest commitment . Melodic flight and arresting lyricism . The Sonatas are superbly performed . The Sonata No. 3 may find serious matchers with Clifford Curzon and Paul Badura Skoda . The intermezzos are depicted with the adequate illuminating . These intimate pages must be played with the perfect balance of light and shadows ; think in Chopin Nocturnes for instance . Only Glenn Gould gets close to him in the Intermezzo Op. 117 No. 2  . The Ballades may be the weakest works of this fundamental set . Benedetti Michelangeli and Emil Gilels recorded brilliant and eloquent versions. Finally The Paganini Variations find in Benedetti Michelangeli a serious and unbeatable adversary . To be honest , this set is widely recommendable for you , to know the whole and intimate world of Johannes Brahms , the beloved son of Hamburg. Katchen also recorded a powerful Islamey and an unforgettable Rachmaninoff No. 2 .
