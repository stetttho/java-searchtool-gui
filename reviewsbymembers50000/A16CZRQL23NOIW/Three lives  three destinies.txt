 This dark and somber picture deals with a sensitive and awful sexual abuse. A tragic chronicle that sealed three different existences. Add the physical wounds the unforgettable traces left in the mind and the soul. Three friends who just are in his teenages, one of them will be designed by the destiny's finger as the innocent victim of that crime.  The silence will be the common denominator, but the damage is too big to heal these emotional wounds. And so slowly, the destiny will assume the form of a long cloud that literally will gather them again, thirty years later. Eastwood reached the peak as hard to beat director; with a simple story but rich in details and edition. Between you and me this film and 21 grams were the most pyramidal american films in 2003 but you know, the logic usually doesn 't apply as a mathematic equation, and this outstanding picture was simply nominated and nothing else happened. The cast is simply terrific. And the absorbing photography is another invisible actor.  A film that will shock your senses for a long, long time!
