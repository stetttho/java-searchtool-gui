 This is simply a milestone film. A picture that broke the walls, specially in those hard times when the shadows of a recent War waggled over the world, in pain, sorrow, revenge, repentant, deception, sad memories and renovated hopes in search of a better world. Rossellini made his masterpiece based on a fiction story according his introductory words but so vivid and so credible that it makes us hard to think about the whole veracity of the previous statement.   The particular seal of the genius is making us to get inside a play with such invisible force that you do not even realize when or where you were engaged to live shoulder to shoulder the lives, times and disgraces of a group of people joined by the cruel fatalism of the omnipresent and repressive Nazis. A mature woman -my always beloved actress Anna Magnani (one of the ten best actress ever born in any age) waits for her bliss, her fiance Francesco will marry her the next day. But in her neighborhood, we have living her sister who works in a nocturne club with the girlfriend of an important resistance member, a immature woman, who has struck by the life, she has walked too many miles, in search of best positions and living selfishly; a bold priest who will work out as fundamental bound.  What you will see all along this movie is the reality shocking your soul and spirit. This script is so sublime that we forget they are acting, but living the struggling environment and trying to make the best they can according their possibilities.  The misery, greed, double moral, SS nastiness, the bold resistance and the supreme of surviving makes of this film a diamantine and majuscule artistic achievement. We should wait eleven years to presence another invaluable gem in this sense: Wajda `s  Kanal.  Obviously you should not do without of  Paisa and Germania Anno Zero of this superb filmmaker and a true universal patrimony: Roberto Rossellini
