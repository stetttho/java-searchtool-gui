 A fascinating, intense, penetrating, haunting and exploratory drama around a group of passengers traveling from south America to Berlin before the nazi outbreak. From the powerful best seller of Katherine Potter, the picture makes an incisive dissection around the different human profiles, anguishes, and fears under a dark cloud of fatal shadows.   One of my top films of the Sixties. Simone Signoret, Oskar Werner, Lee Marvin are specially effective in this absorbing achievement of Stanley Kramer.
