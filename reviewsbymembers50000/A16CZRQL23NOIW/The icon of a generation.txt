 The particular filmography of Oliver Stone has had peak and lows. He is - before any other circumstance - a CSI filmmaker. His camera is an untiring explorer of facts, livings and memories. That is why my personal list of his treasures films possibly do not include his most succesful works.   This is one of my three favorite Opus of Stone; (my other tweo choice are JFK and Wall Street). This movie works out as historical document, due its shocking realism but the the loyal refelect of USA in those ages. Being an exception figure O.S. innquires and carves in releief the expectations, defeats and livings of whole generation, tired of waiting who felt Jim Morrison was the icon of his generation, the direct descendent of the beatnik ages headed by Alan Gingsberg and Andy Warhol. The script is so well built and the performances are so natural and spontaneous; the towering acting of Kilmer and the fabulous scenaries conform a majuscule and interweaved puzzle of multidimensional resonance.  Recommended without reserves.
