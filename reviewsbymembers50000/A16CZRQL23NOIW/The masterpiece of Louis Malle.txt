 Based on a surrealist writer Jacques Rigaut who committed suicide in 1945 , the film focuses the attention on the alcoholism of him instead the addiction , which was his real hell . The last two days in the life of this artist are more than enough to sweep us in the tragic mood in a clinic for his treatment due he is unable to stop his mortal habit . Somehow this is perhaps the most awful film inscribed in the Existential Literature Movement with Sartre and Camus as its most remarkable and fervent followers.  And since the film was a commercial failure I think this film was too much for that age in which the great interest of the audience consisted in watching the last occurrences of the most representative Enfants terrible of the New Wave : Francois Truffaut , Jean Luc Godard , Claude Chabrol and Erick Rohmer. Malle began his first works inscribed in this movement but clearly you can see how he is concerned for subjects filled with major intensity and conceptual relevance . His career begins with Elevator to the gallows , a clear homage to Hitchcock , Les amants , and Zazie dans le metro a curious presage of Amelie forty years before and then he grew up with this merciless masterpiece . Maurice Ronet was never better . You saw him in Purple Noon that classic noir film of Rene Clement in the late fifties . Malle would direct Lacombe Lucien , Le souffle a Coeur , Pretty Baby , Atlantic city , Au revoir les enfants , Damage  and Dinner with Andre , stimulating and fascinating films signed for the genius of his craft . Beware : Wolker Schlndorff was his Assistant and the music is Satie `s Gymnopedies and Gnossiennes , performed by Claude Helfer. The Paris Premiere took place on October 15 , 1963 and New York Premiere on February 17, 1964. . Believe or not Malle was in his early thirties -31- when he faced this hard and exigent script based on Pierre Drieu La Rochelle novel (1931) published in New York in  1965 .
