 For all of those who still think the tango is only tradition, there are bad news. Astor Piazolla was the untiring stalker who renewed and even widened the frontiers locals of a badly seen dance in the Twenties (As a matter of fact, Jorge Luis Borges termed it once a brothel `s reptile) and considered as a simple curiosity of sensuality 's exercise to become an authentic referential evidence, a musical genre that dressed showy clothes, expanding its action radius toward new horizons.  This recent ensemble has know to employ the essential roots of the forbidden fruit, blending it with new musical inflexions and enraptured hues. And more than a simple revenge, I think it constitutes a true revaluation of the expressive possibilities of a musical genre that only can be understood from the wise perspective wedged by Maria Luisa Bemberg a very gifted filmmaker who expressed accurately a painful true: "The Argentine 's tragedy turns around the fact is seen as a Latin American in Europe and an European in Latin America." That duality is even worst than a simple emigration or a banishment: I would term The Flying Dutchman 's syndrome, conceived as the incapacity to enroot with the land.  The crown track of the album is the fantastic version of the Last Tango in Paris, but there is still more to enjoy.  If you are still grasped the old concept of the tango as the elemental desperate anguish `s scream of unfinished passions, please remember this smart statement of Gustav Mahler: "Traditionalism is negligence."
