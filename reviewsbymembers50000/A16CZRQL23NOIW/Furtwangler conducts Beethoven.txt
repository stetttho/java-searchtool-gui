 Every time you listen this brilliant genius conducting his favorite composer (according the impressive average, of play Beethoven at least one of each two Concerts) , you may feel F?rtwangler' s engaging  spell in what concerns to illuminate the score, for instance, has no parallel in the music.  This Pastoral remains as one of the most examples of cosmic rapture, of perpetual commitment absolutely out oh this world, inscribed in the mythic roots and the deeper significance of Beethoven `s music.   "To Beethoven the creative effort goes from the chaos to the clarity. In him, the Dionysian ecstasy and the Apollonian harmony are intimately linked. His music remains among us as an example of balance between the language of the sound and the language of the soul, between the musical architecture and the development of a tragedy, whose roots are in the psyche and mainly between the "myself" and the rest of the Humanity; between the isolated individual and the community. In spite of the limited space, he achieved in a sonata what Aristotle in a tragedy; to exalt the soul through the catastrophe."     So when you read and assimilate these clear and wisdom statements about Beethoven is easy to understand why F?rtwangler `s Beethoven certainly lives in a superior level. Nowadays, pitifully the frenetic activity of most Conductors simply do no tallow them to express their ideas, but according to the obtained results since the last thirty years the balance is dangerously negative.
