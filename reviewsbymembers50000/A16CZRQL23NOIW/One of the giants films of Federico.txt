 Fellini paid his personal tribute to Roma , and he memorialized himself for the first time ; this is simply one the most ravishing films in any age , filled with  bitter humor and incisive insights . Fede built the movie as a set of delightful vignettes , making a great journey around the great city . From the initial sequence in which we are in the middle of a hell traffic to the warm rendition of that admirable and unforgettable Anna Magnani the greatest actress of the italian cinema ever , but when you watch the recreation of the WW2 music hall and the unforgettable parade in the Vatican for priest and nuns you will be absolutely sure that no other filmmaker (with the supreme exception of Luis Buuel) has been able to state a freedom state with barroque and dazzling images and sardonic approach as FeFe.
