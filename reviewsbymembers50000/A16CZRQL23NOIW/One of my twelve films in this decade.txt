 Consider the impressive number of great films that were exhibited all along this fertile and creative decade.  Locraine directed a very unusual version of this well known Shakespeare's tragedy in the middle of the War.  This Shakesperian rapture brights all along with lighting grandness, showing us once more that Shakespeare's gaze is nowadays, more actuallized than ever.  The human being just only has changed the medium of making the war but in what the basic instincts who feed his soul and thoughts keep absolutely intact. And that is not precisely an aspect to be proud but it reveals by itself the huge ethic deficit we still have.  Watch for this fabulous and ravishing stage. Ian Mc Kellen is splendid for this role, making us to forget by brief moments the colossal and much more classic approach of Olivier of 1955.
