 At the moment to make the impressive account of the most prominent Mozart players, we must never forget this legendary pianist. Fisher possessed this artistic magnificence, that winged vision about his delicate pianissimos and genial modulations to remark the notable transitions in this colossal Piano concert.   This notable historical register of the 22th  Piano Concerto, preserved for the posterity one of the most pyramidal and formidable performances ever recorded of this notable work. Fisher literally gave possession of this K. And believe me, I love this Concert, and I have tried with the monumental version of Robert Casadesus (my second choice, by far) excellent performance of Badura Skoda, the fantastic version of Schiff, the incandescent reading of Barenboim, the introspective and emotive approach of Ingrid Haebler, the aristocratic vision of Lili Kraus and the intimate performance of Serkin in Perpignan under Casals baton, but there 's no way out. Fisher gave a step forward never achieved until this date.  The 24th Concerto performance is very idiomatic but there are better ones. The jewel of the crown is the 22th.  Go for this legendary recordings, before it's too late.
