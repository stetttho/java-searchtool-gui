 Gina Gershon has never been best. She makes the sixty % in this film. She deserves major opportunities and I expect this film adds the expected desire in future projects.   Sean Patrick Flannery is a young promise and makes a credible role. The script works out with organical flow . There are innovative situations that keep your attention and hold to your seat. The increasing mistery slowly goes involving you to a satisfactory ending. The direction is another positive point to remark.  A little gem that might become in a status cult movie . In my opinion this film got it!
