 Manillow reached, (perhaps without proposing himself) a memorable tribute to this Giant of the song: the inimitable and unbeatable Frank Sinatra, through a set of a very carefully chosen repertoire, although with visible and unexplainable absent themes.  I regret for instance, the exclusion of My way, My Funny Valentine, As time goes by, The Lady is a tramp, The world we knew, Softly as I leave you, It was a very good year.  Maybe it would have been necessary to release two CDs for satisfying totally this project loaded of good intentions.
