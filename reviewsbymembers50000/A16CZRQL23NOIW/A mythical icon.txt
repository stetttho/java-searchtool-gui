 With this movie Fritz Lang show once more why the movies can be a genuine proof of art in its purest expression. Think just fifty years before when Wagner built Bayreuth for showing us all his works. And the most powerful of them , the quintessential of the set was precisely The Ring .  Lang made a sublime adaptation of this work . 1924 was the year of this landmark picture.  Inspired in the powerful mythologic essence , Lang keeps the expressiveness, the force and the soul of this legend. Believe or not , but I've always thought that you never will be capable to appreciate in his wholeness Metropolis , if you are not involved by the mythical spirit of this film. A must for all the viewers really interested not only in the cinema evolution , but in the soul of the art.
