 Do you imagine the awful scenes of what it meant the invassion of the German Panzers in Polland Sepember 1 1939 when the resistance fought ridden on horses?  Well , this was the impression i reminded on the last sequence of this film .  The Last Samurai is a brave film that reveals the significance of the honor in the Samurai culture .  The script is very related in conceptual approach to Dance with wolves in which nathan concerns . He is an antihero a man committed with nothing except himself . He is a haughty man . A mercenary without scruples who accidentally will discover a new world and will receive a slap in the facewhen he discovers the ancient traditions of this warriors . The ideological conflict between the ancestral ways of life and the modernity tradition will become in the central nervous of the film . Ken Watanabe perfomance is the most remarkable character of this film . Filmed as a Sumphony in four moments , retains its interest all along the film except the conclusion , its only fault . Do you really expect that the hero presence after the battle is necesary ? Do you imagine a hero being interviewed , and telling his old memories for instance? Is the last goal of a warrior to be happy ?  This resolution final twists a wondeful film loaded with epic spirit .  But if you miss this little detail you will be rewarded by far with this picture . Superb art direction and special effects .
