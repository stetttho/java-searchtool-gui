 One of the most considerable and extraordinary contributions of the cinema as art is the amazing and perfect conjunction between mythos and reality; to get the accurate proportion in which poetic verb and visual expression can be melted.  Yimou Zhang `s powerful visual expression reaches that notable peak in which visual fantasy is simply a minuscule portion of the narrative scheme. The visual effects are under the service of the fable and the power of myth.  Loyalty  and duty; betrayal and jealous, pride and honor are just irresistible words that mean nothing when love makes its appearance. The rules are meaningless and the bliss genesis is also its consummation.  The sacrifice ritual is part of the life; the selfish still dominates our primary impulses; courage, boldness and spiritual discipline are mere semantic formalities. We return to the primordial roots: The consecration of spring is going to burn at your eyes.   The choreographic duels; the ravishing employment of chromatic filters, the wild nature working out as splendid frame to reveal the varied gamut of feelings; the cinematic rhythm and passionate characters description make of this picture not only a must-see, but elevates and expands still more the astonishing possibilities of the cinema as inspired vehicle of the perpetual imagination and reminds us these famous words of Jean Luc Godard when affirmed: "The cinema is the expression of our most beautiful feelings."
