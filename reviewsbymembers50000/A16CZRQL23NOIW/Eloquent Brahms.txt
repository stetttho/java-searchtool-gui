 Today on the FM I listened to this well gifted pianist playing this difficult score. Its intrinsic autumnal and hence, peaceful feature constitutes a serious challenge for any artist and conductor but you can fall too easily in a contemplative and dreamy state that would draw badly the whole structure of the work. There must be passion, mourn, outrage and deadly anguish but never must be self indulgent.   Andre Watts surprised me pleasantly with this reading; Bernstein conducted accurately without abusing of his well known hyper romanticism or expansiveness of the musical phrasing. Adequate balance, extraordinary fingering and noblesse feeling make of this recording a notable finding that I will include in my list.  Recommended without hesitate.
