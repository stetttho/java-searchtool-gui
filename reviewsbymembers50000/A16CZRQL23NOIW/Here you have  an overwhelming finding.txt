 Erich Leinsdorff reached a remarkable feat with both recordings dated from 1969. Those recording sessions found him in a very special mood. These are inspired performances, pregnant of bravura, virility, wildness, refinement, elegance and sumptuous expressiveness. The opulent sound of the Boston Symphony plus the admirable baton of Leinsdorff made it possible.   Leinsdorff was the last great exponent (and the brief presence of Tilson Thomas in the podium) of the old school and so it is not a mere casualty the expected result.   The First Symphony performance is extraordinary phrased. The Adagio Molto is one the most refined among the classic versions. The last movement is a real tour de force (you must remind the audience the first bars of  Leonore III). The perfect attacks of the strings and winds, the woods and metals join its forces to give us one of the most celebrated versions of this beloved Symphony.  The Eighth is incisive, mordacious, discrete and beating. In spite of the fact no other director has even been capable to get close to the historical performance of Herman Scherchen, this version is undeniably one of the Five Top recorded in any age.    Go for this unusual collection piece and you will experience a rewarding surprise.
