 May be you don' t believe it, but from time to time, there are certain poetic films that would seem to recover its majesty even in the most unexpected circumstances.   The plot is a fairy tale indeed, but in last instance, who cares about it ?. The final intentions are precisely what it counts. A winning lottery ticket will become the sparkling breach to narrate a story that surely will enchant you.  A marriage in disgrace due both of them would seem to talk by different TV channels. His marriage is far to be a dialogue, but an exchange of monologues. A honest man, a good guy, a candid man, is a cop in NYC, an ambitious wife; a disillusioned woman plenty of good feelings who suddenly will meet one each other in this little picture of low budget perhaps, but loaded of spring vision. There will be a gradual, very emotive and absolutely expected love affair between these solitaire souls, that will experience certainly new, varied, encountered and cruel emotions.   I  have always been engaging with Bridget Fonda as actress. She possesses that delirious touch just reserved to a few artists. She illuminates the screen with her mesmerizing sidereal beauty ornamented with her nave smile; she is a lovely and very talented artist who stole the show along the picture. Rosie Perez is fine as the ambitious wife and the great Seymour Cassel as the elegant Jack Gross is terrific. Nicholas Cage in one of his best performances ever; very natural and credible in that character The script has no fissures, the frame is the always changing City of the World and the fit camera of Andrew Bergman, will allow to reconcile us with the life through this unusual film, without special effects, free of violence, chase cars and sensationalist explosions. I swear it.  A beauty parable of the Good Samaritan, and the expected boomerang reaction of the community respect this very weird behavior.            The Angel 's device is imported from "The wings of desire".  And the final shot of the red balloon floating over Central Park is a well deserved homage to Albert Lamouirise ` s The Red Balloon.
