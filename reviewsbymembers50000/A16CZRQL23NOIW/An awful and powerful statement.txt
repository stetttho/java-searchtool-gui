 Travis is a Vietnam veteran : one more among those who fought in that asiatic land . He is a wounded man ; is spirit is hopeless and his mind is shocked from all the horror .  In this state of things he decides to work as taxman in the night New York streets ; he suffers of insomnia so he explores as a bitter observer the corrupt and decadent stylish life of this underworld in certain places .  His broken personality and his troubled mind slowly will be building a revenge agent of some causes that still may be preserved from that awful world .  There will be two important women in his night tour. One represents the love but by far from a romantic mood ; she must to love how he is without restrictions (Cybil Shepperd) she is involved in a presidential comand for a strong candidate , and inmediatly you'll notice the unavoidable crash between these two widely different worlds .  The other woman is the redemption vehicle : twelve years old child-woman who sells herself in the streets of the city .  The failing in her request for love with Shepperd will throw to act in a wild way to make his own justice code . Are you talking to me ? This question is essential when Travis looks himself in the mirror ; his silent and only friend of that troubled and paranoic human being . Scorsesse not only made a bitter sight of the next hard times that followed to Vietnam ' s but also revealed (through a pathetic character) many issues that still permeated some troubled mind . This neo film noir was a knock out film in that age (1976) , but also it represented the personal triumph of the key Scorsesse De Niro .  To me this film became the masterpiece of this talented film maker .  Winner in Cannes and a top cult movie from its first release.
