 This album is fundamental in your collection . Forget Gershwin in his tuxedo formalism  . Imagine you are placed in the 52th  floor of the NBC building in a May Saturday evening ; you are excellently accompanied and New York is under your gaze . Levant plays with such level of conviction allowing the music elevates by itself in the sky of Manhattan without fireworks or any other ornament . Ormandy and the Philadelphia strings giving a tour de force performance with Rhapsody in blue so sincere and so free that you hardly will find another exquisite version in the market . You may argue the Earl Wild recording , the Jesus Maria San Roma and Eugene List recordings as supreme rivals and these really are  giants readings too ; who can deny it? , but this set owns a Bacchic mood and wide imaginative rapture that will engage you from the first bars and will involve you and this charm will be in your soul for ever . The Second Rhapsody is played with such nostalgic poetry and feeling  as you never heard it before .  But when you listen the Concerto in F for Piano and Orchestra you will kiss the sky . The variations "I got rhythm" are tastefully played and the three Preludes for Piano  are simply overwhelming .  May be this is the masterpiece album of Oscar Levant .
