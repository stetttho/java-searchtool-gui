When you get The 400 blows of Francois Truffaut (The quintessential New Wave film) in the initial titles you will watch the special hommage to Bazin in memoriam . You may consider several mistakes in the traduction , when this happens remember the chinese statement: All traduction is a betray. Try to get a spanish edition .
