 Gyorgy Sandor has been associated with Bela Bartok as Schnabel with Beethoven . In this case the approach given for Sandor making sound the seventh sonata (his best achievement in this interesting set)loaded percussiveness and dark shadows creating atmospheres so eloquent that you woll not be able to believe after you listen it . There is lyricism , sense of the mistery and rage and wildness , specially in that last movement . The eigth and ninth sonatas are extraordinary . From the fourth to the sixth go to Richter . He is a winner in these .  Sandor plays a second and third with idomatic language. These are worthable recordings and considering the ratio prize quality , the reasons for you to acquire this set is almost a duty if you are a fan of Prokoviev.
