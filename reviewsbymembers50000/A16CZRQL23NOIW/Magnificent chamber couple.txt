 I had the huge privilege to watch this team twice in the middle seventies. Both of them are etremely well gifted musicians. In the second opportunity they gave an unforgettable recital with Bartok, Brahms and Villalobos. Believe me when I tell you the talent and cgharisma of Sziidon and the penetrating and fabuluos msuicality of Jenny Abel will amaze you.  Go for these hard to get chamber worrks of this notable Brazilian composer and surprise with those works. Villalobos must be known far beyond his legendary Bachianas. His piano music and Cello Concerts are by themselves superb expression of genuine expression of musical genius. Highly recommended!
