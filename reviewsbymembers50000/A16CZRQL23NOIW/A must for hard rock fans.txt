 This brilliant guitarist displays originality in his musical proposals . Shake your money maker is an incredible theme . But may be in his blues , derringer exhibits with much more clarity than any other genre his virtuosity . The best track of the album is the superb ten minutes blues : Somebody loan a dime , the second best blues is You' ve got to love her with feeling a touch piece and the excellent blues Texas . Wonderful choice for hard to beat experts .
