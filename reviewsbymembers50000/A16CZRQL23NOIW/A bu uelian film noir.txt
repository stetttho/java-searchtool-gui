 In the best tradition of the sarcasticc, ironic and devasting spirit of Luis Buuels filmography (and obviously a Billy Wilders touch), the film runs by its own with a masterful plot  brilliant travels and remarkable performances. Blier made a film absolutely free of any kind of convencionalism, intelligent humor, clever sense of absurd and mesmerizing laberyntic journey into the underworld, the acid view about a policeman who decides breaking the rules together with two men who are under a high stress anguish by different reasons . Suddenly all the sense of reality suffers a blackout and you become part of it. Watch this film. And convince by yourself this is a fascinating tale, a brilliant work, and an unforgettable movie in any age. Youll be widely rewarded. And please, forget the logical and drown in this surrealistic story.  Eternally enjoyable. Depardieu as always at his top.
