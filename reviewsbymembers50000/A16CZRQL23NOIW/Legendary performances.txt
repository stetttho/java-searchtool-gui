 Cherkassky still remains among the most celebrated and remarkable pianists in what Chopin concerns. His interpretions were always loaded with an accurate blend of precision and passion. His cantabile and tremolos; glissandis and arpegios were amazing; his thunderous fortissimos supported the melodic line. And this quality is fundamental at the moment to play these Studies, where the epic approach must be expressed with sonorous intensity. Perhaps, in what expression concerns, both set of Studies remain a step behind the Scherzi and Polonaises.  This is one of the most distinguished and captivating Etudes ever played. Go for this golden album.
