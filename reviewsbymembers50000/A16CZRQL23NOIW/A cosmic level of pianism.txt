 To define the art of Lipatti means describe the essence of the poetry made pianism. The flowness of his cantabile sounds so natural , that it let you surprised. The wonderful hands of this rumanian artist and the commitment spiritual he owned make of him a lone star in the universe of the supreme masters of the keyboard. Think in his Bach for instance . Elegance , rapture and majesty, and loaded with deep musicality . His Chopin is unique in the story he never gives a reading romantic in Chopin , but he carries to Frederick to a highest level . The waltzes and The third Sonata op. 58 haven't equal performers.   His Schubert sounds so different of the other pianists. You may consider Schnabel and Fisher as the only two glorious exceptions . You listen his Schubert and inmediatly Lipatti links you with the soul of the composer , being he just a invisible vehicle between us and the composer. His Mozart is deeply aristocrathic and plenty of original ideas. The early death of Lipatti in 1950 (33) let the world in such state of orphaness, that it has never filled with another keyboard player.  His place keeps still without substitute!
