 Paris, the always shining beacon of the world, is the frame of this interesting and painful portrait around the lives and times of three outlaw human beings: the most liberal of all of them, the authentic center of gravity of manners, tastes and behavior: Charlize Theron plays Gilda, the irreverence made woman, who has given shelter to a nurse - Penelope Cruz - and has allowed her to go ahead with her bliss and dreams. Both of them lives the convulsed and fabulous thirties, where the Charleston and jazz sounds were emerging with particular emphasis. Her brief stage in Cambridge, allows her to meet a very special man, who eventually will become the love of her life.  This unlimited happiness will be interrupted by the war, attending the call of the conscious, curiously. She as a nurse and he, as sensible human being feel that their happy state of life is not in harmony with a bleeding world; in the neighbor country Spain: The Civil War is a very hard reality to ignore it. That fact will break this curious triangle and both of them will become protagonists of this drama.   Charlize is absolutely devastated in this sense, but this emotional crossroad, this existential dilemma will transform her, leaving behind all the selfishness and she will do her best, according her possibilities to contribute the cause against the world of shadows.  A convincing script with certain narrative pauses, but with enough rhythmic pulse to arrive to a crude but satisfactory conclusion. Charlize Theron was marvelous and credible. Her kaleidoscopic beauty allows her to combine several behaviors: as femme fatale, alluring lover and elusively enigmatic character.  Filmed with a visible inspirational European flavor, that reminded me to Claude Sautet.
