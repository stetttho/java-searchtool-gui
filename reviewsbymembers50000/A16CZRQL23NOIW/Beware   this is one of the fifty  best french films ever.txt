 I have always been and admirer of Sacha Guitry . I have in my personal collection this lovely , superb , incisive and expressive film ,  plenty of that special distilled charm you guess of the genius . Try to find as soon as possible this item . It extraordinary all the way ; the odyssey in search of the Pearls will be the pretext for Guitry to show all his imagination powers . The other film I recommend you is Le roman de un tricheur (The diary of a cheater). An elegant and unforgettable film and one of the most striking movies of the thirties .  A treasure !
