 Robert Bresson is one my top favorite directors . And this work is one of the best achievements in his brief but remarkable filmography . Mouchette is simply one of the most powerful films ever made . After you have watched the last shot , you will convince by yourself we are not in the better of the possible worlds.  The story turns around Mouchette a child without love an emotional orphan , her little story and brief stage in this world is a brutal and penetrating reflection about us and our little miseries . The Bresson camera is pure poetry . The triviality in the simple fact to serve sugar in a cup over and over talks by itself . The trivialty , the absurdity in the attraction park , and the terible events in which Mouchette is involved become in a perpetual deja vu for the listener . As you know so well , Bresson is very austere in the verbal codes . He prefers the images become in the real actor , that's why many times the audience is serioulsy disturbed due there are several sequences entirely mude . Bresson is more worried in the powerful and expressive visual force working out as a silent witeness . His camera is a merciless eye but also a fascinating traveler guide who accompanies us in the mythical journey employing the simple reality but that is Bresson's genius touch ; he makes a simple image acquires an epic or tragic dimension and that artistic triumph is done with a clear resource economy.   This winner film in Cannes is another jewel of the master of masters : Robert Bresson!
