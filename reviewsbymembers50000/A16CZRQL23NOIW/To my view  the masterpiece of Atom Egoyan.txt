As you see, the dramatic plot will engage you from start to finish.  Its boldness, intriguing and provocative nature make of this film one of the most attractive, original and striking films of 1991 and one of the most remarkable of the nineties. Egoyan is one the most controversial film makers in the world and maybe, the best Canadian director of the last thirty years.
