 Ernest Ansermet was in the peak of his directorial power in this decade . The real effort to guide and elevate the Suisse Romande to the most famous swiss orchestra ever was made for this admirable and not yet recognized conductor .  Ansermet had a special rapport for the Russian composers . In this recording we have the presence of the virtuosi violinist Ruggiero Ricci characterized with a cold temperament but gifted with a steel sound extremely adequate for this works, giving his best musical achievement of his brilliant career with both Prokoviev violin concertos . Ricci and Ansermet knew to express that dark poetry and nostalgical mood demanded by Prokoviev . The First violin concerto is worthable but the crown jewel is the Second concerto, by far the best performing of this piece ever made in the story . The Romeo and Juliet suite is simply amazing and one of the five best Ansermet achievements all along his brilliant career ; the other four artistic triumphs are in my personal opinion , The Firebird with the London Philarmonic of the late forties ; The three cornered hat with the Suisse Romande , the Fourth Symphony of Beethoven , Scherezade (one of the best in the market) and The fairy kiss . Try to get this issue ; and you will be always rewarded. The sound quality is simply astonishing : A-1. Bravo for the sound engineers of Decca London .
