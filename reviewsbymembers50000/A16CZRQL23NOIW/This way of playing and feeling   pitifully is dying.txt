 The artistic height of Raymond Lewenthal must be seen under a reflexive state. He is one the last exponents of the Romantic maelstrom in live flesh. When he walked in Central Park and was attacked by a smuggler, he decide to live in Europe.  His integrity and overall behavior as musician may be appreciated along this CD.
