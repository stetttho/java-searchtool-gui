 Please do not waste your time and money searching another other performance of Kachaturian . This is by far , the supreme jewel in the musical universe since its first release in 1945 in vynil .  Kapell simply was far beyond of being inspired , he threw over the concert and literally explored every little detail , you will feel the anxiety , the nostalgia , the delirium , the caucasion moods , the unbetable rage and the most passionated lyricism ever made in this concert . And despite Koussevitzky with The Boston Symphony makes a great team . This orchestra , gifted with such tonal color , his strings and brass ; cellos and counterbass , winds and metals were simply a real tour de force .  The rapport was inmediat and this recording became in the hitherto of the Kachaturian Piano Concerto . Believe me I ve heard this work since 1973 and not least than three hundred times . Its frenetic intensity , its febrile majesty and vibrating erotism is absolutely overpowered . The Prokoviev is very interesting though I find it too fast in the first movement and somehow this hyperkinetism may work out if you do not know for instance the Samson Francois version in which S.F. articulates lyricism and powerful . But despite this last commentary about the Third , the record is fundamental for you to acquire the essential and more astonishing performance of this Concerto .
