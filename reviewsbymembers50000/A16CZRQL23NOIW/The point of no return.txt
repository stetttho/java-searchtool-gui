 January, 9th 1993 was a very special date for someone who reached and crossed over the frontier of not return.  That day was the doom day for a human being who simply got tired of lying to himself and the rest of the world; and as the equilibrist on the rope, decided not to continue in equilibrium.  Inspired on a real fact. Not recommended for squeamish.
