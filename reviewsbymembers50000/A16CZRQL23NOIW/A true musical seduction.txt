 The magic effluvium of this showy musician resides in his astonishing eloquence to place us in the middle of the Light City of the world, from his first bars.   The overwhelming musicality of Larcange suggests us an immense postcard, a delirious parade of smiles, faces and unforgettable locations: Eiffel Tower, Elysian Fields, Museums, boulevards, restaurants, that magic, spelling and enraptured charm that that unique city evokes.  This is an admirable of selected songs, that nowadays are part of the lyric smell of it. The Pigalle, Domino, Moulin Rouge song, Under the skies of Paris, La vie en rose are part of the myth and the legend. And Maurice Larcange `s interpretative freshness arouses even in the most indifferent listener a special sensibility.   His temperament and domain of the idiomatic spirit have become him the true musical Ambassador of a magnificent soiree, where the friendship, joy of living, or love can nestle in any of those charming themes.   Since I got both records in vinyl acetate format thirty years ago, it is a true motive of special satisfaction rejoin with those selections, that undeniably form part of my emotive memory. Having or not been in Paris, this album is for you a must-acquirement. As a very personal self gift, for your fiance, lover or wife or husband (according the case), or a very personal distinction of sincere friendship.
