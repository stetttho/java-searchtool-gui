 The actual generation jazz is supported by the guitar as the starring instrument. So the keyboards ruled in the eighties and the sax in the seventies.  I dont mean this as a fundamental statement but a clue approach to invites you to think about. Think, for instance in the the two top master keyboards, Gregg Karukas and Brian Culbertson and Dave Koz , Rick Braun as fundamental musicians. Chuck Loeb is a major guitarrist too, but Id rather prefer White may be due his musical ideas are supported by more innovative conceptions. In this album you may find out a particular universe in every track. Which one of these tracks is your favorite? Its a difficult answer, but youll find a delightful reason for Caravan of dreams or Venice beach. Ten tracks filled with beating sounds and musicality. Obviously who can deny the huge influence that Wes Montgomery still surrounds to the new generations?  Wes became a kind of big tree who involves the spirit of legend guitar as George Benson, Chuck Loeb, Jeff Golub, Stanley Jordan or Jinathan Butler. Buy this. One of the best albums in 1996 and still sound Ok. It doesnt age just a bit!.
