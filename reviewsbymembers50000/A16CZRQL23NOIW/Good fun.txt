 This remarkable script was the perfect balance between poignancy and humor. It focuses around a minor drama if you want, but not less touching:a widower intends by all means to bring up his motherless son and viceversa. As you know, the fine eye of Vincent Minelli told us a crude and painful portrayal through a charming comedy drama, a delicate issue that despite the elapsed ages, it keeps its actuality. Stella Stevens stole for herself all the applauses for this standing out performance. Glenn Ford was effective with his elegant charisma. Unforgettable!
