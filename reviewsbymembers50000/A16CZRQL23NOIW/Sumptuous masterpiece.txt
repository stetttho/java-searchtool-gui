  The secret of this overwhelming and admirable film of films lies precisely in the fact to be a simple fable without melodramatic concessions. It's almost a children story told in one of the saddest periods of Italy, in which the hopeless and the ambiguity for an unknown future interweaved a complex web of collective desperation for this huge of workers and humble citizens who simply suffered in their own flesh the awful atrocities inherited by a War. That story could be happened in any city of the world. But as Orson Welles stated once in an interview, the Italian people not only has been gifted of a natural disposition for the bel canto but also for the natural acting. The merciless fight for the surviving accents the dramatic situation of this simple man who needs a job to sustain his poor family. After hours and hours of wait, he finally obtains his expected job, but the happiness won't be too long. A simple story that you or I could read in a the quotidian press but that in De Sica masterful direction acquires another dimension. For the most of the great audiences this artwork is inscribed among their list of the top ten films of any age. So, far beyond this additional consideration go for this golden jewel and convince by yourself.           After you watch this film please remind tis clever statement of Robert Bresson: "The facts must lead to the feelings but never in the opposite direction"
