 The progressive transformation of a nave country girl and the unwilling bride of the imbecile Tsar Peter, her Darwinian adaptation through the abrasive and poisonous Court intrigues, her alluring profile to become the Empress of all the Russians.   Riveting camerawork, superb lightning, overwhelming edition process, careful script, marvelous detailed and visually impressive. Add besides, the fierceness of the Caucasian music and the seductive presence of Marlene Dietrich who repeated  the admirable team with Joseph von Sternberg after the artistic triumph of the Blue Angel.   A film of films and one of my selected two hundred movies in any age.
