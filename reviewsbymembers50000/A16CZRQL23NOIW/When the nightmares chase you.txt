 The implicit idea of the film is just one: Is the woman of these modern times absolutely of her omnipresence and faculty to decide the absolute domain of her sexuality? The rest of the film tries to find some clues.  The total domain of any relationship resides almost by desereved right, in whom loves less. The other may be love more but the other loves best. The fidelity is, in last instance, a very fragile equilibrium state; and the desperate behavior of the male counterpart exhibits those fissures. The hell of the mind plays an important and decisive role trying to seek and wonder why the countless attitudes of the female behavior.  Stanley Kubrick focused this interesting aspect displaying all his huge cinematographic power: as a visual director and creator of atmospheres and stages, he confronts us with this painful fact, but along the film you will discover the reality and fantasy may be blend. Somehow this film reminded immediately to Bergman's Scenes of a marriage; the script deserved perhaps a major scope. The master crossed the line but I think he did not advance with that sure step so typical of his previous film. That lack of decision may be seen as the main ingredient that affects the climax, because the wave was not appropriately high and strong to reach the ecstasy. That's why the last line of the film made you left the hall with a floating riddle in your mind. Perhaps this was precisely the intention of Kubrick, but having known so well all his previous works, you maintain the doubt.            This complex and mature film had two serious failures. One of them was the role of Cruise. For some reason Kubrick had to repeat several times some sequences of the picture; that means something very remarkable because all of we know about the love of Kubrick for the perfection.  In the other hand it was very hard to believe the locations in Pinewood to assume New York.  Anyway the last Opus of this master director was the pivot for Nicole Kidman who became in a solid actress since this picture.
