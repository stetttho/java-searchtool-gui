 Since the Faustian roots have had some most significant relevance than this one , nevertheless this film gets what it proposes . The translation of paradigms leads to this modern evil messenger - Rob Lowe - in a very credible role , to claim his part of the agreement gentlemen signed with a yuppie James Spader . The brutal sequences and the demoniac revenge is not for squeamish sensibilities . This film plays hard and you know the plot . We are not in a happy land . Notable performances for the entire cast . Curtis Hanson announced the world his unstoppable raising and promising career to most ambitious projects .
