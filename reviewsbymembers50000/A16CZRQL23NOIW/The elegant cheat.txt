 A sophisticated bank robber and an unscrupulous insurance investigator will be the central focus of this brilliant picture . Add some emotional tricks , smart verbal sparring , the presence of Steve Mc Queen and Faye Dunaway two potent icons of the sixties , the talented camera of Norman Jewison , a n extraordinarily well built script and the most erotic chess game ever made in the cinema story  and after that you will obtain one of the most gratifying movies in that decade . Norman Jewison confirms why he was one of the most innovative filmmakers in those ages when he decides to make a film with basic structures close to the Film Noir but with a handful of surprising twists along this clever film . He put elegance , refinement , eroticism , humor and cynicism and the mix was very successful . The last influences received from the European style specially Henri Verneuil in his film Any number can win are clear , but the seduction process in which investigator and thief are involved is carried with aristocratic style . A cult movie all the way
