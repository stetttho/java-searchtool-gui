 The innovative special effects  hold this film all along its dramatic structure . For many viewers this is a cult movie and to be true it has very inspired moments, but if you realize the presence of Albert Finney deserved a best treatment. The script promised in the first half but you feel a lack of goals . The film could be worked better if it has turned to the thriller mood , but it did not grow up and finally you have to accept this is a blended thriller horror picture .
