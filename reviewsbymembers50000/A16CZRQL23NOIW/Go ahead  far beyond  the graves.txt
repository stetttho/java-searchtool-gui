 This collection of Chopin works is an absolute imperative for every person who really loves the music. Despite the painful and very brief existence of Dinu Lipatti (1933-1950), the destiny could not tame the artistic legacy of this sublime artist of the keyboard. His name will be shining in the reduced universe of supreme genius of the piano though the years and even centuries.   My most sincere acknowledgment for the Sound Engineers who made possible this outstanding remastering process.
