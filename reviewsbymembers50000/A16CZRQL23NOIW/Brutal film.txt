 The inner demons hidden in a crowd will explode with all the expected fury around and innocent man acussed unfairly .  The sociological study of the human being is exposed in all its ugly nakeness .  So after you watch this sinister nightmare brilliantly played by Spencer Tracy, please remind that famous reflection of Ibsen taken from An enemy of the people : ^The majority never has the reason^ .   This movie was the first one made for Lang when he came to North America after leaving Germany .  A major cult movie !
