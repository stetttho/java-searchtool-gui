 I have always thought the Adagio of this sublime concert is a real future jump . Consider in this sense the Andante of the Mozart ninth concerto , the Lento of the Bach arrangement fifth piano concerto or Beethoven second movement of his third piano concerto. Shostakovich composed something deepes than a simlpe 19 th anniversary for his son . He was thinking in the future . This movement is loaded of cosmic nuance and nosthalgical high level moods . The couple Jasnson Rudy works out to the perfection . Michail Rudy is one of the strange pianists of today who seem to isolate of the rest of the standard . His sound does not seek effectism . He is an absolut artist , deeply involved in the meaning of every bar and the sense of every work he plays . It is not a question related with the technicianship , it is much more than that . He assumes a real commitment with the score . I knew thanks to a Liszt recordings and his pianism surprised me positively . His inmense skills and deep musical thought makes from him a real hope in this great universe of countless performers, but where only a few have something to say .
