 The wide display of great stages and wonderful recreations of the Ancient Roman Empire are depicted in this overwhelming super production of the fifties .  And since the film focuses on the love affair between a Roman Soldier Robert Taylor and a  Male Christian Deborah Kerr , the jewel of the crown acting was shared for two supporting actors Leo Genn and Peter Ustinov . They made the difference and for that reason both were nominated for Best Supporting actor that year , though the Oscar went to Karl malden hands for A streetcar named Desire .  Nominated also for Best film and Best Musical score , Photograph , Set up , Decoration and Dress  Wardrobe . And despite the fact the film didn't win any Academy Award the time has preserved to this film a honorable place among the Best films about this painful period of the story . The destruction of Rome and the cynicism of Ustinov is simply a tour de force experience .
