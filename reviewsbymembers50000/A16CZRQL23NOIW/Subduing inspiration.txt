 Ramsey Lewis, the legendary keyboardist, stroke again with this inspired and joyful album where once more his versatility is carved in relief. The re-edition of Sun Goddess 2000 included the featuring of Grover Washington Jr.(in memoriam). There is not a single hole throughout this musical journey.  To my mind, the most distinguished tracks are Cold and windy, Hearst of fire, I will always be with you, Les fleur, but the CD would seem charged with vibrant positive energy.   A true delight for your senses, mind, soul, and spirit.        Absolutely recommended.
