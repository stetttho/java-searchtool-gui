 Who can deny Connie Francis was the best foreigner female singer who sung better than no one the Italian repertoire? She sung with such vitality, grace, charisma and enthusiasm that it can be felt in every track you choose randomly.  This pleasant album is a marvelous opportunity to rejoin with the eternal charm, sensibility and touch of class of  this marvelous American lark; I meant singer.  A gratifying album, that will never get old.
