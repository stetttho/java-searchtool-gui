 Laurence Olivier at the top of his form with this sublime performance about Richard III the wicked deform king and his conquests . This is the definitive and greatest adaptation of this magnificent work of William Shakespeare . If you liked the acting of Olivier in Hamlet , this is much more compelling , beside the fact that Olivier did not win the Academy Award with this movie . A superb triumph . Watch for the cast : Ralph Richardson , John Gielguld , Claire Bloom .
