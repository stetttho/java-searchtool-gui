 One of the most ingenious and sarcastic films of Woody Allen about the decay and anxiety of a crowd of people in his mature ages who conform their world around three sisters :Mia Farrow (married with an unfaithful husband) Dianne Wiest (of visible neurotic character) and Barbara Hershey.   A very laughable but also meditative portrait of this existential micro cosmos, that reveals some insights about the style of living of certain ways of living. One of the most significative Opus of this brilliant director visibly influenced at those times (Interiors) for the Bergmanian elusive atmosphere.  Expressive, engaging, haunting and expansive story.
