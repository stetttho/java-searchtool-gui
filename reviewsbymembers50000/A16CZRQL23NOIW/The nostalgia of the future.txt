 Alain Tanner is the most conspicuous Belgium filmmaker. His visible influences come fundamentally from Jean Luc Godard. The insertion of admirable thoughts supported by excellent micros fit with impressive eloquence. Images and text integrate this wonderful film.  This is very curious movie. It allows to gather a crowd of people, with his dreams and hopes. We have a unemployed father who decides to work in a little farm with two clever characters; a clever History teacher with his own learning profile, who falls in love with the lovely Miou Miou, who works in a Swish supermarket and has to cross over to sleep in France.  Jonas is child who will have 25 years old in 2000. In this sense a true parade of serious concerns around politics, environmental issues, killed whales all over the world that unbalance the ecologic cycle and generating in this sense an overpopulation of shrimps. It is an ambitious and very original loaded of immense humanity and tenderness.   One of my favorite pictures of this talented director.
