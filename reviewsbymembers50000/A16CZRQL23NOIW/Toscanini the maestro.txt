 When you make the whole account of the most expansive and mercurial performances about the famous New World Symphony, you will have to include necessarily, this version among the top twenty.  The list is great because the Symphony can be approached from several conceptions. This version is so good that you may easily forget the abominable and hyper kinetic Third Movement. Toscanini hated the Adagios and this possibly the best available evidence.      Impetuous, frenetic and passionate are some of the major epithets I would have to add to this historical interpretation.   If I had to pronounce myself for my top seven, these would be: the incandescent version of 1953 with Ferenc Fricsay and Berlin Philharmonic would be my first choice; Vaclav Neuman and the Czexh Philharmonic; Vaclav Smetacek and Praga Symphony (see my review about it), Vaclav Talich and the Czech Philharmonic, Rafael Kubelik and Berlin Philharmonic, Artur Fielder and the Boston Symphony and finally, Istvan Kertesz  and the London Symphony.   Harry Janos has many superor performances; Antal Dorati and Moldau has an unbique qwinner: Ferenc Fricsay and RIAS 1951. That is why I cannot give it five stars.  Absolutely recommended, specially for Toscanini ` s fans.
