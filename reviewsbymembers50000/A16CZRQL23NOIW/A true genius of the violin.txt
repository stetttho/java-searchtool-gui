 Vengerov plays this instrument as if it was an extension of his body. He owns all what you may demand: interpretative warmth, leonine fierceness, prodigious and enviable technique, sense of the tune, absolute accuracy and supreme elegance without  frenetic raptures like others known players that we know. The impressive maturity has nothing to do with his physical age, he has filled the huge empty left by violinist of the stature of Szigetti, Neveu, Thibaud, Stern, Szerying, Gitlis, Busch, Vegh, Milstein and Hubberman.          We expect from him to listen his Bach Partitas and Sonatas, both Prokoviev and Shostakovich violin Concertos in the near future with superb conductors as Barenboim, Welser Most, Temirkanov and the raising Venezuelan baton: Gustavo Dudamel,  recently invited by the BBC.     This CD contains a remarkable Brahms performance. It is too far from Ginette Nevue reading in the late forties but nevertheless it keeps the majestic, supreme eloquence and gypsy ferocitiy demanded by Brahms in the last movement. The Sonata No. 3 is superbly conceived and recorded. Welcome to the Holy Pantheon, master.!
