 Jim Morrison was a very gifted musician , but also a very illustrated man . His influence comes directly of William Blake who really became through the years , in another artistic level , plus the original and innovative musical ideas from the lyrics and the sound of such original band . Considering the talent of Ray Manzarek and their legacy , consider the Doors as one of the living legends who made of their art much more than a simple group who played music . They went far beyond this premise .  Light my fire , Tell all the people , Love me two times , Breaking through , Riders on the storm or Love her madly were songs written with the immortality as stage , and such commitment level so hard to find in these times ; that is why they sound so fresh , thirty five years after .  Morrison died when he was just twenty seven . But since that moment he became in a legend . Since he was a poet who not only made music , he literally lived every piece with sublime intensity  .  He was a real shaman of the modern times , representing a whole generation tired of waiting .
