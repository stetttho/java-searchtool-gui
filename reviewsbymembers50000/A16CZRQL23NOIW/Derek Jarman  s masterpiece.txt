 At the moment we make a whole supported respect the biographic and visions filmic    around great painters of the past, certainly it would be a mistake to leave behind this amazing and heartfelt tribute to this overwhelming and original master. Jarman makes a free study about  the human nature and personal universe of this genius and builds a towering work of exceptional class and style. This Post Renaissance artist troubled by extremes of passion and artistic radicalism, but just remember a true artist always destroys the preexistent order to build a new one.   Go for this particular and well done film that scrutinizes with magical illumination, as must be the life and times of Caravaggio.  Derek Jarman: In memoriam!
