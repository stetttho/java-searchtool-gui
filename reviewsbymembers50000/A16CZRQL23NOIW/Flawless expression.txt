 All of us know how the interpretative grandness of Serkin enhanced with vertiginous speed since his constant and frequent collaborations with Pablo Casals in Prades Festival. In this sense, apart his natural talent, his vision around Bach acquired a major deepness and notable maturity. We have a striking evidence: his memorable 1957 Lugano Recital (fortunately available in CD).     We definitively have not had the chance to listen Rudolf Serkin playing Bach with major frequency we desired, and this is a very good option. These Goldberg are musically expressive. They possess the verticality and minutely precision in which the phrasing concerns; lyricism and expression. And, in spite of the fact there are true milestone performances in the whole musical firmament, we are talking about of one of the supreme pianists of the last Century.  Go for this album. The sound quality is fabulous.
