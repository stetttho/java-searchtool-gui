 One of the most significant statements of the always reminded master of the cinema, Robert Bresson, was :"To be models; instead of look like actors." I would say that Olivier Hirschbiegel unconsciously followed this wisdom advise. This (Should I just label it film, or perhaps this term be insufficient, why not better to design it supreme artwork?) masterpiece simply surpassed all the eloquent adjectives of previous reviews.   The impressive narrative dissection, supported by a sinewy script, is loaded of such burden of mesmerizing, engaging and delirious realism, that literally involves you from start to end. This outstanding work is a true radiograph that explores with merciless crudeness all the insights of the last ten days of Adolf Hitler.   Bruno Ganz followed his bliss and stole that coveted pearl, that justifies the supreme artistic achievement of his lifetime. From the initial shot when the nervous secretaries wait for him, until his last Farewell; his delirious anger accesses, increasing withdrawal of the reality, eloquent grimaces deserves for him (without forget Javier Bardem in Sea Inside) the most towering performance in years.   On the other hand the camera leads us to the struggling and  increasingly claustrophobic environment. The camera handle and the fabulous angle shots from the floor accent still more that oppressive atmosphere (Do you remember Orson Welles The Trial?).  The inner tragedy is expressed with vibrant expression. Three expressive sequences are enough to support it: watch for instance the ominous sequence in which Goebbels wife dismisses from her children, the child `s  horror at the moment he will have to face the death in its portent in the middle of the flaming wrecks and finally the elusive gaze of Eva Braun in her last supper.  On the other hand, the dialogues are never superfluous. With a visible resources economy, Hirshbiegel built a huge stage that reminds us the true intention of the Greek Tragedy or Wagner in Gotterdamenung, to shake the soul through the catastrophe, is what we experience after we leave the Hall a true cathartic experience.                        That superior coherence, the fact of fixing without congealing the feat of communicate expressions without the use of words is what it makes of this artwork a supreme masterpiece.
