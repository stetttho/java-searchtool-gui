              Zoltan Kocsis and Andras Schiff are the best and until now, the  last exponents of a vast tradition of legendary pianists through the XX Century. From Erwin Nyiregyhazi, Louis Kentner, Edith Farnadi, Gyrgy Sandor, Geza Anda, Andor Foldes and Annie Fisher.  However Kocsis ' colossal stature would seem to be reserved just only for a reduced audience. He has demonstrated widely his abilities. I knew about him through an excellent performance of  Bach's The Well Tempered Klavier. And his Bartok ` s interpretations though are not at the cosmic level of Sandor are provided with musicianship. He owns the famous three T: technique, tune and temperament.  These are interesting performances of the  dissonances master : Bela Bartok who, according a personal statement of Artur Honneger : "Bartok is the real Ambassador of the musical evolution. Less sparkling than Stravinsky, less dogmatic than Schenberg, is perhaps, the most intimately musician of the three and also in what development concerns has organized himself inside the most constant effort and best disciplined".
