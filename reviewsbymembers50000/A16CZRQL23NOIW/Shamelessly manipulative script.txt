 As you must know Ronald Emmerich is the same director of Independence Day, and in this film he insisted again in a pretended patriot approach, when looking the dramatis personae through clean glasses and provided of serene objectivity, the movie is just a personal vengeance between a colon, and beloved father of seven sons and his hated, implacable and merciless British Officer played superbly by Jason Isaac, under the orders of Tom Wilkinson. Mel Gibson, appeals to his emotive memories enriching his character with proportional doses of Mad Max, Lethal weapon and Braveheart.  The photography is extremely mesmerizing and its better merit, but even the brutal sequences of the wounds of the mortal cannons and a touching performance of Chris Cooper may dignify in its most legitimate splendor what it could have been a revitalization of the courage and honor and not becoming an overlong melodrama with unjustified and almost imperceptible mistakes as that sequence when the Troops arrive to town briefly after the sinister church's massacre. Have you ever been near a multitude of burn corpses and its and perceptible smell miles away?. The Troops come and no there 's no one capable to perceive it.  Very strange don't you? Perhaps, were they strongly affected for a flue, and unable to distinguish it?  That 's what it could be and all of us, the viewers ignored it.   Maybe with another script and another director the results would have been more eloquent!
