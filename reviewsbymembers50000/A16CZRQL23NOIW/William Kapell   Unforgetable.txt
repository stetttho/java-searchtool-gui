 Rachmaninoff's Second Concert is the most played work of this composer . You can make an impressive account of one hundred performances at least in the last forty years .  But to be true only seven versions deserve to be in the list of the most remarkable, and this is precisely one of them. Kapell made of this performance a farewell concert far beyond of the overindulgence and heartfelt phrase. Kapell never sounded romantic. He was a mature artist and avoided above all the cliches. He won will all the honors a honest and convincing performance without tears, but filled with noblesse.  The real winner performance of this fundamental album is Rachmaninoff's Variations. There has not ever born any pianist previous or later who had got so flammigerous, incandescent, furtive and fierce reading of this work as Kapell did it. Precision, conviction, phrasing, technique, histamina, poetry and rapture are some of the most remarkable adjectives I can find for this recording. Reiner directed admirably too to be honest. And this superb version is a real landmark and believe or not the time not only has elevated this status version, but besides has reached in the present times colossal dimensions. And I would really recommend another three additional performances: another version recently released live by Kapell and under Bernstein's batoon and two recordings by Richter: one from 1955 and the ultra known of 1958 with Stanislav Wisloscki.   Shostakovich;s Preludes are OK, but there's a name in these works: Tatiana Nikolayeva.
