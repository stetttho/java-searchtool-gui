 By all accounts Koussevitzky was a flamboyant , egocentric and authoritarian baton; he originated in the first ages of the musical conduction where the tyrant archetype nestled anywhere. Under his domineering will, Boston Symphony reached that privileged status that still today detents, in spite of there is not point of comparing.   His Brahms possesses an austere approach, though it maintains that  radiant aristocracy, expansive phrasing and expressive musculature. This idiosyncratic gaze allows us to dive into the minimum facets of this sumptuous and mistakenly sentimentally played  This is an autumnal and meditative Opus but far from being a stylized and tearful work. And this legendary version is far to be self indulgent. The famous lyricism of the Third Movement never becomes a soap melodrama. In times of decadence, it is very common to use the score to project our own weakness and fears but such approach is bad perspective of Brahms. The last movement is loaded of resplendent struggle and visceral burden.              The Fourth is well played; with  powerful intensity and immense display of mercurial  passion. It has to be accounted this is by far the most difficult to play Symphony in Brahmsian repertoire. It demands not only an astonishing domain of the thematic material but the work has too many modulations and speed changes; you may easily to run aground in the first bars; and if this happens the subsequent result will be a soporiferous performance. Koussevitsky gets to confer a visible consistency and special strength without loss of expressiveness and stylistic audacity.    Go for these treasured performances. They are part of the musical legend.
