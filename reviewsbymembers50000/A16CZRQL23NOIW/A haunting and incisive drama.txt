 Powerful and absorbing drama about the personal anguish and internal dragons of simple man after he has murdered. His conflicts and dramatis personae are narrated in a fabulous minimalist language.   Watching this film you will notice why Wenders is so close to Antonioni in what existential problems concern. That is why they have worked so close.
