 The constructive sonorous straightness enclosed inside a stylized cipher, the lucid tonal geometry and an overwhelming spontaneity that elapses with an intrinsic pleasant character, are some of the remarkable features of this fabulous composer. He has been able to approximate to the searches of the more advanced vanguard that proceeds from Pierre Boulez.  His musical speech supported by diatonic lines and the overlapping of interweaved tumultuous tonalities are not any obstacle to enjoy and appreciate his art.  I think this admirable Concerto for Orchestra is one the most representative works after the WW2. When you buy this double CD you will include it among your most estimated treasures.   Exceptional and rewarding selection with an insuperable sound.
