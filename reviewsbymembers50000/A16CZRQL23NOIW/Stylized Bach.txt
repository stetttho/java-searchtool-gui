 Nathan Milstein (1903-1992) was always a very humble player. Certainly his name was not immersed in the jet set of Szigetti, Heifetz or Oistrakh. His playing was extremely meditative and introspective, though invested of a visible stylized approach.  These Bach 's works are the supreme fire proof for any serious violinist.  His vibrato is far to be sumptuous but instead possesses an sense of tune and color, an expansive sound and a innate freshness. It is fair to acknowledge the tempos are faster than the rest of the recordings you have listened, but despite of this fact his phrasing is so clean, so well articulated, with an impressive aristocratic tone, admirable clarity of conception and sparkling imagination filled with remarkable expressiveness and humanity.   His reading of the well known partite No. 2 is simply vibrant. Milstein possessed temperament and personality; brightness and eloquence.  The Allemande and Giga specially, are majestic. The Chaccone is impregnated of that mysterious aura with ravishing cosmic breath and impetuous intensity.    In my personal list I have this set in a second choice after the legendary achievement of Henryk Szeryng, in the third place Sandor Vegh, the forth for Szigetti and the Fifth for Heifetz. Go for these treasured performances.      But please, remember: the primacy belongs to Szerying!
