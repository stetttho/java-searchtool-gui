 Hans Hotter recorded for the posterity, the most incandescent, expressive and idiomatic Schubert `s cycle of songs, in November 1942. His steeled voice, his clean intonation and remarkable sense of the span and outstanding commitment with the spirit of the text makes of this recording a true historical musical document.
