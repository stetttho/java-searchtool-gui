 This set of 8 CD contains valuable recordings of this piano poet . You will b surprised with the Prokoviev Third Concert . It is played with vitality without that hyperkinetism of the most of the pianists . Full of poetry . His Mozart is very original .  Bach is arresting .  The Chopin is first rate . The Andante Spianato is sublime .  His Schumann has peaks and lows .  Faure piano pieces are splendid , and his songs without words (Mendelssohn) a supreme revelation . His Prelude , Choral and Fugue of Cesar Franck is towering . Widely recommendable!
