 Curiously this film is not a simple western . It goes far beyond . Robert Ryan to my mind made the role of his life as the crude but smart villain who establishes a clever dialogue extremely exciting through the story which works out splendly , but Anthony Mann the same of Men of the West , undoubtedly his masterpiece , created a very special icon inside this genre . Just a few westerns have created its own personality through the time . Consider the following western films : Ride the high country , The wild Bunch , The Ballad of Cable Hogue , Seven men from now , Warlock , The Searchers , Tombstone , Stagecoach , Men of the West , Johny Guitar , Once upon a time in the west , She wore a yellow ribbon , High Noon , Rio Bravo , The big country, Open Range , The life and times of Judgre Roy Bean , Sundance Kid , The Ox Bow Incident and this movie have such level of original force which literally overpassed the classic genre to constitute the western elite and far beyond . That is the colossal artistic height of this outstanding film . Leigh is splendid as always and Stewart credible as the Good Guy . Formidable and extraordinary picture .  Do not miss it under no pretext .
