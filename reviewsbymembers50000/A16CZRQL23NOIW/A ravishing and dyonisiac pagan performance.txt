 This version of Daphne remains as one the most solid and idiomatic versions ever made .  We all know about the supreme elegance and sense of the drama given for that alsacian master : Charles Munch . The Boston Symphony and the chorus are first rate . The sumptuosity and the nuance expression are loaded of mistery and disturbing fascination . Since there is another mono recording recorded at early fifties , we are expecting its release to get it too , but meanwhile this recording is supremely recommendable if you want to know the minimum facets of Daphne and Cloe.
