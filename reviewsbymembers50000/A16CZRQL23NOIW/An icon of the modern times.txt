The soundtracks in the most of those films became fundamental  part of the irresistible charm of 007 as well for us to admire the supreme Goddess as well as the female audience who found in every generation the ideal type . This is an admirable compilation  who goes from Goldfinger Shirley Bassey until Tomorrow never dies with the talented singer Sheryl Crow . The best song in the CD? It depends from you . To me Nobody does it better is the jewel of the crown , but nevertheless From Russia with love is a nostalgic piece , the saddest is We have all the time in the world with the unforgettable Satchmo in one of his last recordings . You only live twice threw to Nancy Sinatra to the stardom after being recorded Something stupid a song for two voices with her father . The man with the golden arm with Lulu is an excelent theme .
