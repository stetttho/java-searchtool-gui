 This is a compelling and detailed essay about the facts happened in Loudun in the century XV .  Urbain Grandier a priest not necesarily viruosi visits Loudun and since his brief stage in the Ursulina Convent, the spell is done . The rest of the incredible and merciless facts censored so many times  is at last revealed in all its  crude nakeness.  The Exorcism processes made in the Grandier humanity are terrible and the insanity in the name of God are extraordinary told for Aldous Huxley one of the most brilliant and prolific minds of the british literature . I really think this may be weel the most remarkable work done for Huxley in all his outstanding career.  Ken Russell a british film maker adapted this one to make The Demons in 1977 .  I can garantee you it will be hard to abandon this reading till you finnish .
