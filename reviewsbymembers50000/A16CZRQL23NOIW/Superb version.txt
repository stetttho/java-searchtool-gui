 The Mass in B Minor is not only one of the monumental and unfathomable landmarks of Johan Sebastian Bach , but besides it 's one of the great works of Modern Civilization . The Mass was submitted in July 1773 at Dresden with a humble request for an appointment as Court composer.  Bach knew to be lyric at the same time than dramatic when the text demanded it and the music requested it . His inspiration is well-aimed , without hesitations . You could establish a parallel Bach-Shakespeare since the infinite exploration in both genius of a feeling , of a psychological hue. Is this a catholic Mass? The answer is no . It was an existing form of ritual in the Lutheran Church. According to Karl Geiringer it curious the Mass in B Minor be called in that tonality . He argues the composition contains twelve movements in D major and only five in B minor . D is the tone of the jubilee Gloria and Credo so Resurrexit and Sanctus . This recording is fundamental for any collector item . Special mentions to Pierrette Alarie , soprano ; Leoplod Simoneau Tenor and Nan Merriman , Alto . The magistral voices of The Vienna academy Chorus under the baton of Scherchen will give you a full description and gratifying moments with this excel work. Thanks to Deutsche Gramophone for this special re-edition , since I have the previous release of the dissapeared label MCA. I guess the sound must have been improved .
