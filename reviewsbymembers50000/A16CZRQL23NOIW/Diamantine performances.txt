    In those years Serkin was in the peak of his powers; evidently his meetings with Adolf Busch and eventually his periodic encounters in Prades made him grow up to unexpected levels. Casals could call any musician he wanted, he was a supreme musical authority in the world, I presume this fact is a relevant proof about the intense musicianship and tonal splendor in the early thirties reached major levels. His encounter with Busch quartet kept the European approach and then Prades and specifically his works with Casals performing Beethoven's cello sonatas elevated him to cosmic heights.   Precisely these seven years were extremely creative. His Waldstein's  performance is among the top, the Sonata 30 is very interesting and so the Patetique is superb too. With the Appassionata I rather prefer his version of 1957 in Lugano.  It' s important to remark his invaluable collaboration with Budapest's string quartet . His reading of the Piano quintet Op. 34 is absolutely definitive and his Diabelli variations are among the best in the market.  So consider this album as a real must to acquire all the way. If you want to have in your collection a golden album, go for this historical recordings.
