 Saura murdered two birds of one only shot in this magisterial and introspective movie. The repressive atmosphere of the Franco Regime works out as fundamental frame to accent two awful and dramatic events lived by a disturbed woman. Being just a child she witnesses the ambiguity Eros-Thanatos when simultaneously his father dies while his mother makes love with his best friend' s wife. But years after when her mother dies of cancer she will expiate her inner demons through a blame' s transfer with her stepfather.  Repression, emotions not surpassed, restrained anguish, emotional memories imprisoned under a brutal regime make of this film not only a sumptuous artwork but maybe one of the most complex and fascinating psychological portraits of the human soul ever filmed.
