 This album is the absolute and definitive evidence of the caleidoscopic vision and the ambitious artistic goals of Willie along his raising and meteoric ascension as artist,poetry and deep thinker. In the universe of the pianists of his generation was unique. The performance of Bach Fourth Partita sounds with awise approach, giving it a very personal approach,and making Bach more human and lyrics. His Debussy reveals a reviewed understanding of the whole sense of this composer.Kapell sounds at the meantime, incorporean and  visceral,sensual and elusive. And finally we arrive to one of the most striking performances of the Pictures thgat I 've listened ever.Strong and percusive,human and trembling, darkly and mercurial. In fact, "The Pictures" is a huge journey through the several anima  states : melancholy, innocence, frehness, joy of living, humor and frenzy. This Suite must be played as a true Theme with variations,  giving to every piece its authentic specific weight. Get this album and tresure it for your descendents. Kapell will be shining with own light through the years, because his integrity, precocious maturity and incandescent playing. In memoriam!
