 In the story of the rock and blues there has not been any other emblematic personality so gifted and expressive as Sugar Cane . You may talk about Stephan Grapelli and Jean Luc Ponty but somehow his performance level were simply musical , they never went far beyond the  scarfskin .  Cane did it . You listen the blues I am alone , or A cup filled of dreams and you can feel the rapport , the sincerity and deep honesty of his art . He belongs to the reduced dynasty of musicians that surpassed the status of simple gifted musicians such John Mayall , BB King, Eric Clapton , Jimmy Hendrix to become in real icons .
