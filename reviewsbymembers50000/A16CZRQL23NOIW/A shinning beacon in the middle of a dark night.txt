 Nowadays many pianists think -mistakenly- that to fill a big hall, demands to produce an enormous sound amount of sound, hammering the instrument with all their mighty. That conception prevailed during the second half of the XIX Century with that advertised announce: "an authentic keyboard lion". Casadesus was so reliable about the sheerness of the sound that literally astonished the whole world with his apparent simplicity, facing such dissimilar composers as Beethoven and Ravel, and being so famous performer in both at the same time.  He was owner of an illimitable energy and prodigious generosity. From his unique fingers. Chopin's Third Ballade never sounded better. His Ravel's Concerto with Ormandy for the left hand and his Beethoven `s Fourth Piano Concerto with Van Beinum still maintain a status character between the connoseurs. His Scarlatti is played with the same dedication of a filigree builder: the exquisiteness in its major level.  His great musicianship will remain through the years, due it was born from the inner soul. That' s the divine clue of the real artist. He was not a superb French artist. His grandness is far beyond a simple nationality. The actual generation of many extremely self worried by only the technician aspect should search and take their time to listen this outstanding and supreme master.   He will never be forgotten by those who personally admired his craftsmanship and for those music lovers of the future!
