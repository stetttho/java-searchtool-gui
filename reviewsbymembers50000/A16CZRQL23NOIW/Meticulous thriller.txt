  An Ex- con has planned with minimum detail every little step: he has designed all kind of electronic wonders and advanced technology : nothing should be wrong; except perhaps, certain twists of fate disguised as human factor that simply escape from your control.  Christopher Walken's first feature : Balsam and Connery are particularly effective. Excellent direction of Sidney Lumet.
