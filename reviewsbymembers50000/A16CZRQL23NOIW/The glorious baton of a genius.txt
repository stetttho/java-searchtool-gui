 Ferenc Fricsay made possibly one of the most interesting versions of Le Sacre ever made in the whole music story. It 's filled of entire conviction and above all profound domain of the discursive and bitter musical language. A notable sonorous richness, steeled modulations, extraordinary interpretative nervous, accurate and precision. The rhythmic obsession is delirious.  And Petrushka deserves another giant surprise for you. This is to my mind , the only performance which can be equaled and even ranked with the famous and historic version of Ansermet and London Philharmonic of 1947. That is no more, nor less the enormous specific weight of this mercurial performance.  On the other hand, the edition process and sound quality is outstanding. If you think it over, you will never find another album pregnant of such remarkable importance and transcendental vigor.  Please, buy it immediately
