 The necessary balance between the impetuous and sweeping pianism of Martha Argerich blended with the meditative and reflexive playing of Kremer worked out admirably, because when you have a solid approach these are minor obstacles.   Both of them play these Sonatas with sublime conviction, weeding and acrving in relief the dark and rough Beethovenian dissonances beneath the score, because of Beethoven' s sound must never sound only beautiful.   In spite of the fact I previously commented the winning performers of the whole set of Sonatas are to my mind Szigetti-Arrau, Kempff-Menuhin and for those who wish a lyrical approach Francescati-Casadesus, this is probably the most remarkable recording of these renowned works in the last thirty years.  And this fact is by itself, an emblematic feat.
