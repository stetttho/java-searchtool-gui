 Absolutely agree. Happy and wisdom statement that it constitutes the central nervous of the film. A powerful story that interweaves with impeccable edition past and present. The triumph of the great loves can be seen only through the ravishing Perrault stories. In the fifties Hiroshima mon amour proved once more the expected possibility to reach the absolute realization due the love. But the magnificent homage to Hemingway is all around the film. And you think in that ancient Frank Borzage's film Farewell to arms over and over. The nurse, extraordinarily played by the French Goddess Juliette Binoche, who won deservedly the academy Award will mean the weak link between the life and death when she decides to consecrate all her efforts for keeping alive to this mysterious man, seriously wounded after being attacked. The moral reconstruction is far beyond the delicate physical condition. This man is alive just to tell us his fatidic story. But the fascinating script engages us with other secondary characters as the implacable Wilhelm Dafoe who will follow to Fiennes according superior orders. Kristin Scott Thomas and Colin Firth will be the couple in disgrace who will conform the amorous triangle. The love scenes are filmed with admirable good taste and artistic rapture. There are not wasted lines in this running film of 155 min. The desert is the big frame and also another invisible actor that will untie that huge sand torment that will allow the narrow and decisive contact of these two future lovers. There is besides, a surreptitious homage to David Lean by double departure: A brief encounter and Lawrence of Arabia. This will be one of the most reminded films in the distant future. I guess the multidimensional level and Shakespearian and Wagnerian dramatic roots  that sustain the whole work will consent it a special place in the Pantheon of the great films.                   Joseph Fiennes is a true giant actor. How many additional proofs  do you want? After Schindler's list, we have besides Spider and The end of the affair. All the cast was simply marvelous. And obviously the magnificent effort of all the production team, scripters and the sumptuous art work of Minghella who, to my mind has made to date his best film and glorious masterpiece.
