 This superb gem deals with the tribulations, disappointments and disillusions once the ideals face against the crude reality. John lynch is Cal a teenage boy who wants to sever his ties with the IRA. But the other side of the dramatis personae resides precisely in the fact, the widow of the policeman he helped murder, falls in love with him and he doubts if he must tell the sordid story or not.   Helen Mirren won her First Prize in Cannes as best actress in 1984 with this towering performance; (the second Prize in 1995 was awarded by The madness of King George). Ambitious and mature film that share all honors together with Hidden Agenda of Ken Loach.   A legendary icon of the Eighties.
