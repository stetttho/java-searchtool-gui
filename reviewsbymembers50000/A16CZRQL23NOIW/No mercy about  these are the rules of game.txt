 A sexual adventure in the youth will be filed by the political opposition and so pretending disqualify her nomination for Vice president: this is the game, does anyone else want to play?     Brutal portray of the interiorities of the political insights, where the unsuspected actions, committed involuntarily may become your worst enemy. So, are we talking a clean game where the ideas are confronted or are we playing to the well know ethic posture. Private vices, public virtue?   Excellent and original film with towering performances of Joan Allen and Gary Oldman.
