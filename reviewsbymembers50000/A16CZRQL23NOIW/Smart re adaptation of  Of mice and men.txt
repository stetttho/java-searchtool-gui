  The brutal impact you will receive after watching that superb film of obvious theatrical character does not diminish at all its primordial virtues. From California to Philadelphia a pair of drifter-losers plan their future building the isolated pieces of a broken living without many expectations in the middle term future. The wings if the hopeless make its work in the desperate souls of these men literally overcome by the hard challenge of living. Curious parable: from West to East in the same way that just four years before two outlaw men make a parallel road in Easy Rider. This long journey will allow us to explore once more the aridity emotional and affective of two men in the edge of the fall. An existential story nothing easy to follow except if you are ready by previous films of related issues as The fire within, the swimmer., Paris Texas, Strozek or the Last year in Mariembad for instance.  I love this picture and if you do not accept the challenge you will really miss one of the tour de force performances of two real giants actors. I do not think it is exaggerate to conclude this has been the best achievement of Gene Hackman in his career and the sixth best acting of Pacino after Godfather II, Scent of a woman, Justice for all, Dog day afternoon  and Carlitos way in that decreasing order.  I insist: it is not a easy film. But it is plenty of details that work out so efficiently that you will remind it for a long, long time. May be this scrupulous theme is not approached in the future with such honesty and conviction as this case, when the American Cinema gave an important twist in its wide scope focusing the concerns of single people.  An artistic treasure and without any doubt one of my 100 best American Films in any age.     I wonder why this major work has not been released on DVD format: a mistery which overpasses my outstanding. You can argue many reasons but just any excuse.
