 The romantic vein of Clara Schumann is expressed with these exuberant pieces: Three Romances Op. 22 composed in 1853 between the second and third sonatas for violin and piano by Robert Schumann and dedicated to Joseph Joachim. They are handled with interesting harmonies and contrasting melodies The First one is a romantic Andante. The Second is an expressive Allegretto. The Third is without doubt the most charming and tender of the whole set.  The First Sonata Op.105  has a first movement loaded of tragic tension. The Second Sonata is by far, the most complete and best elaborated of the set. It is without doubt one of the most lyrical and romantic pages ever written. Its first performance was given on 29th  October 1853.  The Third Sonata is meandering. It is absolutely incomprehensible how the forgetful 's blanket has covered it.    Andrew Hardy  and Uriel Tsachor conform a good team.  Go for these valuable records. And get into the musical universe of this Romantic composer.
