  These admirable versions of Mozart flute strings are a minuscule part of his immense musical legacy. And despite the very little knowledge of their significance they really are neglected and little known for the most of the great audiences.

They are splendid and charming works filled with refined elegance and spontaneous lyricism.    By far, the best option in the market.
