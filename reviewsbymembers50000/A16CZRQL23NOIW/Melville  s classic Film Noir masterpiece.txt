 The fertile imagination and superb direction of this unusual and sometimes forgotten filmmaker for most audiences, find the perfect intersection of a killer who lives according Bushido codes, moving continuously around Paris with his fedora hiding his eyes. There will be a mythical revenge behind.  Unexplainably, Jean Pierre Melville is a relatively not so well known in this side of the Atlantic. He possessed that sixth sense so demanded in an original filmmaker. He influenced and at the meantime  was influenced by the Noir genre in the sixties.   But his whole work conforms one of the most astonishing personalities in the French Cinema as well as in the World.  From his first Opus; the wonderful, poetic and expressive film "The silence of the sea", passing by "Bob le flambeur" or his famous "Army of shadows", Melville has received a curious and cynical nickname: "The most famous French Director in USA and the most North American filmmaker in France."  Go for this singular and original film. Absolutely electrifying!
