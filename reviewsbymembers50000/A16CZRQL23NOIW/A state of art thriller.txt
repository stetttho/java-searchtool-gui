 This is an intriguing and complex feminist thriller . The multiple dramatic angles overpass all the previous considerations in the French Cinema and with the glorious exception of The postman always rings twice of Tay Garnett  in USA and the Italian version Ossesione of Luchino Visconti in 1943  based on James Cain ` s novel , this scary movie will show the scrupulous chess game for murder planned for two women .  Simone Signoret will prove you once more why she was the most outstanding and prominent French actress through the XX Century , four years before her consecrated in  USA with her more than deserved Academy Award by A room in the top. Vera Clouzot is fine too . Superbly directed for Henri Georges Clouzot the same film maker who made that giant masterpiece Wages of fear , four years ago.
