 A man; his son: the expected illusion on him, to make your dreams come true, trusting in the possibilities of your son; the hopeful arrival to NYC, one of the seven millions people at that moment who firmly believes, the city is depending on them; the clash against the penury and the awful reality of the face, disillusions and new revived hopes are magnificently depicted in this sonorous picture, which still maintains its prestigious status at the moment to consider the greatest silent gold movies ever done.  The experience of life in its darkest nature, when a self convinced man believes his dreams are more powerful than the reality; in search of something big will be basically a striking testimonial where not all dreams come true:   A sharp and merciless glance around the wonderland and its variegated complexities. A majuscule feat of King Vidor.   The towering performance of James Murray is by far the half of this supreme jewel.
