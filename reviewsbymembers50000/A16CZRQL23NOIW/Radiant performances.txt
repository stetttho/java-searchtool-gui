 In 1951, the Chicago Symphony was a prodigious orchestra, having only a superior rivals to Boston, Philadelphia, New York, Cleveland and Minneapolis. The presence of Kubelik was indeed, very brief but decisive. He was a very illustrated and introspective he gave them the perfect balance between balance and color. Listening this Prague version you can confirm it. It is exultant and jubilee, radiant and in the meantime, mercurial.  His clean approach allowed the expression of the work followed its path, but filled of greatness and ambition. As the great conductor his presence is perceived far beyond his gestures back the podium.  In particular this is one the most stimulant Prague performances that I know, and since it is far from being my favorite one, I enjoy it very often. The New World is a very expansive work, plenty of sumptuousness and virility: one of the best choices in the market, after the classical versions of Fricsay, Kertesz,Giulini and Toscanini.
