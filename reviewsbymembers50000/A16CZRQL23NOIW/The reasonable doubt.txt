 This movie is an engrossing drama and a real challenge . A jury have to decide whether a young boy killed his father with a knife . Every one of the twelve men is a emblematic character and all the way the story is played in a jury room . You will watch how the different characters diagree very often and the initial statement will change progressively through a brilliant deduction .  This Lumet 's opera prima is a carefully and flamboyant study of the human nature and underlines the thin line between the aparent and the true . Technically the different camera movements are powerful . You can consider at least three hundred positions all along the movie. This film is a beauty homagge to Rashomon and underlines how hazardous may be to assume the facts how they seem and not how they are . The fifties were hard times in different issues , and how the inner and outer fears  of the human being can judge to an innocent man .  The cast is superb but Jack Warden stole the show .  One of the most remarkable gems of the american cinema. I recommend this work to management science , take of decisions and leadership studies .
