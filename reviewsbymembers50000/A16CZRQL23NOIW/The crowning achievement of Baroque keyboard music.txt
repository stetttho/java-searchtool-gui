 The theme for the Goldberg Variations came from a notebook which Bach complied and eventually presented to his wife by then, Anna Magdalena Bach, in 1725.  The Goldberg Variations stands as one of the greatest keyboard works of all times; it is the result of the incommensurable genius, febrile dedication, profound inspiration and displays a huge talent for idiomatic keyboard writing. Sir Donald Tovey said once: "Until Beethoven wrote the Waldstein Sonata, the Goldberg Variations were the most brilliant piece of sheer instrumental display extant. No other work or by Domenico Scarlatti, not even any concerto by Mozart or any earlier work of Beethoven could compare with it for instrumental balance."    Tureck has been called Bach' supreme priestess. And that is far to be an exaggerate nickname. Throughout her incandescent digitations, superb phrasing and devoted commitment with Bach you can realize this epithet is a true resume of an entire life consecrated to cultivate and divulge his eternal value and sublime meaning.
