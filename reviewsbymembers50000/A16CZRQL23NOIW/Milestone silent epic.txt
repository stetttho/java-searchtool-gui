 Griffith constitutes to the American Cinema the most remarkable director ever born and in my personal list he is among the five Greats . After him we can name Welles, Ford, Wilder, Capra and a long etc. But this giant understood the enormous relevance about the overtaking and the expressive power of this relatively new device. With the only exception of Giovanni Pastrone in Italy (Cabiria nights), till that moment any other filmmaker had such level of commitment, ambition and distinction at the moment of handling a camera to ignite the screen in such way.  Griffith was a herald of the Cinema. His transcendence has elevated the ambits of the artistic barriers to become a continuous matter of analysis and discussion around the master classes and far beyond. He inspired to a remarkable crowd of future directors - Stroheim was perhaps, the most immediate director.       250 chariots, 15.000 people support an intense script perfectly articulated where the injustice prevails far beyond a specific age.
