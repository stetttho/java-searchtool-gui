 Amateur is according the Greek meaning: all those who love what they do .  And somehow the spirit of constant and ascendant improving established the difference in Foster that day when the cheat was done. He imposed to himself the maximum penalty to finish with that hard and unbearable memories. But when he watches that young promise who tries by all means to get close him and knowing about him, he will feel the last call and something inside him it will awake. This slow paced but interesting script is a lesson of life, the constancy, tenacity and work ness will never lead you to a dead zone. Something is watching you and sooner or later the truth will shine. Along the film there are another secondary lines that support the script: the caddy world, the racism and the secret passions. Splendid photography and a brilliant performance of Gary Sinise and Phillip Baker Hal confer this movie an artistic status.
