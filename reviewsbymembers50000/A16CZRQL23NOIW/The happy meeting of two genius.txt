 The recording sessions were made on 3 and 4 April 1961.It  results impossible to describe the admirable and instantaneous alchemy and enviable rapport among these two giants.   Duke Ellington was by far the most complete jazz musician in the Century. And Satchmo was (behind Davis of course) was a true living legend of the instrument. Duke, playing the piano gave us a sonorous surprise with his expressive sound.   Every piece is a joy by itself. I 'm just a lucky so and so is true orgiastic blues. Cottontail is a moving theme with Barney Bigard playing clarinet in extraordinary shape,making a superb counterpoint with Satchmo.       Mood Indigo is (who can deny it?) the jewel of the crown. What feeling and expression, what sense of the color and what sublime inspiration; you feel the blues in your veins, and the rough voice of Satchmo confers the piece an additional touch of joy: an extraordinary version without any doubt.   Black and fantasy is another gem. What sensation.  It don 't mean a thing is a gorgeous instrumental where you can realize the Dionysian mood of Mr. Satchmo in that studio recording. Solitude is another sensitive blues with a great accompaniment of Duke.     Mort Herbert in bass is splendid too as well as Tommy young at trombone.
