 If you look inside through the dramatic core of this play, you will find a heartfelt homage to Rashomon: that glorious masterpiece of Akira Kurosawa. Penn built a simple story in a forgotten town, and deals with an old retired policeman with serious problems with the drink, who will be involved for a child's brutal murder. He will investigate this case till its last consequences, but the fate will make its bitter appearance to eliminate his brilliant deduction, leaving him with the infinite doubt and giving the most of people (the reason?) that proved once more he was not the most indicate man to resolve this murder. As you see the concept of the truth appears in all its nakedness: it is an elusive idea that it makes us feel safe. The whole truth simply doesn't exist. We just are able to see part of it: and that's all. But this word has such hypnotic power, and fascinating charm, that seduces the mass since the dawn of the mankind. How many times have you read: The truth will make you free? Which truth? yours, mine, of my neighbor's one?    Ironic, sharp and bitter story. One of the most intelligent films of that year, not for great audiences. Mesmerizing performance of Nicholson and excellent work behind the camera by Penn.
