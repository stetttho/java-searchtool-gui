 I am not a hard fan of Leonard Bernstein , but there are exceptional cases like this in which you simply have yo say : Bravo Maestro ! The Candide overture is terrific . Based on the Voltaire work , the overture of almost five minutes is a tribute to the life . played with dyonisiac enthusiasm and overpassing passion . The West Side Story Suite is extraordinary played . Personally I do not know about any other performance which can match with this one . On the waterfront is simply brilliant . This is the soundtrack of that brave film of Elia Kazan of the early fifties . And Fancy free performing only matches with another version of the same director with the Columbia Symphony of 1950 . I hace it in vynil , because believe or not ; this recording has not transfered to CD . But this set is simply fundamental for you . Be or not a fan of Bernstein , because that inspired music represents the golden years of Bernstein as composer and conductor . The New York Philarmonic members played as real Greek Gods . Supreme majesty and overwhelming passion .
