 Neveu belonged to another level of performers. His playing was incredibly stunnig precise filled with comittment warmth and fire. This version only has a contender. Herself in a further version recorded with the Munich Orchestra conducted by Hans Schmidt Isserted in 1948 . However this Dobrowens version is  amazing. and very close to that approach. (The difference is the mature in the musical thought of Neveu in that one). After you listen please, try with Heifetz and believe or not, Heifetz is absoltely cold and in certain way he doesnt reach the elusive height and even he shows a understanding spirit of this work. And i sure you. Im not kidding. Both versions are hair raising and overwheelming. Please make yourself a favour and compare by yourself.
