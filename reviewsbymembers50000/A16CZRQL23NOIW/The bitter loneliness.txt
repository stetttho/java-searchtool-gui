 The film is based in the theatrical work of the same name of Rainer Werner Fassbinder . the only stage of the action is the workshop dwelling of the protagonist , the fashion designer Petra von Kant a refined and eccentric woman divorced twice who lives with her secretary-slave Marlene. But that selfish human beingsuddenly will fall in love with Karim, ayoung beauty of modest origin who enjoys the luxury offered by Petra without serious commitment respect her lover . That happiness period will break when Karim decides to reconciliate with her husband . Petra , obviously is very distured and she rebuilds many aspects of her past behavior , but when she proposes Marlene a participation in the business , Marlene leaves home . This was one the creative peaks in the career of this indefatigable creator of human portraits . Somehow Petra is a mirror image of him in those times . But far beyond the anecdotic aspect ,the film is a merciless story about the loneliness and hopeless gaze of the female world . Personally I do not know about another film maker in the story of the cinema who deals with these themes with such fineness and deepness . He never will take a previous attitude ; he drowns in these troubled waters and suffers with them their triumphs and calamities . He is the legitimate son of Douglas Sirk with a major scope , indeed .  Since his early death in 1982 , when he just was in his thirties (36) , the creative world of the german cinema still  remains inciomplete . You may name Percy Aldon , Herzog , Wenders , Kluge and Hauff but something  lost in the environment , due the prodigious and outstanding mind  of Fassbinder is absent .
