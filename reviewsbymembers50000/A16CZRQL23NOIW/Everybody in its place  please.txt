 This Cannes winner is a magnificent adaptation of L.P. Hartley about the stifling class system in England. The artistic and awful script turns around a very painful circumstance, when a chauffeur gets involved with an upper-class woman who recently abandons a psychiatrist Institution after suffering a mental depression. He establishes a powerful relationship with her but he doesn't realize the slender between trust and affection; the warm friendship and the real love; he simply is unable to perceive it and that will be the beginning of the end.  Robert Shaw made the best achievement of his career with this highly artistic film, underrated in the west coast of the Atlantic and reserved just for treasure film searchers  but acclaimed in Europe due its status level.   Mature and sensitive film that runs slow paced that demands the full involvement of the viewer.   At last this giant film arrives to this format, at last.
