 The creative and fertile imagination of Tim Burton reached the peak with this incredible and poignant fable . Burton created a tale that means an authentical ode to the triumph of the human being in front the different obstacles he must to face through his existence . The script is well known for all of you , so I want to emphasize is the rapture , the dark poetry and the presence of a model in the cinema .  Johny Depp made the most powerful artistic performance about a unknown and never created before character . Heaccepted the role and won by far . The atmosphere is top of the line . The couple Depp - Ryder was perfect . They established a real rapport since the first shots . Johnny Depp is actually one of the greatest actors in the world . And I think his talent grew up in this film and somehow this movie blessed him .
