 The Italian heritage made of him one of the most sublime Operatic conductors in the music. His passionate style, his perpetual obsession for the accurateness, his different and expansive grimaces at the stand are still reminded.  But all these titanic efforts were compensated and fortunately for us, who have been blessed with some of his most winning performances. His version of Prelude and Liebstood from Tristan and Isolde  still remain among the untouchable and legendary versions recorded in any age.   Pitifully for him, he was like Paul van Kempen a privileged conductor without a fixed Orchestra, a gypsy Director in all the sense of the word.   If you merely have hear about his craft, I beg you to acquire all what you can from his eminent director whose time begins to show.  This is an anthological CD; a true collector item.
