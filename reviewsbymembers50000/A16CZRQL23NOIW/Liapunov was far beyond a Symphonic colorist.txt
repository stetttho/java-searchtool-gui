 Louis Kenter was a legendary pianist. His honesty and conviction permeated all his performances during his lifetime. His Liszt for instance reveals a vital concern for eliminate the "hook effect", that corrosive approach that so many seems to convey at the moment to play Liszt. He did not remark the acrobatic pyrotechnics and the demoniac sforzandos, but he always illuminated the score through admirable and expressive glissandos or admirable arpeggios.  Under this perspective these little known Liapunov ` studies are performed. Liapunov as John field was not musically interesting; the form dominated always over the cantabile line. You can not talk about a solid musical construction, because these were not his intention. And Kentner searched and got to extract that lyric vein through the perfect balance between elegance and robustness.  You will surprise yourself once you have acquired these neglected and almost forgotten pages.
