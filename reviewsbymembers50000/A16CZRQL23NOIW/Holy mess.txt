 Noyce is an extremely good director. He usually likes to dare the viewer with hard and challenging scripts(Henry and June, for instance) but somehow he failed in this case with this misfired character of the main character. The storyboard and the actor direction became the Saint in almost a cartoon network. So, if the true purpose was simply to delight the young audience, the goal was made. But for the mature viewer, this film was a crossroad between the Avengers and 7 Faces of Dr. Lao. Thre was chemistry sexual among Elizabeth Shue and Val Kilmer, but the whole structure of the plot does not resist a further analysis, the script possesses an extreme weakness, fragility and predictability.  It's hard to believe Noyce had directed one of the most relevant films in the decade as Patriot Games was, compared with this easily forgettable film that may work out for a boring pop corned rainy weekend.
