 In the famous carrer of this swiss conductor there were many definitive performances. But if you make me pronounce for the first of them, I would mention this record. The state of art is the term that better describes the spanish dionisiac passion that seems iluminate and engage to all the musician of the Suisse Romande. All the orchestra that day seemed to be literally so enthusiastic, that gave their best of their craft and walked to the eternity. Fire, glamorous histamina, passion, elegance, rapport, and a deep comittment with the Three cornered hat makes this record, one of the supreme treasures of its kind in XX century and throws to Ansermet to the rank of the supreme batton virtuosi. Forget about any other record. Don't experience with other one. It wolud be a waste of time and money.  And thanks to the genius of Manuel de Falla for his contribution.
