 In this performance of Beethoven`s seconds concert Kapell makes an dionisiac approach . The notes under his fingers are played with such kind of "velvet touch", (specially the second movement) that it doesnt let you indifferent. His reading is far from being romantic. Its a classical view. May be this is the reason why Beethoven is so difficult to play. It comes to my mind the performance given by Glenn Gould in 1958, and I think this is the only version that is near respect his warmth and lyrical rendition. But coming to Kapell, his performances seem to have the perfection`s mark . One could think that Kapell would have a strange premonition in every one of of his records, that his presence in the world wasnt long. Anyway to all these people that haven`t heard enough to Mr. Kapell , this is your chance to know to the keyboard`s prince. Ive been a Kapell`s fan since 1970 when I knew about him in a live performance from Australia in the 4 scherzos of Chopin. Since that day , the only pianist that I remember whose playing is so cantabile, comittment with the score and interpretative fire is Sviatoslav Richter. And the other two whose poetry is to his level are Dinu Lipatti and Samson Francois. The early death of Kapell became a great loss for the musical world and his place in the throne that he represented is yet empty. Kapell is a true legend in the keyboard and I believe his craft will be inextinguible.
