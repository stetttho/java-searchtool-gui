 18.000 souls had the chance to presence this amazing spectacle in Los Angeles Forum on 18 September 1969 one of the most reminded musical happenings ever made. The impressive strength vocal and incredible moods of this fabulous band in the late sixties allowed them articulate lyrics ballads, easy going themes and furious rapture.  They had a very original style but the perfect vocal coupling in white rock bands. How can you forget his furious Eli's coming, or his super known One or the sweet ballad Easy to be hard? Go for this historical document and no matter if you didn't live the Rock Golden Ages!
