 This is a reference book for all those who admire this legendary filmmaker. Ingmar Bergman has sealed with golden letters his own place in the reduced Pantheon of top directors in cinema `s story.  Nourished fundamentally by August Strindberg (among others like Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer or Bchner), Bergman has written a true testimonial, a portentous document that surmounts the category of a simple biography. In Bergman, the word, images and glances impress his films of such notable conceptual density and excel incandescence, no matter the dealt subject.  Totally recommended for all kind of readers, but specially with major emphasis for all those authentic cinema `s lovers.
