 Joachim Raff has been an unfairly forgotten composer; in fact his music is seldom played in most of Concert programs.   His musical influences obey to the last Ambassadors of the Romantic movement: Berlioz, Schumann and Mendelssohn. His charming style seemed to anticipate a skillful mixture of the last Romantic echoes and the "New German School" gathered around Liszt and Wagner.   Perhaps the final step for him to be reminded, remained in transition state, because the sudden irruption of Gustav Mahler, Anton Bruckner in the musical stage, plus the radiant influence of Wagner did not allow to him to fix in the musical memory of great audiences who experimented notable changes in just one generation. With the arrival of the musical Impressionism and the emergency of the Russian school he was relegated to dilettantes and hard musical students.  Fortunately, since 1970 there has been a serious attempt for rediscover his works, filled of that spring trait and neo romantic scent, loaded of visible intimacy, elegance and brightness.   I knew about Raff because of his Piano Concerto (played by Michael Ponti) and even it has been difficult to get some of his best works, slowly I have been able to discover this talented creator of febrile imagination and fertile effusiveness.  You will experience a very rewarding surprise at the moment you decide to acquire this album.
