 The progressive transformation of this brilliant film from the multi comedy to the  echoes of  an announced tragedy occurs in a micro cosmos - a simple  pizza delivery will be the stage to deal with the controversial theme of the deep - rooted racism . Strong and well definite characters here and there will appear and slowly the events will lead to anarchy , chaos and destruction .   No way out with this brutal drama . Watch it because somehow the time will forget to Driving Miss Daisy and elevate to highest places this fundamental work .  Monumental and tense script : Ossie Davis , Danny Aiello and Ossie Davis are simply superb .  And please , do not forget the clever homage to The Night of the Hunter in the hands of an essential character : Love-Hate .
