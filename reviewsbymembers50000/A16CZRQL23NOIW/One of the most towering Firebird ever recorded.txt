 The market proposes you a lot of worthable versions , but in in my personal view , there are three really overwhelming . And this is one of them . The other two are  a superb version of Fricsay from the fifties and the another is Ansermet Suisse Romande of the fifties too  . This recording has a fierce and such span sense unique . The Minneapolis percussionists are ADMIRABLE .  Dorati made a glorious tour de force and the strings play with such level of vitality , magnetism and comittment as you will be surprised with such intensity level .
