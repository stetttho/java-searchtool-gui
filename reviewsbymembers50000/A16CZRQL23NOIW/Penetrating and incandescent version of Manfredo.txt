 Manfredo's vigorous transcendence in the Romantic landscape shocked with remarkable intensity the heart and soul of Arturo Toscanini. And in spite of the fact this work be not considered an overall Symphony, maintains however all the main ingredients to be included.   Certainly Berlioz and Tchaikovsky were possibly the most emblematic composers who dedicated a good part of their inflamed imagination to describe the penuries and autumnal delirium of this personage. We should always to take into account Toscanini was an exception witness of Verdi `s death, that is why his soul always found a honorable place for the dramatis personae and explains his devoted passion for the Operatic genre.   In this order of ideas, this mercurial incisiveness and penetrating visceral approach is pitifully totally absent in the actual directors. Something of the Romantic drama has vanished. The triviality and the modern times have overborne, minimized, overdressed and overlaid the Romantic figure; perhaps due we simply have neither time nor interest to know the hero' s myth, we are too clever and have surmounted these tearful anima states. That must be.   But if you still think the art has something to do in the world, you should acquire this radiant and breathtaking performance that simply will prove by itself Toscanini reached with this version another notable hitherto in his legendary career.               Romeo and Juliet's version is acceptable, but there is an absolute winner: the glorious performance of Charles Munch conducting the Boston Symphony, which still remains in that legendary status.   Recommended without reserves.
