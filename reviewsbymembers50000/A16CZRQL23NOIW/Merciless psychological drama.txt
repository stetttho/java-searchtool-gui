 	 A young man kidnaps an art student and decides the best to her is to stay with him. Admirable performances that eventually deserved for both  the coveted awards As Best Actress and Actor in Cannes Festival 1965 and also a Golden Globe for Samantha Eggar above the favorite Julie Chrisie with Darling, so just imagine about what acting level are talking about.   Watch carefully the front page of the DVD and think in The silence of the lambs: Casualty perhaps?  Another winner film of William Wyler.
