 This is an American movie strongly influenced by the flamboyant European taste with a bit of Woody Allen's insights. Al Pacino is a fall down advertiser inmersed equally with his fellow partner Ryan O ' Neal an old fashioned actor who lived his fifeen minutes of glory and has a serious problem due a love affair with the wrong woman in the wrong place. And somehow, this lack of adaptation for the new ages afects visibly all their emotional and affective world and so their way of life. They are partners and were reknown celebrities years ago. Nowadays, however they seem to be simply phantoms in a world that plays and bets hard and fast, but with other rules. The power's spheres handles its own codes in a diferent way, and that work in progress is supported by the complicated web of dark relations and political and even religious disagreements. Pacino intends to make a social encounter to face the differences and so the picture ellapses in real time through just one day. Drugs, corruption, war of wills, interests games, old fashioned characters and new guests to the great party of the frivole conventionalism in the great city of the world. The script promised much more, certain characters were not enough worked, Tea Leoni did not convince me a all in her role, but Pacino once more carries the film to secure Port.
