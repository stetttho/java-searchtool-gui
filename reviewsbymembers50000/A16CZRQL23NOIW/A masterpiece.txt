 What are the last consequences about a crowd who decide to lynch a man? Notice this film is made in just the middle of WW2. William Wellman made a timeless script about the no sense and the unthinkable behavior of a crowd in a small town who have decided in the name of a collective honor code to make justice by themselves. You must have noticed that in the most of the cases the human being acts due the passion instead the reason. And that's the nucleus of the film . The concept of justice can not associate just because the number by itself imposses . This a warning for all of us .  Since the collective memory is weak and their feelings are always under the reason , you may inquire the reason must prevail. But beware. The point to remark is that the passion must under the reason's service . In 1935 Fritz Lang made his first film in USA titled Fury with a closest script. A powerful and timeless film!
