 This film may be well the sublime masterpiece of this gifted director . The deep emotional impact and the introspective atmosphere of the movie allow us to watch the artist before the opression , the struggling presence of the Nazis in Poland and through the obstinate bars of the mercurial , epic and granitic Chopin Ballade No. 1 Op. 28  , Adrien Brody will built his own shield against the enemy . But in the middle of this moral misery this fact will become the weird vehicle which links two refined souls . One of them is clear , but the another is seriously disturbed , between his internal wishes and the outside demands and imposed rules. This encounter will open an invisible gate for those men who will share far beyond his beliefs and points of view a warm and effective reason to forget though for brief moments the crude surrounding reality that involves them . There is film dated from 1979 titled Roads in the night and casually directed by Krzystoff Zanussi, a polish filmmaker too in what we watch the clash culture between a Polish countess listening Chopin prelude op. 28 No. 15 best known as Teardrop and the curious impossible romance with a aristocratic nazi young officer due the obvious political obstacles . As you see both films are close related but the Pianist differs from that one in its inner epic aspect .  The heart of the craft will never be under the war miseries , seems the prevailing statement of this excellent movie a real Cannes winner and much more received in Europe than America even it suffers of certain steadiness along its development . Towering acting for Brody who won the Academy Award as best actor.
