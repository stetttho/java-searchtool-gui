 In this historical document dated from 2001, Joaquin Corts displays all his unbeatable art in this difficult genre, product of many crossed rhythms and musical influences, giving a successful hybrid that works out with sublime grace; he exhibits grace, charisma, frame of mind. And he also prepares the necessary choreography and ensemble process with his string sections, bass, female singers, percussionists, guitars, Peru an box, drums and cata (an African instrument) built a solid and extraordinarily convincing spectacle that engaged not only the successful audience that literally stowed the Royal Albert hall, but besides, all the viewers who enjoyed this outstanding spectacle. My only complaint has nothing to do with Cortes, but the terrific process of edition and filming; the camera literally forbade us to enjoy highlights moments focusing faces and dismissing Cortez heel wonders. What a pity!
