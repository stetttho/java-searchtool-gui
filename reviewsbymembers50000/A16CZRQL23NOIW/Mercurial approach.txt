 It is not easy to face and listen Bruckner. Not only because he is far to be entitled under a specific category; and this fact is determinant and talks us about his genius as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert or Wagner. They do not follow the rules, but his own muse and even create and establish his own universe. That is why it so difficult to employ minor epithets such tendencies or styles, because they have nothing to do with those labels.    The wide gamut of achieved sonorities, the wide emotional range, the wholeness present through the broadness of his musical writing leads us from the starkly austere chorale; silence and shattering fortissimo outbursts, impregnated of strong Wagnerian harmony but always inspired in the nature of the cosmos. His music is a true journey without time and frontiers, where the musical form is in constant movement and dynamic change, where epic and tragedy, contemplation and action, rapture and emotion are overlapped and interweaved, through the several orchestral voices. And such kaleidoscopic facets of anima states can disconcert for the newcomer listener. Because as the great artists establishes his own physical and spirit time, creating atmospheres.

That huge gamut of emotions is hard to put in words, because you must absolutely engaged and committed with this mythic journey.   Frtwangler 's wisdom, the presence of a first rate Orchestra and the mercurial conviction in search of this experience makes the great difference respect the other visions, that can be accepted or rejected according your particular values code          This is a historic register and an invaluable musical legacy for all those who really are disposed to carry out the journey. And I hope you are.
