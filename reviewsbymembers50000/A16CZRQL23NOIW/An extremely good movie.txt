 This film is simply greatful . But the charm lives precisely in that intelectual pleasure which some masterpieces challenges the viewer .  Two characters ; she is a school teacher and he is a simple butcher . but she establishes with him a very strange link with the butcher of that little village in Perigord .  But she has a sexual frustration and her job and the bitter memories of an previous ill fated realationship . But a serie of brutal murders will convince her about the blame of her suitor . A superb rendition to Hitchcock but developed in a very french style . And since the film flows slow paced , th new tricks and clues wil be a feast for your mind . The fertile creativity of Chabrol one of the fundamental icons of the French New Wave, allowed him to build a fascinating story loaded with obsession , mystery and suspense . Watch this film and enjoy it till the last shot .
