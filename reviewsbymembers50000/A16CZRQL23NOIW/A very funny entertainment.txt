 Gerard Depardieu once more steals the show in this admirable portrait as a weakminded character. He is sent to prison and soon he will establish a peculiar relationship with Jean Reno that will lead us to unthinkable and laughable situations with great doses of black humor. Go for this film. It will reward you always.
