 The exuberant pianism of Arturo  Benedetti Michelangeli resides in his kaleidoscopic expressiveness. He owned a superb sense of tonal color, appropriate texture, accurate warmth, precise expansiveness and exquisite phrasing. His whole approach every time he played a piece,  was very similar to an architectural process. Like Furtwangler, he re-created a work, in search of its inner values. This historic performance is an additional testimony that carves in relief his artistic integrity. The Schumann's Carnival is played without self indulgent affection, he impressed the romanticism a major sign, a real statement of the greatness of the human condition and glorious sense of transcendence. Go for this invaluable musical treasure without reserves.
