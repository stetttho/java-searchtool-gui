    To play with such perfection level these admirable sonatas you must be provided not only with a wonderful and outstanding musicality , commitment and complete domain of the Beethoven idiom bot besides establish a special rapport with your partner . All these requirements are in this CD . Claudio Arrau does not need presentation . But you have to recognize the Fifties was the most glorious decade for him . He did not only record one of the most notable Schumann Piano Concerto performances under Victor De Sabata and the New York Philharmonic, but besides he was in an effervescent state, creativity and histamine and the presence of this giant violinist (The greatest of the Century to my mind) Joseph Szigetti produced a happy blending of charm , elegance , virility, strength , fineness . I have the readings of Kempff -Menuhin , Francescati-Casadesus and  and Heifetz -Bay but this set is the winner, by far . I do not know about other set capable to beat this .
