  Piazzolla was simply superb in this spelling performance. Even this album presents works of major experimental profile, such Contrabajsimo and Reality, the known pieces as Mumuki, and Camorra are filled with such intensity level and rapture that it will reward you by far.   Coming to his classic works as Tanguedia III, La milonga del ngel and Adios Nonino, the result is much more than impressive. It 's colossal. The cosmic inspiration flows without any effort. The whole concert is much more dramatic and less lyrical than the Vienna Concert, that reveals that the real artist nature.  The changing temperament is a clear evidence of the constant transformation understood as innovation, in last instance.  When you listen Operacin tango, you will be immediately carried to another universe, of zero atmosphere introspective and profoundly meditative. Angel Ridolfi in the contrabass and Gerardo Bandini make a real tour de force performance.      For those people who still disagree with the tango new airs given by Piazzolla accusing of falsifying the authentic essence of this genre, let me remind them a crude but valiant statement pronounced by Gustav Mahler: "Traditionalism is negligence."   Astor Piazzolla died on July 5 1992, but I guess his music's charm and innovative moods will be captivating new people generations in every corner of the world, and with all certainty will be listened far beyond the fifth millennium, because the genius is always contemporary.
