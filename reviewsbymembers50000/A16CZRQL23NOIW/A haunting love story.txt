 Frank Borzage filmed this notable adaptation of the Hemingway ' s novel . The script is very simply and tells us about the love affair in the middle of the war hell .  The echoes of this story still sound in the recent movie The English Patient .  Borzag shapes the story perhaps with excessive romantic mood , as emotional vehicle for a wide audience who knew the sound in the cinema just four years ago . Nevertheless the performances are so convincing that you miss this detail. Warmth and poignant .
