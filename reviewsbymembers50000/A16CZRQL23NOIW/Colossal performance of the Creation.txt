 Charles Munch' s elegant baton and expressive eloquence and the golden sound of The Boston Symphony made it possible this artistic register. Milhaud' s Creation du Monde had never received such Dionysian treatment. The first rate order strings section and the admirable winds and metals section make a tour de force performance, with a solid vision, stylized refinement and idiomatic flexibility.   I have listened this work conducted by Tilson Thomas and Simon Rattle; both records are technically unbeatable but lack of savoir vivre. And that failure is by itself decisive because this approach permits in last instance, the work breaths.  Listen and compare by yourself.
