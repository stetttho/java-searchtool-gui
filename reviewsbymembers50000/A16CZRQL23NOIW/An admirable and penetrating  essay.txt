 The number of golden books written with such panache, distinction and touch of inimitable genius is not so abundant like it seems. De Qincey makes an admirable dissection, plenty of fine irony, elegant eloquence, intelligent humor and seductive charm around the crime, going far beyond the superficial causes and making a fabulous and delirious journey through the ethic, moral and customs with zealous intellectual rigor blended with that peculiar touch we use to perceive in Bernard Shaw, Thomas Carlyle or Oscar Wilde.   This is an impeccable exercise of erudition around this mysterious but always present enigmatic feature of the human soul,  that transcends frontiers, socio cultural barriers or ancestral beliefs of any nature.  Absolutely recommended, without reserves.
