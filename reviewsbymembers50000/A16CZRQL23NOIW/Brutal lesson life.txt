 This is a very dark film . Kevin Reynolds illuminating allows him to describe somberly the hard and bitter conflicts with the students in a High school, but this picture has nothing in common with To sir with love . This is much more than a simple fairy tale . Carefully made script and a brilliant performance given for Samuel Jackson
