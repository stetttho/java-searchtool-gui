 The thief is a modern film noir. James Caan gives his most powerful performance to date. Cool, analytical with a hard debt that it must be paid. There is a film that I still remind very close related, titled Point Blank and directed by John Boorman. The starring in that film was the hard Lee Marvin. I have the inner conviction that Thief was inspired by that one. Please acquire both of two. I have them in my personal collection.  This is the opera prima of Michael Mann as director. Well effort and amazing script.  One of the top ten cult movies from the eighties. A must in your collection!.
