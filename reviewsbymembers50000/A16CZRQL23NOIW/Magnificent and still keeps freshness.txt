 This film was a challenging issue in its age . Nevertheless the racial prejuices and the involved circunstances around the ethical crossroads that surrounds the film are still present , fifty years ago.

Both of two are credible in this drama who join these two man initially divided for different conflicts but , (once more the mythical journey) convinces to each other one of them that they must to act as just one man if they want to survive , because they have a common enemy . You know that Stanley Kramer was always a director that loved to make incisive and bitter films .  In this case he made a masterpiece around a simple story that it could happen again in any other region of the globe .  The remarkable point is this moral question somehow permeated the filmography of famous directors in the future , as Norman Jewison (In the heat of the night) , Mississippi burning (Alan Parker) or The green mile (Durabont) , to name three films of different decades .
