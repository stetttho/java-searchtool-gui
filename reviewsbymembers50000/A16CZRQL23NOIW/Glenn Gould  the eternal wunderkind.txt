 Gould give us what we should call his battlehorse: The Goldberg variations. I have got four versions (the two of this set) one from Canada 1952 and another one from Salzburg 1959.   Each one of them has his own profile, but surely no one of these can be beyond the version of 1981. It sounds wise, cosmical and in a certain way, Gould seems to give us a kind of musical testament.  You can say that Mr. Gould was a singular case in the music but his approach to Bach was unique. Forever and ever Gould will be  the foremost pianist born in Canada and a genius of the keyboard.  These Goldberg performance owns wisdom besides musicality. It's obviously an autumn farewell!
