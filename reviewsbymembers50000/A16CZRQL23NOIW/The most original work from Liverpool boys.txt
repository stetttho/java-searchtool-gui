 When you make a retrospective gaze about the creative power of The Beatles , and you should have to show an evidence , surely this would be the most relevant proof.  And let's start with the cover of this: the clear influence of the pop art , the invisible presence of Andy Warhol permeated this innovative presentation . And it became in a must reference for new publicitary spots , too . This cover gathered some of the most relevant personalities , Churchill , Charlot and Poe (among others) around a grave . I really don'tknow about any cover album more original than this in any age.   Think for instance in With a little help from my friends , a very advanced song inits age . Combination of voices and a rhytm exremely simple but filled with a powerful melody and message .  Lucy in the sky breaks the rules . The melodic lines of the guitar opened a new frontier .   But I'd love to turn you on literally surpased all the expected . This is a bitter crude and introspective loaded with nosthalgic mood : "He didn't notice the lights had changed".  The weird proposal was amazing , think it about the fact of being set in the last track is not a mere coincidence .   The Beatles were in the peak of his cretaivie powers and this album (in my personal opinion) established a real breakthrough respect to any previous work .
