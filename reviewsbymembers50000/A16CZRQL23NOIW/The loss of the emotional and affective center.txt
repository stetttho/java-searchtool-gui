 A piano teacher superbly performed by Isabelle Huppert (one of my top favorite actress in the world), exhibits the ancient myth of Eros and Psiquis, and emerges with powerful force and dark poetry in this frustrated human being who, hidden on her art helmet, seems to watch how her best lifetime passed without any expectative. The cotidianity establishes in her life an unbearable repetition of a long catalogue of common places. Indeed, the obvious conclusion you perceive after she punishes that promising and talented pupil through the most miserable envy feeling and impotence. In her soul depths she knows her pupil will overpass her in a future not so distant. But suddenly the passion appears and with it the Pandora Box will open with her cumulative sum of expected affection, sexual repressions and the wished love that came behind the masque of the oblivion. She will play hard this role of victim and victimary. In her role of teacher the last profile is well known but she knows the time is brief and somehow as the famous Proust novel she intends to search desperately the missed time. To be honest the camera is not to the same level than the performers. Huppert is overwhelming but the camera eye doesn't maintain the same level of required fierceness and mistakenly you can feel it. If you intend to change visual agression with the deepest insights of that troubled soul avid of love and consideration, we have big problem.    Think in Nagisa Oshima with the Empire Senses and you will realize that important device. The way you use your filmic language is even much more important perhaps tahn the same script if you want to accent certain issues to achieve your purpose. Otherwise you will obtain a serious artistic deficit when you analyze the final result.
