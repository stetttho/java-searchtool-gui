 Marcel Carne made Le quai de brumes in 1939. And you know what I mean with it. In fact the film turns around a dock and an expected voyage ; the last detail for get the happiness between two lovers, but the long arm of the fate will avoid the deserved happy ending. Carne and Prevert made a succesful couple and even a weird agreement in the whole structure of several films.  And this poetic gaze will originate works of undeniable beauty as this one. Its fundamental for you , if youre really interested as me about the Carne films watch the first of greatful movies abou this film maker, because youll find out in this one some vital clues that will feed the following works. Jean Cocteau was emerging also but with a clear difference , the approach of this poet is filled by the mythological rapture translated to the modern times.  Back to Carne , I have in my personal collections the most remarkable films of Carne. If you watch Le jour se leve , by instance , isolatedly from the whole poetic context , you may easily to make a mistake about the meaning of this. All the great authors and artists develop a solid structure thta grows progressively with his grow up process. Beethoven,  Michelangelo , Shakespeare or William Blake are consistent examples who define the significance of this issue. Obviously , Carne is an universe in himself . Youll watch Paris as a background who will permeate your soul , due the evident contrast between the beauty locations of this city light and the clouds of fate that surround the characters , the love is expressed to such high poetic levels , that the world who wants avoid the deserved triumph is an unconscious part of the dark fate. Marcel Carne will show you why the cinema is art.
