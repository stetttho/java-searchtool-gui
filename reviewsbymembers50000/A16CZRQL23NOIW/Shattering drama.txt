 After years of self imposed exile a classic pianist decides to return to the oil fields with his family. It is not a mere coincidence to have chosen that special Chopin Etude to reveal the profound feeling of disillusionment and disappointment that surrounds him.  It can be sound a bit exaggerate perhaps , but I have not seen better to Nicholson in any other film previous or next . His violent changes of humour , and bitterness still are a must for all his hard fans and cinema lovers but also for young actors .  Bob Rafelson made to me his brilliant masterpiece with this one . The chicken salad dinner is still a reference standard . What this film keeps for you is the loss of the bliss against the rules of the game of the life . This movie has a very strong influence of the best European Cinema and that' s why it can explain how the great audience frequently do no remember with major intensity .  The final sequence seemed to reveal the triumph of the will in the middle of the quotidian loneliness that becomes in an usual way of life with the petrified forest in the middle of a gas station , crude metaphor that signified his wrong initial decision .
