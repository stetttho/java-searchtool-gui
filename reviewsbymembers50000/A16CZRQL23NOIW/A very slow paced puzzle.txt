 David Cronenberg - at last - has made his masterpiece . He has made an overwhelming and carefully designed work in which every frame has been thought with any hole all along the story . The miserable and painful introspectivity of that misterious man will be revealed with shots who reminds to Bergman style (Wild strawberries , The hour of the wolf and Fanny and Alexander) and some reflects of the best German expressionism making a colossal color employement, a delicate art direction and the use of the narrative elipsis to show the living memories linking past and present age .  Our disturbed man will show his terrible childhood incident , and told with supreme maestry and artistic honesty . Fiennes as always gives a towering performance, Miranda Richardson is superb too and a special recognizement to Gabriel Byrne as the merciless and unscrupulous father . A winner in Cannes and a new classic film .
