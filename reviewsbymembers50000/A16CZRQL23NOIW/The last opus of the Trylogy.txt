  This is a hard film which plays with your inner feelings without a drop of merciless. Two sisters stop in a hotel and will exchange her different opinions and points of view. One of them is frustrated lesbian without anything to give and furthermore nothing to share. The other one is the free loving mother of a 10 years old child. In this claustrophobic stage and micro cosmos Bergman will interweave a painful and harsh portrait in a hallucinating and valiant drama where the loneliness, the hopeless, the God's silence and the lack of affection will be the main springs of terrible revelations and mutual accusations.   A must for Bergman's fans and despite the elapsed time it keeps its semblance and actuality.
