 This beloved film with Greece as the supreme landscape presents one of my ever lasting beloved actresses : Liv Ullman with the charm of Gene Kelly making all he can for this relationship materializes.  Ullman showed to have a huge talent for the comedy after a brief interval in a set of brilliant Bergmanian films.  An unforgettable little gem of Irving Kershner.
