 This modern parody is a legitimate grandson of Inspector Clousseau. The film in itself is clear vehicle to homage that classic British film of 1950:Kind hearts and cornets .  A far descendent of French impresario Pascual Savage from the Real Dynasty -the unbeatable John Malkovich- empowers the Jewels of the Crown due he considers the time has come for him to rule the nation to his own style.  There are admirable memories of the previous and famous work of 007  Goldfinger . But also it's a brilliant and surreptitious wink to Henry V.  Our clumsy hero and distorted image of 007 -Johnny English-will be the designed special agent who will stop those machiavellian plans.   Through a set of unimaginable pirouettes you will delight this funny satire. The sequence in the Coronation is overwhelming and intelligent buuelian nature.  And in the last sequence you will beware that sometimes the most refined technology may become the greatest enemy of the love.  Nobody does it better!
