 And as well as the charity neither you nor the another one are fullfilled .   Bob Hoskins gave the tour de force performance of his astonishing career with this portrait .   He plays the role of honest and self convinced being human who honestly believes his underground world can be improved . Due this idyllic behaviour he will sent to prison but he forms to Michael Caine as a future Gangster and will intend for all the possible ways to persuade a honourable prostitute to change her profession , but obviously it will be in vane .  This intelligent film somehow revealed the portentous talent of this brilliant and exceptionally gifted film maker Neil Jourdan who would astonish the world with My left foot just two years after .  This work carefully analysed is a very smart twisted gaze of the Mob so well featured in the thirties , forties and fifties for James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart .  It is good to remember the irony is a landmark feature of the English and Irish lands .it is not a mere casualty William Shakespeare , Bernard Shaw , Oscar Wilde, Jonathan Swift , Chesterton and George Orwell have been born in those latitudes    Cathy Tisson as the pros is superb . And Michael Caine performance augured him a great year  due that same year he earned the Academy Award with Hannah and her sisters .  One of the ten best British films in that decade !
