 In many ways, this search for the immaculate perfection diminished perhaps the required proportion of temperament, vitality and human touch that many composers demand at the moment to play his works.   In the case of Bach this tendency is far to be felt, because this way of supremacy is one of the requisites to remark the cosmic approach in his works. In this sense Heifetz's approach has supported many visions. At the present there are three visible examples: Itzak Perlman, Schlomo Mintz and Salvatore Accardo; in the past Ruggiero Ricci, Nathan Milstein, Leonid Kogan and Michael Rabin. In the opposite side of the street there was a major emphasis in the significance of the expression and temperament; in the past Joseph Szigetti, Ginette Neveu, Isaac Stern, Artur Grumiaux, David Oistrakh, Aaron Rosand and Henryk Szerying; actually Gidon Kremer, Maxim Vengerov and Pinchas Zukerman.  In this recording there is not any single hole. The whole commitment and the impressive harmonizing of technique and warmth were successfully together.    If I had to pronounce myself for the best artistic achievement of Heifetz, this album would deserve such enviable distinction.        And remember the famous Bernard Shaw `s statement : "If you provoke a jealous God by playing with such superhuman perfection, you will die young. I earnestly advise you to play badly every night before going to bed, instead of saying your prayers."
