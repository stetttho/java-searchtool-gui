 After his devastating and demolishing M.A.S.H., Altman returns with a very smart picture. You should not forget how Altman was totally involved with certain premises considered untouchables; he made a splendid film titled McCabe and Mrs. Miller in 1973 and eventually he would round off his fabulous "Three women" in 1977, considered as his most Bergmanian work.      The magisterial use of the Country music is just an attractive facade to explore and carve in relief a lot of basic profiles of the American people. There is so much to see and analyze underneath.  A solid film that has became in a loved cult film since its immediate release.
