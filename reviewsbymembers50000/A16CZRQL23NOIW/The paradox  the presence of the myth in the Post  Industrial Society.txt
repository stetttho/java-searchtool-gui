 The zealous analysis of the human behavior, the hidden clues conferred by the unconscious philosophy inserted in the myths, the absolute domain of the evolution of the paradigms, the constant and growing application in almost every one of our tangible and intangible systems and procedures around the knowledge 's universe, plus the prodigious imagination of Charles Handy has produced this admirable intelligent and audacious text that breaks the barriers of the conventional thinking around the well know managements issues.   All the organizations are supported unconsciously by ancient and similar facts immersed in the history. Handy has rethought, confirmed and carved in relief a magnificent example of what intelligence means: to reorder and focus from different angles the essential principles that underlie beneath the complexity and the increasing competitiveness of the modern world.    In this order of ideas, Handy plans and puts on the table of the leonine executive 's mind new proposals, demolishing certain behavior patterns that remain such authentic mental barriers. The paradoxes as well as the myths don' t pretend erect as perpetual life' s lessons, because this attitude would reveal precisely he rationalization of the mythical fact. Handy opposes the reality against the illusion of the reality and unmasks certain learned and absorbed models that we ten to assume as unerring. The paradoxes ' intention, in last instance is unbalance to rebalance, but you as manager is the only who can do it  if you process the information and redistributes the iron laws in search of your role.   Innovation is simply an intelligent transformation, and this book bets for that device.
