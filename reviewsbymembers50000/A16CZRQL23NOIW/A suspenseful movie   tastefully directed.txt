 Tim Roth is great in this suspenseful and interesting drama about an expensive wrong medical report and its unimaginable consequences . Beware in the human response .  The amazing puzzle will involve to Gabriel Byrne playing the role of  death link emissary. Interesting plot but the resolution final is adolescent .  It lacked of expressive punch and terrifying atmosphere in the climax . Nevertheless this neo noir film reminds us to the best works of Patricia Highsmith , and this statement by itself is a real triumph.
