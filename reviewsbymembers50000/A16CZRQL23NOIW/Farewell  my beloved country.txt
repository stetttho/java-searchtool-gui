If you pay careful attention to his comparatively few achievements with the Chicago Orchestra by well known reasons, he established an open gate for Fritz Reiner who finally applied his undeniable gifts to become Chicago Orchestra a refulgent ensemble.  At the end of his life Kubelik was truly inspired by the call of his birthplace. And with the Fall of the ignominious Wall in Berlin Nov. 9 1989 and the final collapse of U.R.S.S. he felt the imperious necessity to look inside his native country, and so to undertake for the posterity this premonitory Concert loaded of renovated hopes, as well as a song to the freedom.  So, when he hoisted this musical flag, the second hymn of Czechoslovakia "My Country" with the emblematic and luxuriant sound of the Vienna  Philharmonic Orchestra, he was signing if you want his particular Farwell. Far from being a self indulgent or tearful attitude, he assumed worthily the rank of special guest in name of all of those who died and could not see the final retirement of the oppressive and struggling bear ` s embrace.            You will be able to feel the visible expressive lyric flight, the voluptuous energy and the enraptured commitment of all the members of the Orchestra was not casual. So, given the particular circumstance in which this live Concert was recorded and keeping the meaning of what was going on at this historical moment, this is a collector item, that securely will increase its special brightness through the years.     Go for this record.
