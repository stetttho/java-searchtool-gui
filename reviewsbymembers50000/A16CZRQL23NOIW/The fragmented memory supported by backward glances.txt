 The memory is selectively greedy. The overall amount of the selected repertoire depends of you and your personal bliss.     This powerful and challenging Noir has to do with a simple question: what about you or me if suddenly the lights of the memory simply turn off? What if your capacity to remember is no longer than five minutes?   The dramatic and awful premise: a horrid murder and a serious cerebral damage will make your name still persists but your entire life since that moment will be a total mess, a complicated puzzle of photographs, annotations, addresses, footnotes, faces, false names are the lost fragments product of a bloody explosion, that has caused a true virulent disorder of the vital synapses, reduced to occasional flashes.  A man without memory will become a desperate man; he needs to belong a country, be part of a community, for love and be loved and so nourish his imagination,  to expand his intelligence and so                 to learn and grow up. On the other hand a man with just a memory becomes a modern Faust. Between these two extremes, this anguished man will desperately seek the origin of his emotional wounds to restore a minimum of necessary equilibrium.  This striking film - supported by a breathtaking script - integrates an astonishing and fundamental Quartet of golden movies: Twelve monkeys, Dark city and Mulholland drive.
