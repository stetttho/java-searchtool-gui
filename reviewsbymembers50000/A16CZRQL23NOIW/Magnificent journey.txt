 Despite the years of drinking sealed the ancient boyish face of Errol Flynn, this character fits to the measure to this particular actor. This film won the Academy Award as Best Costume Design, but it constitutes a very good example of the entetaining moods in the last forties. Admirable cast and the double sense jokes make of this picture a particular and unforgettable issue. Highly recommended.
