 There are lives who would seem destined to burn in themselves to reach the sincere expression the hard rapport to express and moreover to feel the song and make of their special repertoire his inspiration source . Halliday , Edith Piaf , Maria Callas ; three different styles but a common cause the loneliness , the unability to be really loved besides her mythical sphere . In the case of Piaf the pain was so close to her that I really think Piaf adopted as his partner and she faced that awful truth . After the Marcel Chardin death you feel this twist of fate and the sense of the emptiness in every one of her themes .  La foule , Hymn a l'amour or amants d 'un jour for instance are the best proof of this sadness who seems to fly far beyond the melody and become in a permament leit motive . Edith Piaf will be always have a very special place in the soul of all those who love without being loved , who have loved , those who still love and specially for those who consider that they just can not love anymore.
