 Jonathan Demme made an intriguing movie around a women prison where he focused all his attention about the complex world of the human behavior , and its most intimate concerns .  That prison is a devastating metaphor of the real world : a microcosmos itself which reflect all the miseries , ambitions and distorted angles of the reality and its fellow perversions . You notice the close relation between this work and other emblematic film of the sixties such Shock corridor was . The deep image of the world in those convulsive years where the anarchy , the uncertainness and the hopeless as always have accompanied the people in decisive historical turning points . The state of insanity in many prisons all around the world has been subject of study and complex analysis . Since the exterted power on the prisioners have shown also the satiety the perversity which accompain too the Status Q and who , thanks the special profile they represent their unknown physical or mind facts exerted on the people are very often covered with the ancient pretexts such as *in the name of the science*  and other exquisite language modalities . This film was filmed one year before One flew over the cuckoo's nest and somehow is engaged with a new world which emerged with new challenges and discoveries which literally shocked the world in that age . In this sense the jump to freedom must be seen as expression of liberation and catharsis in the purest sense of the term. The best proof this issue is far from being resolved is the fact the german emblematic film The experiment (see my review) which deals about related concerns , won the prize as best European film in 2001 . Watch this film of a young (in that ages) but promising director Jonathan Demme , who proved with The silent of the lambs and Filadelfia what are the subjects that integrate his fundamental concerns .
