 Badura Skoda conducting and playing from the piano, accompanied by the Prague Chamber Orchestra Prague performs a sublimely polished and crystalline version of this radiant Piano Concerto No. 23. Elegance, lyricism and blithering spirits make of this version one of the most refined and distinguished ones still available in the market.    The spectacular and charming Piano Concerto No. 25 finds in Badura a bravura player. Sinewy expressiveness and portentous interpretative inspiration make of this album a true must buy.  Totally recommended.
