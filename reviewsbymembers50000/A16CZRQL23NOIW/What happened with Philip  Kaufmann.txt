 Philip Kaufmann has been one of the most famous and original directors in the last two decades . If we watch his previous you will have to recognize the Genius touch in three remarkable films such as The convincing remake of The invassion of the body snatchers , The wanderers ( a cult movie ) and  Henry and June . Since the cast was a secure passport (Ashely Judd, Samuel Jackson and Andy Garcia) , I took the flight thinking in a defiant film . But what a mess!  The film doesn't hold by itself even ten minutes . It seems you are watching a set of vignettes , completely out of continuity , originality and logical sequences . The film promises just in the first ten minutes . You remind a superb film (Internal affairs from Mike Figgs) but soon you will be engaged in a unending script that does not reach the coast . The film drowns in the middle of nowhere . Even Jackson feels uncomfortable with this role . You can watch , and Andy Garcia is (lost in translation) . Nobody wins with such script , predictable and confusing . This film may be the worst work of Kaufmann , Jackson , Judd and Garcia in all their respective careers
