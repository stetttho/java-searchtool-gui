 The sense of inscrutable and unexplainable foreboding surrounds and permeates this beauty and slow paced film. The Irish villages in the 1950s are the immense frame in which the story will elapse. A freethinking mother, astonishing played by Robin Wright (to my mind her best role to date) will be rescued by Aidan Quinn.  The sensation of bewilderment displayed by Albert Finney is other highlight of the movie.
