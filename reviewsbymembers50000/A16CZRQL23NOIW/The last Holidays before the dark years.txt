 Two veterans Navy men are assigned to escort a very young sailor who committed a terrible mistake: to try to make of his own Forty bucks. Both of them have pity for this marked boy and decide to have a good fun before the final act.  This a smart road movie that will allow us to know why Hal Ashby and Robert Altman were the most irreverent filmmakers at those Ages, showing us some dramatic angles of the life.  Memorable performances of Nicholson and Randy Quaid.
