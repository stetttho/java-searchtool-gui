 The elegant style of Weber Piano Concertos reminds me too much to  Hummel , Pixis , Thalberg and Moscheles . They are chiefly written in a gallant style , gracefully combined with delicacy , that was the immediate legacy left for the French Revolution , refinement without deepness , the tearful spectacle to induce you to the great music. After you listen these pages you can easy understand why Beethoven decided to write string quartets , because Rossini and the show business were empowering the Great Concert Halls . Robert Wolkmann Piano Concerto however owns a certain dignity , you feel the composer has something to say and Jerome Rose does the best he can . Franz Berwald the Swedish composer had a personal style a little affected but with a great sense of musical architecture . The CD is worthy in the following items . Alkan Concerto de Camera is a very interesting work , the somber style of the composer helps to Mr Ponti for reaching the goal . And last we come to a great discovery : The almost unknown introduction and allegro of Robert Schumann in the hands of Mr Ponti , is by far more elaborated than Richter cold version or Ashkenazy cerebral approach ; this is a real epitome of the romantic style in the middle of the XIX century , but when you listen Ode to Spring of Joachim Raff you must beware the enormous neglect the people and mostly of the pianists have had with this work . Freshness , innocence and a deep savoir vivre style in the best tradition of the evasive pages in a century where the nationalism was possibly the most employed word. And finally with the Totentanz of Franz List you just only find in the market one recording evidently superior : Byron Janis in the late fifties , however this is a real effort made for Michael Ponti and considering this may be well the second best recording of this hard to find work , you should sum and the result is positive for you .  This low prize CD will reward you .
