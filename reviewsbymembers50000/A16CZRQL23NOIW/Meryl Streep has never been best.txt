 You may consider from now to Meryl Streep as one of the twenty best actress of the XX century . Her magnetism is so powerful in every performance she makes than it is impossible to ignore her.  Nevertheless her last performances in screen have been extremely geometric meticulous cold and apollinean without that expresivity we can watch in this film . She was in the peak of her powers . And in fact she supports the film like at least in a 95% . The script was brilliant writen in the best european style . Resource economy , but with fine dialogues and excellent edition and superb photography . Kevin Kline made the best acting of all his career in the role of this disturbed man . The film is told in off for Sophie herself . Her hell stage in the concentration camp . Thanks to her domain of the german language she could survive . But after the horror has gone , she can not avoid to remake her emotional life . In this sense the dramatic parallel runs equal with the pawnbroker , since the memory and its multiple awful images simply can not be erased , even the happiness had been to few steps from her . The film was carefully filmed with masterful direction . Superb and consider this work and Schindler list as the supremes american films focusing this painful theme!
