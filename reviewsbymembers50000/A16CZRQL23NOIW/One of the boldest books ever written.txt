 Traveling toward England, Erasmus conceived the idea a little book that would become a referential text for the readers of the future. Dedicated to Thomas Moro making a curious twist of words between the name Moro and the Greek term "Moria" that designs the madness. This was a game in which he has thinking, but eventually will turn in a dangerous game. The text is apparently written by the madness itself and it says that it is the most powerful force which impulses the human life, and that all what it happens between men would be sadder, more mournful if not by its presence. This sort of allegation of the madness has a dark and corrosive emendatory, that precisely is what explicitly Erasmus is affirming. "All of you, men that populates Europe, loaded of destiny, are somehow madmen, foolish, people who ignore what you do or even go, and worst still, even don? t know the weight of your responsibilities." But wisely, he does not say in the serious tune of a preacher man, but in a mockery  tune of this light satire that allows that such important isues be said and eventually contribute to shock the European conscious in a moment that was mature for that shaking, without great risk for the man who said it.  It is absolutely fundamental for any illustrated person its reading. This is one the most transcendental texts of the Western civilization,  In this sense this is a smart essay that will help us to understand evenc ?poser yjis egregious mind.
