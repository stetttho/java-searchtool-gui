 Superb and terrific film about the desperation , the disaffection and bitter loneliness of a disturbed woman with deep inner demons who wished to be loved for a man who never came to her life . Tennesse Williams masterpiece was supported for a very fine cast where everybody were abosultely outstanding . Kim Hunter as the wife , Vivien Leigh as the disturbed woman and Marlon Brando as the macho man in a lonely home with the hopeless and disillusion crossing the emotional borders of their miserable souls . Every one of them hiddes something and nobody is really sure about nothing ; the future is just a sum of equal days where the time does not seem change anything . The bitter metaphor is more than obvious . Brave and incisive film filmed with a resource economy but a powerful message to state . One of the superb masterpieces of the american cinema in that glorious and creative decade . Stella ! is the last scream .
