 Frida Boccara made the great jump to the fame with this outstanding Un jour un enfant in Eurovision Festival in those far seventies . Her voice was so clear, crystaline , and filled of expression that it was very hard for you to forget her . All this album is worthable . To listen this female singer is a spectacle reserved for Gods and connoiseurs .  Supreme and unique .  Au revoir Frida , wherever you are !
