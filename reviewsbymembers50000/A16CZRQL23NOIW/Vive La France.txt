 Among the most remarkable and many times forgotten masters of the Orchestral direction, Paul Paray must be named with imperative character. What he achieved with the Detroit Symphony was incredible. He elevated the status and conferred it of personality and style. Charm, elegance, musculature, precision and incisiveness would be one of the most accented features that nourished this renowned ensemble along the Fifties. His sound is expansive and sumptuous, ambition and noblesse expressed with absolute conviction and vision. You just only to listen his Bizet and Chabrier for instance to realize what I mean. His fresh and undeniable charm with showy orchestral colors.       Paul Paray `s splendor and distinguished touch of class are exposed convincing and brilliant and the eloquent grandness shown along every one of  these superb and inspired Marches. Gounod 's Funeral March of a Marionette was employed by Hitchcock as his musical curtain in TV series. Coronation March is a very felt and emotive piece. To talk about the admirable emotiveness and mercurial result of La Marseillaise is useless, unless you listen it with your attention. His Offenbach is simply sublime, listen for instance the impressive final code of La belle Helene, the majestic and inspired touch of refined elegance in Orpheus in the Underworld, played with such conviction level that gets to mesmerize even the most indifferent listener, bringing back the alluring atmosphere of the Parisian Belle poque and the ravishing presence of Loutrec. And we finally arrive to one of the best known Overtures of the repertoire: William Tell. There are just four unsurpassed versions in the history: Arturo Toscanini and NBC, Fritz Reiner and Chicago, Carlo Maria Giulini and this one.  So please, don' t miss this legendary CD, that not only is obligated reference every July 14th  , but also every time you feel enraptured and bewitched by the French mood.   Absolutely recommended.
