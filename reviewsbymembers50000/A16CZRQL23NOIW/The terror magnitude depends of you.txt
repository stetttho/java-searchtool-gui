 The First Opus of an unknown Polish filmmaker, named Roman Polanski would seem to overset on the psychological folds and inner fears of his oppressed and beloved country.   A teenager requests a hitchhike and is attended by a young couple. This is basically the dramatic premise; the viewers and the couple do not know anything about this sinister and disturbing character. And the legitimate strength of this clever film resides precisely in the next step to follow, and this unpredictability will generate in the audience an authentic cornucopia of diverse anguishes or fears.  Filmed with visible economy resources, the egregious gifts of Polanski blossom from the initial frames, nourished and supported by admirable traveling, angle shots  and mesmerizing close ups.  The movie possesses a discrete charm, visibly influenced by the raising French New Wave (Breathless) though its profound expressive burden derivates from the theatrical environment.  A must-see of undeniable historical importance.
