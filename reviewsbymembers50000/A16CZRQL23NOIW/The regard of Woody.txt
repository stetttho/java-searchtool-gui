 After you watch this film, you must agree the distance between the implicit messagge into the Greek chorus and our normal quotidianity is not so far as you may think. The existential dilema persists and so many non reolved issues, the protagonists may change but not the central focus. Allen got a magnificent blend between comedy and tragedy around Aphrodite Love 's Goddess and her paradigm in the unconsious collective through a set of lovable vignettes. Mira Sorvino is terrific in this role than deserved her Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress. One the most fertile scripts of this brilliant filmmaker.
