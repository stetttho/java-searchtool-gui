 This is a legendary recital in which we find the egregious combined talent of two first rate musicians giving the best of them.  The portentous creativity of Corea,  his impressive phrasing and the formidable Burton `s musicianship, are carved in relief all along this Concert.  Their enraptured homage in Bud Powell `s memory, the magnetic charm of Senor Mouse, the introspective work Crystal silence, the engaging mood of Tweak, the magnetic Falling grace, the suggestive Mirror, mirror, the lyrical Song to Gayle and the spelling Flamenco airs of Endless trouble, endless pleasure make of this album a fundamental and future piece of your personal collection.
