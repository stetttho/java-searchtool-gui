 Stanton Carlisle is a prisoner of his own cunning ambition. He has survived like an astute lion in the naked city. And finds the right moment when obtains the secrets of a fake mind reader. He is provided by an undeniable charm and sexual magnetism who allows to manipulate Zeena and then , forced by the circumstances will wed with Molly, (one of the most beautiful actresses at this moment), and will extend his ambition when meets Dr. Lilith an icy intelligent woman to extort a wealthy family who suffered a painful experience with their sixteen years old daughter, Carol.  But then Stanton commits two terrible mistakes; the first one: to trust in Lilith , a superior mind who surpasses him many miles way; the gelid and authentic embodiment of the evilness; the second one is to play to be God, I mean he has violated a limit due the thirsty ambition of power and money and in the dramatic apex of the film, he unmasks the real nasty nature of Carol' s father around his dark past with Dory. And the fabulous touch of geniality resides precisely when all is discovered, and the tricked man, suddenly becomes the good and honorable guy. An outstanding exercise of genuine smartness that to my mind elevates the rank of the film to major dimensions.         Since that moment the fate will pursuit him to become him a living wreck, and returning to his original job, accepting to earn his life as "geek", a freak-show attraction who eats live chickens; an admirable metaphor and an eloquent punishment for an ever looser who considered once to be in the top of the world.   Tyrone Power made possibly the bleakest and pyramidal role of his lifetime. Be aware for instance at the moment he turns his eyes from Carol 's father to the ghostly appearance or the supreme sequence when he inquires and is inquired by his wife when discuss the final trickery; he says to her: "This is the other side of the show business"; and you think it over: Is the vanity under the service of the illusion, or vice versa ? .  The script is not only harrowing, but quite interesting under any angle you watch it. It explores the unknown universe of the circus and the lower depths of the show business. Since its immediate release it was considered a cult movie. One of my top favorites of the Noir genre.  Adapted by Jules Furthman from the novel by William Lindsay Gresham, the film was released on October 9, 1947 .
