 The French Revolution has won . Long live to the liberty and  the guillotine ! Very soon the terror will invade France and the fight for freedom , fraternity and equality will return .  Despite the fact the French Revolution became the serpent's egg of Napoleon Bonaparte and you will never be able to get the freedom with pulled down the equality or preserve the equality without flattening the freedom ,the Revolution becomes in a real blood bath , of personal revenges and above all in a power chess in which the defeat will signify the death in the guillotine .  Andrezj Wajda shows us in this picture why he is one of the top directors in the whole world. The intelligent similarities suggested  by Wajda with the real events which happened in Poland are more than a simple coincidence .   Top notch performances of Depardieu as Danton and Wojiech Pszoniak  as Robespierre . Watch Patrice Chereau as Saint Just .
