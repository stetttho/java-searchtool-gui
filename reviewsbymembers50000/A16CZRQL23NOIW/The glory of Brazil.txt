 Guiomar Novaes was a notable pianist . Her style was characterized for a sense of the tonal color as few pianist have been able to have it .     This recording is fundamental for you , because the Grieg Concert is played with majesty and avoiding the inherent sentimentalism in which the most of the pianists fail .     She knew how to get the involving sound , avoiding the excess of sensibility so typical of the romanticism movement . She turns the melody in a sugerent and impresionist portrait , giving a natural gaze not a picture museum gaze .     That is why her Mendelssohn 's songs without words have no equal rivals . Try to find it .    Her Chopin is OK , but Grieg is the peak of the crown . The nights are loaded of passionand fire , one of the four best versions ( among the Kapell reading with Stokowski , an incredible performing of Robert Casadesus - Mitropoulus and Artur Rubinstein)in the market .    Don't miss it!
