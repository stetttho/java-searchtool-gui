 The formidable technique equipment of Mr. Ponti as well his passionate romanticism in the Second Somata. You may argue this recording can not match with Horowitz for instance, but I beg you to listen at first giving me the doubt's benefice. This reluctant recording is such dramatic and intense that literally lets you exhausted at the end of the performiance which runs 25  minutes approximately.  The Scriabin is extremely interesting. The aureole of introspectiveness and poetic rapture is astonishing. Ponti plays these works with such conviction level and fevered pianism that it is hard for you to remain indiferent after listening them.  Finally the big surprise is the incandescent live performance of the three movements of Petruschka. To my mind there is not any other version played with such fierceness and Siberian moods.  This album is extremely recommendable for any one who is really interested to get close to that honest and undeservedly reknown  pianist. Let me tell you that Michael Ponti has the immense honor -among other personal and artistic triumphs- of being the only pianist in the story who has recorded the entire repertoire of the following Russian composers: Alexander Scriabin, Piotr Illich Tcahiakovsky and Serguie Rachmaninoff. So I guess Ponti must domain the Russian musical language. Don't you?   Try to get this album as soon as you can!
