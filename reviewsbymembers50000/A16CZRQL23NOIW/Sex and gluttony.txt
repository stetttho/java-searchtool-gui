 A small group composed by well definite  personages, (linked by their Epicurean approach)  each one of them representing a symbol of power and notorious status in the society - a judge, a chef, a pilot, a TV producer and a female school teacher join for a gastronomic weekend in a Parisian home. This great plentiful repast will be complemented by an unexpected guest: The Death' s Angel.      What it going to come will be certainly one of the most impressive portraits of degradation and decadence ever seen in the screen until this date.   An admirable metaphor of the boring and the lack of illusions to live.
