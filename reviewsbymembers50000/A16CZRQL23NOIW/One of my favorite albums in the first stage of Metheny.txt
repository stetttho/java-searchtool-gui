 I love this album. It owns that genius touch that can be appreciated from the first bars of the First song to the last one. Metheny sounds look so fresh, contagious, gifted of this engaging emotiveness and joy of living that will seduce you instantaneously. Watercolors and Lakes are the most delirious tracks of the CD, but in general the quality level of the album is so high that it will be a hard task for you to decide about your special favoritism around a special theme.   A fantastic album, permeated by a colossal musical inventive and delirious flair.
