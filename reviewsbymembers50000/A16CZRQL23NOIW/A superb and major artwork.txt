 It's difficult for me to be totally objective due the fact I have been all my life a hard fan of Vermeer. Her absolute domain of the color harmonies, the sharp contrast between the light cascades and his total domain of the fugue point is absolute.  The film focuses around the simple but powerful anecdote , how this picture was done. Scarlett Johansson shines with her fantastic performance. Colin Firth is impressive too as the Delft ' s genius, but Tom Wilkinson is outstanding and deserves all the best comments.  The illumination was made following the pictorial patterns, elegant, mysterious, enigmatic and sensual, a true visual feast, that complements a very artistic film.
