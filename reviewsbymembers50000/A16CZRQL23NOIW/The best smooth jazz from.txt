 Gregg Karukas is one the major keyboards in smooth jazz at this time and probably Blue touch may be one of his greatest achievements.. This album has no holes. Blue touch is a solid work, with many interesting tracks. My favorite one is Fly away. However youll be widely reward with this buy. Every track is carefully played, with a sense of rhytm and harmony as a few.  Karukas belongs to a selected dinasty of keyboard players that never let you down , because he renews in every work he throws. Undobtly a musician with a huge foture, because his skillness, wide sense of the form and over all he never lets you dissapointed.  He and Brian Culbertson are from now the great white hope in smooth jazz keyboard.
