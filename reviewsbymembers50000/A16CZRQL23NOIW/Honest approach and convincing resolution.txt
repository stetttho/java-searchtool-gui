 Janos Starker is a consummated cellist. Possibly he was not very fortunate to live just under the shadow of so many Giants of the instrument; Pau Casals, Mitislav Rostropovich, Pierre Fournier, Jean Fournier, Feurman, Janos Piatigorski, Daniel Shafran, David Soyer, Schiff, Jacqueline Dupre and Cristina Walewska, simply eclipsed the whole stage around the world with refulgent light.    Nevertheless, his approach respect these milestones pages of the cello repertoire are more than surprising. His intellectual tact does not demerit an apex a honest vision.   I recommend its acquirement keeping in mind Casals performances are sidereal and far beyond any possible comparison.
