 This kinetic and passionate version of the Seventh Symphony is simply electrifying, though it does not overcome to his version of 1939.   Toscanini conferred Beethoven that dignity that has been gradually decreased. This absence of grandness and lack of noblesse and wildness has been possible thanks to the notable efforts of Mr. K conducting the Berlin Philharmonic. And  many other directors have simply extracted the Dionysian essence of the work, decreasing the fortissimos and reducing the fierceness and intensity in many passages, to avoid perhaps to saturate the audience with such will sounds. When you think and play Beethoven under this approach, you are murdering the most important values implicit inside Beethoven 's work.  So if you want to know how Beethoven should sound, please return to the classic directors who were perhaps less indulgent and unmerciful with the audience.
