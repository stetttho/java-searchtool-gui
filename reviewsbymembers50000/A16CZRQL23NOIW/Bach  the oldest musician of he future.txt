 The perennial fascination and constant actuality of Bach's music resides in its  non temporality. The music seems to flow from the depths of the cosmos, there is not any drop of sentimentalism but greatness; there is no lyricism but intellectual meditation, its not circumscribed to any specific circumstance: no historic reference,  personal statements,  epic feats, romantic expression, pantheist sublimation . It's music in its purest artistic meaning. It's a true micro cosmos by itself.  That demands a very special commitment for any musician;: to play Bach successfully you need trespass the invisible barriers of the score and explore another dimension. Specially in these works: his Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin, whose cosmic lyricism seems to gravitate in every bar. Bach talks to the eternity and I guess his music will always be listened and admired for the future listeners with the same freshness and eloquence. Sandor gives a dramatic and authoritative performance. One of the best choices in the market, even if you recognize that Szerying recorded the hitherto version of these sublime works.
