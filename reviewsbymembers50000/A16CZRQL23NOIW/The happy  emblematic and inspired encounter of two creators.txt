 This album gathers two authentic legends in the Jazz, the particular and very expressive poetry of Thelonius Monk and the art of this superb musician as John Coltrane.   The successful blending of both temperaments in this recital of 1957, may be possibly one of the most important musical findings in this year, if not the first one of them. The only fact for having rescued this treasured recording that was preserved intact, has too many points of undeniable interest for all of those Jazz lovers around the world.   Even if you are not a well informed Jazz fanatic, you must buy this album, because simply there is not a simple motive for you to argue about it. The incandescent rapport between these two giants is established from the first bars. The musical blitheness emanated by them is so eloquent, honest and convincing that hardly you will be able to escape from this seductive spelling.  It may sound exaggerate to affirm we have one of the most Jazz treasures ever found. A gem that will be revaluating through the years to come. So between many others reasons, go for this, because believe or not,I just was a child when I listened A Kind of Blue by Miles Davis and I felt a special feeling of wholeness, that is not usual to experience, and somehow is contained too, respect this diamantine record.   So acquire several records; one for your personal collection and some others for your most appreciated friends. Do not think it over, read some other reviews and decide by yourself.  Recommended without reserves.
