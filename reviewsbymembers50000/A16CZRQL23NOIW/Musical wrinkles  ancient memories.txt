 This is a magnificent collection of songs that somehow fed our memories, and sealed our youth meetings, in the Disco and in the happy company of beloved friends. Many of them are married, others are absent. Forty years have elapsed and as known tango states, twenty years are nothing, so forty years is simply twice nothing.  Jean- to my mind -(in despite of the fact that this is not the original song; this is faster than the other one) is the most forerunner theme in this selection. Oliver was a true herald in this style. The classic Traces of Classics IV, plenty of a sad lyrics, Baby now that I've found you of the Foundations was a super hit in those times and meant for them his definitive leap for later winner songs. Who can forget Mary Hopkins in Those were the days?.  In the other hand we have to Friends of Distinction with a song that anticipated in six years to the Disco Music genre. The sweet ballad Smile a little smile for me but if you go to Derek and the bubble gum themes Cinnamon or Sweet pea's Tommy Roe (Dizzy), you will understand why this selection I so enjoyable. And who can deny the unforgettable of the bars of Batman's theme with the Marketts. Go for this and make a journey throughout your personal memories in the High school or University years.
