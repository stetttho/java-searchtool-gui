 Butterfield 8 was a disturbing film in its age. Elizabeth Taylor won an Academy award for this film. The picture was supported by a fine dialogue. Once more Hiccock was right when he stated that the three most important fundamentals aspects for making a good film were ; first a good script , second a good script and third a good script .  Laurence Harvey is the lucky guy who commits adultery with that night butterfly , who later will fall in love with him . That perspective , however becomes in a complex device to explore the intimate world of all those people who live around them ; the fantasy world of Gloria, her glamorous desire to become a great lady , with an overshelter mother, a friend who makes the role of the brother she never had (Fisher is a mess as actor in this movie , maybe its only fault). In the other side of the coin , Harvey is a married man who lives in a boring house with a unbearable wife , with nothing to say and nothing to give . So this marriage is just only a status convenience. He rebeals against this state of things but he is uncapable of break his marriage.  This situation is obviously hazardous for Glorias growing expectations , who deeply in her mind still believes hell divorce. Powerful dramatis personae with an unexpected twist of fate. Taylor in the peak of her cosmical beauty , but showing us also her powerful skill gifts acting. Good transfer on DVD. The picture may be today a bit old fashioned , but the visible analogies in that age with notable personalities of different worlds are obviously reflected. The Profumo case for instance, was still fresh in the mind of the social pages and some other celebrities . A good film to watch over and over.
