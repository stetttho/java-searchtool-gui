 The Teutonic refinement of Wilhelm Backhaus has always been a veiled mystery. I knew from the profound admiration of Arrau for his pianism, thanks to a common friend who pitifully passed away fifteen years ago.   Maybe you may agree with this kind of hard reflexive and granitic Brahms. In fact Clifford Curzon employs a similar approach in his well know and famous recording with Georges Szell. I think Brahms must sound less rational and much more visceral, according his beloved and well known finals in so many works of visible gypsy tunes. Brahms also possessed humor, but if you want to inject major conceptual resonance and underline a major emphasis on span, (as Klemperer did it with Beethoven, for instance), go for this one.
