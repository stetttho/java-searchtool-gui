 This film is a treasure. If I had requested for the two most prominent pictures of the German Neo Realism before the WW2, I would mention The Blue Angel and this one.  Louise Brooks gave a terrific performance with this exigent role. Lulu is not a femme fatale. She incarnates the passport for depravation and perdition surrounded her magnetic smile and her candid baby face. It was literally impossible to escape from her alluring charm.   The picture turns around her awful life that elapsed between low depths places and cabarets, but Pabst 's touch of genius resided to underline the precognitive aspect , remarked by Fritz Lang through Brigitte Helm 's character. But Pabst drew the curtains of a hopeless, anguish, desperate and hunger society, trapped and devoured by their own demons. Jack the ripper will be simply a simple fate 's puppet in this sinister parade of desolation and moral orphanage in which the German Society was sunk.   Overwhelming film that conforms the Supreme Pantheon of the consecrated golden German Expressionist movies, together with Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Nosferatu, The hands of Orlac, Dr. Mabusse and its sequels,  Metropolis, The last man, Sigfrid, Kriemhilde 's revenge  and M.
