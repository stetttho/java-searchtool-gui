 This album is a true finding. Isaac Stern was not a febrile player of Bartok's violin music like Menuhin, for instance but his encounter with Bernstein who was not a renowned Bartok's director produced a weird and successful chemistry. The complex dissonances and the  melodic roughness are performed with leonine skillfulness and artistic feature of that unforgettable violinist: the maestro Isaac Stern!.
