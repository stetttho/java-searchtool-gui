  Sergei Paradjanov made his sublime masterpiece with this matchless and epic story of starcrossed lovers against the ethnographic statement of the carphatian mountains . Visually stunning , loaded with symbols , and arresting metaphors with lyrical photography  and ravishing intensity .  The only film I remind closely related in what concerns with passionate humanism would be Desu Uzala of Akira Kurosawa , but the point to remark is this film was made ten years before .
