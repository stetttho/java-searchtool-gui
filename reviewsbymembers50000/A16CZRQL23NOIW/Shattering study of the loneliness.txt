 This is the real masterpiece of Vitorio de Sica . An old man succumbes to the ravages of the age. An uncompromising denounce and a powerful reflection about the golden ages in the life of that lonely man , forgotten by all his most fellow friends . The movie is extremaly haunting and poignant . You will face in all its harsh reality the last consequences of what this hard but sadly moment comes but it is so well written , tastefully directed and even better acted that you may consider this one as one the best italian films of this decade . The anguish , loneliness and desperation have never better told and you should wait for forty years for another gem which deals with that related theme ; We are fine of Giussepe Tornatore . A sumptuous and master film !
