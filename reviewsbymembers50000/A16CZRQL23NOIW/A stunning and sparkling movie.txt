 Since its immediate release and until this date, we know nothing about any other picture that even gets close to it. The superb and smart script deals with the universe behind the scenes world of the New York theater. Ambitions, disillusions, betrayals and all kinds of allowable and not so devices to reach the peak. A true parade of unmeasured vanities where the goal justifies the ways according the Machiavellian logic; the sense of the game is to win, no matter how.  A superb classic, one of the most towering films in the Fifties, one of the ten best American films in any age, an everlasting cult movie, a living lesson of how to make a good picture, robust and incisive dialogues, exceptional cinematography and an obligated reference for the viewers of yesterday, today and future make of this an absolute must-see.   Without discussion, the glorious masterpiece of Joseph Mankiewicz.
