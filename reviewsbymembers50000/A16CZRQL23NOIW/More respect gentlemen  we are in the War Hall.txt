 What kind of movie. Brilliant, demential, cynical, dynamical, perfect, ironical with a dazzling script, excellent camara direction and a superb cast. If not for Kind hearts and cornets (1950) this would be the greatest black comedy ever made. Kubrick broke all the previous forecast and established this film like an authentical landmark. Sellers in his best triple performance.  George C Scott and Sterling Hyden are really amazing. A MASTERPIECE.  What are you waiting for acquiring it? Mein f?hrer I can walk!
