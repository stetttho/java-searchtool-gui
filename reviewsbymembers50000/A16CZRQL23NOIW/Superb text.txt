 In my University years, I must confess there was any other issue in the Engineering career capable to match (in what difficult concerns) than Dynamics. I consider that this isolated discipline is the seventy per cent of the whole difficultness in the Five Years. Harry Nara was my beacon in the darkness, his polished concepts, kind presentation, fundamental exercises and that easy going conciseness and accuracy at the moment of solving "heavy problems" , constituted to me the friendly hand that saved me from the waters. Go for this, I still use it in my Consulting Timing "to help" the new students generations.
