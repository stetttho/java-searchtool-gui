 The piano is my favorite instrument . The musical literature has been widely generous with it. Since Bach to Mozart , and from Beethoven to Shostakovich , the piano has proved with all the deserved respect to the rest of the instruments the unbeatable king.  And that special profile that incorporean majesty given through the pianissimos and crescendos makes of it a perfect caleidoscope of sensations and auditive fragancies according the tonal color . The piano is one the supreme films of the nineties . Conceived as a tribute for the female soul , the movie explores deep laberynths in the soul of a married but unsatisfied woman who only through the music she is friendly about her inners demons and obviously hidden desires . The decisive argument for developing a poetic and dazzling script where Holy Hunter plays a superb role and Harvey Keitel shows his unexhaustive actoral powers. The locations are really sumptuous with the precise light quantity and the marvelous landscapes working out as an additional actor . The dark forest , the unbeatable , the exquisite close ups and one superb script . Anna Paquin steals the show and excels among all these giants actors . The credits go besides, to Michael Nyman who inspired himself with such commitment level to offer us his fine moods for this film .  Sublime is one common characteristic of the masterpieces .  And this is one of them.
