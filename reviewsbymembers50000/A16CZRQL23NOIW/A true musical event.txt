 The recent release of this innovative album has been a very fortunate event. Andrea possesses a very warm and lyrical voice with admirable tonal registers which allowed him to undertake a fantastic and pleasant musical journey; an authentic homage to great classic themes of the past of nice remembrance in the popular memories. But there is more. the magnificent lyrics and arrangements are of first order. Christina Aguilera, Kenny G and Chris Botti, one of the best trumpeters in the world (Ray Hargrove is my favorite one) conform a refreshing and necessary album, specially in these times where the noise seemed to pretend substitute the music. Andrea has restored the romantic music, a renovated splendor and gentle elegance without that accustomed flippancy we are accustomed to watch in so many musical concerts. To my mind, the jewel of the crown song is Pero te extrano.  An album to recreate the romantic moods and discrete charm under candles or moonlight.
