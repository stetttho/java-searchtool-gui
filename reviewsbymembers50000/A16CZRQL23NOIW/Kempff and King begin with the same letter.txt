 If Artur Schnabel represents for many the maxim exponent, you should never forget to Wilhelm Kempff as a serious and legitimate contender too. His expressiveness and cantabile line simply has no rivals. Yesterday, I just listened these superb versions of the Fourth and Fifth Piano Concerts that literally are breathtaking.  Kempff was justly in his Forties, so consider the fabulous phrasing, untiring display of creative energy and enraptured musical spell every time he played. The wisdom employment of the pedal, his diamantine glissandos, the velvet sound emanated in every one of the pianissimos is something simply unbelievable.  The Fifth Piano Concert was performed in 1935 and the Fourth in 1941. Go for these historic recordings before it `s too late and remains out of print.
