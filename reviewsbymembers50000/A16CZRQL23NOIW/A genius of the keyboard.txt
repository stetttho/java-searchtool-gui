 It seems incredible that so many years have passed witout us , here in the western hemisphere, never heard before about this superb pianist. I waited to listen a standard version of the Apassionata and Patetique, but what I discovered there was an ocean of skills, deep thought, and honesty with conviction . Murdoch was an extraordinary pianist, and you can feel a strong personality combined  with an overpowered lyricism.  The apassionata is touched with amazing precission and unquestioinable maestry. The Patethique is performed with wisdom. Exploring the inner facets behind the score. Charm , nuance and poetry all along the way. The Archiduque is among the greatest achievements, just behind the famous Casals, Kempff, Vegh from 1961. So consider the performing. Thanks to all these people who really showed their interest  for making us known this remarkable artist. In the future we are expecting more recordings of this undeniable giant of the keyboard.
