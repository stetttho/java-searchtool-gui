 The thousand and thousand cases of familiar violence that we know are not but the iceberg's point. How many hidden cases do really exist at this moment? This bold film focuses around a typical case of excessive abuse, evident physical violence and mental cruelty exerted by (Can we design this human being a man?) this extremely fearful, visibly dangerous, potential murder and weak mind husband who considers his wife as a possession and enjoyment personal, a simple furniture who may be disposed to clean, cook and make love to satisfy him exclusively. He is far to understand any relationship according this distorted approach only can generate fear and mortal silence, that eventually can become in a time bomb, able to explode anytime. After you leave the hall, think about and make memory around your social environment. You will ever find weird behavior in many people you knew, in your workplace, in your University classroom (and I do not only mean students but teachers too, as I personally had), AA, distorted behavior patterns that you hardly could understand because you were fortunately living out of that oppressive atmosphere. A top-notch to watch over and over and a magnificent pretext to initiate open and sincere conferences and discussions around the world about this issue, that pitifully goes on generating serious and unexpected emotional responses in human beings who eventually can reach elevated positions in several power spheres.  Remarkable performances by all cast. Spain is a true nest of promising talents. Laia Marull (Pilar) and Luis Tosar (Antoinio) won deservedly , the prizes of Best Actress and Best Actor in San Sebastian Film Festival 2003. An outstanding film. Do not miss.!  And don't forget to Laia, the most prominent actress in years.
