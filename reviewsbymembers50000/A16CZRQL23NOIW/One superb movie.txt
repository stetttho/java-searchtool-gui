 First at all , I must confess that my favorite film of Luis Bunuel is Viridiana. But what this film has in particular is the special enchantment who Bunuel added when we watched the dramatic transformations suffered by a same woman in an unhappy relationship.  The progressive change , you perfectly can associate with the journey from Athenea to Aphrodite and back to Athenea with a touch of Gea . Athenea besides being the knowledge , the prudence and wisdom's symbol , was virginal. Instead Aphrodite simbolizes the love without restrictions and duties too. In Aphrodite's mind the idea of a perpetual relationship and marrioage, simply don't exist. Gea represents the woman who thinks in the marriage as a commitment of life. She loves the family and kids, and that's her bliss. That's why our troubled man (Fernando Rey) can not understand. Because he loves the best of both , and so his confussion grows and grows till the time comes for him to fade in that unexpected ending. One powerful of the couple. A film carefully made and a brilliant portrait who reflect the behavior of many couples in any age. Watch this monumental film . One of the most honest works of that genius: Luis Bunuel.
