 A timid woman, overprotected by his father a General, finds apparently the expected love and shelter in a man of doubtful reputation, fond of women and hard gambler who did not hesitate for a second to sell his soul to get some money.  In this state of complementariness, one each other finds shelter (one of them economic, the other one, emotional and affective) the tension will be gradually increasing due the serious suspects he may kill with the same easiness he lies. She will be upset, but this growing doubt will affect her whole behavior leading her to the verge of the neurosis.  Although, the original plot is even bleakest, other interests interloped to present a smooth version in which a forced redemption will emerge from the blossomed heart of his beloved wife. This alteration whatever their causes might be, weakened the basic structure of the movie. That 's why I can not assign the expected Five Stars. If I had been Hitchcock, I would have kept a Director version, for better times, perhaps.       A well constructed drama with all the basic elements of Hitchcock. Fontaine won an Academy Award for this acting in 1941.
