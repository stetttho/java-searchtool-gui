 The figure of Artur Rubinstein in the musical stage was very similar respect Chopin in the previous Century. Far from his beloved Poland, this unforgettable pianist possessed the magnetic charisma, and joyful kindness to play the most profound Polish sentiment all around the world, with special emphasis in the Thirties when the figure and transcendence of Alfred Cortot was notoriously decaying. His double condition of emigrant and no one land citizen (due his Jewish roots) made of him a personality who surmounted the limits of the musical stages.  So, while the great number of directors and soloist were spread all around the world in the Thirties due political reasons, Rubinstein played the Romantic repertoire with notable solvency. We should remind his powerful performances in the Thirties until the middle Forties.  In this sense this Grieg is loaded of forceful expression and fervent nationalist ardor and sublime vehemence. Particularly and in  spite of the fact this Piano Concerto has suffered of a process of exhaustive abuse, this version remains among the most solid conceptual and musically performances in any age. You should not forget three additional performances: the fantastic version of Dinu Lipatti, the remarkable reading of the supreme colorist Walter Gieseking in the Forties, and finally the sensible performance of Radu Lupu n the middle Seventies.         The Brahms Piano Concerto is exquisitely well phrased and played. Munch as always was superb conducting the legendaries musicians of the Boston Orchestra.   Acquire this historical register before it' s too late.
