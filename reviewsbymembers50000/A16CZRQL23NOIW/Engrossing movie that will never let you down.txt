 1939. The world is at the eve of the WW2. Robert Donat, a formidable and versatile actor who shone with his famous portrayal of The Count of Monte Christ, gave possibly his lifetime performance around the figure of an abnegate and beloved schoolmaster. Make this visual exercise and perhaps you agree with me: but Donat influenced securely to John Hurt `s style acting.  A fundamental issue in your treasured collection. Donat won a well deserved Academy Award in 1939 for this superb role. Greer Carson (one of my top choice actresses ever) makes an auspicious debut.  Absolutely recommended.
