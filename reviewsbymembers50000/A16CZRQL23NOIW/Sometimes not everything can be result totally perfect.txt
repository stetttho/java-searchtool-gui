 Sometimes the excess of self reliance becomes a boomerang for many artists. This was the case, pitifully for Artur Schnabel who gave a modest performance of one of the most sublime bout also enigmatic and demanding Piano Concerts of Mozart; this Concert is far from being a simple tongue in the cheek; Amadeus explores multiple corners of the anima state, tragedy, innocence and nave aristocracy around the most kaleidoscopic of his set of Concerts. It is very easy to make a mistaken reading of this one, and Schnabel conferred it a German austerity and excess of intellectualism (the Final Cadenza that sounds so close to Schenberg)  that helped in less than nothing to deform the whole expression and meaning of this work.   Beethoven ` s Third Concert  result was by far, much more fortunate for him. But I must remark there are several better options: Ivan Moravec (My Super First Choice, by far), Andrei Gavrilov,  Marguerite Long, Wilhelm Kempff, Daniel Barenboim and Glenn Gould exhibit a major persuasion level and commitment sense.
