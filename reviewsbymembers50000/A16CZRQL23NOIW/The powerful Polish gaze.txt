 Kleines Requiem fr eine polka written in memory of the composer' s mother in 1971. It's work of intimate mood evidently of introspective character with outbursts of absolute meditation, exacerbated concentration and restrained rage, enrooted in the innermost  church-song and folk songs traditions. The second movement is an obsessive of remarkable minimalist character. The fourth movement -Adagio Cantabile- reminds us powerfully to one of the most known folk songs previously employed by Bartok in his famous Rumanian Folk Dances loaded with serene calmness and nocturnal character.  It was recorded on February 12, 1994 at Henry Wood Hall, London. The Concerto for harpsichord and string orchestra is very brief. The first of the two movements is a lively and obsessive melody with anguishing atmosphere; the last one is equally tense but dynamically stronger and minimalist approach.   It was recorded on December 17, 1994 at All Saints Church, Surrey, England.
