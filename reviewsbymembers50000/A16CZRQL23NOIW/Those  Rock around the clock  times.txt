 This film announced from another angle the enormous no satisfaction social disseminated in several social spheres. This generation who was born just at the beggining of the WW2 expressed with the characteristic rage the rules. This behavior has been an eternal ritornello. The ingenuity innocent , the continue defy to the Status Quo has prevailed always, but specially in those hopeless and confused ages when the radical changes in the whole world even drew new expectations and questions: the rock was an important mass phenomena and somehow allowed to overthrow a good portion of cumulate tensions. In the other side of the Atlantic Ocean the New Wave was born with similar proposals.  The familiar conflicts, the huge number of orphans, the alcoholism , the obvious fear to the ghost of the nuclear weapons, the presence of the Cold War needed some answers but most of the adults ignored them , which it meant a major social effervescence.  Blackboard jungle works out as a frenetic emblem of the miscarried youth, orphan of love and spiritual guides.  Vic Morrow and Sidney Poitier were particularly effective. Glenn Ford's tour de force acting lead this movie with special credibility.  By these destiny's ironies , ten years after Poitier would be just in the other side of the classroom in "To sir with love".
