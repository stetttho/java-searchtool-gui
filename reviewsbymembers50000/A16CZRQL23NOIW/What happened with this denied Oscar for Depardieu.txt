 If Jose Ferrer won more than deservedly the Academy Award , Gerard Depardieu must have received his prize too . In this sense , pitifully a great injustice was done . The amazing effort made for Jean Paul Rappenau in the rebuilding of the story were simply sublime : artistic direction , photography , superb adaptation and the radiant presence of this billion thousand carats : Gerard Depardieu made of this film a strong candidate to win a great number of Prizes . But what it happened is part of a very sad story .  In my personal opinion , Depardieu has made five unforgettable films in this order: Danton , Cyrano , Tartufe , Jean de Florette and Novecento  .  So when you acquire this issue you will have something much more important than a simple movie ; you will take your home a glorious masterpiece of the French Cinema .
