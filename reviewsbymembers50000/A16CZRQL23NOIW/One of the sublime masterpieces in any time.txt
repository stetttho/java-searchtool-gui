 What can we add about that glorious movie? Wonderful script, powerful message, exceptional landscapes, superb cast. In fact, Depardieu gives one of his finest goals (at the level of Danton, Cyrano, Vatel or Novecento). This film also threw to the sand to Daniel Auteil and Montand might have given the best achievement of his career as the greedy father.  The story is quite simple. Depardieu tries to find a new life in a farm on the hills of a village, whose people don't see him very well due his hauntchback.  The epic spirit he arouses and all the crowd of situations make this story and this film a must reference when you consider the best Eighties French movies.  Watch this film and please, dont forget Manon the second part.
