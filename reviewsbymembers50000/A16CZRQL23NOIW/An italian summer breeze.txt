 This is an original , powerful and charming love story . Venice is the background in which an unhappy married with a bore and predictable man decides to stop for mere casuality in Venice. But this decision will be her twist of fate . Admirable acting , Lucia and Bruno are superb , the script is very smart and the scenes are wonderful. A feast for the senses.
