 John Frankenheimer's masterful direction , Eugene O' Neill's  solid script and superb and enviable cast: Frederic March one of the best American actors ever , Lee Marvin and Robert Ryan overthrew the raising career of Jeff Bridges .  Set in a 1912 waterfront saloon : the perfect stage to face the tragic anguish of Hickey -The iceman - , destroyer of his hapless pals .  Superb and superior film.
