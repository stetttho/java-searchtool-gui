 Phil Janou proves once his admirable gifts as Director thanks to his powerful visual narrative and daring shot angles.   In this case, a retired cop is an involuntary witness of an airplane crash that almost kills him and his wife since they were fishing in a sunny day. Without thinking it twice, he drowns to save possible survivors and gets to rescue a lovely child. This fact will be the dramatic overture which will work out as a violent premise that will be related with dealers. Violent and very effective thriller. Baldwin is superb, but Jill Stuart Matheson didn't achieve the expected results, she looks like some distant and inexpressive of this secondary character.
