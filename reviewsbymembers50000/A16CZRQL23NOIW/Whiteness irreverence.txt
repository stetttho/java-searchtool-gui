 Among the notable group of the Six, it would seem two names have resisted the impetuous acid test of the time: Erik Satie and Francis Poulenc.     Melodically, Francis Poulenc is an heir of Erik Satie, but disliked abstractionism and philosophy. He rather preferred sensuality and sentimentality. He was a typical product of the French culture, one of the most singular figures of the famous Six (Germaine Taileferre, Erik Satie, Milhaud, Arthur Honegger, Georges Auric and Louis Durey)        He opposed himself clearly to classic form dissolution inside the impressionist sonorous taste and on the other hand, refused the tragic heroism. Gifted with an instinctive personality, was a fervent lover of the structural clarity and the melancholic mood, kindly ironic without purist whimsicalness.      His music is strongly loaded of whiteness and careful expressive phrasing. Gabriel Tachino shows us why he was one of the prominent pianists of his generation.     Go for this album without dilation.
