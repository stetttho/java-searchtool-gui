 On a Saturday evening in 2003, a great friend of mine, made me listen this version of the Fifth : I must confess after having listened it, I just could not believe it. This is by far, the most amazing, revealing, incandescent and mercurial reading of Sibelius Fifth ever recorded until now.   Segerstam deepened into the essential core of this work, giving us a mythical approach; the epic and strength vision simply has not parallel in the market.  In which the Third concerns, the results are admirable; you would not have to miss this fantastic opportunity to acquire this overwhelming record.
