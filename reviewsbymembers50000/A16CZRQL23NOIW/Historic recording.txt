 This historic live performance confirms once again, the sensible loss experienced when Gould left us in 1982. His magnetic charisma, triggering fingering, fevered passion, astonishing pianism and powerful personality can be appreciated particularly in this recording. Gould initiated the Recital -dated August 25 1959- with one of the four most important musical influences of Bach; Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck's Organ Fantasy; the othr three composers were Vivaldi, Couperin and Buxtehude.  Then Gould plays Schnberg in a enigmatic version of the Suite Op. 125 and the First half of the recital is dedicated to Mozart's Piano Sonata K. 330. This Mozart work was almost an obligated reference, considering the fact that Gould was playing in the nest of the composer. Once again, this performance has serious problems for all who expected to listen a crystalline and expansive Amadeus. The result is an introspective, austere, autumnal, and if I may Johan Christian Bach `s approach. The jewel of the crown was the Andante, played with rapture and loyal fondness to the score. Noblesse oblige.     Nevertheless the main interest of the audience was focused around the Goldberg, the work who threw to fame and wide acclaiming around the world.              This third performance of the Goldberg ( after the 1953's debut in Canada and the most known by then of 1955 contains some stylistics innovations that carves in relief the years of research and study about this Giant work. The final result was if you want the warmest performance of the four known versions (including his Posthumous Goldberg in 1981).       Fundamental album in your personal collection. And for all those fervent fans and admirers of this singular artist, whose encouragement and bold statement made of him an enigmatic legend of the keyboard.
