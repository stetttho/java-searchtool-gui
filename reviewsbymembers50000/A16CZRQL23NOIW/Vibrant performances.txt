  The elegant batoon, the distinguished reffinement, and the persuasive eloquence of this Alsacian conductor is carved in relief with these two well known works.  Munch elevated the rank of the Boston Symphony literally to unexpected levels in just ten years. He owned that golden eye to remark, accent and underline the mysterious, the musicality and the rapture of every work he conducted.  With this performance of Mendelssohn 's Third Symphony Munch kissed the heaven. The orchestra breaths with superb aristocracy and expression as any other conductor until now. Peter Maag makes a convincing performance but it lacks comittment.  The Fourth is radiant,provided with nuance and lan. Munch's ritards, rubatos and violin portament are simply enviable.  If you even may to get the Fifth Symphony, run for it because there is not a better option. You may find it in Amazon France as I did it in 2001.
