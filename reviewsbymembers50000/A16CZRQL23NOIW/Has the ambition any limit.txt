 Laurence Harvey the best role of his career with this admirable film in the most scrupulous sense of the word. From the powerful and incisive inspired pen of John Braine and a magnificent screenplay of Neil Patterson.  A man, obsessed with the success and the Machiavellian maxim: "The goal justifies the means" won 't stop at anything to reach the top of the world in the business world. He represents the legitimate descendent of Richard III.   A cult film that shines with radiant light, despite the elapsed years; the movie has inspired countless sequels, but here between you and me, this is the winner.  Who can match for instance with the towering performance of Simone Signoret who won an ultra deserved Academy Award by this sumptuous role.  A classic film in every level you analyze it.
