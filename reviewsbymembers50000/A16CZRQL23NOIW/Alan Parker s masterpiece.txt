 This is an absorbing and arresting film. Since the first minute of the opening sequence , the dramatic mood will live in our heart . The inner tension in the airport is perfectly made , the fear , the insane atmosphere in the turkish jails , the language obstacle , the hopeless , the dramatic sense when the Turkish Court gives the veredict in the middle of a bitter political conflict are a true landmark in its style. John Hurt (Max) plays an unforgettable role as the addict friend of Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) and his performance is only overcome for The elephant man two years after this film. Magnificent script and extraordinary performances.  A winner.
