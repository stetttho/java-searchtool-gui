 The creative vein of Istvan Szabo was beating with refulgent intensity. After the world success of his sumptuous and delirious film Mephisto, he returned with Hanussen , an engaging story which turns around a wounded soldier during the WW1 who seems to have prophetic gifts; because of that, will lead him to be used by the Nazis for obvious reasons.   Powerful, intriguing and memorable film. One of the supreme achievements of this Top Director.   The reason why this superb film has not been released on DVD at this time is a true riddle.
