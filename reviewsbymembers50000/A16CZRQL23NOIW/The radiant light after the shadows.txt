 Bruno Walter was a remarkable conductor of Mahler. This brief introduction is important to remark because, every time Walter conducted Mozart, it can be felt how the elements of candor, charm, presence and warmth of the Austrian surrounding is felt far beyond the score.  Walter illuminates the bars with that refulgent brightness and touch of humanity, in this sense his Mozart is deeply contemporanean and above all human. He literally, transports us (as Gould playng Bach)to the essential core of the lyric musculature and eloquent expression.  In this sense I want to recommend you this admirable and triumphal set of Overtures with the complement of the most renowned of Mozart' s Serenades; his Kleine Nachtmusik, surpassed only by Sandor Vegh and Ferenc Fricsay in what it concerns to lyrical purity and sublime expression.  Go for this CD without any doubt.
