 This picture is a sublime ode to the sea nature and it exemplifies as any other else, the nature's purposes may be far beyond of the tradition or established principles conceived beforehand. According the dynasty of ancient ancestors, Paikea must be a male leader, but there 's a twist of fate when two twins are born and one of them dies: the male. So this female survivor is never seen with any drop of tenderness of sympathy by her grandfather. She intends by all her means to win the trust and respect but she does not  get it.  But slowly there will be a curious events chain and slender facts that will convince him to this honorable but narrowed mind master he is wrong. The film elapses between rituals and touching but effective anecdotes. She never gives up in her courage to reach her place. She will break the rules and her character will face the authority more than once.  The midnight sequence in which we watch the whales in the sand is visually poetic and extremely haunting.  Niki Caro threw once more her hat to ring with this admirable film, plenty of metaphors and mythological learning in which the nature is present ominously, through the greenness, the wind and the sea: the symbol of the life, according the mythical gaze. Few times the cinema has been under the nature's service as in this case. There are other notable films as Flaherty's Nanook of the North, Herzog's Fata Morgana or Roeg's Walkabout for instance, but this film shines with resplendent brilliancy.
