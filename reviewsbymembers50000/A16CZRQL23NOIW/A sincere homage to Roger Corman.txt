 Lisbon is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Who can deny it?. And Win Wenders becomes it as magnificent frame to tell us about an unfinished filmmaking project; disillusions, perspectives and intelligent dialogues that reveal an even more compicated issue: the life itself.  Samuel Fuller and Roger Corman two irreverent filmmakers, acceded to join Win about this somber but enriching existential dramatis personae.   The soundtrack is magnificent and somehow this film works out as a transitional which ties up "The way the world ended" and the future four hands work with Michelangelo Antonioni: "Lisbon story"
