 This original Besson' s movie caves in relief once more the slender difference between the violence motor and violence victim. The film scrupulously analyzed and seen in perspective has undeniable shadows of the Clockwork orange but seen from other perspective. Many issues are put on the table for a further discussion: Who wins with the violence? Is the violence by itself a cause or a consequence of the established order? Is the violence condemnable when you are an outlaw placed on the opposite side of the Status Quo, but it's accepted and even prized when you are part of the good team? Does it really innocence exist in the human being? . Do you still believe the world is composed by good and bad guys? .   The man denies due he' s weak; those words come from Rashomon when the wife talks to the members of the Jury.  Define violence is the crude answer of a character in that Wender's film : The end of the violence.  Our starring Nikita will experiment a dramatic change of forced attitude; she will be exerting the violence for cleaning the world of certain worms and precisely in that brutal re adaptation process she will feel in own flesh the violence in its most elemental nature. A woman without love and searching it unconsciously . The film will play with the ancestral codes of  victim and executioner immersed in a complex and cold world with the pragmatic approach. The enemy of today may be my future fellow friend depending who bets in the casino.     "The civilization does not eliminate the barbarism ; it excels it". Voltaire.
