 Walter Gieseking was gifted of this particular feature. His pianissimos were simply enviable; the slender approach to Mendelssohn works out as ring to finger. All of us know about his supreme eloquence around Debussy performances, but Gieseking underlines the admirable lyricism provided with an enraptured approach, sounding much more eloquent respect the most of pianists who tend to remark glissandos and arpeggios forgetting many times the absolute chamber work character, where elegance, panache and nuance shake hands.  This is one of the most successful records ever performed, but if you have besides Rena Kyriakou, Guiomar Novaes and Anna Dorffman, you should not have to worry about it, because you would have the cream of the cream versions about this work.
