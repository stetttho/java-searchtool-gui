 This admired and sometimes forgotten French director (The jeweled Le chose de la vie Things of the life) made a great artistic achievement with this story of disaffection and love discounters a very intoxicating film. You must be in a special for appreciate with a majuscule glee this superb movie.       Magnificent score with Ravel music and a cast headed by the great Daniel auteil, one of my loved French actresses the always beauty Emanuelle Beart (Manon of spring and more recently Nathalie) and this legendary actor Andre Dusolier.
