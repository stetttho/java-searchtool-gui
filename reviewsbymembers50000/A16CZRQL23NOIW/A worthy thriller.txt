 The film is hard to beat. From the first shot you are forced to experience the suspense taste: Terri Hachter due a phone call is forced to follow strictly every little indication for her son's life. A voice in off in the other side of the line orders her , the kinetic and frenetic rhythm will lead us finally to a brief climax though we suspect is not but the peak of the iceberg. There is much more; since she has been fired from her previous job, certain dark forces will work out on her and suddenly she will be blamed of a murder she didn't commit. The rest of the story will involve to her ex -husband, who is seriously implied in all that huge enigma.  Despite there are some lagoons in the script such that obvious sequence in which Terri enters to her previous job without any kind of problem - and since we know she is chased for FBI, police and the Security Personal which you and me assume slept or perhaps in Holidays, but I guess it was July Fourth or The First Day of the Year- or the extremely expected and more than obvious sequence of the ambush near the helicopter, the film keeps to maintain the interest through the way and entertains, without extreme intellectual effort from the spectator.
