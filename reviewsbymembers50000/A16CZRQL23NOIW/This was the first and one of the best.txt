 This picture still maintains the frehness of its age . A discrete budget but the screenplay and the cast and dazzling leaned the balance favorably . Sean Connery is the authentic Bond . Ursula Andress , the first Bond girl has been a supreme beauty . The dialogues are loaded of very good taste and unavoidable sense of ironical and double meaning . Bernard Lee as the evil Dr No is outstanding too . The locations are the top of the line . How can you imagine the century XX without James Bond or the Beatles ?
