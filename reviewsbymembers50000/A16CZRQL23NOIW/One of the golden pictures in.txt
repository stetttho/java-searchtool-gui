 This artistic film has much more to say than you ever imagine. It focuses around a poignant and very often unspoken and voluntary ignored issue: the hidden side of the Big Apple.  Julian Glover makes to my mind his best artistic achievement in his career as a homeless man who meets another homeless young who is worse than him Matt Dillon. He believes is taking superb pictures from his empty camera and Glover supports him in his fantasy: his madness land and unhappy bliss.   As the film goes on, an intense friendship will origin sequences of haunting loneliness and moral misery. Somehow that film reminded me to a cult movie: Sporchi, brutti e cattive (Ugly, bad) an Italian film of the middle seventies directed by Ettora Scola. (See my review about that one)  In the other hand the masterful direction and the impressive locations will demand from the viewer a sensitive approach. Valiant film which survived in the Independient Channel and didn't deserve major acclaims, due possibly to such painful argument.  The secure hand of Hunter led this film to an epic resolution inside the limits and possibilities of this homeless human being.  It's more than obvious to recommend you this curious and admirable artwork that simply overpassed the commercial criterions and circuits to get inmersed in a real nightmare in the middle of the Great City of the World.
