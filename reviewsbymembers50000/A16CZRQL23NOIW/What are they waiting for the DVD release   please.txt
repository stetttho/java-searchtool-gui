 It is the story of a little man . He thinks he is an criminal inspector . he believes that he will be able to mock some Federal agents but : wrong choice! The life has by far a better imagination than him and he will experiment a real twist of fate . He has to find the murder of an old Jewish lady owner of a confectionery in a black ghetto . He does not know but this investigation will involve him . There is a bit influence of Spike Lee works ; a crude reflection about the anti-Semitism  in the black ghettos . Mamet handles the slenderness with reason , he tries to establish a game between families . You know as well as me , Mamet is an outstanding film maker that it will never disillusion you because he always a card under the sleeve.  Haunting and penetrating film .
