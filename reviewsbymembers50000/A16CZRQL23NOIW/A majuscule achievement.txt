 Bruckner 's Eighth Symphony is a landmark work. Listening with careful attention, has become gradually the most pyramidal of his Symphonies, relegating to secondary levels,  lofty architectural pieces such as the Fifth, the Seventh and the Farewell Ninth.  The third movement is by far, the core of the Symphony, but its colossal proportions its radiating potency, its delirious high scale proportions do not demerit at all its intrinsic virtues .   This is a very important version in the annals of the story. But I must confess I prefer by far, the Novak version.
