 The meditative, sumptuous and refined atmosphere generated by Michelangeli at the moment we listen his Chopin, gives us an even further vision of the composer. Being Chopin a Romantic artist, there are an extensive catalogue of collateral emotions and livings, that visibly, enrich the overall landscape of his music.  That' s what it makes the visible difference between Michelangeli and the rest of the pianists. Arturo lets the bar breathes sand flies, filling the hall or the studio recording with new elements, game of light and shadows, persuasive elegance and sumptuous expression. As genuine exponent of the old school, he not only played music, but remarked the unsaid corners of the score.          The Ballade No. 1 finds possibly three other marvelous historical. a live performance by William Kapell, the enormous reading of Frau Carreno and a refined version of Casadesus in the middle Forties.  The Second Sonata is to my mind the most idomatic that I have heard before.  Beethoven is extremely elagant and noble.    You should acquire this album, because we are talking about one of the major keyboard giants of the recent past whose influence still permeates the anima state of some renowned pianists of these times, fortunately.    A true classic.
