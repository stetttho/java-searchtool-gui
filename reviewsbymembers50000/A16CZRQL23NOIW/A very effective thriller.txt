 A Sheriff who also is Bishop in a very small religious village in Utah is very proud to maintain his community well distant from the rest of the world in which violence and murderers concern. But suddenly, all his hopes will vanish when he had to del face to face with a serial killer.  Among the several samples of Independent Films, this one maintains an impeccable conceptual honesty and very personal style. Hi camera 's employment with wide objectives reminds us to Howard Hawks and the suspense treatment with the first stage of Alfred Hitchcock. This director even his youth, handled with absolute mastery suspenseful moments, leading us to false assumptions and wrong deductions, building an interesting script, which may be a bit overlong specially at the end.   But the final sum justifies by far, his undeniable talent. Remember this name; for new producers and great audiences. Bravo for him.
