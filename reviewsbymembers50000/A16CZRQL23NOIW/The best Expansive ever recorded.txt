 In Leonard Bernstein 's musical career there have been glorious and unforgettable achievements: and if I was required by the eight major ones: I should name, in this order. a) Mahler' s Second with the London Symphony; b) Schumann 's Second ; c) Aaron Copland 's Rodeo; d) Edward Elgar' s Pomp and circumstance with the members of the BBC; e) Britten 's Peter Grimes ; f) Haydn ' s Symphony No. 97; g) Charles Ives question without answer; and finally this Nielsen 's Third. Nobody does it better. When Bernstein was inspired and decided to face the work going to the essential roots, he got magnificent results as this one, for instance.  So don' t think it over and try to get as soon as you can this towering recording, without a little shadow of doubt: this is a resonant artistic feat.
