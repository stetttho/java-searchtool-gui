 The dark side of the geo politic agreements backstage which allow to sustain and maintain our living standard in a convulsed and extremely complex universe of ancestral beliefs, financials indexes, puppets authorities and dark affairs which concern with the national security and market laws constitute a very actual and competitive environment that will conform this accurate and meticulous portrait that describes with dazzling and brutal realism, those multiple linked facets and mirror games where every single movement is like a true chess game. A wrong move is the end of the game.  George Clooney made a very convincing role (I start for notice his magnificent body language such his way of walking), the superb edition process and the synchronized script that seems to behave like a watch mechanism will demand from you all your possible attention.
