 This version is one the purest , lyrics and passionate about the Emperor Concert . This is not merely a simple reacording . It breaths honesty all the way . The orchestra is so well syncronized with solist and conductor that literally is an odyssey for you to get such commitmen in the present times . There is an invisible rapport , a trascendence sense to leave a step , a clear statement which reveals an intends to express something , but the approach you feel is the final result pf a introspective journey in Curzon as pianist and  Knapertsbuch as conductor . This performance is one of the ten best recordings of the Emperor Concert ever made.
