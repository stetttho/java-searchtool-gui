 The great day has come at last. The father celebrates his birthday. A remarkable and unique ocassion to join all the members of the famuily. Lot of laughs and best wishes don't seem anticipate the cloudy and somber atmosphere that sooner than later it will come. The guests are around the table and the celebration speech is supported by the traditional toast.  The elder son will make the speech, and soon a cloudy and painful statements will open the remained secrets through the years. Little secrets that apparently everybody had been forgotten will appear: the Pandora box will be opened and so the cathartic fury will assume the protagonic role: incest, sexual abuse, voyeurism, sadism, cruelty. All the guests on the table simply are surprised and shocked. Every son and daughter will confess these little family secrets, and this dramatic vision will remind us the tragic Antigona chorus. This awful and overwhelming work is one of the best movies made in this new century.  Absolutely neccesary for you to watch.
