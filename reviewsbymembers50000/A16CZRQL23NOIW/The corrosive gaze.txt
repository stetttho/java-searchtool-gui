 There have been many similar movies around this theme (Coming home still remains by far as the unbeatable film about his delicate issue) but what it confers this gripping and awful story that touch of grandness is the merciless, intense and real approach so typical of Oliver Stone.  There are three remarkable aspects that basically, consolidate and reaffirm this movie as the best artistic achievement of Stone; the crudeness and incisiveness of this bitter script; the best performance given by Tom Cruise in his career and the unforgettable devastating images along the film, as that mesmerizing and metaphorical fight on the desert of Cruise and Dafoe.  To my mind I must insist, this is the majuscule achievement in Oliver Stone's career.
