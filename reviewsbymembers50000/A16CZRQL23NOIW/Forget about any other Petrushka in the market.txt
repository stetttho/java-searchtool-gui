 You can try with any other version recorded previous or late respect this one. You won ` t get this sensation of wholeness and plenitude this performance maintains. From its instantaneous release I heard about it since I was a child about its grandness and expressive eloquence . No other version can beat with this one. The London Philharmonic and Ernest Ansermet those days of 12 and 13 Feb. 1946       Forget about it. The jewel of the crown is Petrushka. Don 't waste your time and even money essaying with others.      If I had to cite the four great moments of the brilliant career of this Swiss conductor: this recording, Scherezade - Paris Conservatoire - , The three cornered hat (See my review about it) and Prokoviev ' s Romeo and Juliet.  To your memory, master Ansermet!
