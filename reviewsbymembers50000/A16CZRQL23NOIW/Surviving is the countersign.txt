 Powerful, haunting and bravery portrait in the middle of the WW2, when by those random' s caprices, a Jewish boy and his father are separated, in times of Nazi invasion. This boy will face to face by himself, day by day the horrors of the War under different perspectives. Fortunately his smartness will allow to build an improvised bunker: a desolated wreck that will work out as an attic. The way he builds the stairway and his undeniable love for his pet "Snow" (a sympathetic hamster), and his persuasiveness despite the worse days will earn his own honor 's medal.  A worthy picture that deals a matter depicted many times before, but that nevertheless maintains its own artistic integrity.              Go for this hidden gem and very unknown work.
