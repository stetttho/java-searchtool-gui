 Most of the Brazilian pianists have been colorists. From the times of the monumental Guiomar Novaes, it would seem the soft rapture and the well known sensuality permeate the whole approach. In the case of Roberto Szidon, this statement seems to open parenthesis. His strong sound and digitations looks lie a bit clangorous, but most of the Liszt `s  Hungarian Rhapsodies need it to guarantee this petulant sensation of omnipresence. Just remember Liszt was the embodiment of the thundering sound. Louis Moreau Gotschalk, Sigismund Thalberg and Charles Valentin Alkan follwed similar musical behavior. The piano should be simply a vehicle of expression; the torch for their fireworks.   Those are the main virtues of these piano pieces, loaded with expansive musculature and glittering arpeggios and theatrical sonority. To satisfy the great crowds of the XIX century, the piano had to be hammered to get and obtain the required applauses.  In this sense the Hungarian Rhapsodies established a profile where the incisiveness and exaggeration of the span should substitute the musicality. Rather than a musician you should play the role of a gladiator in scene, a typical device of thelast ashes of the late Romanticism.   Gyrogy Cziffra is possibly the best exponent of this old fashioned tradition, (without forget to Louis Kentner and Edith Franadi) but Szidon constitutes an excellent option for those purists of the great tradition.
