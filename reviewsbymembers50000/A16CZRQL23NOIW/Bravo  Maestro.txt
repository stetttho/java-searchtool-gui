 The admirable artistic level achieved by Casadesus seems to be far to be formally analyzed. Maybe because of he was a XIX player, with kind character, totally focused in his art. His repertoire was extremely reduced, but he possessed an absolute domain of  expression. He will be reminded as one notable pianist by Chopin notable coloring Chopin, his egregious Beethoven First Piano Concerto, his refulgent and crystalline Mozart, Franck 's Variations.   He was specially preferred for conductors as Bernstein, Toscanini, Rodzinki, Mitropulus and Szell, famed conductors with notable stylistic differences between them who felt in Casadesus the aristocratic sound of the piano; an aspect that has been relegated to a third concern in the most of the actual piano players. It would seem the homogeneity must prevail before the singularity, and the technique must be achieved as the maxim priority. If not try to distinguish among two well known piano players (whose names I won' t reveal by obvious reasons) and compare by yourself. This abominable tendency in search of criterion unification has murdered Dionysian aspect over Apollonian, being the music and the new listeners the victims of such narrow vision.
