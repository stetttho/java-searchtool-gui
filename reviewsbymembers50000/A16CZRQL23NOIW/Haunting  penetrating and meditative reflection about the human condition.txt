 Poignant and meditative story about a failed salesman plans to quietly live the last months of his life in a resort. And this unexpected place will ironically become of special significance for all the guests who spent their holydays there.  Alec Guiness is superb in this role. Beatrice Campbell is lovable to watch.  We are expecting its next release on DVD format.
