 First we assist to a verbal confrontation, symptomatic surveillance about the misdemeanors of a rotten class according the view of those maddened women. Her final veredict will become a true bloodshed.  There are similar and related bounds with the servant that famous film of the sixties conducted brilliantly by Joseph Losey. The female owner of a chic gallery decides to hire a passive maid to care for her family and home. Eventually this maid will befriend with a local psycho to develop an obscure conspiracy whose main cause must be searched in ancient memories of the dark past.    Not exactly recommended for squeamish tastes. If you are evolved by Chabrol's  artistic career. You will enjoy it from start to finish. Otherwise you can delight it in smaller sections.
