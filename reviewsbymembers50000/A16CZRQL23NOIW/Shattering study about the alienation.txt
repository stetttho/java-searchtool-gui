 Few films in the story of the cinema can match with this one. Antonioni-the great master of the silences- focuses around the behavior of a lonely and disturbed woman who commences a new sentimental relation with a broker -Alain Delon- after having broken a previous love engagement.  The reading and the final analysis about her loneliness with the huge frame of Rome make of this film one of the most remarkable movies in any age.  Eventually you have to consider to watch the rest of this trylogy composed of The adventure and The night. A giant film!
