 Marie Louise Boehm is a well gifted and renowned pianist to play special composers . In this case he recorded an interesting set: Johann Nepomuk Hummel ' etudes.  There are two special pieces which demand your attention . These are the Etude No. 20 - a real future jump which reminds us even scriabinian moods - and the solemn No. 22 that works out as a special homage to Johann Sebastian Bach .  The rest of the disc shines for the Alkan ' s etudes and piano pieces . The Etude Op. 39 are overwhelming played but with special emphasis in Aesop 's fest , performed with authoritative fierceness and eloquency ; as well as The Funebre March a very introspective piece which exposes clearly the intimate universe of Charles Valentin Alkan .  The rest of the CD is OK for those listeners who are really intereseted in Moscheles and Henselt miniatures that are curious collection items .
