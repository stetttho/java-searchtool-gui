 A tricky bunch organize a swindle which consists in collecting funds of several old ladies to finance a theater play with just one condition: to guarantee them a fabulous participation respect the benefices. They have prematurely assumed the play will be a disaster but the destiny mocks of them.  A lot of a laughs, with Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder in delirious situations. This picture to my mind is by far, the masterpiece of Mel Brooks. It won deservedly the Best Original Screenplay in 1968, becoming instantaneously a cult movie.
