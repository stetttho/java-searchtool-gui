 Moura Castro is a true piano poet. I have been lucky to meet him and even to share an unforgettable ideas exchange thanks to a common friend in Caracas. Moura is not only a sensitive and extraordinarily gifted pianist, but also is a thinker and a great human being. He played for a little audience a Liszt program of almost a hour with interesting musical observations. In this opportunity Moura plays with fascinating rapture the piano music of his fellow Heitor Villalobos.  Villalobos keeps for you admirable and original pages in the pianist literature: Prole de bebe or my favorite piano work; La leyenda de Caboclo (Caboclo's legend) a magnificent and poignant portrait. Go for this album. It will be a rewarding finding.
