 Edward G. Robinson anticipated his trace to the immortality with this overwhelming performance, in this tale of greed, ambition and Shakesperean flavor about an archetypal gangster who comes of a small town along with his cohort and finds in the great city the great opportunity of pushing around with the only purpose to reach the top of the mob. A fabulous sociological portrait about the behavior in the low depths as response to the Depression Era. A outstanding bravura film with seal of immortality.
