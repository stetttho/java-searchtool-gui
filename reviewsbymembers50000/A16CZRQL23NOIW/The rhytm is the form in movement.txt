 Artur Schnabel plays Beethoven keeping in mind this previous staement. The notes he recreates demands a special atention , because he seems to sculpt every phrase , every arpegio in a language which trascends the music itself . He seeks the real and hidden intention behind the score .    The set has however peaks and some lows . Let 's name the peaks : The 1 to 7 , 10 ,17 , 20 , 27 , 28 sonatas , Les adieux have no equals .   You may find an astonishing 27 in Egon Petri version for instance . Forget about the Tempest sonata , Schnabel stole it for himself amd made from its own . The 28 was the first Sonata that I listened with Schnabel in 1970 and I really don ' t know about another performance .    In the last sonatas , I think Schnabel is not in his top form . The 31 Sonata has a performer : Daniel Barenboim in the eighties , the Waldstein Sonata has to me (three unforgettable versions : Frau Carreno (1905) , Ely Ney (1950) and Paul Badura Skoda (1971) ) .    The Hammerklavier finds his ideal performer in Wilhelm Kempff (the fifties mono recordings ).   The 32 and has with Badura Skoda (1973) his esential performer. The Apassionata Badura Skoda (1978) , Barenboim (eighties in a video recording) and Rudolf Serkin fifties.    In the Diabelli I rather prefer the Tatiana Nikolayeva version . And I miss a great reading of the Patethique of Edwin Fisher from the fifties and a superb version of William Murdoch from the thirties.   Solomon gives an interesting Hammerklavier and 30 too .   But this set as a whole is a must for you .
