 The Carpenters constituted a true legend in the universe of the easy listen songs. Every piece was composed with an impeccable diction and notorious musicality, listening them meant the equivalent of being in a musical oasis in the middle of the congested traffic of the second rock generation. I just ask you if (for mere casualty) belong to the new generation, if your parents fell in love thanks to one of the lovable songs of this splendid duo.  The arouse of this duo was in the line of the tradition of Simon and Garefunkel, Sonny and Cher and Zager and Evans (in the year 2525) but with such level expressive and touch of class that hardly will be erased from our musical memories. They inspired other newcomers duos as Hall & Oates or Air Supply, but the achieved stature they reached belongs to the Immortality Pantheon for the new generations of listeners to come, who securely will appreciate and evidence by themselves, the magic and spell of this unforgettable duo whose musical quality and talent does not admit any objection.  On the other hand, the awful early departure of Karen anticipated the legend status for them. Forever Carpenters and whenever she is, will be reminded with the best enthusiasm and joy of living she inspired to all of us who were witness of this golden age in the seventies music.                       Do I need another additional device for persuading you to acquire this CD?
