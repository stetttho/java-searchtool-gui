 According an almost genetic tradition, there has not been any other instrument so closely associated with Jewish musicians. Szigetti, Heifetz, Stern, Menuhin, Morini, Rabin, Gitlis, Perlman, Vengerov and Zukerman among others seem to confirm it. Gideon Kremer virtuosity would seem to run parallel to its humbleness. He is far to be a star of the instrument; he has always known to maintain a low profile, even every time he decides to make a public appearance or to record determined work, it' s an issue of constant attention by many musical followers of his art.          Gidon Kremer made of this special recoding a cult performance in all the sense of the word. His impeccable phrasing and fabulous technique have credited him as one of the most legendary interpreters of this instrument.  Go for this record. It will reward you.
