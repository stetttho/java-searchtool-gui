 Bartok was not only one of the purest and gifted musicians ever born. Despite his music is not easy listening, the enormous sincerity, rapture emotive and eloquent expresiveness catches the most indifferent listener from the same beginning.  So, his musical heritage has no limits. Around him there were musicians of the artistic height of Ferenc Fricsay, Antal Dorati, Sandor Vegh, Gyorgy Sandor, Geza Anda, Annie Fisher, Andras Schiff, Louis Kentner, Joseph Szigetti and obviously Yehudi Menuhin; I mean this special, loyal and profound admiration came from the bottom of the soul in every case.  All of you know the huge love maintained for Dorati about Bartok through his entire life. This CD is an absolute artistic triumph, because it comes far beyond the score: It is not mere casuality that Dorati and Fricsay be the superior names at the moment you made the reduced list of the Giant directors in Bartok's music.   The additional commitment will be immediatly perceived for you from the first bars. You will never have the minimum possibility to loose with Dorati conducting Bartok.  A diamantine record all the way!
