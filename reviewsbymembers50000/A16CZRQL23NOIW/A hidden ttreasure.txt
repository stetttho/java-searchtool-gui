 I just knew about this golden treasure album due a magnificent surprise gift of one beloved and estimated friend, last Saturday. In this work Evans once more exhibits with all his virtues some little and intimate musical gems. Michel Legrand' s What are you doing the rest of your life? is played with such introspective mood as I had never listened never before. Why did I choose you? expresses with meditative and serene calm, a decisive love's homage. Lullaby for Helene and Like someone on love make of this CD an appropriate pretext to listen over and over under the twilight, dawn, proving once more the artistic stature of this everlasting jazz legend.
