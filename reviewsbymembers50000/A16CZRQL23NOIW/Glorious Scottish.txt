 Peter Maag was a superb conductor who pitifully has been forgotten for a remarkable audience. His sumptuous and noble style, the perfect articulation of the harmonic languages, color tonal, mercurial lyricism and adequate melodic balance, fit out to play Mendelssohn a colorist composer.

The certain is that this Symphony remains not only as one of the most expansive and delirious Symphonic works ever written. Mendelssohn 's muse reached a peak hard to climb even by himself. We would have to wait for the Fifth Symphony to enjoy such enraptured inspiration and magic spell.   I have to remark that version is after the unbeatable Munch 's Boston Symphony, the most expressive and eloquent version that I have listened.
