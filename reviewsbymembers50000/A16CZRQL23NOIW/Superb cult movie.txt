  This film consolidated in all the world to Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Even he had a huge number of avid viewers who knew about him by other titles. This picture became the First German Film really commercial all over the world. Hanna Schygulla shone as a real Super Nova with this complex , intelligent and crude tale.   Fassbinder interweaved a web which linked almost fifteen years of live story through the eyes of a loyal woman whom suddenly after she marries, his husband is requested to participate in the War. From that day she will wait for him, day after day until she decides to make a breakthrough with the life when the hunger and the misery slowly will surround her whole family.   The rest of the story runs for you. Magnificent script, an anthological ending who still is shocking.  Indeed this was film of the famous Trilogy with Lola and Veronika Voss.  The sudden death of Fassbinder in 1982, left the German Cinema literally orphan and his place still keeps empty.     The marriage that only elapsed a day and all night long.
