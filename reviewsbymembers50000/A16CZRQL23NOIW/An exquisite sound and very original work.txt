 Wisbone Ash was an innovative band . In those times they developed , an specific sound based fundamental in the harmonic richness of the guitar seeking more the effects as a whole instead of just a beating sound . So they were never reached the pop category , but belonged to a very reduced elite . My favorite theme is the King will come , this theme is full of surprises for you , his medieval touch instantaneously carries us to King Arthur ages . Time was might be well the most known pice for the great audience but it sounds OK , even thirty two years after. Sometimes world is terrific , and the sweet ballad leaf and stream . But consider the bonus of Phoenix the most formidable of his career and here you have the perfect CD of a glorious band .
