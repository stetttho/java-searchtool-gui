 It results very difficult and many times useless to pretend entitle to Spheeris as New Age musician. In particular I disagree with this appreciation. Chris revives with a great doses of musicality, instrumentation and careful brightness the hidden melodies of the Arabian and Spanish cultures, going always toward the roots.  In this case Arabian rhythms are renovated with elegance and innovativeness. But a warning must be done: where do the Arabian moods finish and in the meantime the Spanish music reborn? Spheeris knew blend both rhythms with extraordinary easiness, fruit of his admirable talent. Dancing with the muse is the happy melting of these two cultures joined by a history of seven centuries.  Magaya is to my mind the perfect sample about how you can mold and recreate with astonishing presence the millenary Arabian dances employing an evident resources economy.   You will be pleasantly surprised, listening this curious work.
