 A weak man; a strong character, compulsive and dominant father; where the ethic imposition works out much more as a power delirium that a simple duty supports this interesting script. The story suggests throughout the therapist guide, the troubled mind of this simple man molded and castrated from his early childhood (Remember Peeping  Tom?) adopting serous twisted behavior patterns divorced from the conventional social norms. Well built Noir film with the wonderful performances of William Macy and Donald Shuterland: A must for you to see it.!
