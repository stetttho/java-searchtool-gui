 Frankie was sociologically the man who fought against all the odds and obstacles , he overpassed them and won. He acquired the status of living legend just because he knew engage all a whole generation of people , he din't only sing to the golden age , but he took the place of Bing Crosby and made the arrangements to be in the fashion mood with the post war generation. His velvet , expressive an eloquent voice he added his presence in the screen (From here to the eternity , the man with the golden arm ,Manchurian candidate Von Ryan's express) and showed also his skills as actor. To talk about all the innovative devices that Frankie made in the artistic world would overcome that brief review. These Capitol years defined a style and melted to that golden generation of crooners as Nat King Cole, Bobby Darin , Dean Martin, Tony Bennet, to name the most remarkable. He survived to the rock new sound and he knew how to keep the link with a main social target without sacrifice any particle of his craft.  Frankie was a powerful influence for the sixties generation , think in Tom Jones for instance or Engelbert Humperdinck. I would need a book to talk about the huge influence that even still Sinatra is making now, in this age. Acquire this set and don't forget that Frankie was also a blessed guy . He married with Ava Gardner ,a cosmic beauty. And above all think in this point , the portrait made for Mario Puzzo in the Godfather was meangliness due the myth was built!.
