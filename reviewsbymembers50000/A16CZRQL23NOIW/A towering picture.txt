 The outstanding stature of this film makes of this work one of the top twenty best of the Decade.   Fred Zinnemann (High Noon, From here to the eternity, The sundowners and The Day of the Jackal) once more, proved by far his impressive domain in this field. Based on Robert Bolt 's play about Sir Thomas Moore 's personal conflict when King Henry VIII ask his opinion and support in break with Pope and the eventual consolidation of Church of England.   Consider this cast : Paul Scofield,Wendy Hiller, Orson Welles, Nigel Davenport, John Hurt, Susanah York, Robert Shaw and Vanessa Redgrave.  Six Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor, Director, Screenplay to Bolt (Lawrence of Arabia),cinematography and Costumes.   Do you think it 's possible to imagine nowadays such status level? Maybe, and making an imagination exercise: Joseph Fiennes, Jessic Lange, Anthony Hopkins, Robert Duvall, Harvey Keitel, James Woods, Audrey Tautoo and Kristyn Scott Thomas and Director I would bet for Anthony Minghella.        A film of films.
