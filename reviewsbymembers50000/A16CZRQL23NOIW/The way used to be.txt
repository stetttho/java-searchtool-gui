 Sharon Stone ignited the screen with her sidereal, enigmatic and alluring beauty that constituted the dorsal spine of a film sumptuously produced, brilliantly illuminated that would seem to oscillate between the Noir Film and an existential erotic thriller.  The sexual ambiguities of this female writer and the hot scenes nevertheless, do not guarantee a total and happy journey. The script has many holes and the mistaken director acting on Michael Douglas would constitute for him the image of the disturbed and harassed man in future films of doubtful quality.  The serious problem that I have with this film is the lack of profundity, once you have decided to face such attractive and fascinating breach. It would seem the hidden dragons of the script would have clashed against the invisible walls of the Puritanism , becoming in a true dilemma that will lead us to an awful anticlimax. Once you open the gate, prepare the torch and get inside this hell assuming the consequences and extract major implications than a simple and pleasant Video clip of long duration  but please, don' t pretend to make an erotic fable with the only purpose to convince us about the undeniable attractive of Sharon Stone. All of us are more than convinced about it.  Two other films have walked the same footpath: 9  weeks and Indecent proposal. Both films can not transcend the superficiality and the trivial anecdote.  If you required me about other similar films that bet hard an won, I would name two remarkable ones. In 1985 Nicholas Roeg directed an outstanding film: Bad timing, that explores the sinister labyrinths around a non conventional love affair with deep implications. On the other hand, it is good to appoint Robert van Ackeren directed in 1984 a -pitifully- a not so well known film of nocturnal beauty and enraptured violence: The woman in flames with the exuberant Gudrun Langrebe.   Here you have two striking  examples about what I mean.
