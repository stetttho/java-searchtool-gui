 Akira Kurosawa was one the supreme masters of the cinema . In his craft the story emerges and converges in a real complex web of emotive relations , acquiring a story - no matter how simple is- a special status . That Midas touch makes the difference between Kurosawa and the rest . It is a wedding party of formal rite and suddenly is perturbed by murder accusation , suspects of opportunism by part of the fiance and a policial arrest .In the other hand a young executive wins the trust of a great industrial magnate , becomes literally in his right arm and marries with his faughter . Really the father of that man has been murdered by the magnate and his hencmen, and have not any kind of trouble with their methods of enriching without a little drop of scruple . So the initial motive of the hero is simple revenge , though his young wife inspires him a deep tenderness . Acquire this magnificent film of A.K.
