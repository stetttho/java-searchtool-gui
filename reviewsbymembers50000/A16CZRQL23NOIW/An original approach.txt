 Shakespeare and Beethoven are two powerful examples that show that no matter you face his work, even how terrible you play his message they resist as a big tree any intention, they simply are far beyond the present circumstance, they talk to the best of ourselves and the power of synthesis and strong conviction make them indestructible. Glenn Gould's approach is an irreverent reading, trying to diminish the epic in some Sonatas and emphasizing the grief and passion. That's why the whole sum can produce great positive surprises but also terrible disappointments. For instance I love his version of the Op. 49, The Adieux, The Funeral March, Second, third and Seventh Sonatas, and even the Moonlight, the Tempest and the op. 110, because somehow this last Sonata reflects more than any other else the intimate universe of  Mr.Gould. I mean, do not expect glorious results from the Waldstein or Hamerklavier. I know Gould to guess he could do a best performance but simply didn ` t because his intention was clearly to refuse the argument lines and the historicity. I agree totally with him in what concerns with the absence of any Romantic approach with Beethoven, and in this sense he triumphs in several works due the true Beethovenian dissonances must sound hard, bitter and wild.
