 Yehudi Menuhin has been the violinist with major sense of the refined playing. Somehow he represented the Renaissance 's artist. His serene temperament and sensitivity allowed him to play under the composer 's intentions and director as any other artist in the music. That excel virtue by itself is what it proves his fabulous readings of Bela Bartok under Dorati or his aristocratic Brahms under Wilhelm Frtwangler, for instance. Maybe his major achievements be found out in the chamber music or intimate violin works such as The Mozart 's Violin Concertos or his memorable performances as director of the Bath 's  Festival' s  Orchestra.        The sumptuous, elegant and convincing  phrasing of Yehudi Menuhin reached in this recording a particular apex. The artist is in top musical shape; Bach 's  First and Second Violin Concertos are played under his teacher and close friend Georges Enesco; the First Concerto is played with admirable sense of noblesse. The Second one is widely known and the delicate performance is hued by notable details of modulation, the velvet tune and the accurate approach make of this recording a fundamental achievement in the career of this master.  Additionally we have Bach 's  Double Concerto played by Enesco and Menuhin; a recording that by itself justifies the acquisition of this album.      The only serious problem resides in his Chaconne `s performance. Extremely stylized, played with excessive romantic approach and without ambition.        The absolute peak of his performances may be admired during his multiple appearances in Prades Festival, and once again the figure of Pau Casals as this untiring musical motivational spark plug that seemed to elevate the rank of performance of every one of his partners; this fact can be visibly observed since 1959 until the middle sixties.    An album of transcendent musical relevance for the actual generations and the musical newcomers of the present and the future.
