 The particular greatness of the giant directors consists to introduce the viewer through a so well known argument loaded with artistic personality and vibrant drama. And Louis Malle as you know, was one the most surpassing directors of his generation. He never lost that artistic integrity as few directors are able to maintain. His intimate approach, raving luxury and existential anguish for living the moment without caring the consequences was told in such efficient way that captivated even the most exigent viewer. The splendid cast: Juliette Binoche as La Femme Fatale, Miranda Richardson as the cheated wife and finally that colossal actor Jeremy Irons that shone with special brightness in the best role he plays: decadent and obsessive: There was nobody like him in 1993, that's why the election was simply perfect and allowed to lead this picture to a very special place at the moment of making an account of the twenty best films in that year. I just can feel how his film not only improves with ages but besides, it has reached a cult status.
