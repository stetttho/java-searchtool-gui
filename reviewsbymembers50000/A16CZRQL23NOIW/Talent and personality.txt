 Murray Perahia together with Van Cliburn may be well considered as the most remarkable exponents of talented generation of named American pianists who blossomed after the WW2, who knew to express with total naturalness and absolute spontaneity the Romantic accords. As you know the technical equipment was perhaps the main virtue, inculcated in his professional career. Toscanini in the orchestral conduction (without forget to Reiner), Heifetz in violin and Horowitz in the piano  were the supreme musical Gods  and became the last peak, the supreme perfection. If you notice for instance, the visible discontent of Toscanini at the moment to conduct the Adagios, you will agree the terrible and distorted vision that generated in most of musicians in progress. Stravinsky, Prokoviev and Bartok were much more closer for this young generation than Brahms or Beethoven. An impressive cloud of competitiveness surrounded all the possible spaces. From U.R.S.S. came Emil Gilels in the Fifties, a formidable artists but also a cold and analytical pianist, which accented still more this fashion tendency; and those European artists who seemed to be linked interms of the old fashion to play, were not precisely the main guests. And if you consider the fact that Van Cliburn has won the prestigious Tchaikovsky Festival in the extinct U.R.S.S. with that battle horse concert, the idea strengthened even more in the spirit and motivational approaches.  Of course there notable exceptions to rule as Earl Wild,  Tureck, Kapell and the frist stage of Watts, but somehow they were in opposite flow. In this sense the merit of Murray Perahia is double, in this sense. He kept and nourished the Romantic tradition, till the time came for him to revitalize in the late Sixties, where the new tendencies were much more open minded.    And with retirement of Van Cliburn at the middle Seventies from musical stages, Perahia and Wild remained as the last survivors of this tradition: Micahel Ponti decided to live in Europe and Raymond Lewenthal chose Paris after that painful incident with sa smuggler in Central Park.        That is among other virtues fundamental reasons to acquire this album. Perahia breathes and transmits that warmth in every one of his multiple records.
