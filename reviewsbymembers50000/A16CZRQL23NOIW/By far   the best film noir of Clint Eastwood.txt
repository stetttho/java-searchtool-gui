 Fantastic film ; memticulous and carefully built ,loaded of the highest suspense you may expect . In this clever film noir , Eastwood is an outsider . He is not a detective , but a jewel thief who watchs something he never had to see . This brutal murderer will reach the highest governement levels in which a very well planned chase will be made behind the traces of Eastwood . A great script . Hackman is absolute convincing in the best role which he has represented more than any one else ; the immoral, corrupt , decadent and perverse villain . Intelligent puzzle and artistic film prove once more than industry and craft may join . One of the best films in his career .
