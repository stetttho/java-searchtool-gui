 Samson Francois was one of the most talented and high gifted pianists of his generation . He was a self convinced and deeply honest artist . He will never give you a trivial performing .  This set is admirable . The Waltzes are superb , specially the Valse op. 64 No. 2 , The Brilliant Waltz and the minute Waltz .  His arpegios are composed of a perfect balance between intelect and emotion involved by a wisdom and irreverent vision ; his powerful articulation , his deep commitment and the eloquent expressiveness are some of his most remarkable virtues. The ballads are splendid . The second and third are unique ; the first has better versions in the market (Michelangeli of the fifties in Praga live concert) , Teresa Carreo and William Kapell (1952) in a weird live performing. The fourth ballade is of Casadesus ; he is a winner . The Impromptus are really interesting ; because Francois literally enriches them and reveals some unknown and unthinkable aspects of its inner values . Usually these are pages of neglected and unfair considerations for the most of the pianists . The Op. 66 is the most famous , but there is not a special interest for playing them for the najorityof the players. Wonderful artist and unforgettable performings .
