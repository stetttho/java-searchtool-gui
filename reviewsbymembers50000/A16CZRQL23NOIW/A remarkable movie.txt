 Originality is the supreme adjective for this picture. It won deservedly the Academy Award as Original script. Ridley Scott made an authentical road movie but loaded with humor , cynicism , haunting and above all very anti macho movie. The sinister fact that will turn a twist of fate in these two women who only wanted to have fun just for a while will become in a permanent and menacing nightmare for both of them . The spectacular landscapes are a huge background all the way reminds us Paris Texas . The use of big lenses and the arresting images walks together with a solid script .  Brad Pitt appears briefly as the hitch hike guy who eventually seduces Thelma . Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are the mirror images of Sundance Kid , you may consider it a speculation, but think it carefully . Since the accidental murder , and the sweet smell of the risk when Geena robes a supermarket , the dramatic car chase is very close in spirit to the sudamerican getaway and above all the ending sequence .  Keitel works efficiently , once more and Scott shows us once more why he's on the top direction . Consider this one from its release as one of the most powerful nineties cult movies!
