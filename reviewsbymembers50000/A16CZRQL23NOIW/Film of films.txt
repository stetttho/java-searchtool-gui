 This Giant and milestone film is a fundamental issue in your collection for several reasons. The first one is Robert Rosen his director. Rosen comes from the own roots of the Film Noir and impressed this movie with this slender touch. Second: the admirable script with abundant material, discursive and metaphoric, supported by exceptional sequences and smart dialogues; and third, the towering performance of Paul Newman, who made to my mind his crowned acting ever.   Dynamic, mercurial and solid film that has deserved an important place among the most important American Films in the last Century . As you know, Scorsese would make a notable remake with Tom Cruise as star, in The Color of Money
