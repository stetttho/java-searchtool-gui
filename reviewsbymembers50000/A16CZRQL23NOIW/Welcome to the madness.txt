  When the time comes for you and personally decide to make a list of the most remarkable films in any age it' s impossible not including this cult movie. This is a tour de force film; complex and provided of multiple angles. A fascinating horror tale with an obsessed boy and his strange object of affection. The doctor will be involved at such level that... Well the rest runs for you.   Go for this adult drama and enjoy once more a superb performing of Richard Burton another actor who never won an Academy Award (incredible don't you?) and the supreme direction of this well deserved awarded in the recent entry: Sidney Lumet.
