 In this formidable album you will realize Artur Grumiaux is in top form. His lyricism and expressiveness is quite evident since the first bar you listened. He possessed that admirable and inimitable phrasing, supported by the most fervent passion and commitment.  This is a fundamental and excellent selection of his interpretative art. His Lekeu and Debussy violin Sonata do not know about rivals, even the elapsed time. I miss the exclusion of his Hendel works Op. 1 and several violin Sonatas of Mozart (specially the K. 376), but this artistic document well deserves its immediate acquisition.     Grumiaux was -undeniably- the best Belgium violinist after Ysaye, and one of the eternal icons of this instrument.
