 This film is simply perfect . The script works out as real watch mechanism . You do not a find just a single hole in its dramatic structure . The overlapping of both situations linked for that twist of fate will allow to follow a plot loaded with tension and interest . The office boy is so engaged with the charm of this diva , that will allow him to surpass his own possibilities and trascend suddenly .  The minimalist oriental female , the dark side of those misfits make of that film literally unique in its style . Beineix made his great contribution to the universal cinema that demonstrates us once more the no ending premise about art and entertainment. He made a glorious work without restrictions in its artistic proposal. Brilliant and unforgettable film.
