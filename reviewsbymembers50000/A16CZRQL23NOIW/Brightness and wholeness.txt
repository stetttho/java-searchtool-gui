 The first musical stage of this consummated genius of the guitar finds him accompanied by two monsters musicians: Jacob Pastorius a true master in the electric bass and the talented drummer: Bob Moses.  You will find in this CD an authentic kaleidoscope of images, landscapes and living memories.  This inspired work still remains among my favorite works of this brilliant and amazing artist.  It is literally impossible for you to affirm there is a weak track.   Absolutely recommended.
