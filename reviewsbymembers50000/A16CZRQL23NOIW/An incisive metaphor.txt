 This is one of my most admired films of the Thirties. Even if it may result stagy for the new generation of viewers, the picture deals with the ironical survival in the civilized world. A gangster -a solid performance of the raising promise actor, Humphrey Bogart, holds captive to several personages in a restaurant, until the expected ending.   The dreamy atmosphere will engage you from start to finish. And once you have been watching think it over and examine certain similar items respect John Ford 's stagecoach. It may result a very interesting and stimulating exercise, around the human behavior..
