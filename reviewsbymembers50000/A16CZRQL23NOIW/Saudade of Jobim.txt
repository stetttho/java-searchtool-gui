 This Brazilian term: Saudade de voc express the perfect blend of nostalgia, fondles and sympathy that we can feel for a friend who visits us and then he must leave. Just before he leaves, you can say it without blush. In this sense it seemed to me to express all this emotional feeling that Antonio Carlos Jobim meant and still in the heart, soul and spirit of the whole world, because his name transcended all the idiomatic barriers. Jobim allows us to visualize and experience the vision of that kaleidoscopic country sunk in eternal spring with its well know Carnival and tempting landscapes.        This album is true collection treasure. It is played with that vital enthusiasm you can feel it from the first bars of any track you choose.   Zimbo Trio has been one the most exciting and fabulous Brazilian ensembles ever. And their Bossa Nova style permeates from start to finish this gorgeous album. It 's absolutely enlivened, inspiring and superbly well played.   The musical journey is besides a magnificent guide to appreciate still more, the poetry of this notable composer, of pleasant and continuous remembrance.   You  will always be rewarded in case you make the decision to acquire it. And once you have got it it almost secure you will search for more of this legendary trio.
