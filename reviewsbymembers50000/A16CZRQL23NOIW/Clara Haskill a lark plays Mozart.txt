 I never will tire to remark the prodigious hands of this sublime pianist . Clara Haskill was one of the most illustrious artists who played an inimitable Mozart. Her sound was simple exquisite without losing profundity; expressive but without affection; elegancy and lyricism; her spirit `s purity illuminated her the way to offer us an always fresh and renovated Amadeus.  As you know, Charles Munch was a very sensititve conductor, and this succesful combination gave as result one of the most mesmerizing versions ever made previous or recently.  Her Chopin is illuminated and very charm. Nevertheless, I have a first choice, Samson Francois.   It was not any casualty 's product she would have been an eternal guest to Prades. Go for this alum. It is a must-buy.
