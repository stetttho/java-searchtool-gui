 Roger Williams has been called Mr. Piano. For all those (I am among included) who grew and grew up in our first childhood steps throughout his easy listening music, still have an eternal debt of infinite gratitude for this charismatic and enthusiast artist, who really immortalized pieces such as Autumn leaves, Strangers in the night, Crying in the chapel, Misty, Till, New York New York, Maria, Evergreen and so many others songs that now belong to legend status.   So if you belong to the new generation (born in the Eighties or Nineties), it would be advisable to get close to this magic universe of this legendary pianist.
