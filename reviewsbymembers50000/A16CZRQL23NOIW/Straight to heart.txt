 Two brothers are sent to a children 's home, due her nasty mother supports her life thanks to the earnings of her own daughter 's services as prostitute since she was nine years old. An officer, (who is even  single)  gifted with opened heart will experience a true transformation along the trip from Milan to Sicily; and knowing the painful future that waits fir them opens his heart and shows them those little pleasures, the human warmth, love and affective candor they deserved by far, after such miserable childhood.   A brutal portrait, a true accusing finger to some social stratums who still do not seem to realize the perennial wound they are sealing in the souls of their children.   Watching this movie, you can feel the childhood ` s sorrowful scream coming from distant films such as Zero in conduct,  Germany year zero, Forbidden games, Ivan 's childhood,  400 blows, Kolya or Central Station has not concluded yet . There is still a cruel and merciless ethical deficit in the soul of certain human beings, whose designation by itself is quite doubtful.   A haunting and absorbing picture, told with the possible austerity but loaded of profound painful and redemption 's sense.               And remember the last dialogue of the child: "Maybe there is a Foot ball Stadium in our new home"  It is still unbelievable after so many elapsed years I am the first person to recommend one of the Fifty jeweled films of the Decade and worst even, this gem has not been released in DVD format yet.
