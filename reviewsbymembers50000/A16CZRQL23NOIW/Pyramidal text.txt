   There are many who assume mistakenly the abstraction and complex language with the deep knowledge: wrong choice. The wisdom -such as the true beauty-does without any additional ornamentation. As the various fields of engineering become better understood , the differences between the multiple web of disciplines diminish.   This book contains that implicit merit: it is too far from pretending a complex analysis about this outstanding issue as the mass transfer is. It presents with pristine clarity and transparence through all its chapters an approach to solve and above all to understand with global vision the several facets of the Mass Transfer Phenomena, supported by invaluable diagrams, charts and properties, hardly available in just one book. I must recognize personally the profound help and support during my student years. Even in my University labor it continues teaching me, as a fellow friend.
