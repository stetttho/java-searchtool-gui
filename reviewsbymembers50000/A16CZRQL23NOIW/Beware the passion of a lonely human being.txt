 Ruth Ellis is a gentle waiter . She has a son and lives for him and his welfare . But soon she will meet David; a man who will become her only subject of desire and illusion . And David is just a gigolo without any future . He lives as many people does ; just waiting for the fridayness and have a great fun .  But this encounter with Ruth will arise a opposite passion totally unknown . He will be to her the object of desire but besides of pain and sorrow ; he punishes her and this behavior gradually will carry to the expected ending : this murder became the last execution in the England fifties. Miranda Richardson has been a very beautiful woman and also a very gifted actress , she has expressive force and presence on the screen. Ruppert Everett plays David in a very credible role . This film may be well be considered the best british film noir of the eighties . Extraordinary!
