 A letter is addressed to three wives saying that she has run off with one of her three husbands but anyone of them knows nothing . Through clever flash backs the viewer will be shown  three stories that tell why each of the women' s  husbands might have left her . Superb acting of the entire cast . Watch for Thelma Ritter one of my greatest female icons in the forties and fifties .
