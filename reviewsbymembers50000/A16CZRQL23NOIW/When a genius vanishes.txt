 When the whole historic reconstruction be made, surely the Fifties decade became in the most tragic of all: William Kapell, Michael Rabin, Dennis Brain, Dinu Lipatti, Guido Cantelli and Ginette Neveu who having dead in 1949 , may be included if I may, to remark the fact that any one of them surpassed the thirty six: Kapell(31), Brain (26), Cantelli (36), Lipatti (33),  Neveu (30) and Rabin (36). The no sense loss of Guido Cantelli just in his thirty six years meant a big void in the story of his art. Just think in the fact he was designated La Scala's first ever Permanent Conductor (not even Toscanini or De Sabata held that title officially) . Cantelli possessed that genius touch when you listen carefully any of his achievements. Somehow he signified the emerging  and promising generation of talented conductors. If you think that Sviatoslav Richter commenced his career at thirty three you will imagine that Cantelli just begun his career. He was permeated by the innate musicality of the Italians. And despite he was a protge of Toscanini his musical skills and numerous gifts were undeniable. A sumptuous style, his haydn was so convincing and elegant, his Frank `s Symphony in D was so far from being a tedious reading that frequently is given for the most of conductors. Two young promises of the baton : Ferenc Fricsay and Cantelli reached the height of unobstructed communion with Ludwig van Beethoven. But at least Fricsay (who died at a very young age too (49)) had the chance and the lucky to record a major repertoire. I am not absolutely convinced that the art of Cantelli has been enough valuated in its totality.  My dear reader, every time you have the chance to acquire any of the recording sessions of this brilliant and prodigious musician, don't ever doubt and do it. You will find the genius rapture since the first bars.
