 It' s a pity Tchaikovsky ' s piano music be so neglected and dismissed. Let' s admit the deepness in not precisely one of its attributes, but maybe you know unknown aspects of the hidden side of this "Symphonic" composer.  The discrete charm and intimate character of his piano works have never shown with such commitment previous or lately. Richter played these works in 1983, when he was in his 68. It would seem Richter had a personal debt with Piotr.  The case is Richter once more was in mood and the result was the best recording that i have ever listened of these selections. The Humoresque in G major Op. 9 No. 5, Chanson triste, Op. 40 No.8, Romance in F minor Op. 5 and June are specially the highlights of this rewarding CD.  Richter played in his forties the Sonata Op. 80 with superb results.
