  I guess it would not be exaggerate to state with this film Sean Connery made the great step to the acting world out of his famous role of James Bond. Tippi Hedren was a very talented actress widely known in the Birds previously. Beside all his inner virtues Hitchcock was gifted of that peeping touch and despite this he had a great number of options , he chose this risky movement with a raising actor , seeking perhaps not disturbing the audience with the cast but the plot by itself.  This film is the hallucinating portrait of a very disturbed woman who suffered a serious breakthrough in her early years that eventually never could be overcome. For many viewers this film is the last important film made for Alfred before the slow decadence of his missed expressive punch. Frenzy is a minor film compared with this one, for instance.  This is a great opportunity to enjoy one of the most treasure works of the Suspense Master. Don't miss it.
