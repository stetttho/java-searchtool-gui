 Wolfang Petersen may be proud for all the eternity by this achievement. This film (just ten millions dollars in 1981)is a superb film. You know so well when youre in front a masterpiece. That sensation which remains in your mind and your soul , a must reference and above all, it becomes an unforgettable memory in your brain. The film is full of tension; claustrophobic, dramatic and powerfully haunting. The sequences of action are very well made; the script is very related to the book.The cast is outstanding. The handle of camera is BREATHTAKING, the camera is a sliding eye, nervous, it retains the anguish, the hopeless and that deathly taste you feel when you share the destiny of these man under that huge water pressure. That film broke the walls of the standard market and soon became from 1982 in a classic film. The question about if this film is anti war film is out of discussion. I dont think even if this issue is important. You must feel the evil experience of these men sent to a almost safe death in a sea surrounded by enemies forces. Watch this movie.  And youll understand why U-571 even his special effects is just a worthy tribute to Das Boot, the masterpiece of Wolfang Petersen.
