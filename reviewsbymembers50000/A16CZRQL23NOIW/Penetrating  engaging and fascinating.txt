 The vision of fullness given by this master of the Japanese Cinema Shohei Imamura around this complex and extraordinary film loaded of visible black humor, hot eroticism. A dynamic artwork with an admirable focus around the violence loaded with eloquent showiness and flaming beauty.  Imamura is one of the greatest if not the major Japanese filmmaker of his generation.   A stunning masterpiece.
