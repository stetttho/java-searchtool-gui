 Ormandy had a special affection with Shostakovich symphonies . Watch for instance , the Fourth and the Tenth symphonies . The fourth is the best of the market by far and the tenth is just behind the colossal and unbeatable perfromance of Mitropoulus . In this case this symphony is a special rendition to Wagner music . The specila rendez vous about the Ring could suggest the fall of the Soviets Gods . Pitifully Shostakovich could not see the end of the Empire , but he had this suspicion . You know the artists have that special sense far beyond the common people calls the sixth senes . i wolud define it as a hypersensibility deeply inmersed in the mind and the soul of this prodigious musician . Ormandy plays this symphony with noblesse and very well dosified rage . and the strings of the Philadelphia are as you know the most powerful in all the universe of the american orchestras . The Second Sonata is deeply introspective , meditative and very touching . This work has been unfairly neglected for the most of the keyboardists . It is a litle jewel . Shostakovich had always something to say about all in his camera works . Notice the Sonata for Cello , the astonishing piano quintet or his string quartets , a micro universe in themselves .  Excellent performance of Gilels in this piano work .
