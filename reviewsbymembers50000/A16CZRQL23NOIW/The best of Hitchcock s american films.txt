 One remarkable, bizarre and malicious thriller suspense, this script reminds us that sometimes the guilty are innocent and the innocent are guilty, is characteristically noir, but more specifically Hitchcock's world, a world in which no one, it seems can escape blame - not even the audience. (Remember another film of A.H. that deals with a similar question , the underrated but admirable "The wrong man", possibly the darkest film of this film maker). And that's one one of the many virtues of A.H. as director. Since the beginning , (you know  as well like me), that the champion tennis Guy (another Hitchcok's irony) Haines  is not a model of virtue (The same occurs with another two films, like Grace Kelly in Dial M for Murder , and Janet Leigh in Psycho; both of them commit adultery and Leigh also is a thief) and Bruno who's just very clear about his human condition and seems not having problem with that (in a stunning performance of Robert Walker; maybe the best of his career) , like a devil's messenger , proposes an unusual arrangement: a criss cross murders. Obviously, the villain materializes his part in the arrangement (giving his gentleman's word) (another thrown glow to audience from Hitchcock) , but our inmature Guy seems to get on the line with the ethics?, less by conviction than by fear (another Hitchcock's cynical rapture). Watch this film. Since I did it (in 1972) I was sure this picture was among the five best   of him and it made me glad to know that the well known video guide entitled Facets stated that Strangers for their criterion, was the best film of that year, evem above "From here to the eternity". A syncronization or a happy coincidence? Remade as "Once you kiss a stranger" and clear inspiration for Danny de Vito in "Throw moma from the train". Remember: the DVD contains two versions ; the american and the english; I'd rather the last one.
