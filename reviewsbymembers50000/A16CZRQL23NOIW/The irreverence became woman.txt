 Jane Birkin was the French response to Jane Fonda in North America. She was not only the legitimate of the cat woman Brigitte Bardot but besides her undeniable talent allowed to make the incursion on the screen. Her voice of a never grown up teenager and her ineffable sex appeal allowed us to know about her with that never out fashioned song : Je T'aime...  Moi Non Plu with Serge Gainsbourg.  Go for this French icon.
