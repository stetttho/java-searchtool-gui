 Lorber is an incredible gifted musician . In this album he shows the  wide scope he owns around works as Wavelength , Yellowstone , Do what it takes the amazing piece Worth waiting for and the exquisite piece Columbus Ave. which may be the crown jewel of the album . But quite beyond the all the considerations this album is in the list of the ten best of 1993 all the way . You will feel infinitely good with this inspired work .
