 The Song of the Earth is one of the supreme wasteland works and incisive symphonies of Mahler . There is a clear conncetion between this work and Verklaerte nacht of Schoenberg . Scherchen was a champion conductor in Mahler and in this case he made his most inspired performing in any other G.M. work. Admirable rendition . If you get Horenstein seventh ; you do not need any more .
