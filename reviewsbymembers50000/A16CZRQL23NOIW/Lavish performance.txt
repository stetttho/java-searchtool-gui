 Rachmaninoff  Yuri Temirkanov elevated the rank of this work to unexpected levels. He loves plainly adores this Symphony. He is to my mind one of the most remarkable and interesting conductors in the world. In this case his approach with the Orchestra confirms his filigree work , he confers it, the nasality so characteristic of the Russian Orchestras and also handles the rubato, retards, brass vibrato and violin portamento with admirable skillfulness and the resolution it can not be better done. He got a richness and voluptuous sound with melodic fluency and passionate expression , specially in this beloved Third Movement, so typically orthodox in the Russian meaning.  I remind a smart marginal note of Glenn Gould when he remarked the enormous specific weight of the religious feature in the Russian music. And this is carved in relief so painstakingly by Yuri to indicate the listener there is much more in this Adagio than simple and reminiscent lyric song. There's nostalgia and according Tarkovsky in Russian feeling this word goes far beyond respect to our understanding. It's associated above all to the huge affection by the birth land , the human condition, the sublime landscapes and the ineffable water in all its possible states.   But Temirkanov also accents the hedonistic lan without overlooking the Caucasian wildness. If you are searching the most complete performance, go for this record. Eugene Ormandy, Walter Weller, Kurt Sanderling and Edo de Waart may be honorable options but  this will be your nonesuch choice.
