 Sigfried Behrend is a remarkable guitarist. He possesses a very clean phrasing, notable fingering and engaging tune. His version about Aranjuez Concerto is one of the most honest and captivating that I have ever heard.   On the other hand, we have to Nicanor Zabaleta, undeniably, the most prominent harpist of the last Century.  Recommended without reserves.
