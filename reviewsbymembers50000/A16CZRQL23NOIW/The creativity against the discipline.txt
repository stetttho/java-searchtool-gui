  Once more Apollo and Dionysus face one each other. Apollo is the supreme master of the rules, the establishment, a fervent follower of the pre established codes. Dionysus is an outlaw, he simply fights for its aim and no matter how he will follow his instincts.  Apollo means the experience the hidden wisdom beyond the scares and wrinkles. Dionysus is the youth who in its own rapture thinks to itself it is eternal, it is the innocence captivated by its goals, no reflection just action. The heroes are essentially sculpted by Dionysian. And that explains his presence in the Earth is so brief. They don't know the fear and his life is just a play.  The prudence doesn't exist in his particular dictionary and even in his thinking.  Think in Siegfried ` s the hero per excellence in Wagner's Ring.      The real confrontation is exhibited out of the battle field when the Sharks ` team has lost four games in a row, and Cap, one of the artifice player is seriously wounded in the Third game.      "In this game you have got to be about some more than win", says Tony D' Amato to the raising young promise of the Sharks, Beahme. And the insights about this hard sport are treated with that vertiginous rhythm so typical of Stone. The medical ethic is carved in relief between a brief but intense dialogue between Mathew Modine and James Woods.  The film is a real punch who goes far beyond the simple entertainment for teenagers, surpassing the anecdote to become in a real cult movie of recent times.  The mesmerizing performance of Jammie Fox proved his recent Award was not a mere product of the coincidence. Dennis Quaid is perfect as Cap and Cameron Diaz is simply arresting as the one sight heiress and widow of this team, legacy of her father.  May be there awesome scenes that can wound your susceptibility, but this is one the fundamental characteristics of the artistic personality of Oliver Stone.
