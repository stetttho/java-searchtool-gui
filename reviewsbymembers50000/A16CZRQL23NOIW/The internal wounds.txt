  A young soldier is seriously wound in the War. He will be sent to a hospital to treat his facial damage. The slow and painful process of  physical, mental and spiritual reconstruction will be depicted in this unusual and mature film with admirable realism.  And despite of being Francois Dupeyron a unknown filmmaker overseas, it would be very interesting to get close to this interesting director who has too much to say.  One of the best films of this year. Magnificent script and scorching performances.
