 "Appassionata" Sonata was begun in 1804 and completed in 1806 was the one that Beethoven considered his greatest Sonata to that date. This work not only constitutes a climax in Beethoven `s writing keyboard but besides, he materialized in piano that untamed spirit, in form and style; between structure and feeling; that expected unity in which Apollo and Dionysus fuse.   As a matter of fact, you may find a similar climax in "Eroica" , although it was received coldly by obvious reasons; the genius always walks miles ahead respect his contemporaries.       Pitifully notwithstanding the circumstance this work has been recorded in excess, there are not so successful results as you might expect. Most of pianists seem to ignore the intrinsic values behind the score and just play musically, in order to make a job. If you act so, you simply denaturalize and disarticulate this great Opus.  To my view, Rudolf Serkin is twice among the five most prominent pianists who made the journey to the core of this sublime work. And the rest of them would be (I insist, is a personal opinion) by Paul Badura Skoda (in a legendary version of 1978 that has not resurrected into CD format, a double LP from BASF), Serkin again with his impressive live version in Lugano   1957 (see my review), Arthur Schnabel and Daniel Barenboim in a recorded studio version in the middle seventies.          The invaluable legacy bequeathed by Rudolf Serkin is still a matter of discussion around the world.
