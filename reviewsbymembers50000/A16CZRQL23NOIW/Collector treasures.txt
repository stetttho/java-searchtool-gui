 There are different categories of music ; atonal , classic , romantic and baroque , but How can you define Mozart's music in this classification ?  Mozart is an universe unto himself , due each work of his fertile mind is individual . His creative works and monumental legacy is far from any other composer previous or next .  In the case of Horszowski playing you can feel from the first bar his immense concern to afford us the essential spirit of W.A.M.   He does not use the sostenuto pedal  . The result obviously translates into a major continuity in the musical flow instead of the recreation of reflexive atmosphere , because somehow this device would tinge his music of romantic taciturnity .     I have not heard in my whole life such expressive and astonishingly well played Fantasie in C minor .   If you really want to display an admirable rapture experience , come  to Horszowski playing and acquire this sublime album .
