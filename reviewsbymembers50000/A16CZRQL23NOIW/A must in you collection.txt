 In the story of this instrument there have been just four legends. Dick Contino , Maurice Larcange , Christian Di Maccio and Art van Damme. Van Damme's style is interesting , romantic and sometimes influenced with jazz rhytms ; and the results are extraordinary.  However when Van Damme is inspired in the romantic mood , he produces golden performances , as gone with the wind and Laura , for instance. Acquire this record , because the velvet sound generated by Van Damme is unique. The name of the album couldn't be more precise. A winner CD!
