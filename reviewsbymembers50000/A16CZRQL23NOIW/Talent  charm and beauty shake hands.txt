 Mary Hopkin was the typical sweet little girl with blond hair and beautiful blue eyes who engaged us with her angelical voice and astonishing lyricism. Two themes were more than enough to captivate the taste of the exigent audience of those ages. Those were the days and Goodbye. Go for this album and find one of the sweetest voices of the early seventies.
