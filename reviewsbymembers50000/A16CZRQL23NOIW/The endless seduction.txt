 Claire's knee is a gem picture. Eric Rohmer was in the peak of his creative powers with this movie in the early seventies when decided to make that film plenty of sugestive rendition for the femenine charm about a middle aged man who falls in love with a sweet and slender teenager and the main motive of his affection is the knee. This script will originate a set of funny and smart situations that will rejoin you with the cinema considered as the seventh art. This treasured film must be included in your personal list of the great French films in any age. Rohmer is one the most prolific and original directors who came from the New Wave, and was also one of the most important signs of the Cahiers du Cinema in the early fifties with Chabrol, Truffaut and Goddard.
