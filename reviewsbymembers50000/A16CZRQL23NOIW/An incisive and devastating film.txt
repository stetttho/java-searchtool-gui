 The most eloquent protest against the rampant struggling oppression, and oppressive government  and autoritarism is expressed marvelously in this breathtaking film that will let you shocked due the realism and the crudeness of its own nature.     Winner of the Grand Prix in Cannes. A true artistic feat of his Director Serif Goren.Go for this one.  It is less than amazing this film has not been released on DVD format!
