 A brave and overwhelming movie. Ronald Joffe (a true master director)(The mission) describes carefully the efforts and creative virtues of Vatel, a true artist in the sense of that Jean Renoir statement: The art is not a job; its the way you make that job". All the corrupt and decadent atmosphere that surrounds the Kingdom and the Court of Louis XIV are shown through a powerful script and very brief but also bitter dialogues, and an amazing employment of the visual and corporal languages. The direction is first rate , the astonishing visual angles are supported by a descriptive style, breathtaking "travellings" ,  monumental images and a superb cast. Depardieu show us once more why hes a living legend and one of the top twenty actors in the world; the exquisite and exceptionally gifted and beautiful Uma Thurman gives probably the most powerful performance in her career and obviously Tim Roth, amazing as always. Watch this film. Youll be widely rewarded. Youll feel and experience that special rapture , a trademark of the masterpieces
