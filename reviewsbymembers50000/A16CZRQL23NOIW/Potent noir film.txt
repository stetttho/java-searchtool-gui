 The film runs with astonishing intensity, with verycredible characters, very well written and solid script that will catch your attention. Obviously there are certain codes that maintain the whole interest in the film. There are certain thieves who still believe in the word: loyaly and honesty, and this is not a cynical expression.  So in this state of things you can look behind through the time, essential and related films: here I go: Point blank, Reservoir dogs( the best film noir of the nineties in USA),Le cercle rouge and Rififi. Four astonishing and crucial films that defy any possible match. But the fabulous presence of Harvey Keitel, Stephen Dorff and Timothy Hutton make of this thriller a true tour de force; the increasing tension will struggle you from start to finish. A remarkable and neglected picture of this year.
