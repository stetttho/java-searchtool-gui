 The angelical charisma, the natural sympathy and the fresh spontaneity that emanated from this well gifted singer, made of her an unforgettable icon of the popular tradition.  Her first steps in the Cinema and some well known hits such  "Amor en el aire" in 1967 , allowed her to be widely known in that young generation in which a very young singer named Julio Iglesias, Raphael in Spain and Sandro, Palito Ortega and Leonardo Favio  from Argentina worked out as a splendid boomerang. Those were times of Go-go and Ye-ye generations, where the raising soul, and the new sounds of the Rock literally filled the musical stages.   Her successful meeting with Juan Gabriel immortalized her, due two continents were reunited again for the eternal  Mexican genre best known as "Rancheras". Under the sublime inspiration of this young composer, Durcal expanded her presence all around the world, revitalizing and renewing a missed musical tendency leaded mostly by male figures (as Javier Solis, Tony Aguilar or Pedro Infante).  I had the enormous to meet her personally in "Tamanaco Hotel" in 1985 when accidentally I was dinning and requested her an autograph. Her sympathy and singleness had no parallel.   I regret deeply her departure from this world; but she will be always remembered every time you listen "Amor eterno" , possibly her most emblematic song.  Farewell, Rocio.
