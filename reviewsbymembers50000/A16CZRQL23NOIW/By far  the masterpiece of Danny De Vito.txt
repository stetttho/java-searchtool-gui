 De Vito played and bet hard with this script that securely must be tempted to more than one director and producer but that finally was relegated to the memory files. De Vito built a solid foundation assimilating the dark shadows of the underground ties of the power seen with Shakesperian glasses.  The rise and decay of this syndical leader perfectly starred by Nicholson. A bold tour de force that intends explain nothing but simply to reveal the nasty and very often forgotten alleys and labyrinths concerning to the power's nature, here there and everywhere.  This film joined to JFK (1991) and Malcom X (1992)  constituted certainly -at those moments- the major evidence about the robust rebirth of new landscapes in the American Cinema.
