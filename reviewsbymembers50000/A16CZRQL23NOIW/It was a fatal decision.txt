 A young musician but no smart guy decides in a rainy night to hitchike . But the fate will appear in his life turning his existence in a real hell . These random agressions will lead us to a passionate and brilliant film noir .  Jacques Tourneur made to me his glorious masterpiece with this work which I guess influenced decisively to Louis Malle to make eleven years after Elevator to the Gallows .  The particular charm of this film is that somehow the movie overcomes the genre and becomes a tragic play with all its sinister ugliness.   One of the five top noir films in any age !
