 The cantablie line and the sincere sound ; the clarity and purity given for his golden fingers will impress you much more keeping in mind we are in presence of a man who lived his ninth decade . Horzkowski was a fellow partner of Casals and once more the Casals spell seemed to cover all the musician who joined him in Prades . The list is enormous and remarkable : Istomin, Serkin , Vegh, Stern , Grumiaux , Haskill and Horszkowski . Prades Festival was a happy encounter place where a special energy seemed to flow and load all those artists who definitively improved his skills and even more after these musical meetings. The Mozart of Horzskwoski is so natural and specially soulfelt that hardly we will be able to find such kind of original  approach. What happened with this magnificencent artistic level ? May be Andras Schiff and Daniel Barenboim have still the gift to play this way. Great choice and best buy for you in case you decide to get this CD.
