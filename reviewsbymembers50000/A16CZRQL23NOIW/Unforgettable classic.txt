 Those forties and fifties were undoubtedly , the golden ages of the British Cinema  There has never been any other film which has reflected with such merciless vision the cruel deception of a boy who idolized a butler - Ralph Richardson in one of his finest performances ever - and then falls in disgrace when he is accused of having murdered his wife .  The photography is first rate so the whole cast and the artistic direction.  Another jewel movie of Carol Reed.
