 This film is unique . Nevertheless it is a mature film , really disturbing and visually agressive .  The unforgettable italian  creator Pasolini made this glorious masterpiece with a resource economy but with broad gusto and sublime intelligence . The story is about a boy and his painful childhood in Rome surroundings . They are hard times and Anna Magnani (the best actress of the italian cinema in all the XX century) makes the impossible for surviving in these challenging conditions . The final sequence is a real metaphor who will let you amazed . A film of unreachable proportions. Amusing and unforgettable.
