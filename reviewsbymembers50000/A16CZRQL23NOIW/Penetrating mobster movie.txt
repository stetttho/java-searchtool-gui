 An unfiltered FBI agent gets penetrate the dangerous web of a criminal organization. Based on real facts in 1978, he is godfathered by Al, a looser into the hoodlum pyramid. Against the odds, Al risks himself and Donnie ascends at impressive rhythm when he acquires an original feature before Sonny Black. Meanwhile his marriage sinks due the brutal emotional tension, he swims between two waters and the nerves progressively transform his kind character becoming him another member of the bunch.  Interesting proposal, I think this was the film who revealed Johnny Depp as a solid actor, far beyond his previous works, this was a difficult performance with many inflexions and dramatic changes, but his countenance and talent made the rest. Pacino and Madsen are terrific too in this bloody thriller of betray and greed.  Good point for Mike Newell behind the camera.
