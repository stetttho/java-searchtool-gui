 Frtwangler was a special conductor for this dramatic Symphony. Just a few directors have been capable to survive in the challenging Fourth Movement. To get the climax and maintain the whole tension throughout fourteen minutes without decaying, it is nothing easy for any conductor. Frtwangler gives the work the required heroic stamina, ranking the status of this well renowned.  One of the wonderful legacies of this unforgettable director. In what to Haydn Variations, I do not share this approach. I prefer a more Mediterranean vision, due I think these Variations simply constitute a well deserved to Haydn and nothing else. The album shines because the First.
