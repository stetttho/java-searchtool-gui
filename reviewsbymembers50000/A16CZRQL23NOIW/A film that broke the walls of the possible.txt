 Based on Vigo 's personal childhood experiences, this admirable, beloved and poetic work constitutes a superb and precise outlaw portrait of a boarding school. Vigo creates a claustrophobic world filled of tension in which the petty tyrannies of the school regime stand in sharp relief against the natural fantasy and tender delirium of the children. There is a lot of psychological insights, this landmark was banned in France until 1946.        If you really want to start a anthological collection, you must not ignore this milestone picture that in certain way would anticipate the French New Wave and influenced a countless films.   Jean Vigo was a monumental talent who missed too soon. His filmic heritage were just only two films, but his grandness is acknowledged all over the world and specially by the French Cinema that reserved every year a Festival in his memory.    A genius who shines with own light in the Universe of the supreme Gods of the Cinema
