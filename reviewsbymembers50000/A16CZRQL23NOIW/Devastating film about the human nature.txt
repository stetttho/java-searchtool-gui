 The swiss director Xaver Koller made one of the ten best film of the last eighties with this tragic saga , through the meticulous description of the Odyssey of a family of Kurds who attempt to leave their Turkish seeking the promised land of Switzerland . Gripping picture not recommended for children due its subject matter extremely harsh. Absorbing , poignant and brutal movie ; a superb and mature film with all the possible realism and even more . Oscar winning  as Best Foreign picture . I expect its immediat release in DVD format .
