 Whitman is the maxim singer of Myself , the human body , sex , the universal fraternity , the democratic equality , he is considered the supreme poet of North America  , his work is deeply renovator, has became an inspiration source to the new generations . Leave of grass takes back almost his whole work.  Published for the first time in 1855 , with nine corrected editions just before his death . America was then the famous symbol of an ideal . The whole world turned its eyes toward America and its athletic democracy .  The virtuous capacity of Whitman of being many in one has had many followers such as Sandbourg, Neruda, Lee Masters , Bukowski but there is just one sublime exception : James Joyce in Finnegans Wake . But besides of him no one has been able to ascend these high peaks as Whitan did.
