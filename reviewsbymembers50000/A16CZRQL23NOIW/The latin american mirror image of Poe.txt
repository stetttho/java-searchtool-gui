 The fertile mind of Horacio Quiroga , his enormous talen and best gifted pen make of him a must reference in the literature world . In the fantastic genre you just have to look back the names of Guy of Maupassant , Robert Stevenson , Julio Verne , Edgar Allan Poe , Franz Kafka , Jorge Luis Borges and Horacio Quiroga . The basic triumph of Quiroga trurns around the form he seduces the reader . Without any kind of restrictions he goes from the eye to the soul and mind so fast and suggestively that you hardly will be able to believe it . His narrative technique is very close to the cinematographic method . Quiroga and Antoine Artaud seem to be the prodigal sons of the cinema . Back to the book , Quiroga goes to the american jungle and builds a superb puzzle where the outer atmosphere blends with syncronized perfection to the human soul , its little miseries , normal decadence and its unbeatable fellow trip : the greed . Get close to Quiroga world and you will get surprised .
