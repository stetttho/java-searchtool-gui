 Poignant portrait about an orphan twelve years old child who runs into a war with all the purity he still keeps from his awful childhood, without knowning the hell that waits for him. This film  may be among the five saddest films in any time. The visuals metaphors about the lost childhood are simply  amazing . This film was a winner and the first that threw to Andrei Tarkovsky , becoming from this opera prima in one of the genius of the world cinema. A must for any lover cinema and above all the art.
