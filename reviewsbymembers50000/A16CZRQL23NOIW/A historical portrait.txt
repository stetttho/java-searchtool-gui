 Sviatoslav Richter offers us the best of his craft in this historic documents that gathers his early  recordings.   His Bach is very interesting; combining clearness, precision and expression., The Fantasy is played steely but the Italian Concert remind us to the first ages of Glenn Gould.  His Haydn is simply distorted; there is neither humor nor grace; besides it is extremely fast and very inexpressive. His Beethoven simply lacks of soul and definition. There is abundant exhibitionism but nothing else.   Finally his Chopin sounds effective and precise, even a bit of coldness and expression.  Recommended for historic reasons.
