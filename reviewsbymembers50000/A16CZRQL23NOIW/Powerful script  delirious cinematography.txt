 Scorsese made an admirable picture about factions in New York in the XIX Century. Once more it? s good to remark, this picture is far to be a simple apology about the violence. On the contrary, it's a striking allegation around the fact, the violence is a basic component of the human behavior. And under certain circumstances (emotional, affective or ideological) ignites by itself. So from this perspective you will watch a crude portrait, a potent allegory, a brutal story, an intense description of the human nature in its more absolute nakedness.  The eye camera scrutinizes all the dark corners of this demolishing story, emphasizing the inner motivations that induce to that vehement explosion of outrage.  Perhaps the final sequences exceed excessively exaggerate, due the previous sequences have been enough violent by themselves and consequently the expected climax does not work out, since it maybe seen simply as an programmatic appendix of the storytelling.        Daniel Day Lewis, once more shows us why he is one of the finest actors of his generation. Cameron Diaz and Di Caprio have never been better. The portentous cinematography is really mesmerizing.  This is an emblematic film, because it reflects another historical perspective, so many times discussed but scarcely taken to screen. Bold and controversial, as the most of films of this talented director.
