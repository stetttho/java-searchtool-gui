 First at all I love this work with particular intensity. Somehow this is the turning point Symphony since Bruckner undertakes unwaveringly his absolute brand. Many directors have seen in this work a true epic sense. And this seems to be in concordance respect the Fifth Symphony represented in so many composers as Schubert, Beethoven, Shostakovich, Prokoviev, Sibelius and Dvorak.   We have to admit the Wagnerian bombastic in its formal design and breath, this glorious leads us to new and original musical landscapes. Horenstein in particular reached another personal feat with this performance, becoming a true reference pattern respect the rest of the previous or posterior versions must be measured.  This reading possesses extreme conviction, supreme commitment, reaching an unsurpassed level of purity and nobility that hardly you will find in any other. Ofcourse you have an fan of options. Frtwangler, Carl Schuricht `s memorable version with The Vienna Philharmonic of  Feb 24, 1963 , Eugene Jochum 's Dresde,  Daniel Barenboim, Asajina and Celibidache, but among all these brilliant and honest first rate recordings, Horenstein shines with major passion and mercurial transcendence.   Go without any kind of reserve for this treasure and historical performance: September 1971 with BBC members.
