 Domenico is the key , hes a man who lives (out of reality?) ; but his speech given in the apex sequence is the fundamental nucleus of this monumental work. Tarkovsky had to leave his birthplace , after making Stalker , and this fact (as the Nuremberg judgement in Frtwangler case) obviously will affect deeply this film maker. Tarkovsky decided to establish himself in Italy ; and the first work will be that one; loaded of Nosthalgia ; notice that Tarkovsky always insisted in the importance given to this word ; in the russian mood Nosthlagia would have similarities with a brasilian word saudade but with major landscape. The concerns this film deals about are a real tour de force for all the viewers ; the reflectins about the human condition , the abscence of center in our way of living , will let you in shock state and youll be watch it over and over because the powerful ideas are endless in their meanings and deepness. An artistic masterpiece of this cosmical director.!
