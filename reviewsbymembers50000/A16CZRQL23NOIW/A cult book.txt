 As you must know J.P.Holman is the same author who wrote the most complete and assertive text of Heat transfer ever published. And according this reference, this book has been made according the same context, through an articulated process of thinking clarity and persuasive style, Holman deciphers step by step the facets of this very interesting discipline, so fundamental in Engineering.   As a matter of fact you may consider this book is a fabulous account of bith courses of Thermodynamics, and includes a wide revision of the First and Second Law of Thermodynamics as well as the Gibbs Equation, Statistical Thermodynamics and an impressive chapter dedicated to power and refrigeration cycles.   If you consider, besides the inclusion of valuable charts in the Appendix, it will be nothing easy to find another text that accept a comparison in the relation cost vs. information value.   My personal collection includes this text, among some others as Saad, Van Wylen and Van Ness, but this is one of my obligated consult references at the moment to refresh the fundamental concepts of this passionate scientific discipline.   Recommended one hundred per cent.
