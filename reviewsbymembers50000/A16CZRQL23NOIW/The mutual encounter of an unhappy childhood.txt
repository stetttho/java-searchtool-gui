  Maybe the most important and even discretely suggested message in the film be the harsh childhood of the three principal personages along the film. Every one of them suffered the rigors of a merciless and cruel father before the quiet presence of the mother. One of them opted by being a serial killer to vindicate his fears and somehow to redeem anybody who pretended to be happy: you will see the angels very soon. This bloody attitude reveals a classic answer, a scream in the darkness inside his phantom world. The pleasure and the sublime act of love seems to be in him just a special sparkling ignition to put in action the ancestral codes of repressed anger and restrained fury. The rest of the world will have to pay his internal frustrations: so simple like that. In the other hand we have to Mike a good for nothing guy, an extremely frightened man who seems to be a sleepwalker in the life without will, personality and responsibility. His sister developed a stronger character and somehow she has to carry that awful weight with him.  In this state of things this serial killer superbly played by Tom Berenger - a very neglected actor by Hollywood- makes an interesting role of this disturbed mind murderer, who will appear in the isolated Oregon Valley appearing to change seriously the bitter situation of both brothers. The idea was terrific and my only claim was precisely not emphasize in this sense. However the film gets its purpose and lets us with an open end of mystery and complicity. Ravishing direction.
