 Does any other pianist from the past or living exist who soundss better in Schumann?  The answer is no. And the reason be that very few pianists of any generation are capable to make the piano sings as Kempff.  However he doesn't play Schumann in a romantic mood. Kempff was not only a superb pianist but a deep thinker . He had the gift of looking through the score and produce the tonal effect, the right pulse , the cantabile line with rapture , emotion and expresiveness . His symphonic studies , the Second Sonata or Papillons has no equal. If you request me to name another winner pianists in Schumann I would state for Cortot, Richter and Ives Nat would be those .   But Kempff finds the spirit of Schumann as a whole.Nevertheless, in the piano concert or in the chamber music there are others . Ivan Moravec in the piano concert (watch my review) and the piano trios given for Casals in Prades Festival. There's a excellent version of the piano quintet with Serkin Budapest .   And I still wait for a convincent performing of the piano quartet.  This set is fundamental in your collection!
