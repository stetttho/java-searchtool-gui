 Kielowski made a glorious work. This set talks about the relativeness you may approach every one of these ten commandments.  In a miserable building Kielowski will show us with no mercy sight the claustropobhic space in which the polish citizens live. All along the stories there will be serious ethic conflicts between the letter and the spirit of every commandement and the resolution usually goes on the opposite side of the real spirit of the commadment itself.  Specially remarkable are the Chapters 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10. Kielowski made his own script for the polish TV.  An unforgettable masterpiece ; a must for any serious lover of the cinema.
