 The glorious masterpiece is a true real nightmare. We end to forget the presence of human beings who live in the dark side of the world. Browning with all the possible realism, shows us the low corners of the human depravation, somewhat it makes us to reflect around the adequate place where the pretended ugliness of the soul habits: are they or on the contrary the sickness triviality of office mercenaries who get some undeniable profits with the morbid exhibition masked beneath the title of entertaining?       This terrifying vision around of life and times of weird inhabitants of the sideshow world can shock you; Browning does not employ any special effects; they are real freaks; so the visual impact is even higher than you may expect. I have not had any other reference of his approach 's horror until the entry of Herzog in 1969 with "Even dwarfs started small" and lately with David Lynch 's "Eraser head"  and  "The elephant man."  Not recommended for squeamish.
