 Since of the best versions of the Sonata No. 2 in all the story of the great music is from Casadesus (the 1947 version) I bought this CD with great expectations (My favorite one live performance of Benedetti Michelangeli from Praga 1957). In this case the result was not so convincing as I expected. The Sonata no. 3 was more interesting . The multiple expressive richness contained in this work allowed to Casadesus to make use of his powerful skills and get a superb interpretation . The Ballades No. 2, 3 y 4 were the most remarkable. The Ballade no. 1 is signed for two names : Frau Carreo and William Kapell. This is a live recording from Paris 1962.
