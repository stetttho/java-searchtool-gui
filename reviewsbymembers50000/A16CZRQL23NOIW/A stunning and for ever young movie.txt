 This film was a winner from its initial release . Sublime adaptation from Henry Fielding ' s novel , this story talks about the adventures of this man who loves the woman in superlative grade . Albert Finney made a role so credible loaded of charm and savoir vivre . His virtues are not exactly of the first order , but his defiant against the Status Q is told with nuance and very well gusto .   Tom Richardson made one of the top english movies in all the british cinema . An authentical ode to the joy . And Susan York is splendid too in this performance . Diane Cilento is simply amazing with her support role . Excelent transfer to DVD .   Please smile and let your senses talk by themselves .
