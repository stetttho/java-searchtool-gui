 You can find best versions of the Death and the Maiden . I mean , this performance is good but I recommend for instance two powerful and unforgettable versions . The first of one is from the fifties with the Konzerthaus of Vienna (I got the whole quartets set) and the another remarkable performance is of the Chiringilian Quartet (from the early nineties). The CD shines just because the Trout . Believe when I say this statement . I have got famous versions as Schiff Hagen Quartet , Richter Borodin Quartet , Gilels Amadeus Quartet , Curzon and Badura Skoda in the fifties . All of them are good but this one is played with such conviction and rapture that it is absolutely impossible to get another better in the market . I know this work since I was a teenager , and may be I have heard this work at least one hundred times. I have always been available to listen all the new versions since the seventies . Do not seek anymore. This is the greatest!
