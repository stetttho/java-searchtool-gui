 Samson Francois figure has evidenced slow but increasing enhancement through the years. His notable pianism, aristocratic approach and refined phrasing are some of his virtues.  If you still do not know about this legendary artist, no it s the time for you to convince by yourself about the supreme level occupied by him.  When he left us in 1970 at his 46, he had so much to give. The musical world remained legitimately orphan and much more vile since his premature death.  But, fortunately his legacy will live among us, every time you listen any record you acquire of this peerless musician.      His Ravel is loaded not only of notable, sensual and asserive expressiveness. If you know about some other performance able to equal his Gaspard de la nuit, please, be my guest.  His Debussy is sober, eloquent with Impresionist flair and sublime musicality.  A true artistic and a fundamental treasure in your collection.
