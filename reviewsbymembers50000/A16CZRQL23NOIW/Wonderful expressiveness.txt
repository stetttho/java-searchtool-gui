 Rosand is a superb musician. He's a honest , convinced and meticulously artist.  I could watch his craft twice in Caracas in 1978 and 1980 and I saw in Paganini No. 1 and Sibelius . I must confess his presence is very far to be arrogant; and gifted with charisma. His Sarasate reading is overwhelming. He knows how to get the perfect balance in every little piece. His Gipsy airs with Fodor version are the best in the market . The golden pieces are the  Basque caprice , Navarra , Zapateao and Malaguea. Acquire this album because despite the miniathurist composer who Sarasate was, the rapture feeling given by Rosand deserves for you the effort.  You'll be amazed if you still haven't had the chance to listen this great artist.
