 This place has all the charm and privacity that you always have wanted . Inmersed in the heart of the Little Italy , his menu is interesting it offers you wonderful dishes . His personal attention is first rate . I was there twice , in 1995 and 1998 . I recommend the sallad bar , and specially The Linguini with sea food . The meat and the fish are cooked with very broad gusto . You will feel inmediatly that warmth human in all the team. The wine selection offer a great number of possibilities . And please ask for two superb deserts . the Tartuffo and Tiramisu . You will not believe . A feast for your eyes and your taste.
