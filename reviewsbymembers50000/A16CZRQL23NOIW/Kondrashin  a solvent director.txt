 One of the prominent and expressive Russian batons, Kirill Kondrashin (1917-1981) demonstrated in these two live recordings the reason why his deserved fame as legendary conductor.   He was, above all a sumptuous director; the fortissimos and pianissimos should be remarked with loyal accuracy. He certainly belonged to the old school, and his obsession for achieving the full meaning of score, the precise intonation made of every one of his performances a true living experience.  If you additionally, take into account the sumptuous, engaging and sweeping sound of this prodigious Orchestra, you will understand why both recordings are true emblematic references.  Scherezade, in spite of the fact of being one of the works (together with the night on the ballad mountain, Pictures at exhibition, Prince Igor, 1812 Overture and Liszt Second Hungarian Rhapsody) that along the years, has pitifully conveyed to produce a explainable fatigue in most of listeners due the reiterative abuse of thousand of repetitions, employing their leit motives as musical curtains in countless films, documental works and T.V. series.  Nevertheless, I took the risk and the result justified by far, my initial fears. Kondrashin added that enigmatic shadow of Oriental Fantasy, enriching still more, the score with this reluctant and absorbing performance(June 1979)  But believe or not the true jewel of the crown was the opulent, vigorous and breathtaking performance (June 1980) of Borodin `s Second Symphony. Kondrashin in his last year of life, elevated the status of this work to unexpected heights, gifting it of an epical taste and visible exoticism. Of course, the Concertgebouw was a fundamental factor in this mercurial and engaging version that will captivate you from the first bars.         On the other hand the process of sound edition has been literally overwhelming. My most sincere congratulations for the sound Engineers of this label who made possible to preserve for the posterity this historical document.
