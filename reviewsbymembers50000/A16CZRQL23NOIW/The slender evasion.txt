 This is one of the greatest artistic artworks made in USA in the middle of the eighties . Christopher Cain sketched a film based in the feelings of pain , anguish , blame and suffering through  a boy who accidentally shoots his older brother whom he adored . This unbearable feeling makes to him to isolate from the outer world .   Sublime , artistic , exquisite, haunting and original movie .   Acquire this outstanding and mature film . The cast with Glenn Close , Frederic Forrest and Robert Duvall is first rate .  To my mind one of the top twenty American films in that decade!
