 Lugano May 1957: the legendary Austrian pianist  Rudolf Serkin, Casals' lavish son will write possibly without knowing one of the most celebrated and commented recitals of that decade.  Unusual repertoire by the way; Schubert's Impromptus, Beethoven, Bach, Brahms and Mendelssohn as encore. Schubert sounded very expressive and cantabile. His Bach resulted a nice surprise, loaded with freshness, without stylistic poses, very touching and musical. His phrasing was accurate and precise.  Appassionata has been always a hard contender for ay pianist. Even his fierceness and splendid attacks, the climax seemed to lack this unstoppable dynamics and wildness. I have always thought the last movement must be played with increasing urgency sense and undeniable ferocity to get finally the cathartic explosion in the final coda. Serkin looked something restrained and controlled. And that was a surprise due I have listened his impressive studio recordings in the early fifties and his vision was plenty of febrile tension.  The treasured finding were the Handel Variations. An overwhelming performance filled with expressiveness, asserted articulation, and wholeness. His accents, inflexions and slender phrasing doesn't permeate the required forte and fortissimos impregnating the score of vivifying rapture, majuscule musicality and visible emotion.  An unforgettable musical encounter, a superb historic document and a magnificent resemblance that shows once more why Serkin is so beloved, admired and reminded artist all over the world. A human being who enriched enriching himself due those happy interplays first with Busch ensemble in the thirties and late in Prades with Stern, Vegh, Szigetti and so many luminaries , enhancing prestige, musical stature and increasing maturity and wisdom that made of him one of the supreme exponents of the keyboard .
