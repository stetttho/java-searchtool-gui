 Stanley Donen affirmed once, interviewed by James Lipton that it was very hard not to fall in love with Audrey Hepburn; and this statement even may be extended to Grace Kelly and Hitchcock for instance.   This light thriller works out such a reference frame to portrait a love story in the Light City: Paris. The enrapturing , composed by Henry Mancini is still present in many social encounters and musical curtains.   Besides the fact that Cary Grant was too older for Audrey, the demanded chemistry emerged. This elegant work is plenty of smart dialogues and discrete charm that you may find possibly dated nowadays. And that device so typical of those ages simply it is understandable in the present time. You had to make a ride to seduce; and now you just only need smile to get your purpose.   But if you catch the infinitude in the Epicurean rapture, you will always be engaged with this delightful movie.  Finally consider some forgotten issues concerned with Paris as inspiration source: From John Huston ' s Moulin Rouge, An American in Paris, Jean Renoir `s French Can Can, Zazie dans le metro, Wilder 's Sabrina and Paris blues, among the most remarkable ones, that must mean something don't you? .  Audrey Hepburn in the sixties somehow meant for the screen what Mary Pickford in the twenties, Ingrid Bergman in the thirties,Donna Reed in the forties, Grace Kelly in the fifties, Catherine Deneuve, Jacqueline Bisset, Candice Bergen and Isabelle Adjani in the seventies,Carloe Bouquet in the eighties, Winona Ryder in the nineties and Audrey Tatoo in this raising century; an angelical beauty.
