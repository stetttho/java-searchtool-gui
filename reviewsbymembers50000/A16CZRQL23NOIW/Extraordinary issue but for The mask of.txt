 The Mask of the red death may be the best achievement of Roger Corman in all his career. You feel a deep influence of Ingmar Bergman in this work . The gothic atmosphere and the Corman camera work are magnificent .  This film was a real inspiration motive for a cult movie filmed four years after in 1968 , The conqueror of Worms (widely recommendable). A must in your personal collection.
