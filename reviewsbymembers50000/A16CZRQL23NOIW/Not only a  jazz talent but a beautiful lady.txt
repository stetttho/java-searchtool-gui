 Dianne live in Paris is must for all the jazz lovers. The charismatic presence, her velvet voice, her skills pianistic, supported by a wonderful ensamble.  Paulinho da Costa that legend is part of it. The recording is superb in the Olympia of Paris, that temple of special significance for all the superstars that have performed there. Also you must buy the DVD, because this is a special event. Dont miss both of these gems.
