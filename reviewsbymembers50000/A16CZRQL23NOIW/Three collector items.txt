 Scriabin's kaleidoscopic creative vein makes of him an audacious and curiously, not well known enough. Endued with a passionate mystic, a genuine harmonic innovator, his main motivation was based on the fact he believed the man could achieve perfection only through the Art. In the turn of XIX Century, the expansive echoes of the last romantic artists still resounded, when the pessimistic world-view was in vogue, he was a made fire man.  He wrote three tone poems between 10903 and 1910 in which music and mysticism are combined. The Divine poem, The poem of Ecstasy and Prometheus.  This flaming version of the piano Concerto Op.20, still remains among the three best performances recorded until now, the other two would be a superb and unequalled performance of Paul Badura Skoda in the middle Fifties and the other belongs to Vladimir Ashkenazy under the conduction of Lorin Maazel. Mr. Ponti was filled of vibrant inspiration that recording evening and Hans Drewanz is OK conducting the Hamburg Symphony Orchestra.                I still keep the vinyl record of this fabulous recording. And I hope sooner than later to get this unusual album.
