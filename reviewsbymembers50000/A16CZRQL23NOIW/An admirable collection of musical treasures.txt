 Sibelius Finlandia must signify to his citizens the same meaning that Elgar `s Pomp and circumstance for the British people, the final expression of fervent, passionate and fevered feeling of brotherhood and national fervor. Vladmir Ashkenazy achieved an incisive and towering performance with the members of one of my beloved orchestras ever: The Philharmonia Orchestra. He extracted the musical vein in its whole expression and exultant boiling.  Karelia was also another artistic achievement, having in Colllins the maximum peak until this date. This version could be my second choice.   Tapiola Op. 112 ha a winner: Hans Rosbaud and Berlin Philharmonic in 1957 but Ashkenazy transmits us the essential and reminiscent echoes of Debussy 's La mer and obviously his Fourth Symphony through his intense performance. En Saga, in the glorious baton of Collins is simply unsurpassed, but this version is mercurial and very propulsive. Luonotar, Op. 70 is an exquisite version.   But what it is really worthy to remark is this sense of full aristocratic and committed  approach; the horns, woods and strings of this Orchestra are pure gold. A colossal artistic  triumph, and perhaps the major musical achievement of Ashkenazy as conductor, until this date.   Horst Stein conducted a very heartfelt performance of this superb musical treasure of Sibelius: The Four Legends are performed in just few opportunities. However, Erik Tuxen made a historical register in the early Fifties with the Royal Danish that still belong to the most prominent achievement ever made of this mythical work.                    Pohjola 's Daughter has serious rivals: Koussevitzky and Toscanini and the night-Ride and Sunrise found in Essa Pekka Salonen a distinguished interpreter  In sum, an album to be collected, because in just two CD's for Sibelius newcomers constitutes a notable contribution and a very complete approach to the work of this noted composer: the most conspicuous  and beloved musical son of Finland: Jean Sibelius.
