 Onscribe this work as an extraordinaty punch wprk and promosing directorial debut of the Coen brothers. What movie . Filled of twists of fate , intriguing plot and high caliber drama . When a man decides to murder his wife and makes a contract , what happens if ...? certainly this premise is a discrete and deserved hommage to Dial M for murder . The camera work and the kinetic script catch all our interest and involves us into the sordidness and darkness of original approach . Mc Dormand is splendid in her role , and when she awarded the prize for Fargo , the only comment I made in that moment was:  Why had the Academy and film makers waited so long to recognize her brilliant actoral powers ? . Intelligent , brilliant and one of the best four film moir of the eighties . The other three would be Body heat , The postman always rings twice and Black widow . A Sundance Festival winner!
