 Based on a real story , this film is real artistic triumph . I do not agree with many people and even critics who state this picture is a soap opera . It contains many dramatic issues that invite you to think . How can we adapt to the real world inmersed in a dark world where the blindness imposses us its own roles ? This medical repport works out as a perpetuum mobile through the film , it is supported by a good script and a special chemistry generated for Mira Sorvino (I love her) and Val Kilmer in a very credible role as the blind man . The brief process in which he recovers the sight sense is a life lesson . Irwin Winkler caught the insights , and the inner conflicts of any man in a situation like this . Excellent photography and edition .
