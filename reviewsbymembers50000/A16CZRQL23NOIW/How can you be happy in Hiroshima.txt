 The action occurs in little more than twenty four hours ; a dream like prologue composed of brief shots of naked torsos intercut with shots of a hospital and museum , newreels of Hiroshima 's atomic devastation , footage from a 1953 documentary Japanese film Hiroshima (directed by Hideo Sekigawa ) , a reenactment of the holocaust , and views of the rebuilty city . Both lovers are happily married . And they decide to trust one to another .  But the memories of destruction and the unhappiness environment is a serious obstacle for them to think about the happiness in the middle of the hell and destruction . Hiroshima mon amour shared with the Venezuelan film Araya the International Critics Award and received the Film Writers Award . It also shared with The four hundred blows (1959) a Prix Melis. Universaly praised the film received the New York Film Critics Award for Best Foreign Film (1960) and Marguerite Duras was nominated for an Oscar for Story and Screenplay - written for the Screen in 1960.     The film 's central theme is the memory and forgetfulness ,a sinister leitmotif repeated in hypnotic mood . All experiences in time are subject to oblivion . She is an actress (rebuilding of the emotive memory) and he is an architect (rebuilding of new landscapes, the perfect motive for destroy and dream with a new future). The characters are superb depicted , complex and changing . And one more detail : I have seen this film year after year , and the film , far from getting old , it renews itself , that is the best proof for stating we are in front one of the landmark film in the screen .
