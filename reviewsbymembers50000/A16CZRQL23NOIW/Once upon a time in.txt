 Blade runner is a futurist nightmare set in L.A. in 2019. The dark, cloudy and contaminated atmosphere , and the two billions towers surrounded of that claustrophobic gothic landscape persuades you something bad about to happen.This magnificent set inspired Tim Burton in Batman 1.  Harrison Ford is a police hired to kill an extraordinary generation of replicants , humanoids whose mission is to make the dirty work and gifted of emotive memories, but built to live just four years , who have decided to rebel. In this frenetical search, Ford falls in love with one of them (Sean Young) and he must exterminate the other three. Rutger Hauger is the leader of the group, and we have all along the film very smart clues; the Vermeer in the wall of a room, the sinister aspect of the city reminds us to Metropolis from Fritz Lang; and the presence of Edward J Olmos as the evil preacher; (who cares if you live?); like a leit motive musical in the story. Poignant moments in the romantic scenes and unforgettable sequences of splendid kinetic energy as the brilliant coreography fight against Darryl Hannah in the room of toys. That ending climax final and the last dialogue Hauger-Ford are from its release in 1982 a classic. The soundtrack from Vangelis is another important factor that adds aditional dramatic effect to the film.  Riddley Scott made his most intimate and even original film in this serious futurist scenario: and more over his other triumphs as Gladiator; Thelma and Louise and Allien 1 , this movie could remain as his masterpiece.
