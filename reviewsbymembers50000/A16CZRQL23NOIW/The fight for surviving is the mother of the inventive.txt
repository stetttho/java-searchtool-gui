 This hallucinating, provocative and irreverent script had to come from England: the nest of so many and not least brilliant gems in the recent past. Films of the stature of Pygmalion, The importance of being Ernest (adapted from Shaw and Wilde respectively), Kind hearts and cornets, The Lavender Hill Mob, Lady killers,  Hobson's choice, Whisky Gallore - delighted and still make it laugh - to several generations and carried as flower and its fruit the germinal seed of the Monthy Phyton in the seventies. The severe underemployment crisis leads to these men to create a very original way to face his financial problems.  This film to my mind was the best  Comedy in the Nineties, sharing honors with Delicatessen. Full laughs! Don't miss it.
