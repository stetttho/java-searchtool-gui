 This album is a winner in all the width of the word. Despite the fact three are gone since this historical recital in Fillmore, this muiscla document hasn't aged a bit. Duane Allman made possible this triumph. The deep engagement among the musician is unusual. They bleneded with the same eficiency , jazz, blues and rock & roll. To get this youneed an ensamble and also being in good shape, mood and virtuosity. In my opinion this album matchs with Uriah Heep live , Deep purple made in Japan , Hendrix in Woodstock ,The Who live at Ledds ,How the west was won's Led Zepellin. I mean we are talking about giant albums unusual rapports moments ; rapture inspirations .  Don't think it over. Ask your friends , because you never will obtain a negative answer. This album belongs in rock to an equal level than A Kind of blue of Miles Davis. The mythical themes as In memoriam of Elizabeth Reed or You don't love me are the best prrof that this ensemble went far beyond the standard level to make their own signature in the Immortality Hall of the rock music in any age.
