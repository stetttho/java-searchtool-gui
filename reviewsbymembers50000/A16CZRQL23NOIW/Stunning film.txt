 Artistic , majestic and suggestive movie with a solid script .   The inner tribulations of a priest gifted of special powers to guess the cards . That will be a smart device to make some money and try to help a community for building a very original church ; made of glass .  The long arm of the fate will make its appearing in the last movement of the story.  Exquisite  performances of Cate Blanchet and Ralph Fiennes.
