 On February 28 th 1997, the LAPD was in a true front of War facing two weak of mind but full loaded weapons guys who decided to steal a bank with heavy arsenal. The film is told in documental style with interesting flashbacks about the different protagonists involved in this unbelievable fact. Splendid camera handle though the movie tends to lack intensity at the same level the time runs. So instead a climax wer are before an anticlimax. Good entertainment but do not search any more beneath it.
