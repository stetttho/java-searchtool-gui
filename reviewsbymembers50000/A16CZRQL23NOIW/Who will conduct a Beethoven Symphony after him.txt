 1942: It's wartime. Once more Wilhelm Frtwangler conducts this work. But this is not another additional performance. Frtwangler has decided that evening that the Ninth must elevate far beyond the podium and the hall. Something in the enviroment will be shocked since the first bars. In the First Movement the cosmic fury and the tragic mood face one each other.  The Adagio is a true Requiem; the baton of W.F. works out as Achilles sword. This Symphony that evening will mean a clear message for the present listeners and thinking about the listeners of the future: the end is near. Never before in the story of the music a performance will resound like this one. The intrepretative violence is not gratuite: Every time Frtwnagler conducted Beethoven it was a true ritual a real cathartic experience. This historical recording overpasses by far, all the adjectives to become a cosmic experience. Who will conduct a Beethoven Symphony after him?.
