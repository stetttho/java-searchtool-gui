 This acid and clever stement comes from Alejandro Dumas and in this case fits so well . Funny , clever and exhilarating film . This movie deals around the marriage of a nonchalant sport writer and her talented and charming international reporter . And the sitautions are not so far from the modern times . Fundamental work in George Stevens filmography . Hepburn , shinning as always and Tracy outstanding too .  A "must" see !
