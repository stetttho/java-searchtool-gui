 This film is a real landmark in the story of the American Cinema .  The first part is the most powerful of the two . Kubrick focuses his concerns in the arrangement process and brutal training far beyond the duty and the final consequences in the psiquis of a disturbed and weak mind soldier who definitively is put down under an unexhaustive psychological and physical presure. The Second Part is sensitively much weaker and despite it is an original and powerful story , never matchs with the previous chapter . In sum an extraordinary work though Kubrick never reached the anthological level who got in Paths of Glory .
