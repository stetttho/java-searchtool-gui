 This an outstanding film and the best achievement of Michael Anderson . This war drama deals with one of the most dangerous missions in WW2 .  A great opportunity to watch this superb actor : Michael Redgrave one of the ten best British actors in the XX Century . Based on real facts this film will sweep you from the first shots .The bliss will go far beyond the duty or the patriotism to produce the appropriate mechanism just in time .  A potent story where once more the ancient statement of Protagoras is overclear: The man is the measure of all the things .
