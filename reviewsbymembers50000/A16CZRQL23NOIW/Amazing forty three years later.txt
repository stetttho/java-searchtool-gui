 For many viewers this film is the quintessential movie of the New Wave . I would not dare to affirm it but undoubtly we are in front a masterpiece loaded with irreverence , sardonic humor and a special candor and tenderness of the loneliness told in a brilliant journey of hyperkinetic anguish . The delirium and the sorrow ; the time must be lived as it was the last day of their lives . The story turns around the adventures and misadventures of a very weird couple who decides to break certain rules . Belmondo is outstanding . We had to wait until Jules and Jim to enjoy and describe the whole circle of the meaning of the New Wave . You may number five essential titles : 400 blows (Truffaut) (see my review) ; Breathless ; Les cousins (Chabrol); Bob le flambeur(Jean Pierre Melville) and Jules and Jim (Truffaut). Essential film .
