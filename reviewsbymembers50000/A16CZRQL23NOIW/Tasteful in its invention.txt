 Beethoven dedicated his septet for three woodwinds and four strings to the Empress Maria Theresa and its premiere took place on April 2 1800 in Vienna 'Court Theater.    The undeniable mastery and the epic moods which Beethoven had attained in composing his Quartet Op. 18, his First Symphony and his First Piano Concert Op. 15 is brought together in this superb chamber work to produce a piece which adapts in many ways an almost symphonic pose and confirms once more the raising and height of his genius.  For all those who love Beethoven 's work, (at least in my case) tend to listen this work with frequency. And if you think it over the powerful influence this work produced in Schubert encouraged him to compose his beloved Octet. So, you have the most pyramidal chamber works written in the music 's story at this order this Septet, Schubert 's Octet and in a less scale Mendelssohn' s Octet.  One of his pupils as you know was Ferdinand Ries who also wrote a Septet dedicated to his beloved teacher but Beethoven was quite frank with him: "This work very similar to mine."
