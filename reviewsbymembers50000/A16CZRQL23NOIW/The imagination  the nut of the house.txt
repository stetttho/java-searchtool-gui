  This artistic and very European style tasted film will beat you. The script is very simple but revealing. A writer will be involved with the beloved sons of an attractive widow- Mrs. Winslet- in a fascinating fantasy journey superbly linked with the drama. These imagination's exercises will permeate the most intimate places of our heart in search of our ancestral childhood's memories.  In this state of things many ancient structures will fall down. As you know the creation process demands the destruction of the previous order politically correct. Depp makes a colossal performance throughout the picture and despite the film is extremely conventional angles shot, the artistic direction compensates certain weakness in the plot. This writer will feed the imagination of these boys and in the meantime will allow them to grow up when they face their mother's illness while Depp's  own marriage is sinking unavoidably.  There is only a serious default all along the film and it's Winslet's performance. I think she didn't get absolutely the real commitment with this character and sometimes she looks like out of the role. I think in Helena Bonham Carter, Julianne Moore, Naomi Watts or Emma Thompsom for instance, to play with much more accuracy and brightness this exigent role and the film to my mind would have resulted totally satisfactory.
