 De Sica was probably the major and most relevant Ambassador of the Italian Neo Realism  in the Sixties. If you analyze carefully, Roselini was crossing a visible lack of creative breath; Federico Fellini had left behind this movement with The Nights of Cabiria and was building his own dreamy  universe, while Visconti bet for the historical portraits.   De Sica held with impressive loyalty and absolute commitment, searching for inspiration those minuscule and abominable and unsaid little disgraces of common people. The WW2 was a powerful compendium of inspiration that eventually would lead him to make this prodigious masterpiece around the penuries of two women crossing over no one' s land where the wasted territory worked out as sublime metaphor of the inner and outer feelings of the distorted and defeated human soul in many people.               A breathtaking picture.
