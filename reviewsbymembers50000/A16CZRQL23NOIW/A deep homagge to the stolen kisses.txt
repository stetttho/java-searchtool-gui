 This film is by far , the masterpiece of Giuseppe Tornatore who made a solid , powerful and poignant story with so many implications and emotional wrenchs , that literally invades and engages the viewer all the way . The ancient memories of that will never end childhood lost in the dust of the tomes will be smartly for Tornatore as device to introduce us in this fine script . The song to the unitersted friendship between and old but lovely man (Phillipe Noiret , so brilliant as always) and this child ; the countless of laughable situations (remeber the sequence of the exam in which we can see that incredible and funny blackmail) or the nosthalgical mood in which the film is spread out out of the hall for being watched for the outside people, make of this film a genuine landmark in the story of the universal cinema .   The strong influence of Federici Fellini in that onirical images is another remarkable punch . A timeless bravo for this film that rejoins us with the life!
