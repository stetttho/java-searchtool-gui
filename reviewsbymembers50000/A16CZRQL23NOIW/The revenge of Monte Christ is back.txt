 This is one of the more intersenting film inyears that I have ever seen . Levinson has made a movie in which we can enjoy every little detail and meanwhile to appreciate the broad gusto and the amazing script that surrounds this dark story . Four kids , an accident a twist of fate : The hell kitchen will be the mouth of the tunnel that bitter stage will become them in disturbed man , and their lives will never the same .  The first recognizement is obviously to that legendary actor who does not live with us anymore: Vittorio Gassman , his role is secondary but his presence literally covers all the screen and shades the others . Bacon is flamboyant as the saddistic police , he really makes you to hate this character his miserability and behavior acting is played with naturality without any drop of effectism . De Niro as the modern priest is excellent . ( This is his third role as priest ) . Levinson makes a camera work as the Gods . There are several sequences which proves that statement .  The second part when they have grown up allows to Brad Pitt and Jason Patric to build the merciless and meticulous plan who will work out to perfection . The final is more than predictable , but the echoes of the Count still keeps beating .
