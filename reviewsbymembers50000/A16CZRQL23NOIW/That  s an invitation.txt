 "Magical..." establishes a true turning point in the musical career of Liverpool's boys. Based in an articulated set of innovative musical works, two of his most celebrated and easy singing themes such as "Penny Lane" and "Hello Goodbye" and the everlasting expressive "Fool on the hill", engaged the great audiences, and, in the meantime opened the gate to all a new generation in search of new proposals, inspired basically on "psychodelia" in which the rhythm found a broad support and expansive platform such as "I'm the walrus"  and "Strawberry fields forever". In this sense this album would be the transitional work    to a trilogy that nestled in their minds: "Lonely heart's club's band"  and  "The White album". Recommended without reserves even if you are not a fan of this eternal ensemble.
