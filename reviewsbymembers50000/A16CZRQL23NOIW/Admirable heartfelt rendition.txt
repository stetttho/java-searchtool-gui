  The profound sincerity of Dave Grusin is one of his most notable qualities as human being. From time he as Sting, turns around to the classic mood and decides to put a sand's grain for proving the distance in musical genres is just in the mind. The presence of Lee Ritenour, Julian Lloyd Weber, Gil Shaham and Renee Flemming so confirms it.  The tune trowel covers a wide spectrum. From Spain Moreno Torroba the master composer of so many overwhelming works such Spain Castles for instance, Don Manuel de Falla who elevated the Apennines Mountains with his Three Cornered Hat or El Amor brujo and Federico Mompou to the great Hungarian composer Bela Bartok , from Fritz Kreisler to Johann Sebastian Bach. The transcriptions are excellent and even maintain the authentic spirit. The best piece of the CD to my mind is Bartok's transcription Rumanian Folk Dances. Grusin kept the passion and profound noblesse of the score. We all knew about his famous album dedicated to George Gershwin's memory in 1993, sand that' s why I am not so surprised by this musical tribute to this supreme universe. As a smooth breeze, surrounded and supported by pleasant harmonies. This album could become in the true for any jazz lover to incursion in the universe of the classics      Personally I really expect Grusin from time to time, make another superb arrangements. Imagine for instance Mendelssohn's  Venetian Gondola, Grieg's Holberg Suite or Brahms ` Intermezzo Op. 117 No. 5, Samuel Barber's adagio, or Bocherini's Fandango. It's good to remind Hubert Laws has to his own, another superb arrangements in the far seventies as Starvinsky's Le sacre  and the famous adaptation of Tchaikovsky `s Romeo and Juliet or Ravel's Forlane from Couperin's grave, that meant for him a Special Award in 1976.      Bravo Mr. Grusin for this artistic recording
