 The well known generated controversy around this very special movie aroused extreme commentaries around the world. Oliver Stone built a provocative and corrosive parody around a couple absolutely surrounded by a sick violence atmosphere.  To my mind there were just two premises that visibly affected his final purposes; a marked excess of personal ambition and narcissist self tribute (after all who can deny his absolute domain around his discursive lexicon shown in JFK for instance), loading the screen of vertiginous visual innovations which resulted quite effective during the first ten minutes, but absolutely pernicious due the reiterative abuse of those sensationalist devices; on the other hand Stone also incurred into the orgiastic and bombastic flow he pretended to underline, being eventually dragged by this frenetic burden of violence which pitifully became a boomerang for him.  All the unjustified excesses eventually, reflect a certain lack of discursive material.
