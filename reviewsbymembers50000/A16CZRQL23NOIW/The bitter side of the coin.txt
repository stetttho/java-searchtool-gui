 Watch this work . This is without restrictions one of the ten best movies in that decade . The film plays hard and merciless with the viewer. It is by far one of the most mature drama about the casualities of life ever made . The story takes place in a children housekeeping  whose mothers are living from the prostitution and Madame Rosa takes care of them while they are working . Obviously they do not know about their mothers job . But the time does not forgive . And eventually one of them will be the dramatic nucleus , because he was left by his father a long time ago . But the time has beaten the spirit of that miserable that now claims for his son .  You will be astonished with the clever answer given by Madame Rosa when the time is over and she had to face with this nasty man . Simone Signoret , the best actress born in France in the XX Century , once more shone as a radiant star , convincing and extraordinary all along the film . This is without a shadow of doubt, the sublime masterpiece of Moshe Mizrahi .
