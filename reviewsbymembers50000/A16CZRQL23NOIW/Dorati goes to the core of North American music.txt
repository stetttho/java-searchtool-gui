 Antal Dorati was the perfect example of what a truly concerned conductor can do conducting three Contemporary North American and a Swiss composers . Four styles, four different languages and visions.   With Gershwin Dorati got a magnificent reading of this sympathetic character, who worked out as a very auto biographical portrait and also musical curtain in the homonymous film..    In  Copland 's Rodeo Dorati joined to few steps of Leonard Bernstein performance in what expression sense concerns.    Gunther Schuller 's Seven studies finds Dorati in absolute domain of the harmonic contrasts and sharp dissonances; where the blend of lights and shadows are magnificently detailed.  Bloch 's Sinfonia Breve is a brave performance and one of the best and most reminded achievements in Dorati 's career. There are moments in the middle section of the First Movement that reminds immediately with echoes of Sun trader 's Carl Ruggles.  Sketching some musical inflexions in the Andante you can establish a later influence in another superb composer: Witold Lutoslawski. Somehow, this work represents a notebook 's journey throughout the existence of this gifted musician. He stated once: "I have made from me the best without never folding myself to caprices and elusive tendencies. I have never intended to be newness, but authentic and in general sense, human, I mean loyal to my own roots."  In sum an album absolutely recommended. My eternal gratitude will be always for this outstanding who made of the Minneapolis a cult ensemble. The percussionists of his Orchestra will be always a reference point respect all the others.
