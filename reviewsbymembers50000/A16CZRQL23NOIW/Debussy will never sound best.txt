 You must recognize after listening the incorporean , seductive , evocative , sugestive and landscape depicter style of Walter Gieseking ; that is hard to find out another player who has been so commited as Gieseking was. You easily may establish standards in other musical latitudes : Beethoven - Schnabel ; Schumann - Kempff ; Chopin - Francois ; Rachmaninvov - Kapell ; Bartok - Sandor .
