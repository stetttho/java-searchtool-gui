 The honor in the actual times seems to have become a devaluated coin . Words such as Aristos , friendship , honor , have taken a slow boat to China .  Nevertheless there are people in the world who still are guided for an ethics  inscribed in the cosmos ; souls who never crossed the Lethes (The forgetful river according to Plato) .   The astonishing mind of  this notable screen player and director David Mamet shone with eloquent brightness in this European stylized movie about a debt of honor for a family . The dramatis personae will seduce you from beginning to end .   Tastefully artistic direction and very well written script make of this film one of the hidden treasures of this year.
