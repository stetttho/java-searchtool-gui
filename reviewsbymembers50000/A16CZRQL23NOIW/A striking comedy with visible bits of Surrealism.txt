 The mad side of the usually and accustomed way of living of many of us is revealed with potent humor and bitterness in this supreme comedy where nothing is what it likes.     Carole Lombard is the crown person of a very dislocated and eccentric family where Powell is the sane portion term of the equation.  The attraction of the opposites and the impossibility of fitting rearrangement in a distorted state of things will become one of the most efficient comedies in he American Story, because everyone of us has found at least one Godfrey through our lives, and when it happens, just smile and laugh after. Because the fakers believe strongly they are smarter than us.
