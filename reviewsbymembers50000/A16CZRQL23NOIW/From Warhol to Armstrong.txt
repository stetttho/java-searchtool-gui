 This set of songs represent somehow the fertile imagination and the wildful fierce of the rebelness in its peak level . The first CD is the original soundtrack . Steppenwolf with the Pusher and Born to be wild were icon songs in that age . The term Heavy metal appears for the first time on Born. I think this version of The weight may be the best of the market . If six was nine was a future jump song. The other CD contains unbeatable themes such Time has come today and Something is in the air which you may find in the Strawberry Statement Soundtrack . This album is essential for those viewers and specially recommended to those teenagers who seek with passion the clues to understand the sociological aspects of one of the most original decades in the past Century .
