 Having bought this album on the old vinyl format in the middle Seventies, I found it very pleasant to listen, because as all we know, Earl Wild is much more than a simple virtuous keyboard player. His musical thoughts may be felt in every single track.   On the other hand Earl Wild and Michael Ponti are at this moment the only survivors of the last Romantic School and that means we are in front the last exponents of a musical tradition.  In the case of Russell Scherman I find it a very solvent piano player. His fingering is clean and precise and he possesses that required technique to shine with those har to play piano works.   So take this statement into account when you decide to bet for this golden CD, because the final result is even better than the sum of the parts. Absolutely recommended.
