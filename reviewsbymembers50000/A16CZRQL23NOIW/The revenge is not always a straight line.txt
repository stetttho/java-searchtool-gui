 This statement lies at the ending of this movie. I must state that Tarantino has made the most original and honest tribute to the great oriental tradition ; specially to the immortal Bruce Lee , (Kato style from the green hornet TV series from the sixties)   Quentin Tarantino made a brilliant film , inmersed in the middle soul of the revenge . In many ways when I watched the film I couldn't let to think about a modern adaptation of The Count Of MonteChrist to the modern times. The takes are elegant , and the camera handle is still better than Pulp Fiction .  Thurman is magnificient in this role. Her charismatic beauty however, is not an obstacle for her to show all the spirit of fury , rage and cruelty that this character demands. The violence reachs poetic heights. Specially in the final duel. An ovewhelming triumph from Tarantino ; the edition and special effects are first rate. And from now, consider the decisive multiple sword duel in the hall as a true classic sequence. It's a macabre coreografic dance filled with histamina. Don't miss this tribute to all that generation of Kung Fu  fighters : Bruce Lee , David Carradine , Jim Kelly, John Saxon and Karate gladiators too as Chuck Norris. A superb picture.
