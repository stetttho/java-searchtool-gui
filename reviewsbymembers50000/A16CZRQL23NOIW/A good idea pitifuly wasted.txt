 This script promised from its first shots . The first detail it came to my mind was the use of the color so typical of Pedro Almodovar in the eighties (Woman on the vergue of a nervous breakdown) . But it came the unexpected . This movie pretends to be a funny story but without a clear sense of disturbance and mistery . The characters are not depicted deeply . They are like human puppets both of them are shy but loosers too each one in their emotional circle . Both of them are isolated persons and they like the cat and mouse game . But the movie turns around a set of vignettes of ancient archetypes previously told in a most effective way . I may suggest three remarkable films : Sumision , Belle de jour and Night porter where there is substance beyond the distorted behavior . The film is extremely flat and nothing is left to the imagination . So you kill the erotism . And finally the film makes its last round and tries to become in a very special love story . The film runs at half road between the comedy and the tragedy to finnish not being neither one nor another . Good entertainment for teenagers !
