 Sunk in the deepest of the miseries, a countryman decides to pact with God and the Devil, with the only condition of get some food for his hungry and impoverished family, though finally he makes a deal with the Death.  This story may well considered a syncretism of several transited roads, but the script enriches notably adding elements of the Mexican folklore. In this sense the film is brilliant because reminding Northrop Frye in Fearful Symmetry, "There are two kind of Cosmology: the designed to understand the world by itself, and those that intends to transform it in the form of the human desire"...The First one is speculative, or intellectual narcissism; but the second is in last instance the supreme goal of the Art, and this film bets for the second choice.  Ignacio Lopez Tarso is sublime in this role. Nominated as Best Foreign Film in 1960.
