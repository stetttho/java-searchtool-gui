 The XX Century has given us outstanding female keyboards. Tureck in the West and Nikolayeva in the East World work out such two great beacons in what Bach 's playing concerns. Both women were gifted with the genius halo and her conceptions even differ are linked by a sincere and wisdom vision of the oldest musician of the future: Johan Sebastian Bach.   Nikolayeva style is more reflexive and contemplative; she domains the span sense, the rhythmic inflexions, the harmonic language supported by an authoritarian domain of the tune and the absolute domain of the work. When she plays Bach, it seems she was sculpting the melody; admirable phrasing and grandiose eloquence. His performances not only involve the listener but commit him in Bach universe.  There have been just a few exponents of the keyboard who have been able to come so far in Bach approach. Her majestic craft will remain (fortunately preserved by the technology) as sublime milestones and obligated reference at the moment we are talking Bach in his most authentic dimension.        Her Bach is Great, profound and enigmatic due precisely this motive. She seeks the nucleus of the work and the result is a cosmic vision: precise and scrutinizing. Her artistic stature remains at the same level of Tureck, Casals, Schweitzer or Szigetti.   Before such brightness and monumental artistic stature, the words simply surplus.
