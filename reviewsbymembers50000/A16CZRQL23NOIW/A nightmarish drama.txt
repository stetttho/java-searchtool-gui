 After Dr,. Strangelove , only two films are worthy to remark : Fail Safe and Seven days of May.  The opening shots shows us bull baiting : allusive metaphor of what ii will come . Due to a crucial error ,a SAC plane is ordered to bomb Moscow . The awful mess once you opened the Pandora box is still to come .  The final sequence is impeccable . the multiple shots and the elusive perception of the vanishing time until finally stops has been few times shown with so merciless anguish .  A solid cast confers this work a high historic status .   One of the best films of Sidney Lumet.
