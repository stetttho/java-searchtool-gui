 There have been supreme performances about these well recognized Ravel 's works. But there are two unsurpassed factors that assure this one as the most expressive, warm and sumptuously lyric performance of My mere you had heard ever; the presence of The idiosyncratic Boston Symphony, the most European of the American Orchestras and by addition, the successful podium by the Alsatian master: Charles Munch, this magisterial combination feeds back by itself and truly was a true blessing this winning blending has worked out with such perfection level.   On the other hand Cesar Franck 's work is simply unique. The only version that could be named as its rival would be Artur Rodsinzki.    Acquire this CD without dilation, because Munch 's grandness has been proved so many times and to talk about the sound of this sidereal Orchestra under Koussevitzky, Munch and Leinsdorff is now part of an incandescent chapter in the glorious background of the Great Music.
