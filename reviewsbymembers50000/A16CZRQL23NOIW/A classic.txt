  Mind's labyrinth has reached very few times such level of anxiety, desperation, loneliness, introspection and madness as you will experience with this story.  Ernesto Sabato wrote one of his three masterpieces with such eloquence and conviction that you will wonder after having read it why this monumental work is not better known.  This notable writer and thinker, not only paid his personal debt to Poe, but all a gallery of inquisitions, observations and  statements about the human nature, will integrate this colossal portrait of Castel and Maria.  E.S.belongs to that dynasty of major Latin American novelists with admirable figures such Borges, Cabrera Infante, Cortazar, Quiroga, Asturias. He has been a man of sharp intelligence, astonishing erudiction and refined culture. I really hope you to read this book and from the first page you will be struggled by an invisible arm that will envolve you in this passionate and extraordinary portrait.  In last instance there was only a dark and lonely tunnel: mine!
