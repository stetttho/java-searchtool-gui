 The early death of Dennis Brain added another fatal victim to that decade. The fifties was possibly the most tragic decade in the Century. William Kapell in 1953, Guido Cantelli in 1956, Michael Rabin in 1958 and Dennis Brain's sudden disappearance marked the end of the finest horn in years. His Mozart performances have not rivals and his readings of Hindemith and Strauss Horn Concerts have not been beaten to date. Clarity, musicality, phrasing, elegance and refinement in the highest expression constituted his personal trademark. Nobody did it better! In memoriam!
