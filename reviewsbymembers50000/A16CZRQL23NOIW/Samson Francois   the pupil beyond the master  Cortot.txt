 "Playing the piano?:what a nasty thought; but playing with the piano". These wise words are from Francois. The statement is very descriptive of Francois`craft. Wilhelm Frtwangler said in a letter: How can we learn anything if we don`t love it and how can we love it if we don`t learn it? . This sentence runs with the idea subcribed by S.F. When you are in the presence of an integral artist it`s very easy understand why they are so original in his performances. In fact, to be a master in an instrument (think in Casals,Vegh,Frtwangler, Francois,Neveu, Fricsay,Schnabel and Kempff) by example, you must be a reinassance man in the literal sense of the word. Francois was one of the elite of artists. Youll find a Ravel really deep and amazing honest. The gaspard is played with a sense of incorporean and mesmerizing pianism that envolves you.

Listen to Francois and convince by yourself.
