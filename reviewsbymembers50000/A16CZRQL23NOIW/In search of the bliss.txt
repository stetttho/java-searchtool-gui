 "There is not any deeper solitude than samurai 's one, instead of perhaps, the tiger 's one in the jungle."   This admirable statement comes from Bushido, the Code of the Samurai, that prescribes rigorous military training and practice, severe self-discipline, personal honor, and loyalty to superiors and country.     A consecrated Samurai without Feudal Master, becomes a Ronin, according ancestral codes. His anti conventional behavior brings him many problems of insertion inside the establishment. He even asks himself the sense of your existence at the same beginning of the film. Gradually-as a soft spring breeze- we will know about more and more about his little secrets, his way of living and his very calmed temperament. His ambitions go far beyond the dead letter, it seems to be in the way of redemption and expand this purpose to major areas, he enjoys bringing a little bit of happiness to the rest of the village.      Soon he will meet a Feudal master who wishes to hire him as arms master of his feud. And he will have to prove the origin of his title and his abilities as warrior.   The script is simply breathtaking, with that admirable and serene rhythm of Kurosawa, its screenwriter. You will be invited as special guest to presence one of the most admirable and artistic films ever made. The sumptuous photography,  the paradisiacal landscapes and the script are a true feast for your eyes and spirit too.             Gadadhar Chatterji stated once. " Men, even ignore it, do what they do, follow the roads who follow, unavoidably the day will come in which they will be trap within the red circle."   And the red circle means the literal translation of Hinomaru, the word that appoints the solar symbol of the Japanese flag.     An admirable film, that proves once more the artistic possibilities of the author cinema are so far to be exhausted.
