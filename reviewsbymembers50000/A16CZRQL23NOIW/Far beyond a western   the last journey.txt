 There are film which simply overpasses its own goals . It contains the best you can demand and still gives you more . Through the years the film enriches itself due his prodigious script and the capacity to remain in your mind because it renews itself over and over. First at all this an absolutely first rate western  We have a simple story in which we have two old-time gunfighters who are hired to guard a gold shipment . Mc Rea only wants to do a good job but Randolph Scott thinks in a major scope , he cares nothing the noblesse , he lives his last days and well you know , Alberich soul reborns once again . And that is a real catastrophe a real earthquake about their long friendship .  Far beyond the glorious script the spirit of the aristos survives in this work in which there are secondary characters as the young deeply fallen in love with his wife ; they will join to this adventure . There are many other issues around the plot that it will strike you . If the Wild Bunch and the ballad of Cable Hogue are his latest works , this may be well the best artistic and fine work Of Sam Peckinpah . You will miss the beuty violence of his latest works but you will be surprise of what Peckinpah could make with this story written by N.B.Stone , Jr . Filmed in the glorious Inyo National Forest in California. The best performances in the lives of Mac Rea and Scott and resulted so good picture that both of them decided to retire after making it . The question is : When will a glorious transfer on DVD will be made?
