 A love affair in Vienna between teenagers don ` t necessarily mean a forgotten love. The ashes which still can return to fire permeated the soul and memories of both lovers. Ten years later they will meet in Paris, product of a mere casualty. They will have a very fruitful conversation. And the film deals with it.  Paris has always been the perfect stage for reencounters and rejoin. Julie Delpi and Ethan Hawke make a perfect couple; the sexual chemistry is immediate and the dialogues are delirious. There are some links with "When Harry met Sally" and "Annie Hall" , but the film possesses personality and narrative audacious.  Delightful and pleasant.
