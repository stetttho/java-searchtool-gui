 This exciting futurist thriller tells us about a wild bunch permeated and invaded by a genetic wildness, they are the equivalent to a deadly plague, they rape, and demolish everything they want without any drop of scruples.   The script gradually will increase of violence level, a couple first, then the best friend of Max and finally in the famous sequence of the merciless attack on his wife and kid. From that moment the thirst of vengeance will assume human form. And the visual sequences of high level physical and visual violence will burn at your eyes. This movie and Straw dogs are to my mind the only two films of this genre worthy of remark through the period 1968-1979.  An anthological film from Australia, the great launching of Mel Gibson and George Miller, that reached instantaneously a status level. This is by far, the best sequel of the future saga.
