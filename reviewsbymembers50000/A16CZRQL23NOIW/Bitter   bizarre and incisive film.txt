 Greenaway made a real jewel movie with this methaporical and painful story of an architect who goes to Italy with his wife attending a professional request . But in the middle of the immortal treasures of the italian culture , he will live the most terrible hell since his wife commits adultery and the awful fact , he is dying of cancer . The anguish of being cheated and the personal pain produced by the disease will turn his life in a tragical context . The climax sequence is simply anthological ; life and death , but told in such level of merciless dramatism that it will be hard for you to forget it for a long , long time. Extraordinary acting of Brian Denehy and incredible photography and camera work
