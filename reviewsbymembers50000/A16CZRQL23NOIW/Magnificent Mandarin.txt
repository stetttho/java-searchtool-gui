 With The Miracolous Mandarin Bartk sought an approach to the symphonic genre although he did not want to recognize. Maybe because the Symphony as musical device was not precisely living its major glory. These transient times announced dark clouds in the imminent future. The nationalism fever, that fed the destiny of so many people was collapsing, acquiring now a new face and arousing the ancient and hidden social resentments specially on the East World: China and Russia.   In this sense Bartk worked out as true shaman. It does not sound exaggerate to state it. Bartok was an illustrated man and his rough dissonances are not entirely a product of his febrile imagination. He knew and felt as many others artists, something terrible was in the verge of the social environment.   Boulez 's performance revives with magnificent lucidity this ferocious sense of obscure moods and sinister horizons. His commitment level about Bartok deserves him to be named adjoined to Ferenc Fricsay, Antal Dorati, Frtz Reiner with an additional acknowledgment; those works were played three decades after the WW2. Nevertheless, Boulez, having born in 1925 was exceptional witness of the horror and the anguish of those times and with accurate expression sense knew to express it with superb eloquence.  That 's why you must acquire this set. Simply out of context. Boulez was mesmerized and that vision can be felt since the first bar. One of the most remarkable recordings of his career. It 's useless to talk the splendor of the new York Philharmonic playing these works; absolutely incandescent.   In what Concerto for Orchestra concerns, forget about it: there are majuscule versions: Reiner-Pittsburgh is to me, the most splendid and perfect achievement ever recorded; Dorati London and Fricsay Rias are just enough to fill your entire collection in this sense. Boluez does not reach the level in this score, that' s why I can not give it five stars.  Absolutely recommended.
