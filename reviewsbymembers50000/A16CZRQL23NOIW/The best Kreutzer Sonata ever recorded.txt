 This Sonata is the crown jewel of a CD filled of musical treasures . I have not ever heard such wildness, eloquency , nuance, commitment and dramatic mood in a previous Kreutzer ; and believe me , I have got the Casadesus - Francescati , Menuhin Kempff , and Szigetti - Arrau . The approach given for both monster musicians is out of this world . Radiant , magnificent and sublime . A historical and monumental recording.
