 Max Reger has probably been one of the most unfairly forgotten and even neglected composers of his generation. He was trapped in the transition current of two unmixed waters; indeed, the new expression tendencies leaded by Debussy around the musical Impressionism and theosophy supported by Scriabin; on the other hand the resonant influence of Richard Wagner and the discover of new possibilities of expression generated for the strong nationalistic movements in Europe (Mahler, Nielsen, Elgar, Sibelius, Enesco, and Stravinsky in what Symphonic traces concern who certainly could develop their own musical universes) and (Grieg, Faure, Saint Saens, Alkan and Albeniz)  around the piano compositions) practically left reduced into a very narrow action spheres to others composers who still remained looking for the past sources of inspiration.   Perhaps Busoni, Respighi and Rachmaninoff were the most fortunate ones. The first one due his mesmerizing personality and his eminent virtuousness, the second one because the enormous void left by Verdi worked out to his favor, and Rachmaninoff represented without proposing in a resistance symbol due political reasons. .  But Reger (as Cesar Franck) literally remained isolated in an uncertainness sea. On the other hand the Swiss composer was deeply strived in rescuing and revitalize the lost languages of the great German Bach. That explains that Busoni had been considered with much more attention, because he knew to blend his own musical speech, while he made superb transcriptions of his admired Bach. But he was a foreigner; while Reger humbleness and musical ambitions seemed to aim to the essential roots and re elaborate a solid language supported by the historical German musical tradition. The marked introspective feature of his music certainly did not result fruitful. The people was seeking evasion after the bloody war; new sounds (Erik Satie) new ballet proposals (Diaghilev) and the visual materialization of the Surrealism, the emerging tendency relegated his music to a small crowd of listeners.  To my mind Reger `s time has returned. After a long Century and keeping in mind the artistic freedom of minor composers who enjoyed his fifteen minutes of glory, it's time for us to rediscover the admirable bequeath of this notable and misunderstood composer.                 The Variations and Fugue on a theme by Johan Sebastian Bach may be equaled without any bit of exaggeration in the great tradition of the Goldberg, Diabelli or Haendel Variations.  The Variations and Fugue on a theme by Telleman are not so expansive or musically ambitious as its predecessor homologue, but it retains the seminal sound and lovable charm of this unforgettable Baroque composer. It is much closer of the newcomer listener, it's much more exigent and lyrically easy to delight.  Go for this album, that it will keep for you a superb surprise. I love both Variations and in this sense I don' t have any doubt you will agree with me since the moment you make this fortunate choice.     On the other hand, it's useless to talk about the wonderful interpretative solvence of this powerful and sensitive pianist. In this sense you may be safe, because Reger is in good hands. I bought this album in 1995 and with the only exception of the demolishing and authoritative version of Mark Andre Hamelin, this is another formidable option.
