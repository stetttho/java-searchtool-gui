 Mahler had recurring visions of his own death from his early years: these dark thoughts meant for him a perpetual obsession. A personality born in permanent conflictive state in its every dimension, foredestined to live in constant duality: ways of living, the contrats between his natal Bohemia and the sophisticated Vienna. The loss of the innocence, the oppressive figure of his authoritative father, the multiple contradictions between the word and the action, the breakthrough of the ancient landscapes and the announce of a better world, the painful step from the innocence to the experience.  His Second Symphony is a true recognition of the inscrutable, unavoidable and inescapable fate- he titled the first movement " Celebration of the Dead ".  In this sense if his first Symphony concludes with an admirable sense of affirmation or verticality statement , the Second Symphony is a journey to the last borders of the anguish, and Theodor Reik a a friend of Mahler in his book " The haunting melody " states the second Symphony remains a fascinating study in the esthetics of the unconscious.        Klemperer conducted one of the most passionate and descriptive versions of this colossal work. A lavish compilation with unrestrained sense of searching through the complex mahlerian universe. Kathleen Ferrier's texture is simply captivating. She got into the hidden and dark emotional spheres of this honest artist: Klemperer conduction is assertive with the whole orchestra making a superb accompaniment.    Go for this CD without any restriction. Recorded live at the Holland Festival, 12 July 1951, Concertgebouw, Amsterdam.
