 The lovely and sidereal Italian actress (By far the best Italian actress of the Century and one of my top ten choices ever) plays the role of a tempestuous Sicilian woman who dresses a rigorous mourning but after having met a rude truck driver your libido will reborn. One of the most eefctive works of Tennessee Williams.  She won deservedly, the Academy Award as Best Actress in 1955.
