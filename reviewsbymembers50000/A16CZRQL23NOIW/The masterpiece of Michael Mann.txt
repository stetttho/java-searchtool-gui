 This film was unfairly received and even worst appreciated in its real dimension .  The movie runs before our eyes as the timeless memory of these brave ancestors , the courage and the fight man to man was a cruel reality . Inspired adaptation of the James Ferrimore Cooper novel the plot is about the ideological and political conflicts when the French Army has some allies forces against the English Corp at the west of Hudson river in the late years of the XVIII century . Visually stunning this film had an interesting cast with the charismatic magnetism of this superb actor Daniel Day Lewis and the ravishing acting of Wes Studi as Magua. The film combines poetic images showing all the nature fierce and wildness as a huge background where the drama will develop . The heroic insights will talk by themselves in this fundamental issue of 1992 . One of my twenty favorite american films in the nineties .
