 Nathanel West `s novel becomes is long crystallization of his long Hollywood experience as a screen writer. Several short comings here and there; for instance, Karen Black looks extremely old for the role of a 17 year-old heroine. Impressive debut of William Atherton and a wonderful performance of Burguess Meredith as a washed-up vaudevillian still selling dreams. Maybe we can be talking about the most remarkable entry of John Schlesinger around the riotous nightmare and horrid underworld around those awful years in what the horror of the War would have permeated all the environment; even in the land of dreams.      A potent film and without any doubt a towering and personal cult movie; sarcastic and bleakest picture, hard to forget.
