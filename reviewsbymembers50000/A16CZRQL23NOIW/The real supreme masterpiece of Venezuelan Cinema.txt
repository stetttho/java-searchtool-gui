 Twenty years is relatively a short space of time, but perhaps enough to reflect about the grandess of this pecualiar and immortal artwork. The feminine universe in my birthplace literally loads the atmosphere. Venezuela astonishes you due its freahness, captivating greeness, the spectacular Avila Mountain of two and a half kilometers height is a remarkable proof about this statement. You look it and your feelings change. You can walk through this mountain every weekened and feel the Earth Call. So the charm, beauty and powerful gaze of the woman has captivated and engaged the literary world. From Gallegos to Uslar Pietri, from Bonalde a great poet to Camejo ( the reknown poet employed in 21 grams), the ingenuity and strength of the Venezuelan woman has resisted so many combats. most of them painful. Fina Torres rescued through this intimate portrait a simple story of hopeless, disencounters, lack of affection and loneliness of Oriana told superbly in two planes. Yesterday and today are finely shown without any drop of soap melodram, a very well made script and solid performance of Doris Wells one of the greatest actress ever born in this country. Fina Torres told a very common story told so many times and lived at least by thousands unknown women around the world. But this sad portrait allowed to show with all the possible freshness and charming visual poetry some unforgettable aspects of our citizenship. But beware that episode goes far beyond the limits of a nation to remain as silent witeness of the injustice and cross eyed disfunction in ancient generations of unfinished and anonymus stories through the little history. A Latin gem!
