 This album is a true masterwork . Michael Camilo was extremely inspired . From the soft ballade The Resolution to the best rack of the CD Caribe loaded with latin taste in a fest session with Paquito d' Rivera and Giovanni Hidalgo in Congas . One more  once , Why not? , The Suite Sandrine and Just Kidding are the peaks in this monumental and overwhelming work. To my mind one of the ten best fusion jazz albums in that year.
