 Oistrakh was one of the best ten violinist in the XX century. This selected group includes, in my opinion, Joseph Szigetti, Jasha Heifetz, Ginette Neveu, Isaac Stern, Leonid Kogan, Jacques Thibaud, Henryk Szerying, Artur Grumiaux, and Joseph Fuchs. Oistrakh made too many golden recordings, certainly. But no one of them reached the sublime heights of this antjhological one. The performing is absorbing since the first bars and sudenly you are in the mood. This faculty of makes us drowning in the spirit of the work is fast to feel, and just a few performers can do this! Like performer, Oistrakh had  undoubtly, many virtues. His deep comittment with every note he played, was perhaps, the most important. Remember by example, that legendary recording of Frank's violin sonata given in December 31 1968 in Moscow, with Sviatoslav Richter. This is a must that shows how great was this virtuosi and honest artist. Don't let this opportunity for buying this record. One of the great recordings in the century.
