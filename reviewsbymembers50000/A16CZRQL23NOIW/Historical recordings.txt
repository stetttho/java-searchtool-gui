 Bruno Walter was a very talented conductor but it lacks the divine madness for winning in this work. The Fantastique demands from you a sense of rapture; and above all a commitment with romantic spirit; Paul Paray, Eugene Ormandy were very close to this approach but Charles Munch, Igor Markevitch and Ataulfo Argenta winned the match, specially the last one. The record is worth but threr are better versions in this sense. The remarkable credit of this CD is Ravel performance. Remember the deep affective links between Wittgenstein and this concert. Paul Wittgenstein lost his right arm in WW1 when he was wounded. And in the middle of the twenties, he talked with Ravel asking him for composing a work just only for the left hand; Ravel thought and three years after this meeting; Ravel did it. The historical recording withRavel conducting the premiere, with Wiggenstein and the Paris National Orchestra is just recorded in vynil; we expect this historical record be rescued and remastered. So Wittgenstein made from this concert so the Prokoviev Concerto his two battle horses. And one of this recordings was precisely that one. A true lifes experience. Buy it because the background story is now part of the legend.
