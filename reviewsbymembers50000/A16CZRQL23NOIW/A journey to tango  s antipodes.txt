 Robert Duvall has made a solvent work with this picture whose commercial hook would seem another additional thriller. This motive is just a pretext, a real invitation to that magic and mysterious tour: tango's world.   The erotic cadences, the sublime movements, the powerful expressiveness, love and hate: a way of living through a musical genre, plenty of anecdotes and sinister fascination. The tango is memory and passion, the perfect combination of light and shadow. The fusion of the couple, wild and captivating, hard to evade and easy to engage us.   The plot will follow the classic style: Duvall is a hired mercenary. He will be sent from New York to Buenos Aires to pay a painful debt. But the fascinating portrait made by Duvall is unique, very personal and warmth, through smart dialogues and a very well assembled script , that will capture your interest.   There are certain edition problems and unnecessary concessions, that avoid to know a little more about this retired General; may be a flash back would have been enough; and that is why I guess this was not the main intention of Duvall; he wants to focus about the tango, and the crime won't be but the frame of the dramatis personae.   He is a beloved father behind his job. And the cast is fine; a human portrait and an invitation to enjoy this art dance.
