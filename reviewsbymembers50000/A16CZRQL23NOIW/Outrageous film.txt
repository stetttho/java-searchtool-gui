 Following the traces of the career of this Avant Garde filmmaker, the results can not be totally appreciated in just a view. Russell was in the seventies and eighties the daredevil director, the Nasty boy, the embodied irreverence.   Thanks to that wonderful Who's  Rock Opera, Russell built a frenetic, dazzling, disturbing and even puzzling picture, blending visual extravagances, kinetic rhythm, and original stages about a dumb, isolated, blind, and deaf boy who will become a Pinball Wizard and eventually a kind of New Messiah.  Roger Daltrey in the principal role showed his vocal gifts. A venerated cult movie for hard fans and  followers of the beatnik Wave.         A sincere advise: you must be absolutely involved by the score; get Tommy in its original version, and go for Pinball Wizard, The Acid Queen, and every one of its episodes; otherwise, I can guarantee an absolute understanding and consequent  dissappointment.
