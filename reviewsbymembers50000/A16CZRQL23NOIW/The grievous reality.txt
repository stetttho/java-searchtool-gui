  Haunting film and painful portrait of Indian in those fifties. Ferocious critique of the caste's system that rules the life of Indian people through the traps employed by a swindler band to cheat illiterate persons.    A brave film made with honesty, courage and honour, nominated as Best Foreign Film in 1957.
