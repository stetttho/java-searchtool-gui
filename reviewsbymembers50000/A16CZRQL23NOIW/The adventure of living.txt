 A simple and middle class man is seriously wounded in the head and loses the memory due that fact. That twist of change will mean a slow reconstruction of the dispersed pieces of this complex puzzle: he reminds nothing, so he must survive against all the odds. Through the very personal style of Kaurismaki we'll be invited to watch as silent spectators of a hard portrait of search of an identity, an illusion and a reason to live. Since he gets a job, he will have a love affair with a mature woman. The fight for survive in the oppressive and hostile world, loaded of so may people who lives at the edge of the society where the loneliness adopts so many behaviors and attitudes. We will assist to a real parade of emblematic characters: from the corrupt office to the first man he knows after the incident; the man who has to steal the bank to pay his duties with his ex employers, and the musical band in search of best destiny, conform a sad and crude film that somehow revitalizes and gives us back with essential living values and a sharp reflection about facing the real world from a different perspective, so far but in the meantime so possible to repeat. A winner film; its slow rhythm is not any obstacle if you read behind the script. Tender moments loaded with profound humanity sense.
