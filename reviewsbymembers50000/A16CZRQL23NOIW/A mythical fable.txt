 This work of Giuseppe Tornatore is an original issue in the celluloid. The story tells us about a child born in the middle of the ocean , (so forget about whats his birthplace), that lack of no land human being gives him that mythical character. The script shows the process of growing up of this boy , who gradually became in the official pianist of that ship called Virginian, (another smart clue) . The time comes for him , the piano and his intimate friend , the trumpeter are the only friends he has. All the story is told in third person, before a seller of old musical instruments and musical scores; I mean a true dialogue between two categories of memories ; the emotional and the historical. In that sense Tornatore signs his directorial prints on his favorite theme: the memory. Thats the clever device of Cinema Paradiso. But the pianist (in a brilliant performing of this underestimated actor of one million carats talent, Tim Rith), refuses in every decisve moment to leave his own country ship; he belongs to it. He was born there and a invisible link ties him: not even the only love , and mighty inspiration motive for his best composition is capable of make leaving his water home. Beautiful , poetical and amazing tale with multiple laughable sequences, are surrounded by that duty fate of mixing with the ground land . An unforgettable experience that will reward you from beginning to end. Dont miss this one.
