 Tto describe in few words : superb . All this set deserves the best and highest adjectives . Musicality technician equipment and vitality characterize all and every one of these pieces . I had the honor of knowing Istomin in Caracas September 1979 in a piano recital . In the first part he played a mesmerized Bergamasque suite and in the second half he played an unforgettable reading of the Schubert sonata D960. Istomin was another pianist who greW up under the cosmic talent of Pau Casals , together with Stern that wonderful gifted musician, and nothing less than Leonard Rose who in my personal opinion has been the best american cellist in the century . Acquire this set as soon as you can!
