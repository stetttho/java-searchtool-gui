 This is a cult film all the way and certainly one of my favorite issues of Norman Jewison. Few times before or since this picture have ever been such adrenaline confrontation and dramatic tension in any card game .  Edward G. Robinson is the old master and Mc Queen the young man , capable to conquer the world just in one gamble . In the middle of the great depression this movie has had too many similar works through the years, but this is the definitive to date . The supreme Goddess of the middle sixties Ann Margret and the masterful hand of Jewison makes of it a fundamental CD for your personal collection.
