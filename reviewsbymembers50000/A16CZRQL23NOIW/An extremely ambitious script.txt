 This movie had all the dramatic factors to catch our attention and interest. A terrorist faction, an important girl to be watched and the always sensible nuclear premise.  But with such ties to disentangle, there is a hidden risk to dismiss one of the main ethic conflicts; unless you have a hidden Ace or may to lead the film over two hours and a half.   As whole entertainment the film is enjoyable to watch, but it could have been still better.
