 Deep purple live in Japan , I think this title will be obligated reference from here to the eternity. The others albums in my personal view are: Led Zepellin II, Uriah Heep live, How the west was won (Led Zepellin too) , Captain beyond (Capricorne), Allman brothers live from Fillmore, and Jimmy Hendrix`s experience. What else can one say after listening?. Ive gathered with young people, a nephew and several friends of him, and others friends not necessarily rock`s lovers to listen that record (Im 49) the facial expression is the same:  amazing, unbelievable, and other similar adjectives. This is posible, because there are certain moments in a  very special ocassions where you seem sign a kind of statement with yourself and your bliss; a commitment and clarity who goes beyond your own limits. And this thought applies for all the arts. Bresson , a french filmaker (died in 1999) told once: "When you don`t know what to do , and what you do is the best, that is inspiration".And those days of August 1972  Deep purple was inspired, without any shadow of doubt. Only I can add this sentence: Deep purple is a rock band inscribed in the inmortality.  When you consider rhe sum of these gifted musicians like  Ian Gillan,Ian Lord ,Ritchie Blackmore, it`s logical to think that the throne of the rock is  for a few. And Deep purple is one of them. Forever purple !
