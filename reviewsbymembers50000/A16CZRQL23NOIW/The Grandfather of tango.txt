 There 's a famous Argentine aforism:"Gardel is like the good wine; everydays sings still better".  The tango is winter 's memory; unfinished happiness, indifference ' s smile, old livings and  memories either pleasant or unpleasant. Single poetry masked by the collective stardom.      Carlos Gardel `s legend has enhanced through the years. His undeniable abilities and countless virtues, impeccable diction and stage presence gave the tango a special status that surmounted its intrinsic level (Borges called it once a reptile of brothel) and make the definitive leap in the good taste of every melomaniac around the world.  The tango as memory, nostalgia 's matrix, about what it could have been and was not. A musical genre that accounts the little and if you want insignificant anecdotes of unknown and crepuscular human beings; that revives those livings of our vanished childhood and youth; that reminds Mi Buenos Aires with the same sensation of desperate anguish interweaved with hopeless; the appropriate immigrant 's song.   A magnificent selection of Gardel , best known as "El morocho del abasto", where each June 24th of every year in many corners of the world a crowd of people gather with the only purpose to remind his memory.
