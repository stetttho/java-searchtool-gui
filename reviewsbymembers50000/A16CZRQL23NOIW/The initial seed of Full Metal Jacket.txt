 Sidney Lumet built this morbid nightmare in the middle of a British military prison Africa during  WW2 .  The inhuman treatment becomes this film a real status special and reveals how narrow can be the line between the authority excess and the macabre sadism.   Andrews gave the uppermost performance of his career as the sinister authority  and Connery made us forget his Bond profile with this impeccable performance .   Three memorable and realistic scenes will remain in your memory : Connery `s never ending  Hill `s ascent , the prisoners ` mutiny and the awful final .   The only script default : Do you really expect a mutiny in the middle of the desert can be silenced with water , knowing how hard signifies to get  this appreciated liquid in this clime?
