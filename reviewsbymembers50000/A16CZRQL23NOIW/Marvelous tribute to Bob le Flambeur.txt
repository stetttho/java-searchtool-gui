 At last Neil Jourdan made a free adaptation of that fundamental movie of the purest New Wave spirit film of Jean Pierre Melville , Bob le flambeur . This remake is very well made , charming and elegant and if it lacks the bitterness of Bob le Flambeur , the characters are very well depicted and loaded of black humor and double twist jokes . Kusturica as Vlado is outstanding , and the same adjective goes to Nick Nolte . Jourdan handles the camera with legendary masterful . The story never leaves you quiet , it's kinetic and dynamic . Filmned with very broad gusto in this beautiful paradisiac coast: La rivera francesa . A triumph all the way!
