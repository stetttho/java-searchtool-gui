 The concept of a murder victim who functions  as his own detective, gives to D.O.A. a unique point of view and also gives it a major status. The inspiration for D.O.A. comes from a 1931 german film entitled Der mann, der seinen morder sucht, directed by Robert Siodmak (The dark mirror). People manipulated by forces they are unable to control and comprenhend; that's a another important component of the film noir's profile. This film, altogether with Kiss me deadly (Robert Aldrich, 1955) are the best exponents in remarking this point, because also establish a crossroad about the unknown consequences derivated from the technology. Don't miss this weird story; an unvaluable gem and also well done  film of Rudolf Mate. Edmond O' Brien  is top-notch.
