 The brief existence of Steve Ray Vaughan meant a great loss not only for the guitar world but the blues. Vaughan owned a personal trademark for this genre, even he was a famed rock singer. His special dark vocal inflections, and his peculiar style added the blues a propulsive fresh breath.  The best track in my opinion is Texas flood, but the CD is absolutely rewarding from start to finish.
