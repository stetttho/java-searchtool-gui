 Edward Hallet Carr makes a meticulous analysis and untired exploration around the meaning of the historian and his real role as interpreter . He must consider the story as a musician playing the score becoming in a kind of vanished bridge linking the history and the reader . The subjectivity is very hazardous , but the historian can not just be isolated from the emotion . This delicate balance between the reason and the passion is highlighted with interesting points of view of brilliant authors in this theme .  Absorbing and fundamental reading.
