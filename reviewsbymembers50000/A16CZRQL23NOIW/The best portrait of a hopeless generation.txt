 Dennis Hopper made a cathartic movie. I ve always recognized his talent as actor and film maker . Hes an outsider artist , in all the sense of the expression. This picture, is  reflect of his own character. The tale about two renegades , every one of them trying of seeking his destiny, decide to make a journey (the mythical approach) to New Orleans Mardi Grass (evasion once more) , in his powerful motocycles . This journey will allow Hopper to express the alienated existence of these guys and the people who surrounds in every point  they decide to rest. The violence is free ; and you watch in the visual  language of the people who simply dont accept their way of living , the way they dress ; they establish a spiritual rapport with that hippie community in the middle of the road, where the psichodelia images suggest you whats going on.  This film was a low budget . 394.000 bucks , but the script depicted as any other american film of its age the sense of going to nowhere abaout a generation tired of waiting for a change. The increase dark shadows will cover the landscape and will carry to that magnificent and poetic ending. I still have the original vynil soundtrack of this picture. If six was nine of Hendrix, Born to be wild and the Pusher of Steppenwolf , or the weight  were emblemeatic songs of its age which reflected wise and sincerely , the expecatations of a generation just in the year in which the man reached a superb scientific and technological triumph in Jul 29 1969 . In a certain way this outlaw couple behaves in similar terms that Butch Cassidy (Western) , Scarecrow (existential mood city) , Midnight cowboy (outsiders in New York). May be the film age a bit but its descriptive script from its release  became in a cult movie.!
