 Consider this one as the best of Lon Chaney silent films . Never before and hardly since there has been a version so magnificently mounted and idiomatic expressive , and personally I guess the plot fits adequately to mude movies , due his own nature allows . A musician hides in the bowels of a cavernous opera house waiting for his revenge moment . You had to wait until 1974 for De Palma to obtain a worthable second place  FORTY NINE YEARS after . But is more than just to recognize the enormous and expert merit made by Claude Rains in the 1943 version . The makeup is silmply magic . Directed by Rupert Julian a real and forgotten master director. A personal advise to get involved in this surrealist mood ; watch first The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari , The hands of Orlac at first , and once you are completely in expressionist waters , watch it . Otherwise , if you watch without the necessary requirements about the artistic meaning and certain visual , cinematic and light and shadows affects clues , may be you make a wrong statement . due a breakthrough with the fundaments of this genre
