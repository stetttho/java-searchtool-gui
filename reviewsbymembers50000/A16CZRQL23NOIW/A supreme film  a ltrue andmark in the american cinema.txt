 This movie belongs to the legend from its release. Never before Wilder got down to the deepest regions of the soul, like in this one. A voice in off (William Holden) will be as introductory device to involve us in this gripping story about the loneliness of an old fashioned actress who lives only in her lost picture images. In this sense it's worthy to name the only five films which have had a succesful exit about this no mercy theme. These are: Cries and whispers, The silence and Persona (Ingmar Bergman), The anxiety of Veronica Voss (Rainer Werner Fassbinder) and American Beauty(from Sam Mendes). The sense of loneliness grows progressively in this old lady, who decided to stop the physical time and create her own reality between the dark clouds of her ancient memories. An eternal treasure of the american cinema and in my point of view the masterpiece of that film maker giant called Billy Wilder.
