 Albert Camus made one of his masterpieces essays with this clever and fundamental issue . The sense of the absurd has few times so merciless , incisive and bitter as in this case . As one of the legitimate descendents of that huge tree , Fedor Dostoievsky , Camus explores meticulously the esssential facets and describes with supreme maestry the roots of the absurd . He decides to make a journey where the literature , the history , the philosophy and mythology melt to produce an admirable and superb text . If you are (as I do) a hard fan of Camus ; do not wait for a second and try to get it as soon as you can . In my opinion , Camus was the most important ambassador of the existencialism movement . He lived as he wrote ; and that remarkable aspect is a glorious and brave statement of living.
