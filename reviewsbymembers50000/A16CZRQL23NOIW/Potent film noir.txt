 You may consider this film as an authentic elite of this genre. Lancaster plays the role of a man who hasn't been capable to forget to his ex-wife (Ivonne De Carlo) . She is trying to remake her life and wants to marry with a villain .   This script will become progressive more intriguing till the climax is a shock for the viewer. Robert Siodmak was one of the key film makers all along these decads of creative and dramatic film noir. The essential clues are present here. The hopeless ; the happiness never smiles the guy ; the girl uses to fall in love with the mistaken man ; the long arm of the fate seems to dictate its own rules ; the sinister and dark shadows of the envy , the cruelty and the greed establishes a typified behavior ; the insatisfaction surrounds the couple , and many times it seems to touch the model citizen turning in a evil human being . There are bits of melodramatic concerns but it never becomes in the narrative nucleus. Lancaster makes a convincing role and Tony Curtis makes his screen debut.  If you are a hard fan about this genre. This is for you. There was a remake in 1995 titled Underneath : but you may ignore this last one. It doesn't keep the black and bitter atmosphere of Criss cross . Don't forget another trimph that Siodmak also directed The dark mirror (Olivia de Haviland).
