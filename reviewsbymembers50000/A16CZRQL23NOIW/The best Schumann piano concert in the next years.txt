 Before I noticed this recording I had Lipatti, Richter and Benedetti Michelagenli among my battlehorses favorites. But suddenly a czech pianist Ivan Moravec , and the Czech Philarmonic (one of the five best European orchestras) conducted by the giant Vaclav Neumann. It was an interesting riddle. So I decided to buy it in 1977. The surprise still shocks when I remeber the first time I listened it. Moravec is a genius of the keyboard, but not onlythat, the dionisiac approach who Moravec and the czech orchestra give to this piano concerto seem to reveal more notes than this concert has in its score. So brilliant, magnificently performed with deep honesty and an outstanding poetry. Forget all you can have heard about any other recording. Please, ignore it and try as soon as it's possible this issue. Moravec stole this concert for himself.  The transfer on CD is extraordinary. Supraphon made a technical prodige in the transfering process, fortunely. Warning forget the another recording with Dallas Symphony.
