 Since an ex cop (Glenn Ford)decides to crack the underworld hold in a city with the help of a mobster's moll , many things will happen when the risk is accepted . Lee Marvin is magnificent and unforgettable as a sadistic killer . This is a top and excellent policial blessed for the great talent of Fritz Lang who still in that age literally shone with that magnetic and vital expressive force . As you know Lang was always interested in the dark side of the soul of the human being and if you look back in his previous noir filmography , the themes are deeply challenging and disturbed . This is a mature film all the way and one of my favorite and timeless cult movies of the fifties .
