 Walter Weller infuses Rachmaninoff a noblesse vision, far beyond the score. This excellent and many times forgotten director had always a special rapport with the Russian composers.  The First Symphony is to my mind, the most emotional and electrifying performance I have ever heard, keeping in mind the powerful reading of Ormandy.   The Rock is excellent too, apart of an incandescent performance of Kondrashin in the seventies.
