 Sally Kirkland gave the best role of her career with this haunting portrait of a middle aged actress who decides to cast in USA after being a very well known actress in her birth country.  The struggling atmosphere and the winds of change experimented by Anna make the dramatic frame to receive her parent. You will realize how fast and temporal can result the affective ties when the greed and the ambition sharp the spirit.  The profound sensation of loneliness due the age in the acting world is the central focus of this intelligent and sensitive film. What can be the pretext to ignore the talent and experience of an actress whose only sin has been to surpass the forties? The acquired experience weighs less than nothing when the first wrinkles delineate the feminine face. It would seem that Faustian stigma has survived through the years and has embodied in the common sense of many people.  A mature film who could become in a vital reference point and late discussion after you watch this picture.
