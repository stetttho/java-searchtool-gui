 This is singular movie; beneath the epidermical  script, there is powerful message. A priest, in charge of an orphanage will have to shake hands with a group of convicts when the island home be endangered by a volcanic eruption.  When the nature shows us its hidden face, you must leave behind certain conventionalisms, ethical patterns and ideologies, because at those moments the surviving instinct must prevail; the value of human life is above any sort of moral considerations.
