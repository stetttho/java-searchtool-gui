   There are times in which the intuition, the joyous rapture and the inspiration seemed to melt in the right proportions to make an unforgettable record. In the jazz story there are many examples.  But in the particular case in what it concerns the Brecker Brothers made to my mind their best achievement, without any shadow of doubt. Fascinating, exciting and captivating in every track. There is not any hole all along this work.  Simply extraordinary and consider this title among the cream of the cream albums during that year.
