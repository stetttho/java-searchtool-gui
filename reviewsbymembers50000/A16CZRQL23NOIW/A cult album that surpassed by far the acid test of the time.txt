 The elegant Gypsy is, to my view and measure by measure, the best album of this singular musician. Di Meola not only convinces us once more about his prodigious hands and demoniac flourish, expressive musicality and formidable phrasing, but besides he exhibits that magic and captivating touch, that seductive elegance in what expression concerns.   In this album, the dazzling inspiration is present in every track of the album. From its instantaneous release I acquired in vinyl and  enjoyed countless times. And despite the elapsed years it maintains that touch of noblesse and dignity , so typical of the outstanding musical achievements.  So that is the invitation for you, in case you do not know about it; it is a classic album that never, but never will let you down. Freshness, arrogance, musicality, fierce moods and irresistible charm with a quality sound level few times equaled.   So under any perspective this album deserves be part of your collection. It is a cult album of obligated reference among the connoisseurs.
