 To the same distance of the traditional idolatry about that partial critics reasoning or based in determined aspects , Everett Reimer brings nears us to radical conclusions :our monopolist education systems consist in institutions whose final goal is the intellectual and emotive slaving of the childhood and the systematic deformation of their members to a repressive universal discipline . The book values the educative systems since the consideration of its supposed finalities .Our actual conception of the education must be substituted for a plurality of radical options directed to the consecution of a real free society Besides thirty years have passed since its release , this book established an orange signal in the early seventies .  This vital information must be read for any clever and sensate person , because somehow you are involved , believe or not with somebody , a friend , familiar , who actually is immersed in the educative process . And the smart alert goes in many directions . Very documented essay and carefully written .
