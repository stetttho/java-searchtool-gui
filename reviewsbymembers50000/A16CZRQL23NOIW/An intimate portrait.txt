 This familiar album extends itself from 1899 to 1932,in this sense the movie focuses around the painful years of the WW1 and the Great Depression. The sorrows and triumphs of the Marryot family are treatedadmirably in this admirable adptation of Noel Coward's play. The film looks dated but maintains its involving expressive force.  This can be Frank Lloyd's masterpiece.
