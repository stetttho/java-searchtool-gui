 This unforgettable set of interviews given for Joseph Campbell to Bill Moyers meant for me a towering revelation . The supreme domain and the powerful eloquence of this colossal thinker in every little detail as product of his multifacetic knowledgement let you amazed . To me every chapter of these interviews have is so valuable and reveals so many things that it's a must for you watching with your friends or your pupils (according the case)over and over . This set of interviews are from 1986 and the background was the residence of George Lucas . If you are really interested not only in the mythology , but in multiple aspects (sociological , historical , psycholigical among others issues)  derivated all along every interview , you must not miss this opportunity . I know you will never be the same after you watch all of these chapters .
