   This heart felt statement belongs to Henri Matisse.  If a painter wishes to see the beauty that enraptures him, he counts with the power to create it. If he wishes to see the grotesque, the laughable, or the pathetic, he will be about those issues schoolmistress and master. All what it exists in the universe, in essence or in imagination, is before all matter of his mind and then of his hand.   The skillfulness of this genius was merciless. He painted as a mathematician trying to demonstrate a theorem. He created and reduced to the purest essence and very often he neglected the complexity in search of the singleness. But we know what it meant this term: the sum of the sheerness, the overlapping of colors to give the shape and rhythm of the forms.   His revolutionary conception of the picture , the space and the form, he installed the basement for the new generations of the future painters, specially for the cubists, so with all the appropriate right he can be considered as the Modernism's father.   Cezanne's ideal was to express the monumental in a modern language of clear tones and vibrating.   There' s a beauty anecdote told by Tarkovsky in which Cezanne who was beloved by the great public , was however deeply worried and even sad because his neighbor didn't understand at all the meaning of his work. That detail talks by itself of the he human quality of this notable artist.       Hajo Duchting describes the different stages of Cezanne work, focused according thematic and stylistic issues. Consider this book as the most complete, ambitious and prodigal in illustrations.
