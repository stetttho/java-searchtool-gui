 This movie is in my personal list of the top twenty films of the Nineties decade. A superb script supports a dramatic and decisive historic period in England. The hard conditions in which Elizabeth an impure heiress of the British Throne; in the middle of political turbulence signed by tacit agreements, pacts. Her painful access, after be injured and almost sentenced to death  by her own half sister. The daughter of Ana Bolena who was decapitated by Henry VIII, will be under the pressure of all nature to get married and so to hold a major political stability: the fury of Maria de Guisa and the power appetencies of Norfolk Duke, her sentimental disappointments, her sense of living in the most absolute void without being able to trust in practically no adviser, and the gradual transformation, personality and emotional intelligence and maturity that these wounds and disenchants generated are impeccably told by a elegant and sober handle camera, a discrete golden illumination, custom design, an impressive make up triumph, an enviable artistic direction and a glorious cast make of this artwork one of the diamantine jewels in years.  I haven't recovered yet about the denied Academy Award to Cate Blanchet for this performance. But certainly I don't want talk about sad things. Please watch and enjoy this superb film and then convince by yourself about the towering acting of Blanchet. And Geoffrey Rush as his most reliable adviser. Elizabeth ruled according Machiavellian principles; but overthrew all the possible obstacles, and allowed England to display all the hidden potential. My only complaint about this brilliant picture is in the dialogue's first lines between Queen Mary and Elizabeth, Mary affirms she is dying of cancer: Well, well, Did it exist this term in 1554? Hard to believe don't you?
