 The French New Wave nourished the febrile imagination of three generations: the First one was constituted by the pioneers: Truffaut, Godard and Chabrol `s first stage; the second one with Malle, Rohmer, Resnais and Alain Robbe Grillet; and the third one with Claude Lelouch, Chabrol `s second stage and Pierre Granier Deferre.  But Louis Malle, (since Le feu follet), Erick Rohmer, jean Pierre Melville and Robert Bresson explored each one to his own criterions, several and well different aspects of the life, the French New Wave experimented a necessary evolution in what its tasks concern.     Lelouch explored the sentimental vein and made a glorious autumnal glance around a couple who live in a crossroad stage of their lives and the transitional historical moment. The simple love story is made with such conviction power and steeled conviction that became an icon by itself.   An eternal beloved picture and reverenced for many people around the world.
