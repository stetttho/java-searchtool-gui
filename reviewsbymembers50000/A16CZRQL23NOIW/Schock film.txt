 This movie is deeply bitter. It's touchimg and it deals with a premise that we forget too many times , inmersed as we are in our daily activities. In a beautiful wedding a doctor will suddenly appear  and will denounces the injustice for having denied them an important amount of money for the homeless and poor people from Africa. This breakthrough will twist the life of Sarah Jordan (Angelina Jolie) and she will become the most exhaustive fighter for this noble cause. Campbell makes a good and haunting movie , even there are some irrelevant scenes , but you never miss the interest in the story . Obviously this world of injustice will generate the unavoidable atraction between them . Jolie gives a very realistic portrait. The rest of the story runs for you .  Interesting story , above the average .
