 When a girl survives of a brutal and multiple homicide will be at the end of the story in his only friend . The loneliness join its forces with the hopeless . She is only 12 years old while he is cold assassin . Consider the odds and make your own conclusions . The original idea vanishes slowly and turns in another thriller with peaks and lows .  Nevertheless the opening and dazzling shot is admirable . There are a good camera work and the film plays hard with your feelings . Deeply compelling , not for all tastes , the movie is an intersection between the American thriller and the European gaze filled with those reminiscences so typical of the fifties . This is the film who made so well known to Jean Reno. It's a neo film noir .
