 Two legends : two unforgettable names for the musical story of Brazil . Toots Thielemans is an extarordinary musician . His wide scope has allowd him to face one of the widest spectre of the music .  In this famous recording dated from 1969 Elis Regina (the divine , unforgettable and supreme brazilian song goddess and one of most inspired female singers ever) joined theor gifts to giva the world a tresure of thousand carats . Canto de Ossanha, Aquarela de Brazil , O barquinho and Wave are among the best tracks of this spectacular and glorious CD . The only complaint -if I may- is the shortness of this album . Thought and recorded according the LP laws: Twelve tracks and that's all . I have the hidden hope someone finds records not available before or recording sessions never released before to get the chance to enjoy the craft of this fantastic combination . Acquire this CD and get close to the world of this giant couple .
