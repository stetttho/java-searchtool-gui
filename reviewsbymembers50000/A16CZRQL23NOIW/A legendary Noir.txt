 The admirable genius of Otto Preminger was carved in relief with this portentous picture, whose vigor and originality sealed many directors (as Alfred Hitchcock; watch for instance, the famous sequence in the museum in Vertigo).  The original and mature script around a voluptuous and sidereal beauty of Laura will make that three men ( his initial mentor, cynical and hyper rational - Clifton Webb in a towering performance - the trivial and handsome pimp featured by Vincent Price and finally the detective Dana Andrews) established a film of such artistic level many times imitated and never equaled.  This historic film is not only one of the top ten films of the Forties but one of my eternal favorite films in any age as well one of the twenty best American films and one of the top ten Noir ever filmed.   A majuscule movie to watch it over and over again. And please take into account this clever statement: "When a man, who has everything in the world that he wants, except what he wants most, loses his self respect"           Do not miss it.
