 The sweet smell of the burocracy saturates the film from beginning to end . Spielberg told a story with refined elegance and extremely good taste but the invisible accusative finger is felt as the orwellian Big Brother through all the movie .  Nevetheless the film suffers -from the first third part- a clear weakness through its own narrative structure . There are forced moments and absence of dramatic force in the central structure of the problem or the nervous locus . There are tender vignettes and alusive situations about the ilegal inmigration but there are so many empty holes in the script . The anodyne presence of the disturbed Catherine Z Jones adds nothing important to the plot .  Her character is very well acted for Catherine but it is not enough built and seems a butterfly woman who lives as she works . Her troubles are not revealed and remains a mistery for the viewer In the other hand the kafkian character is almost a clown . He was the dramatic key of the film . You have a victim (Novorski) and a villain who definitively acts according the rules ; but the development of his behavior is so unreal and false who turns in a real cartoon , specially in the ending sequence . Do you really believe such behavior and lack of authority ? The legal aspects are handled with such weightless that the story in the middle of the road twists from a great picture to a set of absurde situations to culminate in a soap melodram .  Hanks is overacted and saves his character due his undeniable charismatic power but there are certain moments in the film which Victor looks like the cousin or the copy  of Forest Gump  imported from Slavic regions .  At the end you feel the long distance between what that burocratic web only could be expressed only as a  drama .  In musical terms: too much violin and little cello ; too much rubato to dissimulate the absence of the form . What a pity!
