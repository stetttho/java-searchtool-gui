 The elusiveness,  the slender touch, the precise accent and the absolute domain and total understanding of this work considered as musical testament are some of the fundamental tools to perceive the real intention of Mahler in his Farewell Symphony.  Curiously the Symphony begins with a theme that it might be well considered as a mesmerizing cradle song. More than an Adagio Gustav seems to go to the ancestral matrix , the primary origin or the maternal roots if I may expressing in mythological language: the candid innocence.  And suddenly the happy harmony will be faced to the existential anguish, the hardness of living with his peaks and lows: the first loves, the first depressions, the nature song, those admirable landscapes so well depicted from his native Vienna.  The last movement emerges as the final resolution: the fate of man dissolved in the cosmos infiniteness.  Curiously, the structure of that Symphony goes from the human unity to universe's integration and in this sense goes in opposite direction to Beethoven's Ninth spirit.            Jasha Horenstein was a champion director of Mahler and somehow he explores this far universe with absolute expressiveness keeping in mind every little detail to remark the Mahlerian pathos.  One of the best versions ever recorded. If you add Walter Vienna of the last thirties, Scherchen Vienna Symphony you will obtain the most honest and convincing performings of this supreme work to date.
