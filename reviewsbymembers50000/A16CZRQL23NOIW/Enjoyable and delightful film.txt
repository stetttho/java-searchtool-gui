 Massimo Troisi's last work as Il postino became his undesired cinema testament. His acting became in one of the most expressive performings ever given : amazing, charming, overwhelming , powerful and sincere.  Noiret is a multiple skill gifted actor ; his presence literally invades the whole screen and his performance as Neruda is top notch. The landscapes are arresting : the plot is full inspired and the direction is towering . Radford got a sublime work : an unforgettable artistic work. Besides the music is another brilliant actor: even there is a jazz version of the Yellowjackets.  And don't forget the funny and clever statement of il postino : "The poem doesn't own to the poet but whom needs it*
