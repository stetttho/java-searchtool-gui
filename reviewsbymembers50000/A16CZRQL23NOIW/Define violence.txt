 Win Wenders once more shows us another proof of his unexhausted talent with this admirable and complex puzzle of intrigue, tribulation and fear around three personages who intersect. One of them is a successful producer who makes admirable explosions blockbusters, his stranded wife who stands impatiently for her time and finally an expert hired by the FBI to place hidden cameras in L.A. to catch criminals in action.  The fate' s hands won' t be long to appear to make its ironic trickeries. A film that passed unprepared for the most of audience unexplainably. A merciless and acid urban fable.
