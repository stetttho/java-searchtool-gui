 A wild bunch frighten a small town of peaceful people. You know: they steal, rape and decide practically what is right and what is wrong. By mutual agreement they search for a solution and decide to request the support of seven brave men, seven samurais to put order in that tension state and awful mess. This decision will be wise and you will admire the most beautiful sequences under the rain of reluctant poetic ardor ever mede: fight, violence and death are common places nowadays but in Kurosawa' s masterful direction acquire a major status.  You will be able to watch it over and over and always will find something new, so typical of the masterworks. Cinematography, art direction, close up, travellings and customer design. Countless similar versions have been made after this monumental film ; Ritt would make a very good remake with The Seven Magnificent, but this is real artistic triumph all the way.     One of the sublime masterpieces in any age.
