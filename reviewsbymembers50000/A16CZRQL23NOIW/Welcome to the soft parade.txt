 This album is the most ravishing and inspired of that band. Wild child for instance is filled with ooriginal accents; Teel all the people is a classic and touch me is the most emblematic theme of this band one step behind of vourse his mythical song Light my fire; manzarek was never best ; and the rapture in the voice inflexions of Jim Morrison are first rate; Wishful sinful is simply fabulous; but for me The soft parade is a song that you may well compare with the advenced ideas exposed without restrictions with The low spark of high heeled boys from Traffic. Both of these themes are one thousand years light from the standard in that moment. The lyrics and the twists of rhytm are filled of originality and frehness. A superb work and one of these albums simply magical due that shows once more why The doors is a legend band.  When I was back in the seminary school... Dont miss one.
