 The whole story of the composers-conductors have not been written may be well considered unfinished if the name of Britten is not included. His approach in what Mozart concerns is a fact worthy of the best and sincere epithets. He added these Piano Concerts not only elegance, cram, noblesse but also aristocracy and refinement.  So when the imaginative melodic flight of Britten converges with the wisdom innocence of Sir Clifford Curzon -one of the few artists who "made sing" the piano- (Wilhelm Kempff was the genuine master in this field),   the result is a true enraptured and inspired Mozart, because as the Great Genius, Mozart 's significance is major by what suggests instead by the expressed.  I should remark the special relevance of this CD because both works mean somehow, the alpha and omega of the best set of Concerts of Wolfgang Amadeus: the 20th is to my mind, the most complete and profound of all Mozart piano Concertos. It possesses humor, innocence, tragedy and redemption; all the mythic cycle expressed in thirty minutes. "The brevity is the soul of the cleverness"        Absolutely recommended.
