 The famous Uruguayan poet August Benedetti, wrote sometime a poem named: "Tactic and strategy" in which he stated: "My tactic is to want you ; my strategy is to love you". And that is, precisely what it happens in this clever comedy about the role of hitch; he is a love advisor but you must remind Goethe' s famous statement in Faust: "Grey my friend is all theory and green the golden tree of the life." Hitch's mission is to support and essential information about the women's psychology, what they really want, wish and expect, the use of the body language, the importance of a look, and the adequate employment of a phrase in the right moment. He suggest them that under no circumstance they must allow his real will emerges, creating a stereotyped model without loosing spontaneity, but you know how it is; he will live in new flesh the sum of his contradictions, falling down twice in his raising date, and forgetting that the love is much wiser than we pretend to know because the imagination and the taste is such elusive and subjective matter that many successful accidents will work out as the real hook to find his expected love. Funny, original and smart entertaining film that links with that Trufautt ' s lovely film "The man who loved women" and showing that the author cinema is coming back, fortunately in USA, because the creative process has been growing in the last decade, at short steps, if you want but that means something. From American Beauty to Madison Bridges, Magnolia and Mulholland drive, Matrix to Requiem for a dream, and As good as it gets to The notebook you will find there are not preconceived barriers when the creativity runs freely.
