  This surrealist film is the most sincere homage given by any other Spanish filmmaker to a  master: Luis Buuel.  This irreverent film seems to be dated in this ages but you must remember the bitter years of the Franco's Spain and suddenly Carlos Saura gave us the Spanish answer to these nuts years.  A real divertimento with this special touch of this admirable director.    		  A cult movie!
