 This is one of the Top films ever made in Cinema 's story. Not only due its intrinsic and undeniable artistic virtues, but besides alludes the core of the Shoguns Institutions. The rules and nothing more the rules, when the pretended and always well prominent honor sense has to face against a ethic crossroad that will arise a mythical revenge.   I am absolutely convinced there has not been until this date any other film that had narrated with such crudeness a moral dilemma like this one. The mystery will be increasing and the generated violence alike the seminal roots of the Greek tragedy is a way and not a task by itself. The cathartic experience will surround you at the end of the film.   Shocking, blooding, brutal, explosive, violent portrait, where the true Samurai soul will display the last essence of its own nature and has nothing to do with outer ideologies. The dramatic parallelism between our tragic hero raiding in the Holy Room and demolishing the symbol and Achilles outrage destroying Apollo statue is breathtaking.  Masaki Kobayashi (Kwaidan) built a bravura script, a cinematographic avalanche of violent outburst of historical resonance in the universal cinema. Under this perspective, your personal collection of great jewels of the Cinema certainly will be unfinished, in case you don' t acquire this radiant gem. Luxuriant and genuine authentic expression of a supreme masterpiece.
