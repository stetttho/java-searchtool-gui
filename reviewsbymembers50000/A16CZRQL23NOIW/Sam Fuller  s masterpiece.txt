 A journalist wants to win the Pulitzer Award, and due this goal he gets into a mental hospital pretending he is insane, but few days more he?ll know he made a wrong choice because he?s in the same hell. This chilling story is a real anticipation of One flew over the Cuckoo?s nest ; and even Jack Nicholson is not here, the tale goes beyond the unthinkable and even surpases the famous film of Foreman.  The script is much more dramatic than One flew, because Fuller made in that microcosmos an awful methapor of what?s was going on in that moment in United States. The horror when Peter Breck is chased by a crowd of men who decide dressing like a Klux?s member is gripping. The film is absorbing and obviously you may forget all the rules that governs the world in which we live. In certain mood this film is a dantesque hell, with all the evil manners you can imagine. Fuller announces this film in Naked kiss twice. This work is today admired by many people as a cult movie.  Watch this film even it disturbs you.  Because the reality goes far the fiction.
