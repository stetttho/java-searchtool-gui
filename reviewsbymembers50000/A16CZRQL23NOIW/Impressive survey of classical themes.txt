  This is a very representative selection of the golden spirit of this sensual and contagious rhythm . from Luis Bonfa, a real authority in this subject to Caetano Veloso. Literally a human gallery will pass the threshold of the mere entertaining showing the most remarkable exponents of this original genre. You will listen to that guitar legend : Baden Powell; Stan Getz and his classical and unmistakeable tune sax ; Joao Gilberto and Sergio Mendes.   You will understand the real meaning of the famous Brazilian expression saudade when you listen this CD. Highly gratifying.
