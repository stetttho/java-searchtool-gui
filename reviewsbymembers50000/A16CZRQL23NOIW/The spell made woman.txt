 Recently I made the previous review about the Vol. 1. As you know this charming and unique voice in those late fifties and early sixties captivated both generations, because somehow her touch of class and charismatic magnetism literally dragged crowds of people.   Connie Francis is a legend of the popular Italian song. She assumed the whole commitment and got immersed in rapture enchantment giving the best of her craft, producing these collection pieces.  A privileged voice who shares honours with Petula Clark and Brenda Lee as one of the most famous and unforgettable female crooners ever born.   Acquire as soon as possible this golden selection.
