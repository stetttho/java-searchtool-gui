 This is a journey to hope, in search of  a better future and new dreams. These two women will gather a very original family: he is a successful chef, his wife is an unpredictable, hyper kinetic and selfish woman. She has reached a social status, but nothing is enough for her. Her mother Cloris Lechman (who stole the show) is simply an assertive woman, who was in her golden years a jazz singer, she is somehow the embodiment of the maturity in the house and that's why she controls the natural order. She is suspicious, clever and very funny, trying to keep the fragile equilibrium in that home. The frontier is far beyond from being a simple set of dots and lines. The idiom's barrier works out as a very original device to arouse laughs, but also make us think about the far from envy situation.  Sympathy's Paz Vega is overwhelming her fresh image and spontaneity makes so credible her role that allowed us to engage and make a sincere rapport with her and her circumstance.  This very original script enriches itself due the bonhomie of this lovely child who will establish the natural link between all the members of the family and her mother, who lives according nonnegotiable rules; her honesty is bulletproof, so well her affections and wishes.  I liked the smart final, there are not easy concessions, it proposes you a deep revision about your way of living, the value of those little details that establish the difference and allows to dictate the red alarm to save a boring marriage. This a very touching movie, plenty of  human warmth, a funny portrait that faces two clear different lifestyles without restrictions or preconceived stereotypes. Absolutely marvelous, one film that rejoins us with the savoir vivre.
