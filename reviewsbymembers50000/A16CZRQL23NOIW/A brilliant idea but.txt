 You know how it is . The oversimplifications and the absurd concept of the lack of intelligence in the Nazi Army makes of that film an entertaining film just for teenagers but not for you if you are a mature person .  I recognize a splendid cast pitifully wasted . Burton in one of the less interesting films he made in his notable career. Even the locations are superb , there are so many incredible situations that you have to smile .  The idea was wonderful but extremely poor conceived . Compare this film with Guns of Navarrone and establish by yourself your own conclussions.
