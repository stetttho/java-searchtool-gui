 Four different arists converge simutaneously in that artistic work. The hidden sequel of the racism who affectes the internal life of a man of jew ascencendence who simply refuses to accept his black ascendence. He will lead this lie until his final days. And that's by itself a big problem.  In the other hand the term spooky will mean for him a true whirlwind when he makes a simple ironic joke in the middle of a Literature Cathedra Magister Class. Third, the presence of a homeless girl who refuses to be the secret lover of his abusing father after her mother gets the divorce. And finally the troubled mind of a Vietnam veteran who has serious internal wounds. Four traumas that will intersect giving by result and admirable, mature and terrific reflection about the human nature and how Einstein had all the reason when he stated it was much easier to destroy an atom instead a prejuice. Fine acting and splendid photograph.
