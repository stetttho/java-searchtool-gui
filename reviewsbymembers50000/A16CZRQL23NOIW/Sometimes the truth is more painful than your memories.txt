 The ancient memories of a beloved father enrich our imagination and many times work out as a filter which does not allow us to see some dark facets and moreover to be unable to watch the painful thruth . That work of John Sayles is undoubtly , his masterpiece . Some clues , a crude investigation , a challenging retrospective ; a hard search in the unknown documents of the sometimes mericless reality will revel the real essence of a person whom we considered under the awful and persistent human condition in all his wide ugliness . There is a italian film of the seventies that might have influenced to this ; I am talking about The strategy of the spider of Bernardo Bertolucci (1970) and more recently that film of Costa Gavras : Music box with Jessica Lange . Both films focus that awesome and disturbing argument ; but in the case of this work of Sayles , there is an aditional and rewarded gift to the viewer . The mechanism of the memory and the emblematic and artistic approach employed for the fluidness of the camera work out to the perfection level in this movie . To me one of the ten best american movies in 1996 .
