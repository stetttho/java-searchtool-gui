 Powerful and classical drama set in Morocco where these casualities of life will face two ex lovers , but in crude and disturbing situations , she is now a married woman with a resistance hero , while he regents a night club . The ancient memories will emerge and the drama will take two opposite directions . The inner and hidden emotions that still feel one for each other and the duty , the loyalty and the patriotic sense who meet this disturbing triangle . But Ricky is a honor (strange word in the present times do not you?) man ; he decides to help them and give all the possible shelter he can even his feelings .  So this conflict has a double face the inner emotions about an old love who did not grow up , and the outer related with the political surround who envolves all the city . The smart chase runs for Claude Rains ( in a scorching role ) and his persuasive moods  over Ricky , and the fear for being discovered make of that film a solid gem that has overcome its own time to become in a real masterpiece through the years .  Bogart gives a perfect performance and Ingrid Bergman is extraordinary too . The dazzling direction of Michael Curtiz is another punch point . Dooley Wilson made of As time goes by , his personal hymn. Nobody can sing like him with so nosthalgical rapture and credibleness. Since the film experienced three changes in its ending , (and I  really choose the tragical in which Ricky loses ) , this movie reached the immortality status all through the eternity.
