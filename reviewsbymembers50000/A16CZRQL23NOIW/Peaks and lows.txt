 Based on the colossal and unbeatable homonymous film of 1947, Schroeder seems to be more interested to remark the personal double tragedy experienced by Caruso, jailed and widow in the first the third part of the movie and his painful redemption to fight against the bureaucracy and try to convince the gang headed by Junior and Omar.  Helen Hunt despite her brief performance, gets involve us with her undeniable talent and charisma. Stanley Tucci shone as the implacable agent behind the traces of Kilmartin. This is the actor that (in my personal opinion would have reached the peak performance as Gerard Lieutenant in The Fugitive despite the fact Tommy Lee Jones won the Oscar). Tucci has been underestimated by most directors in films like this. Imagine a film with Tucci and  Chezz Palmitieri together in a mob movie. Well there is still time to do it.   Nicholas Cage looked extremely overacted, Vig Rhames is far to convince too. These two performances demerit the dramatic balance of the film, pitifully. I know the comparisons are hateful but please, watch the gradual transformation of emotions experienced by Al Pacino in previous films such Godfather II , Carlito 's way or Donnie Brasco, for instance. The rage must emerge gradually through a wide number of emotion layers.
