 The piano concerts of Rachmaninov are well written pieces though they lack of immortality thristy . The interesting point to remark is the added cosmic breath inmeresed in the purest romantic tradition and that is why the result is surpprising and convincing . You have to Rach in another level . Gieseking makes use of all his skills and Mengelberg the King of Rubato is an excellent support .  But if this was not enough you have the Concertgebouw the second best orchestra in that moment -1940- giving such amazing playing . From the woodwinds to the percusive section , strings and metals . Welcome then to an original reading of these both concertos . My favorite are Richter - Wilowscki of the late fifties and the unique and passionate version of William Kapell in a live performance not released before in 1953 .
