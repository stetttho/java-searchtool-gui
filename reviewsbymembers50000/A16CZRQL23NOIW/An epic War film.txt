 Measure by measure, from Guns of Navarone in 1961, the screen had not been ignited with such adrenaline and high caliber tension like in this movie, directed by Michael Anderson. The Nazis after unfruitful attempts, have developed a deadly rocket weapon, that being programmed miles away is able to destroy any special target.  The Allies are informed about this new device and a command of brave men are sent to try to avoid a cataclysm on England, Europe and eventually the rest of the world in case this project would materialize. The script is simply brilliant and will generate a whole range of emotions, from the identification process made with real characters assumed dead. They will be exhaustively trained to surpass the inexpugnable circle of research and development around this death-dealing secret weapon and so to detain this dangerous objective. George Peppard is incandescent and credible in the film, Jeremy Kemp, Tom Couternay and Lili Palmer but to my mind Sophia Loren simply dazzled with her undeniable beauty but her high demanded role is far to be satisfied, possibly the only default in the film. She did not t get to assimilate the inner tension of this widow. And that aspect was a true mystery due she got with Two women only four years ago a superb acting with a much difficult character. It would seem she was extremely spoiled, pitifully.
