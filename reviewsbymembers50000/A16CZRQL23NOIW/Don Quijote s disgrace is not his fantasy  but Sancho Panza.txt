 This bold statement of Franz Kafka resumes the true essence of the meaning of this surprising, captivating and still engaging book through the years. This was precisely the year in which we are just celebrating the 400 th anniversary of the first edition of this first order level work. The Spanish writer Pio Baroja affirmed once: "Don Quijote is like love; when it recovers the judge is because it's just dying". The tribulations, mental disorders and the fuzzy logic that inspires his controversial actions are far beyond the simple and cold cerebral analysis: you must be in anagogic level; the fourth level of the consciuous according Goethe, in which the coordinates of the pure reason simply vanish and the doors of perception open before our mind. It a stargate (to employ Roland Emerich's film) , where the presence of a simple woman becomes to him in his muse: Dulcinea del Toboso and his reason for live. Sancho Panza will be his link with the real world, his counter weight living: Eros and Psique's myth once more reborns.    Rivers of ink have been employed to describe the outrageous behavior of Don Alonso Quijano who tired of being himself (after reading countless adventures never lived by himself) decided to leap the twilight zone and from being a simple spectator transforming himself in actor -for better or worst- to change the world in his epic attitude.  I just want to add you must read this book at least four times in your life, because as a true masterpiece, its meaning changes according your values, interest,maturity and mental growth. "It's a great pitty the nuts don't have the right to talk about sensately about the madness of the sanity persons"                                             William Shakespeare
