 Seen under the most objective perspective, there have been eight films that have transcended by far the barriers of the conventional frontiers and have become by themselves in authentic wasteland pictures. The breakthrough with the most of canons have been made and surmounted with such level of intensity to constitute apart worlds.  This film is obviously one of them. The astonishing lust and chilling visual realism will shock you from the first shots. The excesses of the passion had never been shown with such dazzling nakedness ever before.   The other seven films to my mind, would be: Alain Resnais Night and frog, Pasolini `s Salo, Fassbinder 's Querelle,  Marco Ferreri `s  Le grand bouffe,  Ichikawa `s Fire on the plains, Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence and Cavani 's La pelle
