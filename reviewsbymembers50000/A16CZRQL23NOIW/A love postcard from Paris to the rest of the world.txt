 There have been successful albums of instrumental music along the times, but this work contains a basic element. It is made with the best French Romantic themes of the City Light, includes between the members a prominent musician; a trumpeter named Miles Davis and it is conducted by this hyper talented General musician: Michel Legrand, who reached with this work the apex of his lifelong career.       I think this is the best album of Instrumental music ever recorded, despite the fact, more than  fifty years have elapsed.   This is my last review of this year. My best wishes, appreciated readers for you in this new year 2006 plenty of triumphs and entire satisfactions in all orders.
