 At last we are in front of a clever movie far away from the standars issues who gambles hard and never looses . The movie is a cat - mouse film , that slowly becomes increasing in tension and inner drama .  Tim Roth is a mosnter actor . He carrties at least the fifty per cent of the film under his shoulders . The script pays a glorious tribute to these dark film noir of the fifties . Roth is framed about a prostitute's murder . In the inquiring process , you'll find the law is out on its mind , due both investigators are full loaded of little nasty private profiles , but since they represent the status quo , the law has to walk in a straight line , and never failing . The slow process of the facts will carry to a interseting laberynthic game .  This film is a cult movie . An interesting approach with some bits of the Silence of the lambs and The offence . Nobody is innocent is one of the multiple results obtained after the film ends .  Mesmerizing all along the way!
