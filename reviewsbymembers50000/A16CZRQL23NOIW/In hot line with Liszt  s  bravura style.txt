 The flamboyant pianist style of Horowitz at the piano made reemerge in North America the egregious figure of the virtuosi per excellence, a mass phenomena lived in Europe eighty years before when Sigismond Thalberg, Franz Liszt, Carl Tausig,  Charles Valentin Alkan, Carl Czerny, Anton Rubinstein, Louis Moreau Gotschalk, Hans von Bronsart, Ignaz Moscheles or Pixis became the true keyboard lions, where in the theatrical stages still persisted the concept: "To use the music to play the piano."  Horowitz in his double condition of exiled and legitimate descendent of the last Romantic Russian School found in Jasha Heifetz, another emigrant (from Vilnius, Lithuania) and Arturo Toscanini similar exponents of a common cause. To enthusiasm the new generations of American newcomer listeners and simultaneously to develop as certainly happened the raise of an impressive number of emergent soloists in USA.  This fact explains why Horowitz did not cause the same impression in Europe, terribly involved in Wartimes, whose main soloists emigrated in search of a major promissory future.  Nevertheless, these works seemed have exerted on Vladimir mood a substantial return to his musical origins. The musician and not only the virtuosi, opened his soul in these performances.  Something similar can be felt respect two other composers so beloved by Horowitz: Frederic Chopin and Robert Schumann.  Do not doubt for a second and go for this album. Absolutely rewarding.
