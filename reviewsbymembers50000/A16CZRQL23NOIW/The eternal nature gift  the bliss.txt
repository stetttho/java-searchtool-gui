 Francois Truffaut depicted a clever and brilliant sociological study about the huge emotional impact that one far descendent  from Don Juan in the modern times caused in all the women he loved through his life. Despite the surrealistic plot, the smart dialogues illuminate the essential female soul.  Made in 1977 , this movie contains, nevertheless, the conceptual roots of the renewed New Wave and its a very funny and carefully well made film. Oskar Werner and the always beautiful Brigitte Fosey give all their best so the whole cast. Another triumph in Truffauts career.
