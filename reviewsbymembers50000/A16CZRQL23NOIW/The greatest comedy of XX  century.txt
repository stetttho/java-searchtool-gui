 Billy Wilder shows us once more his great skills as director. His versatileness allowed going from the drama (Sunset Boulevard) to the reflexive Stalag 17 and create a classic film noir as Witness for prosecution. In this case, Wilder throws his glove to the sand about two musicians (Lemonn and Curtis) who are witeness of a multiple murder between members of the mob. This starting point will origin a progressive mistake comedie when they decide escape from a sure death, dressing femenine clothes. Never before in the cinema there has been such a lot of laughable situations and suggestive jokes. Remember the presence of the eternally unforgettable Marilyn Monroe, who is the perfect balance in this movie. Nobody is perfect is one of the most famous statements endings of any picture ever. Please, acquire this one. Lemonn is fine and Curtis is in his best achievement.  Dazzling script and brilliant direction. An eternal gem.
