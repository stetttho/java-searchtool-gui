  The artistic personality of Artur Grumiaux was undoubtedly very sober. In comparision with the warmth of a David Oistrakh or the powerful musculature of Heifetz, his golden and flawless intonation was if I may, unique. His sonority and style did not belong to bravura style. He was an accurate and impressive violinist. His Mozart is crystalline and innocent. Once more, his presence in various  performances in Prades Festival transformed and even improved his spelling touch. As you know all the artists who participated in this unequal Festival acquired a giant dimension. It is not by mere hazard that names of the height of Joseph Szigeti, Eugene Istomin, Rudolf Serkin, Sandor Vegh, Isaac Stern, William Kapell, Clara Haskill - above their innate skills - experienced Casals' spell. And because of this experience there was an immediate rapport with Clara Haskill and recorded one of the most incredible sets of Mozart `s Sonatas for violin that I'  have heard ever. And, despite his brief existence 1921-1986 his name will be resounding in the world of the violin during years and years. His honesty and integrity , technique and musicianship, self possession and aristocratic feature confer a special honor place. Go and get all what you can about Mozart, Faure Sonatas, his Haendel sonatas for violin, his Debussy Sonata, Guilleme Lekeu, Paganini 4th, and his version of Franck's sonata for violin is one of the most lyrical ever recorded.           An unforgettable artist!
