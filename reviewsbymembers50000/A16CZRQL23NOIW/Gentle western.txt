 The initial shots with the nervous camera, showing the adventures of these original criminals, constitute a visible homage to the Train Great Robe: the initial seed of the cinema: when the movie was born in 1897.      The enormous and everlasting attractive of this masterpiece, resides in the happy blending of action, and comedy. It just a nostalgic gaze about two outlaw, wanderers, Butch and his fellow friend Sundance Kid, who goes from town to town, making the best they can.  Butch's great project is Bolivia, his personal paradise, far from the madding crowd.  This amazing portrait, this charming and even candied vision of the world in the last days of the XIX century , agree totally with let's say the landscape of the Wild Bunch, where the main values had a clear counter flow direction with the rules of the establishment: easy money through the minimum effort.   This film is not only an exultant gaze to the life but besides, another unexpected angle vision about the classical bad guy stereotype: humor. They own good taste, even they are lovable and charismatic: Redford and Newman had never been best: they established an immediate rapport in camera, that allowed to win three years later in The Sting under the service of the same Roy Hill.  A true American icon!
