 We are accustomed to enjoy of Pat Metheny, because between so many things he is a very honest artist. And many of his projects challenge the establishment: this introspective album waits for you. The jewel of the crown is to my mind, September Fifteenth (dedicated to Bill Evans' memory), in which we admire the warmth and simple but expressive tribute paid for Pat and Lyle Mays. As falls Wichita., the extensive piece of 20:42 is also a very experimental theme, with interesting sounds of Nana Vasconcelos.        This album is for you, to listen in a very special fall evening watching the leaves falling, or driving by the innumerable landscapes of USA or Europe with your beloved couple: a magnificent accompaniment if you are stressed or in a special meeting with friends. To me this album belongs to the reduced list of the best three projects of Metheny till the date.
