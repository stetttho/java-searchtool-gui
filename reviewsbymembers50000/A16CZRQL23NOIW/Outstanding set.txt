 To win conducting Bruckner demands from a director several issues . You must have a first order orchestra ; second your rapport with the orchestra ; third Bruckner symphonies are a real challenge they are real difficult works because you have to maintain the sound all along the work ; fourth: the different mood changes and the running time of every symphony demands a serious analysis and commitment with the inspired and rapture melodic lines inmersed ; fifth : to underline and emphasize the sforzandos , the dramatic accents are almost an epic achievement ; sixth : since the undeniable influenc of Wagner in Bruckner you have to keep the balance and obviously to have studied Wagner in every work and consider the fact if Wagner would have lived twenty years more Would it sound in the brucknerian mood?  and if all the previous factors were not enough , you have to consider the giant directors in Bruckner : Wilhelm Furtwangler , Hans Knappersbutch , Jasha Horenstein ,Carl Suricht , Horst Stein and obviously Eugene Jochum and the most remarkable Bruckner conductor in the actual times : Daniel Barenboim . Jochum was a noble man and he had another important point to his favour : the orchestra : placed in the East Germany kept his sound due the isolation in the thirties forties and fifties . I underline this because the character and presence of similar orchestras as the Gewandhaus of Leipzig let obtain a pure sound ; and not a traditional vision . This set is relevant in your collection because the standard level of every work is very high and often inspired . So it is easier for you to make a musical journey all the way. I really recommend to you .
