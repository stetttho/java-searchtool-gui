 Alfred Cortot had three important pupils. Clara Haskill, Samson Francois and Dinu Lipatti. Lipatti was undoubtly, a poetry. Remember that the term poetry comes from the greek poyesis that means creation. His apolinean playing was supported by an aristhocratic approach in every piece he preformed. His brief existence like Kapell, Neveu, Cantelli and Rabin, was not an obstacle however, to understand why the world lost one truly keyboard genius. This recital is one of the most important achievements in all the musical story. Lipatti went far beyond the legend. Buy this CD and youll feel after listening one painful statement. Actually just a elite of musicians performs in this mood. Something was missed in the craft interpretative.  A sign of decadence?
