 Samson Francois, the sublime poet of the piano, was born on May 18 1924. So given the fact this would be his eighty-two birthday it is pertinent to remind him.  Gifted of a superb technique and a marvelous tune, he literally conferred to his interpretations a touch of class scent and astonishing neat, made of his Chopin an aristocrat sound, a diaphanous phrasing filled of supreme beauty but never, never romantic. He played making the facts led to feelings and not in the opposite way as most of pianists.   If you still have not heard him, it's time for you to go for Francois, a remarkable pianist whose time has not come yet by unexplainable reasons. In Europe is a cult pianist, but in North America and a good portion of South America is still an unknown artist.              Finally let me recommend you four treasured sets of these Waltzes: Dinu Lipatti, would be my first choice; then this one, Alfred Cortot and Artur Rubinstein, but beware I am talking about the set  of the middle Thirties.
