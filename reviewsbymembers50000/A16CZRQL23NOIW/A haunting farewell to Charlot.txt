 Brilliant and splendid story of the raising Charlot till his stardom with meticulous insights about his private life  love affairs . From start to end a delightful and poignant film . Attenborough repeated another bio after his successful film Gandhi and made a superb movie with a magnificent cast and extraordinary and vivid locations . Robert Downey Jr. deserved to win the Academy Award for this one and Pacino deserved it with Godfather II . But you know ; sometimes , the logic is so elusive.
