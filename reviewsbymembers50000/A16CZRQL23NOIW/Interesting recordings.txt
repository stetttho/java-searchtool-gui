 Glenn Gould interest for Haydn was for many of his followers a weird challenge . Since Haydn piano music has always been ranked to intermediate priorities for the most of the pianists, his music has been somehow in a kind of zero atmosphere just waiting for someone who really loves his spirit.    The list is really reduced.     In the forties a spectacular hungarian pianist : Eddie Farnadi .    In the fifties , I remind two remarkable pianists: Nadia Reisenberg and Paul Badura Skoda.    In the sixties Backhaus.     In the early seventies , Malcom Frager . But in the last seventies and early eighties Andras Schiff recorded a very important series of Haydn piano works .    In this sense Gould decided to break the prejuices about the naifness about Haydn piano sonatas and certainly he played Haydn without that kind of affection so typical .    His performances became in a revelation . The frehness interpretative , the inherent humor sense , and the remarkable intention in considering a Haydn with his own musical stature and not viewed as a minor Mozart or a composer who belonged to a determined age .    These esthetic considerations affect in superlative degree the final product you play .    Consider for instance two brief examples . Are you sure about the Czerny sonata (Hilda Sommer)is just a minor work ? or the preschumannian sonata Op. 8 of Norbert Burgmuller (Adrian Ruiz) is just a classic and minor piece , only because Burgmuller lived only twenty six years? .    Gould accepted the challenge and won .    Acquire this set and you will be rewarded. Independently if you are a minor admirer about Haydn piano music. You will not be disappointed.
