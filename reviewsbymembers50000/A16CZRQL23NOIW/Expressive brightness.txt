 To talk about Sviatoslav Richter `s pianism is to talk about a top legend in the keyboard. In this recording we can appreciate once more his notable skills. This album is an additional proof to support his kaleidoscopic repertoire.   The special approach he had for Scriabin, his description about the game of lights and shadows,  makes of this performance a collector item.    His Schumann is deeply introspective and aristocratic and his Rachmaninov is unbetable.   I recommend with intense fervor and without dilation  its acquirement.
