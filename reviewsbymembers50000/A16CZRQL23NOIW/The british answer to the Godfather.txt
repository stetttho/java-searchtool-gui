 The clever script allows to build a sollid story. Bob Hoskins surpasses all his performances, past, present or even future. He gave the best performance of his monumental career. The progressive tension around Hoskins literally overflows the screen and struggles us. That hopeless, that certainless of facing against an enemy of the IRA dimensions and the irreverent mood assumed by Hoskins in that unforgettable dialogue with his american partners lead to a smart and unexpecting ending. Helen Mirren , combines her talent and amazing beuty and Pierce Brossnan has a little cameo in the end of the movie. Under any circunstance you can avoid watching this brilliant and even underrated film of the eighties.  A true gem.
