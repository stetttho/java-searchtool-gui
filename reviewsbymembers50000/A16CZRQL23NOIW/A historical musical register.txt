 Consider this fact: the Fourth Piano Concerto was made as part of a Pablo Casals memorial concert, recorded live at the Marlboro Music Festivakl in Marlboro, Vermont on July  7. 1974.  Serkin made a fabulous reading about  this work. The very slow introduction of the First movement is splendid. The spirit of the Maestro seems to surround this musical encounter.  The Coral Fantasy is simply mesmerizing, Serkin plays with such level of playing out of this world, the balanced musical accompaniment, the admirable baton of Peter Serkin and    the Chorus singing with sidereal conviction, make of this performance an absolute treasure.  I acquired yesterday night and my recommendation is total. Try to get it as soon as you can.
