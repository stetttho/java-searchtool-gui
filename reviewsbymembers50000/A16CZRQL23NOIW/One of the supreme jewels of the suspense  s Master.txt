 Hitchcock made three superb yarn pictures around the war under three well definite but visible different perspectives. Lifeboat, Notorious and this one.  This intense thriller deals with a false accusation on a simple munitions worker, he will have to find a way to prove his innocence. And along the journey there will be several admirable metaphors around his lack of guiltiness; think it carefully when he arrives to blind man 's shake. In spite of the fact his blindness the man is capable to perceive what the other men can not see; a visible slap in the face, to the blind justice. Then when he meets a group of circus personages, they will help him too, in spite of the briefness of the crucial meeting.  The dreadful sequence on Liberty Statue far beyond the visual pageant this scenes is invested, is also another testimony about the abominable attitude a simple suspect may become, when the same protagonist has to risk his own life until his last consequences.   The abrupt finale, which has broadly questioned is the expected and accumulated sum of injustice that simply vanishes when the tension disappears.   If I was requested for my five favorite films of Hitchcock, this one would be one of the reduced and exigent list.
