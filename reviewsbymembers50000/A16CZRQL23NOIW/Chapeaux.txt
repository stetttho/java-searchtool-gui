 To qualify this interpretation is to name securely the most symphonic achievement of Monteux along his long and interesting career .  The Franck Symphony is a real challenge for any conductor . Since you have to create a inner tension state without falling in effectism or glamorous fireworks who may be considered cool for the new listener of this work but that approach will carry to tedious sooner or later .  Monteux knew to make "breathe" the work . And therefore he never struggles with overwhelming rubatos or melodramatic soap approach .  The Chicago Symphony worked out perfectly and made one of the top line performances and even historical recordings in the XX century.
