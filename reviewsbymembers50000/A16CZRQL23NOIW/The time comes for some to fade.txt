 The elusive behavior of those golden years better known as the sweet bird of youth is depicted with a reality sense and certain melodrama touch .  The early years between Tea , Sam and Coles are frenetic rapture. And the triangle works out till the time comes for them.  Ten years pass away : Coles has found Claire ; Tea is happily married and is owner of a beautiful restaurant and Sam still has not found her bliss . From here to there she has walked in mirror circles.  Casually there will be a reencounter among Coles and Sam. And certainly they will revive their past and furious sexual meetings. But somehow this spell does not work out.  The ancient emotive memories still permeates the soul of Coles. He definitively has not grown up and still pretends to play in two stages. He like Narcissus, only loves himself and the rest of his affairs work out as a secure support for his disastrous self stem.  As you know, the domain in love falls back in whom loves less. But this last experience with Venus will define for Sam a crucial cross road. Coles still has not learned anything about the sensible difference between the sex by itself and the love as a whole.  The film bets hard but the wager did not go far beyond the door of the dark room. Somehow this film remitted me to a much more mature work in the last eighties: The woman in flames.  Something happened with this movie in which you can feel the ending is not absolutely natural. It seems after you decided to break the rules, you insisted in going back obeying the moral principles instead of walking to the tragic consequences, because I think this picture had all the basic ingredients for a moral fable but also a tragic ending: was there fear perhaps to follow this road?           Good performances specially of Mark Ruffalo. Excellent camera work and memorable angles shots with perfect illuminating. Interesting plot but it promised much more than what it offered.
