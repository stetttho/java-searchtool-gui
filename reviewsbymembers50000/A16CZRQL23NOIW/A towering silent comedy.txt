 The cinema lovers will always have a profound debt with these two pioneers of the American Comedy: Buster Keaton and Charlot. Leaving behind their stylistic differences both showed you can turn instantaneously a tragedy fact in a comic anecdote.   In this particular film, Keaton - through his sparkling imagination - creates an epic of the comedy, plunging in the hazard waters as the Civil War around a stolen train. The set of derived vignettes will lead by the most imaginative and ever funny situations. I love this film from the first time I knew about it (in 1965) and the gradual importance achieved makes us think that it has deserved a very special in the memory of the collective.  A silent classic.
