  This is a splendid adptation about the famous character, pregant of this double moral and sense of the opportunity. All the ugliness you can imagine and still more is treated with eloquence and superb heart rendition.   Depardieu made one of his sublime performances in all his brilliant career. This adaptaion is made with resources economy , but what a passion and delightful of the spirit's maaning.  Alejandro Casona, a famous Spanish writer told once that there wasn't any serious issue that it can be told in a funny style. That's the clue for that overwheming and outstanding performance. Depardieu also directed and conceived the artistic direction. A real tour de force and definitively an artistic triumph all the way.   A must for you to acquire this. I recorded it from TV cable and then I acquired in this format. I will be one of the first on the line when this work be released in DVD format. A feast for your eyes, soul, spirit and intellect!
