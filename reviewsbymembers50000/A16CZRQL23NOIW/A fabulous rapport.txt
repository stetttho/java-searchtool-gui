 Yehudi Menuhin and Glenn Gould made an efective team, in spite of their well differenced approach respect many musical considerations.  Menuhin was the romantic spirit, Gould the iconoclast msucian; but something magic happened when both of them shook hands and exchanged ideas and opinions. It was a secret but visible reciprocal admiration that allowed them to work out to perfection levels.   Menuhin 's gentle warmth was an overwhelming player and Gould gave us the best of his talent in an historiacl album that deserves to be part of your privileged collection.  A must-buy CD!
