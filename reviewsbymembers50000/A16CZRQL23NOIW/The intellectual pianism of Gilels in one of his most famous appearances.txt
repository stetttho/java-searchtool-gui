 Despite of the fact the well know interpretative coldness that constituted almost a trademark of this notable pianist, I want to recommend you with special emphasis this historical performance of August 17 1972, a live recording made in Salzburg.   The jewels of the crown were Mozart, Brahms and Debussy. I think his Stravinsky lacks of Siberian flame and this required touch of fierce wildness.  Admirable recordings that have become through the years in cult performances. I knew about this performance thanks to a friend of mine who was present and told me about this legendary recital in 1973.  Totally recommended without reserves.
