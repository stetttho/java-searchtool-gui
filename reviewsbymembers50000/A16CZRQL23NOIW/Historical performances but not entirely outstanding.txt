 The team Horenstein-Wild achieved a very remarkable distinction with this set of Rachmaninov Piano Concertos. Maybe Wild was too analytical, reserving the excessive Romantic burden for determined passages. To my mind the best interpretations are the First and Fourth ones; in the Third did not play the Diabolic Cadenza(and that is at least for me, a cruel deception) and the Second has unbeatable performers (The two well known versions of Richter and the sublime live recording of Kapell-Bernstein in a recent edition of Music &Arts never released before in 2004).  In what Paganini concerns, forget about it; Kapell-Reiner still maintanis its absolute leadership.
