 This drama only can be understood with historic glasses. We are in the middle of the bloody and terrible racial conflicts and this drama tends to show the lightened side of the coin. A blind woman , her overprotective mother and her black boyfriend conform the dramatic triangle in this paced movie loaded of mankind and noblesse.  Poitier and Winters are perfect.
