 To let the music speak for itself with the minor possible interference, keeping in mind the right tempo ought to be, loaded with an enrapturing sense of commitment and so self convincing the music has its own values far beyond the dazzling common conventionalisms and gallery 's applauses.    The febrile intensity of this work is admirably expressed in this superb performance. Weingartner was a strongly conductor molded by all accounts, for the spirit of the XIX Century. The existential anguish, the sense of the precognition far divorced with the great dreams of new airs of Industrial Revolution may be felt all along. There is not only a magisterial musical result,; there is besides a statement beneath the score.   That 's in last instance, the awful breakthrough between past and present in musical direction. I am not absolutely convince about if the musical direction must be studied. If we rely to the results and consider Frtwangler, Toscanini, Giulini, Fricsay, Walter, Damsroch, Koussevitzky, Erich Kleiber, Jasha Horenstein, Guido Cantelli, Rudolf Kempe, Adrian Boult, Talich, Scherchen , Adler, Barbiroli were merely amateurs in this field, it would seem to have a deficit according the results. Of couirse, there is minority of clever, promising and well famed conductors, but are not the majority but the exception of the rule. And that 's not a good symptom.                   Beethoven `s Third Concerto is superb; ornamentally showy, admirably imaginative and sumptuously phrased; the conjunction of both visions worked out to perfection levels.   Magnificent version; eloquence and pronunciation.
