 Roger Williams has been much more than a simple piano player . He is to the instrumental music what Sinatra means for the crooners . Simply the best. This selection is just the top of the iceberg of that unequal interpreter of the easy listening music . I expect the new releases of the best of Forties, Fifties and Sixties . Forget about other pianist who can match with his class , charm , style and refinemnt . That's why he is Mr. Piano.
