 John Huston made - in my personal opinion - his masterpiece with this movie . Inspired in the most shakesperian mood , Huston tells us the story of men in search of gold and the raise of the unknown dragons who live in the deepest of his soul . The greed  that primary instinct - loads the screen . Bogart in his most difficult role , won the challenge . The picture is the best shakesperian western ever made. All the prizes for Huston were widely deserved for this cinema jewel.
