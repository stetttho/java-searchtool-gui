 Though I am not a consequent of Entremont 's style, I must acknowledge Entremont was in very good shape, those evenings with Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra, specially with the Fourth Concerto. He caught the required lan and marked bourgeois style, with the adequate bright sound, so typical of the French Orchestras.  Of course, the hitherto per excellence still belongs to Robert Casadesus who in recorded an admirable performance under Rodzinski in a live performance still available.  I have problems with the second Concerto who finds in Jean Marie Darr and Artur Rubinstein their most remarkable performers to date. Entremont employs excessively the pedal and confers the Concerto a certain dryness and rhythmic untidiness, that joined with a glassy sound of the Orchestra really draws badly the whole meaning of the piece which, somehow would seem to coincide with Oscar Levant when affirmed about this work: "It starts like Bach and concludes like Offenbach."         Fortunately Leonard Rose saves the game with his fabulous approach of the Cello Concerto.
