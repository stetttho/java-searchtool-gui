 Lewenthal belonged to that dinasty pianists who held his flags inthe name of unknown and almost vanished works of the late Romanticism . His Alkan sounds fiercely convincing . Plenty of mercurial energy and wildness .  The Hexameron is unique and by far the best in the market . His Liszt playing was surrounded of such commitment level . And to prove this statement I will comment from Raymond notes in one of his vynil records the astonishing writings.  Since he played List Totentanz , he felt the duty and the bliss to fly to Italy for inspiring himself in the most authentic mood . This fact reveals till what kind of volcanic passion he felt when he played.  Lewenthal will be remembered for just a very reduced minority but his place in the Fame Hall of the american pianists is a fact .
