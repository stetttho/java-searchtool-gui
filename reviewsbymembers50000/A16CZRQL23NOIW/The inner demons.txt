 This fabulous suspenseful thriller amazed the world in those late Seventies. The notoriety `s fear and the introversion of a failed and shy ventriloquist, will conform an admirable exercise of the purest suspense, arousing inner demons. This work still remains as the greatest horror thriller of that Decade sharing honours with The Omen, The exorcist and the Sisters.    Richard Attenborough, Anthony Hopkins and Ann Margret constituted an overwhelming trilogy unable to fail or lose. If you go for the famous "Dead of the night" and watch the last episode in which Michael Redgrave plays a similar role, we can conclude this picture is, perhaps a heartfelt tribute for that legendary movie, considered for many as the Gran daddy of this genre in those times.
