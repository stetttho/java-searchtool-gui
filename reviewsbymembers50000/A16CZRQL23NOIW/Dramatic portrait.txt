 Paul Tibbets-Enola Gay both names that mean part of the history. This is an absorbing subject, carefully handled about the officer who piloted and drooped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.  Even I think Taylor wasn't the most appropriate actor for this role, ( I just can think in three names for that moment: Robert Donat, Fredric March and Michael Redgrave) and the film surely would have elevated to a major status. The only default to my mind is the real nightmare derived from this action; the awful sequels that surrounded the mind and personality of Tibbets are simply absent. There was a very long introduction showing the backgrounds.   A well supporting cast accompanied him. Good point for Melvin Frank. Two years later after this film was released,  the American journalist William Bradford Huie wrote the most documented text about this subject. Try to get this important historic testimony.
