 This is a smart retelling of the Dracula legend but with a great difference . Coppola focuses his attention in the origin of the story back to the XV century in Rumania according to the directing spirit of Bram Stoker. Coppola not only turns an interesting device in the sequence when the doctor makes the blood analysis and it is shown to the viewer the clear reference to HIV . The directorial refinement of Coppola once more  makes it feel in his personal homage to Jean Cocteau 's Beauty and the beast and Polanski's Repulsion in the high tension of Dracula behind Ryder in the house , when invisible arms try to catch her . His sight to the Victorian London is simply exquisite. The dialogues are impregnated with sexual references and the frustration and the double moral are suggested with delicacy and fineness with that European taste and the obvious influence of an Italian film maker who has always been the special guide , not only for Coppola , but also to Scorsese : Luchino Visconti  In the other hand the artistic direction is visually stunning . Gary Oldman made the most convincing acting in his brilliant career . Wynona Ryder was fantastic too .  Fortunately to us Coppola made his most powerful film in the nineties throwing his hat in the ring with this picture and reminding us he is one of the top masters of the directorial office .
