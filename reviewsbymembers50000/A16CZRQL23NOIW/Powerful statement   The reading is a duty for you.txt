 This book is simply overwhelming. Laura Pozo interviewed to this brilliant thinker . Because Hillman goes far beyond his profession . He is in the real mood and describes with absolute clearity and mighty precison many of the inarticulated process of growing up and put the cards on the table .  This text should be a reference text for every human being .  Amazing and recommendable!
