 Through a simple story, there is a sudden twist of fate at the moment to get into an elevator instead of another. This apparently insignificance may generate by itself a completely different chain of events and circumstances that can delineate your destiny.   Without major pretensions and rigorous conceptual schemes, the picture maintains an effervescent rhythm and adroit script that will hold to your seat, due its intriguing premise.  Fine direction by Peter Howitt.
