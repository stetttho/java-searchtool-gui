 By all accounts, Scriabin may be described as a composer of "avant garde", gifted of great skill, a harmonic innovator and a passionate mystic. He subscribed to a kind of theosophist doctrine, nourished by personal inspiration and partly based upon Hindu philosophies; his internal conviction the man could achieve perfection only through Art has encountered many similar positions all around the word. If you notice, Scriabin `s writing was harmonic (horizontal) instead of contrapuntal (vertical). But, if we make an imagination exercise and establish the horizontality as will versus verticality as fate, we will find then raw material for further discussions.   This Piano Concerto Op. 20 was drafted in 1892 and revised in 1897. It is a finely wrought romantic concerto and for as long as its composer was around to play it, deserved a wide an conspicuous popularity. The Chopinian echoes are blended with the musical roots of his birth land and the typical innovations of the late Romanticism; West and East shake hands.         In spite of the fact I have never heard another majuscule performance far beyond Badura skoda- Rodzinski in those middle Fifties, this recording keeps us that peculiar flavor and powerful expressiveness so characteristic of the Scriabinian lexicon.   Neahaus is a fervent and passioante pianist; master of masters; a legendary icon of the pianist School; his readings contains the Scraibin scent all along the way; easy to describe but so hard to get in those times where the technicianship seems prevail upon any other consideration.
