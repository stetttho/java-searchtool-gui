 After having demolished literally, all the possible parameters, walls and obstacles that became of him the supreme master of the kind and evasive entertainment, through his childhood memories that were inspired basically by the famous Ray Harryhausen, he decided to bet and delineate his first attempt to inscribe his sign in the author cinema. And he went to the roots of the black soul with a slow paced film but told with unforgettable European style, the camera work and edition process are simply formidable.       If I had to establish the first landmark of this acclaimed filmmaker in what heavy weight maturity and artistic stature concerns this would be, precisely my first choice.  Spielberg 's first step to the author `s cinema was achieved with this little gem about the hard times and sad lives of a South `s family. Supported by a concise script and clever dialogues that breath charm ,humor and portrait the poignant innocence of the childhood, Spielberg built a fresh picture, impregnating of his peculiar style and attached in the tradition of Great Directors of the past, you can observe the influence of Douglas Sirk and Frank Capra, with a clinic eye to discover two emblematic figures that later would be widely known: Danny Glover and Whoopi Goldberg.  A pleasant picture that despite the fact it was not immediately recognized, has been able to endure and remain through the years, as proof of its undeniable artistic specific weight. Go for this one, a picture that will always reward you.
