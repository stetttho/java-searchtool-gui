 This is one the most appreciated gems in the german cinema of the middle seventies. The bitter and unstopable process of decay in Katherine Blum is described with vivid expression , overwhelmong camera work and superb script . You will watch a depressive movie and a mature picture . Tasefully made but without any drop of oversimplifications and ornaments . The film is incisive and direct . It plays hard with the sensibility of the viewer . So beware with this movie . Extraordinary film and undoubtedly a master gem of this brilliant director , unfortunately missed in the present time : Wolker Schlondorff.
