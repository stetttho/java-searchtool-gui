 The fascinating trajectory of the distinguished director Ernest Ansermet was always focused on three specific nationalities: Russia ( From the germinal seeds sown by Mijail Glinka , Ipolitiov Ivanov, Borodin, Rimski Korsakov to Igor Stravinsky), to the sensual and suggestive French Music (Ravel, Honneger, Debussy, Faure) and Spain (De Falla). Additionally, she recorded a superb Beethoven 's Fourth and a set of impressive Weber 's Overtures.  Ansermet, behind his accustomed Apollonian approach, from time to time he left his Dionysian spirits flew away.  In the case of Debussy interpretations, he enriched the score with his admirable palette of tonal color and sumptuous Pagan eroticism, imported perhaps from his wide knowledge of the Russian Ethos. His Debussy possesses elegance and sublime melodic flight but also the performing use to be pregnant of a fascinating Oriental twilights so typical from Kachaturian ` s landscapes.   In this sense, the definitive result is absolutely original because he joins the best of both worlds, despoiling Debussy 's music of a certain intellectual approach, so typical in Pierre Boulez.   I don 't have any inconvenient to impress of Mediterranean effluviums this music, because somehow I have always thought there is not music so close to the painting world than Debussy.   You may argue Berlioz too and even to establish a parallel between him and Delacroix, but in strict sense Berlioz is much more inspired by mythic environment and deeply attracted by Shakesperian 's muse.   His Pacific 231 is a must to have it. No other version in the market can beat it. This was a kind "beau geste" of Ansermet for Honeger 's special dedication.  In Ravel 's Bolero and La Valse I have to underline the existence of the anthological performances of Victor de Sabata in 1950 that literally have been unsurpassable to the present.           Chabrier's Spain may be the best option in the market.  And finally Ansermet has an unique performance that beats it: Toscanini NBC, but if you disagree with the orchestral violence in the last movement, this should be your second option.   Go for this album because this element previously cited seem to prevail as a kaleidoscopic cloud, permeating every one of these tracks.   Recommended without reserves.
