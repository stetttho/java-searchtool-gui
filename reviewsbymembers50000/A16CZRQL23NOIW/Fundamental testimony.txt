 The peaceable existences do not use to be genius ` man patrimony . We have come to life for getting our bliss and the most of times you must to fight  for reaching it .   Few times a tragic destiny as Bartok was , a man will have treated with such implacable symmetry . In last instance , Bartok argues talking about The bluebeard castle , we enter to world  with tears and with tears we come out from it . The teardrops point our existence ...  Grillparzer ` s epitaph on Schubert `s tombstone could not be more appropriate to resume Bartok `s life : "The art of music here entombed a rich possession , but even fairer hopes".  For curious circumstances I have been involved with Bartok `s music and this fact has enriched my life gaze .   This book is a passionate, intense and vivid B.B. ` s portrait . The author penetrates with frantic commitment to the interfolds of the soul of this unique musician .  More than a simple advise , it `s impossible for you to abandon your life without reading this biography .  I had the enormous privilege of talking briefly with Gyrgy Sandor - the maxim exponent of his piano music - in that unforgettable December 9 1982 night in Caracas after his performance and he told me among other issues the huge human quality , his shaman  wisdom , the domain of fourteen idioms and the profound influence through his entire life .    And these words of Bartok will talk by themselves : "An ideal folklorist of popular songs should be poly historian , polyglot and linguist , phonetic specialist to watch and observe the minor hues of the several dialects and jargon . Something like a phonograph , in his exact description about the interferences between the music and the popular dances"     It can sound speculation but I have always thought the profound esteem felt by the Russian people to Dimitri Shostakovich must be parallel to the Hungarian people to Bela Bartok
