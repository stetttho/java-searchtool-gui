 This book is a winner . Forget about any other substitute . In this detailed text you will find all you want about every ine of the multiple equations about the heat transfer , clearly and powerful illustrated . The level of the problems are gradually increased so when you decide to solve them you will become in a real gladiator in this topic .  I recommend it deeply . Since I acquired it I noticed the little difference that makes the great difference . This is a heavyweight text and hardly you will find out another better than this .  A must for Chemical , Mechanical and Industrial engineers!
