 The serene and exotic lyricism of this notable work has never been exhibited with so eloquence and majesty ever before. This adagio of Spartacus and Phygia's  passionate performance is imbued of profane exoticism, radiant sensuality and suggested eroticism. As you know the string and winds section of the Vienna were in that decade one of the most remarkable around the world. The variation of Aegina and Bacchanalia is loaded with admirable acrobatic fierceness. Scene and dance with crotaria is simply outstanding. Kachaturian as director maintained the rigorous balance, and the muscle never shatters the expression musical. The last section Dance of Gaditane and Spartacus' victory is extremely interesting, the bass clarinet makes a rapture filigree work,  anticipating the tragic ending. The whole orchestra will emerge creating a real homage to Dionysisus  and surrounding the hall with that Balkan wildness.  The Gayaneh suite begins with the super known Sabre Dance, an admirable exercise of portentous sound and exhibition of high caliber pyrotechnic. The tragic and premonitory omen waltz is almost a perpetuum mobile that strikes the main melody in Aysheh's awakening and dance. In Lezghinka we have to admit the superior histamine doses given by Tekjnavorian . It' s worthy but it is not even closer  to incandescence and febrile spirit demanded: I found it weak, lack of the required emotion.

Hopak is excellent too, reflecting the joy of living so characteristic o this slave country.  Ansermet' s Seasons is splendid though I rather choose the Albert Wolff's  performance of the fifties.          And just as historical reference, it is a must for you to acquire this golden recording. Excellent sound edition.
