 Gifted of a amazing sense of genuine bliss, Fricsay signed several qorks in the files treasures.  This double CD contains works never released before, and it s a must for all these hard fans Fricsay (like me). Fricsay gives us a brilliant performing of the ninth of Shostakovich ; his Hindemith is suggestive and provided of inner passion; for all of us is well known that Fricsay as Dorati were champions conductors in Kodalys music, specially Dorati. In this sense Fricsay was more selective.  But the great surprise arrives when you listen the Eroica. Believe me when I say we are in front of one of the most overwhelming and powerful readings of this piece ever recorded before. Still its understandable how this performance hasnt released before. Fricsays approach is plenty of wisdom. The first movement is eloquent and surrounded of the epic majesty which demands. The second movement is mesmerizing; the hidden voices , the heros death is revealed with expressive force, commitment and deepness ; you know as well than me, this is the central locus of the Eroica , the gravity center of this monumental work.  In the third movement , Fricsay makes sing the orchestra with that glorious beating ; in the last movement Theme with variations , Fricsay depicts every one of them , giving its genuine expressive weight , the last variation , is filled of euphoria and wildness. And thats what exactly Beethoven expected of the leader conductor.  The mythological character of this giant symphony runs through all the performance. And I want emphasize this aspect, its not a question of making a firework staement about the finale. If you are not invaded by the internal values that support this work, youll never win this challenge. If Fricsay would have lived longer, the Berlin Philarmonic status would have kept the same level hold by Furtwangler when he died. A must in your collection. Undoubtly one timeless unvaluable musical document.
