 This was an unusual Western (made precise or coincidentally) in those awful times of repression, bigotry and ideological intemperance, that remarked the ambivalence of values that may reside in the core of an untamed spirit unlinked to any Ideology (the mythic essence of a hero).  With visible resemblances respect two previous movies Ford `s Stagecoach, and Samuel Fuller' s The broken arrow,  the film focuses around a white man who is raised by Indians (the hidden inspiration for Dance with wolves, perhaps).  The final shoot out between the god guys and the outlaws talk by itself. An ambitious film that surmounts the mere adjective of a simple Western.
