 This film was incredibly neglected in its historic context . The camera - eye goes through the screen directly to the crime scene : A Federal Agent has exceeded his ethics principles in order to get a confession when , in the middle of the interrogatory certain details will get out of control.  The admirable flashbacks employed by Lumet allows us to rebuilt all this conflictive puzzle. The sum of so many memories has been burrowing the emotional equilibrium of this efficient agent : the horror , the impotence , leads  him to a serious isolating process characterized by an evident lack of communication with any other person . The frenetic discussion with his wife confirms the statement . He seems to be possessed by a febrile obsession : all or nothing is his inner philosophy .  Few times Sean Connery had been required with  such level of expressiveness  Ian Bannen is superb too as the suspect man.  A mature and introspective film . Another triumph for Lumet .
