 Sam Mendes made his masterpiece to date following carefully the path of golden directors . Think in Billy Wilder to be exact. Watch for the opening sequence. The camera is a butterfly who sets us in perspective with the voice in off introducing us to the center of the drama. In this sense I inmediatly reminded Sunset Boulevard , but this secret homagge to that giant film is not a sin. The script is amazing. It bretahes and allows laughing situations with Spacey and about him , beside the awful emotional crossroad he lives. Andre Maurois told once : There's an age dramatic for the man , in which he is capable to raise the passion in a woman but not satisfying her *. And this idea is involved in this film . Rapture images as the famous roses bed and the face of the teenager Angela Hayes (Mena Suwari) who plays the role of femme fatale , superb performance of Anette Bening and above all , the development of the secondary drama of the troubled officer , makes this film as the best dramatic film in many years ; and that means a great hope for those film makers who seem think that the special effects are fundamental in every film.  And this film is the best proof to deny that false premise!
