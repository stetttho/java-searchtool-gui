 Notorius may be well his most artistic work but Psycho still remains the dark atmosphere that envolves the Norman Bates environment. His hobby refelects the state of his soul , dead as frozen as the animals of his collection< the motel is awful and mysterious as his mind and his house. Just remember there are twelve rooms available , but twelve is just the members of a jury.  And I think this is an underground clue given by the master Hichcock.  In the first take the camera flies and  sets us in a hotel window with Leigh, she commits adultery, and we are witness : then she steals the money and we are witeness again , so in the second part of the picture we just only establish Bates as the evil murder but we forget the opening sequence. In this sense I've always thought Norman acts as the judge sent by the fate.  The rest belongs to the legend. Norman Bates is an isolated guy and even more, a troubled man . The insights in the plot had a brittish ancestor: Peeping Tom, but Hitchcock never forgot the huge influence of the german expressionism and gives us unforgettable sequences. The handle camera , the support in music given by Bernard Hermann, made of this picture a landmark so hard to reach that still remains as a lone winner in the throne of the supreme jewels suspense american movies in any age.  Perkins in his best achievement. An eternal cult movie.
