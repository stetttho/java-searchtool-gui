 The fair acknowledgement deserved by this supreme pianist is far to have been achieved. There are several reasons that could explain it but it's time for us to turn our attention to this outstanding woman, whose supreme fingering and astonishing musical thinking remains year light above many celebrities with major charm and domain of the public relationships, so common in the actual times. Annie Fisher showed once more, with this complex work, the absolute domain of the Bartokian ethos, and as additive element the presence of Ferenc Fricsay ion the podium, result an impossible premise to elude a the moment you consider to include this performance in your personal collection.       The Sixth Symphony is a resonant artistic feat of Ferenc Fricsay who performed with sublime conviction the minimum facets of this legendary Symphony, one of the most difficult items of the Symphonic repertoire.   The Vienna Symphony once more proved its accustomed versatility.
