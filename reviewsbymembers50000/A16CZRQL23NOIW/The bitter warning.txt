  Marcelo Mastroianni made a superb tour de force acting in this merciless story about the cold receptivity and bloody indifference of the actual generation around the   romantic hopes of a beloved father who still believes in the familiar rejoining.  He will make a long journey through Italy visiting every son , giving them a crude moral lesson about the ethic and brutal lack of affection.  But this striking and cold reception will make him to realize the enormous distance between his illusions and the reality.   Superb and mayuscle film!
