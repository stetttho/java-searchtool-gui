 This film is a real tour de force dilema . I have always considered this work as a true example of the leadership vision . In a corner we see the single minded leadership of the Colonel (Alec Guiness) who considers a honor concern to build the bridge demanded for the Japanese authority in the camp.  But there are other wills who see in this fact the possibility to escape and this commitment will be carried to the last consequences .  It is useless to comment it this war jewel , the timeless battle between the epic and the loyalty ; the will against the destiny ; the duty against the freedom . This movie is now part of the cinema story and it is a wonderful example about the leadership means . All the awards this film received were deservedly won . One of the supreme masterpieces of David Lean ; by far, the best brittish director of the XX century.
