 Excellent farewell album to a very close friend ; the unforgettable , and always reminded bandoneon artist the typical instrument of the tango . Di Meola makes a musical journey through his prefered themes and arranges with a fineness and delicate sound , but it never sounds romantic and even old fashioned but it gives him a special accent ; this sad tribute from the deep of his heart . Oblivion, Verano reflections and Cafe 1930 are by far the best tracks of that special tribute to that living legend who was : Astor Piazzolla died on July 5 1992. In Memoriam
