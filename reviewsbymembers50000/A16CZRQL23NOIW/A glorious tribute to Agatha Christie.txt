 Sidney Lumet filmed this mistery and murder story with nuance and european taste of the highest level . Notice for instance, the unforgettable role of Albert Finey (nominated for this as best actor in that year) playing the most idiomatic Hercules Poirot ever made . Ingrid Bergman was outstanding and obviously she won the prize as best supporting actress . But the cast is really splendid . And I wonder seriously if you could get a similar cast at this moment .  Think it just for a moment : the supreme and legendary Wendy Hiller , the lovely Jacqueline Bisset , the villain Richard Widmarck , Martin Balsam , Anthony Perkins , Vanessa Redgrave , Michael York and Sean Connery . A little hard to get it , don 't you ? . The masterful direction of Sidney Lumet and the unforgettable soundtrack (available on CD) could materialize this outstanding novel . You ' ll enjoy every little bit of this unforgettable movie .  And watch for the ending sequence , plenty of imagination and supreme good taste . Besides Lumet knew to pay a sincere homagge to the train , emphasizing the romantic nosthalgy and everything it meant in the european society , the arresting images talk by themselves . This film , Godfather II , The conversation and Lenny were undoubtly the cream of the cream in 1974 .
