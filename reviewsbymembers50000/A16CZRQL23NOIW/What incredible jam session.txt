 Imagine what it must be for anyone of us to have the honour and the proud of playing guitar with your childhood `s idol and even your youth. That blessing gift was in this time for Stevie Ray Vaughn when he recorded with this another monster legend of the blues guitar . May be Albert King never reached the status of B.B.King but without any doubt , he was a heartfelt , honest and sensitive musician . Listening Pride and Joy one of the most known Blues themes in the story , you feel touched immediately for this kind joyful conspiracy .  Call it Stormy Monday was an inspiration of Aaron T. Walker , the pioneering electric blues guitarist from Oak Clift  is a moving piece . Ask me no questions is a clear device to show the abilities of the piano player : Tony Llorens . It is a funny and easy to follow theme filled with grace and fine irony . Blues at Sunrise is to me , the most impressive blues of the album with special homage to Janis Joplin and Jimmie Hendrix serving as introductory and brief speech and since it runs 15:10 the different curtains allow us to appreciate the undeniable virtues of this underground guitar player . Try to get that recording . It is a hidden jewel
