 One of the most interesting consequences of that underground corruption that devoured the combative spirit, the mission and the ethic of so many institutions, was the given answer for many filmmakers who bet and played hard with the great distance between the preventive action, the jailing process and the soft reaction of the high spheres that, in last instance imparted the last word: this long chain tended obviously to break in this last stage. From movies of diverse latitudes, Investigation about a citizen under suspicion, A clockwise orange, Serpico, Death Wish, the problem was focused from two important angles: the cleaning of the corruption in the same level as Serpico, based in a real case, and the take of justice masked of personal revenge in the case of Death Wish. Magnum Force somehow seems to ride between these two waters; the honesty and conviction of Harry Callahan and the absolute divorce of the reality of the high functionaries who only searched notoriety to reach highest positions; and in the other hand the raise of a secret repressive force based in its own codes: Immediate cleaning to avoid the impunity in major instances.  So Harry will face two opposite aspects of the same coin: eliminate one of them and trying to make the best he can in his job. Maybe the only complaint you may have as I do, is the lack of a real punch answer; far beyond the anecdotic facts, going to the nucleus. This genre gave magnificent profits but just a few cult movies in this category and an immense of irrelevant sequels and related films. To my mind this was the most relevant picture of the saga of Callahan; the rest of them were simply mirror reflects!
