 Toscanini was a mercurial conductor, a force of nature and the performances of Wagner are filled with deep commitment , when you play Wagner you must notice the existence of several gravity centers you must keep in mind. Otherwise you can play a lineal Wagner and that would be a mess. The score and the dramatic sequence are so important and even more perhaps that the music itself . They work out as if they were twins , So if you want to win in Wagner you have to maintain in your mind the dyoinisiac and apolinean features in the performance . Beethoven seventh is filled with histamine and powerful and overwhelming rhytm presence .  It's not my favorite Seventh I must confess but it has character , violence and rapture , and with these elements it's very difficult for you to fail the challenge. One of the major achievements of the master Toscanini.
