 House of games is one of my eternal favorites ones. I watch it at least once each year. Its a Pandoras box for everyone. First at all Mamet is a very clever scripter. And after watching Winslows honor six months ago I think hes one of the most creative directors in the american cinema. Joe Mantegna has never been best. Lindsay Cruise in his role as psychiatrist is widely believeable.  Grey my friend is all theory, and green the golden tree of the life. This smart sentence in Fausto, would seem to be the starting point for Mamet about the develpoment of this psycodrama that you may well without too much effort, to classify it as a modern film noir. A famous psychiatrist, that knows everything about the behaviors phenomens of the human being, is really a woman who never has experienced many issues. Suddenly the evil presence of Joe Mantegna will break all her theories , and literally will throw her by a world of new emotions and sensations. An authentic journey by the hidden face life. Interesting script with a high sense of suspense with Hitchockian accents and a touch of Chabrol.This well known and distingued scientist is seduced in the widest sense of the word, by this mysterious man and the world he lives. Slowly youll be sinking with her in the underworld almost without realizing.  Mantegna works out as a link between Mefistho and Don Juan, and he really wins. Dont miss this one. If I had to give you the twelve greatest eighties cult movies, this would be one of this selected list.
