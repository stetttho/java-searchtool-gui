 The stony heartedness of this singular personage masquerades as passion and reflecting his intense affective lacks. Having no emotional center, he assumes the role of tourist of love, without commitment or extension of his individuality. This incapacity to fragment his alter ego illustrates this well know statement of Bernard Shaw when affirms Don Giovanni is not really the man who has possessed many women, but the man who has never possessed any woman, and so when he decides not trespassing the barrier between the innocence and the experience he becomes in narcissistic archetype per excellence. That explains why he every time he feels threatened, runs away from the last with mayor pawn than he runs after the next woman.   This enlightened version has all what you demand from a refined, elegant and passionate reading of this character. One of the most notable and personal achievements of this admirable conductor.
