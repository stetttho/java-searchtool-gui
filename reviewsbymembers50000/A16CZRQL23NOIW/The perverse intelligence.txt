 The dramatization of this true story of Frank Abagnale Jr has been played brilliantly for Di Caprio giving to date the best role of his career . He gives the character the cynicism , the radiant magnetism and the charismatic elegance tomake it possible all the clever tricks through his life . Walken is terrific as his father and Nathalie Baye that greta french actress is perfect in the role . Tom Hanks looks too overacted to be a FBI agent . Can you really believe in an agent with such profile in this exigent organization ? Give me a break! Obviously the script serves to introduce us in the clever world of this mature teenager who breaks all the rules and resolves all the possible obstacles . This talented boy makes the whole journey of the selfish and inmature character . Finally he comes back to the mother embryo and this is the cause for his eventual perdition . Holy Freud and your Oedipus complex you solved the case worked out as a silent and celestial Sherlock Holmes . (Or perhaps Spielberg made a secret homage to the Seven-percent solution that famous film of Herbert Ross of 1976?)    The script is marvelous and meticuosly edited . A worthable work !
