 Simply outstanding and powerful remarkable are at least the epithets deserved after you listen carefully this glorious performance. Gould catches the adequate atmosphere requested by Beethoven. The mood, charm, and rapture demanded in this Symphony. Curiosly this tonality F major has very interesting link with Brahms Third Symphony: this is the call of the Goddess mother.  In the other hand Gould never sounds romantic. His octaves define with brightness, transparency and honesty every little detail in this major work.   If you loved the previous transcriptions made for Gould of the Fifth that signified in that age the world premiere recording, just before the later versions made by Badura Skoda and Katsaris, you will never forget this masterwork of this gifted keyboard maestro.  A must in your collection.
