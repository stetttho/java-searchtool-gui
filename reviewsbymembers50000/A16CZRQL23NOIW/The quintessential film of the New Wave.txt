 Since the first images you stan by literally caught by the huge poetry who emerges. The sad opening theme with a cloudy Paris as frame gives us a striking clue about the film explores. With the amazing exception of Forbidden games (Rene Clement) never before a movie had drown in the child's universe like these two films. Truffaut is far from making a statement. His camera simply spies the emotive familiar nucleus of this nice guy and the terrible troubles generated by his own parents. We laugh, and cry with the disventures and irreverent madness made outschool. The portrait of Balzac burning is a high point in the picture. It's a long journey in the world of this child that well might be you and me if... The plot is very organilcal, and the final sequence is brethtaking.  Hopeless and a sense of desperation seems surrounding us when you watch by the last time to our youn boy. Forget about all the films that followed to this one in the New Wave, like Breathless, les cousins, or Jules and Jim of Truffaut also. This is the gem of the New Wave cinema. In memory of the great Andre Bazin, the creator of the Cahiers du cinema. A must for everyone.
