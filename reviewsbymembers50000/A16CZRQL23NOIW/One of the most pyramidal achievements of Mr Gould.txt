 This record is simply a musical treasure. Glenn Gould made a glorious and breathtaking performance of this score, maintaining an expressive lyricism, and idiomatic approach about this hard to play transcription. Gould knew to express the inner tensions and the force of this quintessential Symphony. You won't miss the original version for whole orchestra.   A sublime masterwork which proved again the huge loss that meant for all the world the early vanishing of this giant keyboardist.  In memoriam: 1932-1982.
