 The initial sequence o the film is loaded of tragic grandiloquence; woman `s job in a railroad station consists in writing letters to beloved familiars or dear friends dictated by analphabet people. She is somehow a miracle worker, who transmits, livings, illusions and hopes from non future people to enrich and enlighten their painful lives.     But soon her biggest task will come for her. A lonely boy, wishes to make a journey for meting his father, and she will undertake her undeniable energy and spirit 's strength to feed the illusions and make those dreams come true for that love 's orphan human being.  This long Odyssey will carry us to lost horizons, to forgotten names of cities that hardly will figure in the map. A surrealistic but real world of sand, kaleidoscopic misery, severe economic restrictions, and above all moral poverty, where the time seems to have stopped for ever, because nothing happens.    After watching this movie, something inside voice must be claming that the Neo Realism Italian has reappeared. And that the only difference between the stolen bicycle and the vanished father is simply a few inches in the map of the world and sixty years of delay.
