  The opening shot with Jeanne Moreau saying I love you to his lover: Maurice Ronet is the real spark which will initiate a macabre plan ; adultery, betray, greed and above all black humor - in a very original feature film, the Opus one of Louis Malle visibly influenced by Hitchcock but under this touch of genius - will be the main ingredients of this chilling story, Miles Davis will be the guest star in which soundtrack concerns , accenting the drama in Paris streets.
