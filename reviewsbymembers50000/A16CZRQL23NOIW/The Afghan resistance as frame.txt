 The strong plot deals with a nasty agreement between a weapon ` mercenary and a Russian General, both of them are engaged in a dark red of corruption and illegal trades. Bond will have to face them until unmasking.  This saga is loaded with admirable sequences, fabulous landscapes and an intriguing script. The first incursion of Timothy Dalton was very gratifying, because at last Bond returns to his origins, far from being a simple Cartoon character since Moore was hired.  Recommended without reserves.
