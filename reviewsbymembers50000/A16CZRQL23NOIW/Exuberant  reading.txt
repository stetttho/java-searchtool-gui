 Since the late sixties(with the glorious exceptions of Rafael Kubelik and Hans Zender , fortunately)  it seems to prevail  to play Mahler music as if you were reading Proust 's memories . So the orchestral executions own energy , precision and virtuosity . Neverheless these ornaments  by themselves produce a dangerous combination of mannerism tedious and handsome results , lacking the exquisite flowing , the arresting tonal color , the candor homesickness , the active memory feed and involved for the accurate employement of the light and shadow , so perfectly suggested in the score . Specially when you decide to perform the Fourth , characterized for brilliant and suggestive melodic lines whose right direction is born from a deep conviction , commitment and knowledge of the meaning of the term : late romanticism . In this sense you may involuntarily draw the performance of  beautiness , incisiveness and elegance , but without nuance , dark poetry or even worst the sinister lyricism that demand the score . Bruno Walter knew impregnate the orchestra of these fundamental elements and won the challenge . He gave the performance the adequate between rage and peace , lyricism and horror , light and shadow , making it breathe and making us participant of that experience . The main difficult of playing Mahler with success is sumerge in deep waters , where the linearity is precisely absent . Walter made simply the most idiomatic , powerful and convincing recording of this work.  A real file treasure.
