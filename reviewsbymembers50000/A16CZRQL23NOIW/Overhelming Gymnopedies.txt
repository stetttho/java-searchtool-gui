 I could state Daniel Varsano was born to play Satie and make of this sidereal contribution one of the multiple objectives of his persoanl bliss.   I must recognize this notable distinction, because there just a few pianists who have been able to play Satie with such flair, incorporean elusiveness and aristocratic refinement as Varsano does.  If you are looking for the essential facets of Satie in those minimalist pieces, don' t doubt for a second and try to acquire this outstanding and original performances; a true musical feat which seems to improve and enhance through the years.
