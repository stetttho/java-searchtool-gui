 This delightful and enjoyable comedy of mistakes turns around the several twists of fate which will make you laugh in a dyonisiac way . Michael Redgrave -one of the top british actors in the century- is specially appropriate for the comedy genre and his acting is one of the finest and sublime through his career.  Dazzling direction and wonderful adapation of the Oscar Wilde work . Consider this film , Kind hearts and coronets ,Pygmalion, Hobson choice , The lavender hill mob , The man in the white suit Captain's paradise , The ladykillers and Caesar and Cleopatra as the best comedy films  per excellence in the British Cinema .
