 If you want to feel the essential spirit of la francaise chanson with all its prisine sound , the elegance of the waltz and that provincial and naif inspiration , then this CD is for you . Maurice Larcange is a real virtuoso but above all he knows how to express the exact intention , the adequate atmosphere to carry the listener to a special environment .  This CD is widely recommendable . The patineurs or the Accordeon Tyrol reminds us to Emile Waldteufel , it is music for enjoying the life ; elusive but charming ; light but fresh as a summer breeze . Acquire this album and you will become instantenously in a hard fan of that singular artist: it will be a great buy .
