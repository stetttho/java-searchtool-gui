 I will keep optimistic waiting for Deutsche Gramophone surprises us the next year with the releases of the formidable performances of Karl Haas in the early Fifties. I still own a sample of these golden recordings, pitifully very damaged in vinyl acetate.   But if I was requested for the other optional versions I would have to mention just four in this rigorous order: Casals Marlboro of the middle Fifties; this lovable set directed by Britten, Mchinger Munich, Nikolaus Harnoncourt set in the late Eighties, and finally the hyper romantic version of Menuhin Bath Festival.      A personal advise: Go to Amazon UK and search the double pack imported from Germany that includes the complete set. The sound is excellent and the spirit and commitment will amaze you
