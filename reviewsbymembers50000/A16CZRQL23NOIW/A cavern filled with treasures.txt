 Ignaz Moschelespiano concert is a hit. I still wonder since the first day I listened why its an underrated work?  This concert is loaded with a lyricism , expressiveness , and honest spirit : Its a romantic concert , but its much more than simply that issue. You feel a sense of hidden majesty and dignity , that youll be wonder how its possible this concert has been less than ignored by the most of the piano players. The Hiller concert os a tour de force concert ; its energic and filled with histamine , very brief but deeply expressive. Carl Reinecke is the other winner concert. You may feel the influence of Brahms , but is Brahms looking to the Baltic Sea. It owns commitment and sensuality! The other works are OK , but if youre really interested in the genre of piano concerts in the second half of the XIX century and you stoll think there wasnt anything new iunder the sun ; then you must acquire these lost and forgotten concerts.  And the presence of this superb pianist, Mr. Ponti give the exact balance to these piano works. They are more than simple fireworks!
