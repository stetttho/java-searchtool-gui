 From the times I watched Viridiana with all its wholeness expresiveness, I had never watched another striking Latin American movie made with such fierceness and dark poetry.  The last supper is nor more neither less, a parable, a powerful and sad story that describes the slow decay process around a family immersed in their ancient glories, unable to asimilate and understand what's going on outside of their geografic limits.  Gutierrez Alea gave us the super masterpiece of the Latin American cinma: Memories of the underdevelopment, a merciless portrait about the crude reality of Cuba in 1968. After having been a public fact and having received all the honors, he insisted to return with his well know bitterness from several angles, and finally in 1976 he decided to get into the soul, and the ancestral cuban codes: the religious sincretism, the racism, the superb, the old glories and the absolute lack of respect for the human being, and we will be able to watch all those aspects throughout this outstanding picture. The sequence in the Supper when the master decide to join all his slaves to enjoy a dinner will become a true hell after the hidden spirits appear after drinking wine. Add that powerful statement pronounced by the leader of the slaves whn he masks with a pig head and says: "One datty the lie died the thruth while it was sleeping and since then the body of the truth walks around the world with the head of the untrue" still resounds in my mind and spirit. Go for this unusual and strong film.
