 Kheyyam signed his name to the immortality with this set of poems where the inspiration motives are specially the wine , th elove , the nosthalgy and obviously the love . Fitzgerald mada a worthable work of translating to English . You feel a real sense of paganism poetry through the several Rubaiyats . Omar was a remarkable mathematician too .  I personally recommend to read this book with the Antar Symphony of Rimski Korsakov as musical background and obviously a sensitive human being .  A real song to the senses and the soul .
