 This album belongs from its initial release to that selecetd dinasty of unreachable peaks in the music.  Grover Washington was so inspired with every one of the tracks that it turns hard to find out such quality level due multiple reasons .  Tonal balances , innovative smooth jazz , interpretative warmth , great and creative sounds , delightful mood and arresting rhytms . Just the two of us (with Bill Wheaters) , Sad Samba or Winelight are songs without an especific age . They sound so natural so fresh that you never fail every time you want to hear them . Try with young people , for instance and you will notice the inmediat rapport . For many of us , who were in the twenties , this album meant to remind great and unforgettable moments . If you haven 't this album , please call to any friend and try to find out more information about the huge influence that this album meant in its age. Timeless album!
