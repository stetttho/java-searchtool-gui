 Oliver Stone has made his second best movie after JFK, in my opinion with this powerful portrait of greeed and power in the middle of the financial capital of the world. Gekko is typical character of those ages. It is not a bad guy, he just follows the rules, bets and wins, so what is the point with that? The newcomer, Charlie Sheen is an idealist young man and his epci consists in twist the fate of this ambitious man who thinks he can move all the chess pieces without any risk. There is just one complaint of my own. Stone seems just to wash the face to the system he attacks, and somehow this restrained gaze weakens the structure of the script. The good customes and the honesty finally win the game but how long can you smile with this bizarre triumph? and even worst are you sure you can talk about ethics in such atmosphere. Wall Street means risk and failure, competence and disloyalty, no rules just basic instinct if you want to survive. There are many common places between this film and Donnie Brasco if you think it carefully. It is the figure of the experience against the youth idealism, but remember Hobbes and forget the innocence in the world. You may become as the central figure of Candide's Voltaire if you think the world is composed bu good and bad boys: the question is survive; no matter how high is the prize you pay by that.  Michael Douglas made the best achievement of his career to date. A kinetic script and glorious camera work.
