 In an occasion Cortot played the first movement before the astute regard of the legendary pianist  Anton Rubinstein: He told him those indomitable words: "Beethoven's piano music must not be studied. It must be reincarnated.". That incisive but smart statement has to do with a grief comment of Menuhin  on 7th December 1954 about Frtwangler: "Each time he conducted a work of Beethoven, he accomplished a sacred rite."  Nowadays the most of pianists lack of temperament. It seems they are afraid to think. They do everything in order not to think. Man has lost his instincts-has lost contacts with himself.  According these Kempff  wisdom observations talk by themselves. "Each of us, ultimately has something like a motor in the soul and is born with an individual range of expression, and it is up to us to realize that range" The whole fulfillment of Kempff every time he played Beethoven's music would seem that assertive observation of Frtwangler: "I could only conduct when the music sounds beautiful"  Having in mind Kempff's  towering musicality, one convinces oneself about his honesty and craftsmanship: And it works out with every composer he played: Schumann, Schubert, Bach and Liszt. He played without apparent effort, without searching boasts of pianist  pyrotechnics or theatrical  effects to get gallery's applauses, but under himself and in the service of the composer. Buy this set; because sometimes the words seems to stain the best intentions and many times insufficient to express the absolute rapture state and total commitment of certain musicians of the highest level.
