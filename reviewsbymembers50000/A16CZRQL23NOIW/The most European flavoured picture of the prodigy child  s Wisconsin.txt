 The highest creative powers nestled in the mind and spirit of this audacious and irreverent director whose produced impact in the world caused by Citizen Kane still resounded in the collective conscious.   Welles did not sleep in the laurels and decided to recreate the declining portrait  of a wealthy Midwestern family and the comeuppance of the youngest member of the family.   Filmed in the middle of the WW2, the film still captures all the quintessence of the sweet smell of the decadence but told with impeccable good taste.  You can even appreciate the powerful and remarkable influence of the supreme Master of the American Cinema who would die absolutely forgotten in a hotel of L.A. in 1948: David Ward Griffith.   A memorable picture that proved once more (if any doubt still persisted after Kane) the astonishing fertile artistic rapture of this untiring creator, the so many times imitated but never equaled: Orson Welles.
