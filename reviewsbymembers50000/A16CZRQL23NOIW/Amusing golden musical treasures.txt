 No matter if the sound is not the best . You and me know the meaning of these recordings . The pleasure of enjoying such trio with this giant trio Thibaud , Cortot and Casals makes you soon forget the delightful sound of DDD for instance . The Archiduke is plenty of soverignity . However I rather prefer the recording of 1960 with Casals (84) , Vegh and Horszowski .  Nevertheless this commented version is much more lyrical than the sixties . Thibaud with his flamboyant and nuance vibrato literally sings all along the work , Casals is the real master and commander in this performing and Cortot knows how enter with his cantabile without forcing or shade the principal voice . The Schubert trio is anthological . To me it was the best recording till that overwhelming version of Stern , Istomin and Rose . You may well consider both of them as one two winners in all the discography .  This album is really a treasure file .  Casals was the most gifted musician - plenty of commitment and mercurial magnetism - in all the XX century . He was the Midas musician for excellence!
