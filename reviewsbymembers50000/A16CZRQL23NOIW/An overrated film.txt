 The classical figure of the antihero in western movies reached the highest level with Ride the high country . But when you intend to make a challenging film with this message ; you should care about the script in superlative grade.  I have watched this film six times from its initial release to find out its esential values . But yet I only find a sincere tribute , a farewell western picture , an ode to a genre that became in a real inspiration motive for almost five decades in the American Cinema . But the emotion by itself is not enough to hold a film . The hero is tired , he is an outlaw , he accepts the challenge to rescue a little town in a nosthalgical mood who reminds too much to The Seven Samurais dramatic structure but in a twisted gaze . Because Kurosawa approach represents a sociological study of the epic spirit ; this movie goes in the opposite side . Eastwood is not convinced about anything , the dialogues intend to express deep reflections about a long time gone . The role of the young boy trying to grow up in this journey has been told many times before and with major virtues . Freeman is OK and Hackman is a villain too much predictable . There are too much common places and similar situations respect to other and ancient films . Go and watch the Naked Spur , the Outlaw , Warlock or The searchers. In all these movies you find a reason for live . All we know the world is terrible but if you face it with an autunum temperament you do not get even a moral triumph , because only when you have the inner force , the individuality sense you can face the world and fight ; no matter if you win ; what it really counts is the way you do . Keep in mind that in the nineties four films won the Academy Award with the antihero figue : This one , Dance with wolves , Forrest Gump and American Beauty .  So the conclussion is obvious . Do not you?
