 The word and the silence. The last opus of Tarkovsky . In Sacrifice , argument and form , technique and style are joined so perfectly that challenge all kind of viewers. Its intimate fascination is quiet and in contrast with the easy cinema , superficial so fashion , demands a contemplative attitude , to be understood justly . The first shots with the dying tree symbolizes the painful spiritual state of the contemporanean civilization . Tarkovsky applies  in this moment what you might be call the little stage of the world , with characters who are at the same time real and symbolic . Adelaide is an unsatisfied woman married in a convenience marriage . Victor is the disenchant scientist with clear echoes of Stalker -1979- (the previous film to Nostalgia) and Martha , the blossom girl lost in her own narcissism. When the atomic attack occurs , Tarkovsky sets his characters in the edge of the knife . Hysteria and terror oppose to desperation . Alexander breaks his inner barriers and he is opened to the trascendence . These are two times of biblical references . Finally you have to keep your word and the holocaust will come . Bitter metaphor : Tarkovsky seems to revel us there is no place for the trascendentalism in the present world.  But the last sequence is loaded with a deep sense of redemption . The child recovers the language and stood in front of the dying tree he begins to irrigate it with the inquiring statement : In the ancient times the verb was , and with the Bach music ( Mattheus Passion ) the camera climbs the tree and links with Leonard painting , the true icon od adoration and offering . Tarkovsky is back in this way to his goal and the method of all his artistic and religious  cosmovision.  Andrei Tarkovsky  ( born April 4 1932)  this superb and talented filmmaker, died In Paris ( December 29 1986 ) and the film was dedicated to his son Aliosha. This film won the posthumous Ecumenic Prize in Cannes .
