 Shangai , first years of the new century. The schoolmaster of Chen Chen (Bruce Lee)is murdered , so his pupil decides to take revenge.  First at all , the films that look around this argument are certainly , countless , but it what it remarks this film is the particular commitment and approach given by Lee . The main rival comes from a japanese bushido school. Lee wasnt an actor ; and thats what it becomes his main strength ; he makes a tour de force loaded with enraged fury with a level of enrage and no mercy sense fighting simply spelling. Lo wei was the director ; and since the plot is extremely predictable ; the charismatic presence of Lee and some kung fu fights are of first rate. Obviously ; this work remains under Enter the dragon level . This last one is hold by a finest script and a a punch cast, but the violence is not free ; it comes from the inside to the outside and thats a good point . I watched this film when I was a teenager and also it became the first time I saw Lee on the screen. But the last sequence fight still floats in my memories. When you leave the exhibition hall you feel the catharsis in its major expression and besides such a kind of cosmical justice! Youll find out in this film interesting clues about the meaning of the Kung Fu discipline , that had in the TV series an unvaluable shelter like David Carradine meant.
