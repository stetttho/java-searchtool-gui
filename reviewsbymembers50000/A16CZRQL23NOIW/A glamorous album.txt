 To name Rio is to remember one of the most memorable works done in the 80 `s by Lee Ritenour . Impressive and high mood . Specially in Rio Funk ; the lovely ballad It happens everyday , the opening track Rainbow a special rendez vous to Rio , his people and its landscapes. The Major league musicians who accompanied to Ritenour the legend : Marcus Miller : the ineffable Dave Gruisin in the keyboards shinning in Rainbow , San Juan Sunset and Rio Funk , Luiazo Nieves in the bass with Rainbow . Listen to Steve Forman in the percussion in Ipanema Soul and Alex Acua in the drums for instance .   This album is a must for all lovers of the Brazilian music and above all the Jazz fusion    One of the five best album of Jazz Fusion in the eighties . The magic acoustic guitar of Ritenour in Simplicidad is filled of Saudade and those erotic effluvious floating in the atmosphere .  And finally this excellent piece A little bit of this and a little bit of that , where the bass of Marcus Miller sounds terrifically expressive and with glorious musical curtains . Rubens Bassini is OK too .  The only complaint I have is the album was very short in its dimensions . I `d rather and I think to be the real spokesman of thousand and thousand people who expected some more of this inspired and mesmerizing album . A winner work!
