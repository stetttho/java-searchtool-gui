 The clarinet has been always in the orchestra the best instrument to draw the the depressive path of the soul . Beware the significative and reiterative use in Tchaikovsky introduction ; as the first movement of the Fifth and the Sixth Symphonies . Aram Kachaturian employs it admirably in his Piano Concert to suggest the melancholy and sadness . Any other instrument might be well appropriate to Mozart in this stage of his life. Written in October 1791 this was the last work apart the little Masonic cantata K 623 . Notice the fact Mozart was writing at the same time the Requiem    for which he had received a commission in July . You van find a certain resemblance between the Quintet Clarinet and this Concerto even the latter is unquestionably more sophisticated , more dramatic and better built in its tragic dimension . It is hard to express with absolute neat the tragic mood . And to my mind only five chamber works are excellent examples to show that soul state : the last quartet of Beethoven , The String Quintet of Franz Schubert op. 163 , The end of time Quartet of Oliver Messiaen , the second string quartet of Shostakovich and the sixth string quartet of Bartok.  I mean: there are not too many in this sense. This version is particularly efficient due its idiomatic character .Jacques Lancelot is to me one of the young promises of this instrument.
