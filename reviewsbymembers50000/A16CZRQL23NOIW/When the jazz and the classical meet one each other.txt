Bartok had never written before for the clarinet and a violin, proposal that he amused. This evocating title indicates the opposition of these three instruments. Even the rhythmic web is complex and the language possesses unexpected effects, the whole audition is extremely pleasant and very clear  The humor delineates all the score even you can find traces of the primordial anguish of his the Concert for Orchestra, for instance, but , despite all these tonal restrictions and sharp dissonances, this work is one of the most beloved and preferred of this notable Hungarian musician, one of the supreme genius of the XX century whose musicality creativity perhaps be matched by his human quality.
