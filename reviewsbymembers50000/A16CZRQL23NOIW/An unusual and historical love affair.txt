 George Sand was the real pioneer of the feminism . Her anti- establishment attitudes and pattern behavior arose admiration and hate but never indifference . The film turns around the crucial period in which Chopin is in Paris with his fellow friends : Franz Liszt and Marie Dgoult , Eugene Delacroix , and Alfred de Musset the ex fiance of George Sand . The camera is a real peeping Tom which allows the viewer to know the most intimate details in the social  life ; the french aristocracy and their manners . Some reflections around the art and the process composing of Chopin . George Sand literally made the male role of Chopin seduction following the indications of Marie . The double moral ; the little scandals , the sudden affairs , the charm and the exquisite vignettes make of this film a must for you to watch and preserve . Jules Davis made an incredible performance as George Sand and Hugh Grant made a Chopin with certain peaks and lows . Grant seems extremely healthy to represent Chopin  . Tim Roth, Daniel Auteil or Bruno Ganz were three better options in 1990 for that fundamental role . Emma Thomsom gave to me her most powerful performance of her career and Bernardette Peters seems extremely cold in her role . I would rather Helena Bohnam Carter, for instance . Julian Sand is splendid as the handsome and outrageous hungarian musician.       Wonderful locations in France and excellent artistic direction.
