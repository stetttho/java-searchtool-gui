 Fantastic voyage is a real imaginative picture. A group of scientists will make a weird voyage , in the deep of the human body . They have just a hour to win in this dramatic mission. They are sent through the blood current and they will have to minimize and destroy a serious damage in the brain of an eminent personality. This film sooner or later will be remade . I don't have any doubt about. But the challenge to win this original film is hard to reach. The script , the dramatic tension along this tour de force , the amazing inside locations around the lungs , heart brain and optycal nervous are first rate! plus the incredible cast: Artur O Donell , Edmund O'brien , Stephen Boyd , Donald Pleasence and the unforgettable and seductive beauty Raquel Welch give this film of Richard Fleisher two thumbs up about the top ten gem sci fi pictures , because he would make five years after Soylent Green another must in your collection. Watch this movie .  A permanent triumph and a gorgeous visual experience!.
