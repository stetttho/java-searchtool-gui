 As you know Emile Zola was the authentic father of the realism in literature. His portraits are so lucidly depicted as you were watching a film. His impeccable and descriptive style is so impressive that it is nothing difficult to get into his world.  Claude Berri had gotten an excellent rapport previously with Depardieu in Jean de Florette and Manon of Spring. In this time we will witness of the rural drama of an impoverished family leaded  by Depardieu, a coal miner who begins to politicize around his fellow partners.   Somehow this novel was an anticipatory of the turbulent days to come only thirty years after, having been written in 1884.  Monumental photography and brutal realism. A winner film all the way.   It is a true mystery this movie has not translated unto DVD format.
