 Jorge Luis Borges radiant magnetism and vital presence was simply overwhelming . When you open any work of this knight word you inmediatly are transported to another level .  Ficciones represent undeniable, one of the multiple reasons which shows his genius touch .   The south american literature had In Argentine and Uruguay six unforgettable writers ; Julio Cortazar , Adolfo Bioy Casares , Juan Carlos Onetti , Horacio Quiroga , Ernesto Sabato and Jorge Luis Borges . In  the genre of the short novel Borges embodies so many ancient and outstanding authors ; Stevenson , Hawthorne , Conrad , and an unfinished list of famous and unknown pen masters . I remeber two remarkable anechdotical episodes of Borges life ; the first was in an interview in which he stated : When I decided to write I became in a second rank writer after being a reader first level (ironic answer obviosly); but the second is simply unforgettable . He was in 1975 on Caracas in a TV interview .  The question turned about how he felt with his blindness (obviously this was a question absolutely out of context and vulgar even) , but Borges answered wise and carefully. I have to thank first at all to Maria Kadama , my loyal and lovely couple : she became my eyes and always have read all what I requested her ; I worked in the Buenos Aires Central Library and always read and read till the midnight almost daily . So I just can say that after having read TWELVE THOUSAND BOOKS in my life , I can say with justice : Welcome the blindness .   The female interviewer remained mude with such brilliant and sincere statement . That was the prize she had to pay for such indiscret,  insolent and delicate question .
