 If the Neo Realism was born with a forgotten film of 1934 named Tony directed by Jean Renoir, you can read frequently that Roberto Roselini has been designed as his Italian father. In these terms, if we assume the cycle initiates with Paisa (1945), Roma citt apperta and Germania Anno Zero, Vittorio De Sica would follow the traces, many people tend to forget a hidden film of Visconti dated in 1943  -Ossesione- , and best known as "The postman always rings twice."  In this sense Visconti knocked the door before Roselini, and his brilliant career,  during three decades until The innocent in 1976 that would constitute his Final Opus..      Rocco is a powerful, magisterial and still actualized film about the life and illusions of Rocco trying to bring back his family the lost dignity. Somehow the striking performance of Alain Delon in this movie meant for him his leap to fame, after his shining acting in Purple Noon 1959. To talk about the art and influence of Luchino Visconti, his slender camera traveling and expressive close ups woul surpass the limits of this brief comment. Go for this superb gem of the Italian Realism in those painful years of the Post War.
