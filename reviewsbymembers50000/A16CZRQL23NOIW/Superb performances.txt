 I consider one remarkable aspect about the reading that Walter makes about Mozart. The point is an interesting point to discuss with his friends who share obviously the passion and love by the great music. Walter has been the only conductor who experienced a musical journey from Mahler to Mozart. This fact became a new Mozartian sound . because Mozart means the long return from the dark shadows , the infinite loneliness and the hopeless , fundamentals aspects in Mahlers music despite another values. And please,  dont forget that Walter was an intimate friend of Gustav Mahler. The Mozart sound generated in Walter becomes in this sense a happy return from the ashes , the new gaze of the hero who was in the hell and makes his reddemption road. Watch for instance his Mozart from the thirties with the Vienna Philarmonic . These works are loaded of dyonisiac enthusiasm , of living enjoyment . The WW2 appears, and however Walter never lost that conception. Even the return to Mahler performances are enriched by this Mozartian accent. Think it the legendary Fourth (my favorite achievement) and Fifth Symphonies from 1947 in this same label . The brief cycle made with the Philadelphia Orchestra once more confirms my opinion. In this set we can feel to Walter playing Mozart with the same approach and loaded with more lyricism , wisdom and above all that epic majesty that you dont listen with the master champions of Mozart in this age. Actually the technique prevails over the inner intention of the score . And I wonder in silent voice: Is this new approach a decadence signal or perhaps a post modernism virtue?  Acquire this set , because the inner conviction and deep commitment established for Walter , doesnt seem in the actuality to be a matter of importance (pitifully). A must in your collection.
