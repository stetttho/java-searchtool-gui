 This is a charming story about a love story of the Nineties. It is filled of spontaneity and freshness. Julia Roberts has never been one of my female icons, but I must acknowledge she has never been best in any other film that I remember. The sexual chemistry between her and Hugh Grant was immediate.  The script is filled of very funny and inventive situations in the best tradition of the British Comedy.
