 This film is deeply disturbing. We are in front of one of the challenging works made from the independent films. Winner of the Sundance in 2001 ; the movie deals about an outlaw from the jew religion who decides to make a breakthrough with his past traditions seeking for answers . Hes a very clever man and very often he made extreme questions to his teachers. So he makes the whole cycle and becomes Nazi as a rebelness signal , but his memories are stronger and keeps in the deep of his soul respect from the learned traditions . The dialogues are a real tour de force , and there are many disturbing questions without answers. And since the movie has rapture moments that will remind you to Taxi Driver and American Story X, the film is far beyond from the other two, and it demands a major attention from you. One of the most powerful cult movies from this new century!
