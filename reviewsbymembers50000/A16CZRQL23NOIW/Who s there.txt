 Hamlet : one of the most complex dramas of William Shakespeare . Laurence Olivier won the Academy Award for this play giving a towering role .   Hamlet is a real challenge for any actor . His character and moods are of a wide range and in his disturbed mind , he knows , he's clear about what has to be done , but in this inner conflict he has too many obstacles , he lacks of force , he is convinced about the blame of his uncle and his mother but his introspective mood and his infinite sadness for your father's death was a simply murder made with all the greed , ambition and merciless . Since his uncle was the murderer agent , he got two objectives , to marry with his brother in law and to assume the power .   Hamlet thinks but in the first three acts he doesn ' t act . And his inner thoughts have become in an authentical object of continue analysis for all we love Shakespeare works .   The revenge in Shakespeare is born from an organical need , the greek catharsis in his purest expression.   And to translate this spirit in a film was not easy . However Olivier made it .   Don't ever doubt just a second to acquire this film .
