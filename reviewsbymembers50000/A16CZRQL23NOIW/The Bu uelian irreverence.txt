 Once more the prodigal son of Calanda makes a very intelligent and carefully satire, cynical and ironic gaze about the religion and its collateral implications when decides to make an extraordinary semblance about certain dogmatic incoherencies and insane behavior as the funny sequence in which Jesus decides to cut his hair but Maria avoids it as any fashion adviser, or the use of nut who assumes the role of a priest discussing about religion in a miserable bar through a true tour de force script. A road movie that will lead us to Santiago de Compostela and besides will interweave past and present where out of mind characters who will make you laugh and reflect. Not for squeamish tastes or sensible spirits. A giant film along the way.
