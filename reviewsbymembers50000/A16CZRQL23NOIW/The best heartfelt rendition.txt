 This musical rendezvous offered by Dave Cruisin surpassed all my previous expectations.  From the first bars of any track randomly elected, you will be immersed immediately in the most sincere and idiomatic surrounding. The arrangements are simply exquisite and every musician was enraptured to his own. John Patitucci  confirms why he was on the top of the line in the list of the best bassists of his generation. Eddie Daniels is simply gorgeous in Clarinet in the track Soon. Gary Burton in the vibraphones, singly spectacular. Chick Corea and Dave make an unforgettable duet in S wonderful. The established Chemistry between Eric Marienthal in Alto Saxophone and Sal Mrquez Trumpet, is unequalled. Dave Weckl and Sonny Emory are terrific in the drums too. Finally it' s meritorious the collaboration of Lee Ritenour in Our love is here to stay. There is no hole in any track. But between you and me if you required my opinion about the three best racks of this golden album I would choose I've got plenty of nothing, in first place, Maybe and Fascinating Rhythm. The idea of open the CD with the same composer playing himself (That certain feeling) was fascinating, it is like to relive to Gershwin and imagining him smiling and happy with this homage of a group of friends.  I beg you earnestly to acquire this supreme tribute to George Gershwin and if you are a classic music lover - as I do - , the petition would be double. Recommended without reserves. The best Smooth Jazz album of 1991. And the sound is simply out of this world. GRP made a superb mastering effort.
