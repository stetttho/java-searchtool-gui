 The Pastoral Symphony has always been one of these works in which the nature 's enchantment surrounds you in a true mythic sphere. There is not any other written score that be able to conducts us to these unexpected levels.     Wilhelm Frtwangler was a director absolutely committed with Beethoven and established that invisible link building the bridge between composer and audience. This tonality: F major is the same employed by Brahms in his Third Symphony, and somehow represents the return to the origins.  That' s why no one has been able to overpass Frtwangler because he always goes to the profundities of the work, as a hero making his own journey. In this sense his approach produces a mesmerizing result because the music comes to be the result of the mythic journey, and not a goal in itself.   It is not a mere casualty in his youth was a devoted admirer of Michelangelo, showing us once more the bold position of Richard Wagner about to get the whole vision through the blend of all the artistic manifestations.   There is a definitive statement pronounced by a musician who was under the direction of Frtwangler and the other that words more, words less affirmed: "With Frtwangler we played music; but with the other made more money."       That 's the reason my appreciated reader that we must regret the painful and early departure of Ferenc Fricsay (49), the elected director suggested by Wilhelm months before his death. He presented that only Fricsay could maintain the absolute commitment and the superb artistic expressiveness of this Orchestra and the time gave him the reason.    Fortunately for us, there have been just five conductors and a pianist who seem to have understood the transcendence of W. F. s spiritual legacy: Ferenc Fricsay (in memoriam), Sandor Vegh (in memoriam), Daniel Barenboim, in minor level the young Thielemans, Franz Welser Most and the pianist: Andras Schiff.
