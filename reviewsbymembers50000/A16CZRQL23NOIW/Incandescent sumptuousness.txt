 It is quite difficult to remain indifferent  after listening these admirable performances in hands of this superb and acclaimed keyboard giant.These Suites not only possess an astonishing originality, but besides an impressive and mature lyricism. Handel never walked by transited roads, the impressive compositional skills subservient to expressive effect are loaded with that cosmic breath and spiritual expansiveness, that left behind Scarlatti, Rameau or Couperin.   So I still ignore why these pieces are not played with major frequency. This live recital finds Richter in 1980 (when he was in his 65) in a remarkable inspirational flight. His technique refinement is masked of that veiled elegance and charm sound without never let be trapped by commercial concessions.   This is perhaps his major virtue as player. His personal phrasing is subservient the composer language. And it ` s hard to find out any other pianist with such repertoire `s amplitude.   No matter if you are not a Richter `s fan. These Suites are hard to find; and additionally so well played with such distinction touch and nuance. Totally recommended.
