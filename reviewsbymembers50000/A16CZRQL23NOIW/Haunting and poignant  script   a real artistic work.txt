 This film is absolutely absorbing and even depressive .  Twenty three years old is an age in which you are so far to think about the death that it sounds less than a sinister nightmare to consider the mere possibility to leave this world in the golden age of the life .  And despite her life is a real tragedy by every corner you examine it , she is married with a man good for nothing , a father in prison , a mother profoundly disturbed by past ghosts. she is always a step ahead and makes of this cruel statement: two months of life the real opportunity of making all what she wanted to do in her entire life .  To consider all these projects in such brief period will make us think about those minuscles concerns which we must face everyday .  The script was filmed with obvious low budget : you miss this detail because pitifully the photograph is very discrete .  The drama lives in the most intimate universe and you can feel this film overslow paced but it is just an illiusion . If you really engage with this film you will never experience this detail.  A mature work and besides a magnificent performance of this young and promising actress : Sarah Poley a future first actress : It is just a question of time .
