 When you make a suspense film in which you add a love story , a serious mental breakdown and a twist of fate in a puzzle tale plus the Hitchock hand , it's difficult to fail. Hitchock made the most human of all his previous and future films . Since a private eye suffers of vertigo due an awful incident , he decides to retire from his profession . But this decision won't be too long . Extraordinary and very well acetd Novak and Stewart in their best. A timeless cult movie and one of the best three fims of Hitchcok!
