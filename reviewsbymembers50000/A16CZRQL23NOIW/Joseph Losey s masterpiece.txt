 Joseph Losey overtook the landmark with this corrupt,sordid,struggling and deacednt gotic atmosphere created where the human condition exposes all its nasty nakedness. Harold Pinter and Losey worked in other themes like Accident but Ive never seen any other film with the only exceptions of Mephisto and Vatel such kind of perversion level. Losey never before directed so well any other film. It deserves to mention a very usual forgotten film of Losey : Mr. Klein where Losey intends a close approach but the script doesnt help him due its predictableness. Bogarde as the servant makes the greatest role of his winner career; James Fox also shares honors and Wendy Craig is worthy too.  Losey made a celebration film ; not only you remember Welles (The stranger) ,the sinister shadows of the glorius age of german expressionism (Murnau and Wiene) but the employement of the famous crossed mirror image sequence , so many times adapted for a lot of film makers of second rate. This is not only a cult movie; its a reference example for all those people interested in how to make a film, but also a must for those cinema lovers and even a sociological study of the fall of the will and slow process of moral decay in any age; its a no mercy view of the brittish society in that unusual decade.  Its not for all tastes, but you are in front (in my personal opinion) of the most sinister movie made in the sixties and one of the best in Brittish filmography ever filmed. Overwhelming!
