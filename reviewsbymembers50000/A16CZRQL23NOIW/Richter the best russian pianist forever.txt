 What can we add to this performance? Apart of its undeniable virtues, the essence of this version is that Richter is always seeking in every one of his achievements. Try with his two performances of Pictures at exhibition (Spofia and Bucarest) with only a week between the two concerts in 1958. The discography about the second concert is one of the widest in the main repertoire for the keyboard. But, however there are so very few fortunate achievements. And Richter prints his skills not only his passionate fire and evil technique, but he illuminates the score. And thats the key why you are able to listen this Symphony with piano obligatto without an atom of indifference. This work demands an exceptional imagination , due to its length, who doubts about the beauty of the slow movement? Richter walks all along the piece avoiding all kind of effectism, and over all in the last movement , he adds histamina and strong conviction.  Leinsdorff deserves a just mention. Because in every moment he conducts the orchestra with the precise approach of being performing chamber music. This is the clue for getting a happy performing, because if you conduct the orchestra in pianos service, you are taking an inmense risk and probably you get a standard version but never outstanding like this one.
