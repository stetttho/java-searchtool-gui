 This landmark film is one the best personal achievements of Truffaut and somehow is the second part of The 400 blows in which the dramatic structure narrative concerns. The wonderful  storytelling pulse is one of its undeniable virtues.   The idealized world of the golden age and the visible contradictions between the youth surrounding and the   oppressive real world are shown with this admirable genius touch that Truffaut owned. Jules and Jim live their own codes and explores everything they want whether is forbidden or not. It is the pleasure and delight of experiencing by itself, his freedom expectations and hallucinating dreams.   Something inside in my mind tells me that the final sequence in Jules and Jim must have influenced the extremely similar ending of Thelma and Louise of Riddley Scott thirty years after.  Coincidence or simple random involuntary manifestations?  One of the quintessential films of the French Wave Cinema!
