 This picture is song to the life. To all of us who bet for a better world, a hope song and an epic torch through the obscurity and ignorance.  A dark and forgotten music teacher got a moral triumph, changing and improving the hopeless life of an Institute of misfit and orphans boys, who slow but progressively will establish an indestructible relationship with this singular personage. A journey through the dark brumes of the time, a reencounter with the lost memories of  the missed childhood and a true statement about the power of the art understood as the only device to follow our bliss.     Another French gem!
