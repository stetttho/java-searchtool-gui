 The most autumnal symphony of the lavish Hamburg ` s son has always been a big challenge for any director. Its kaleidoscopic universe of livings as well as its sudden changes of tempo and modulation (specially in the last movement) constitute one of the most exigent Symphonic works in the wide repertoire of the music.   Just a very few conductors have been able to be successful. In the past we still remind four portentous versions: the legendary version of Arturo Toscanini conducting the BBC in the early Fifties (this set is still available in Amazon U.K.), a live recording (which was never released under commercial license) directed by Victor de Sabata conducting the London Symphony in 1953, another live version conducted by Paul van Kempen in the last Forties and finally the impressive version of Wilhelm Furtwangler and the Berlin Philharmonic.  After these untouchable performances there have been a set of memorable performances: Rudolf Kempe with the Munich Philharmonic, and this one directed by the great master Carlo Maria Giulini, whose masterful approach revives with renovated inspiration the overall mood of the Symphony.     Dignity, noblesse and sweeping passion without never fall in the self indulgency or even the theatrical and tearful posture so typical and pitifully considered in many distinguished directors.   Go for this sumptuous performance. It ?s a very good option.
