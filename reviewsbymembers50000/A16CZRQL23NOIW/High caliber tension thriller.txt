 Despite the plot has been taken into screen so many times, this well handled and better written script around a group of terrorist fanatics who demand the liberation of an important leader , threatening an airplane with 400 passengers on board, is filled of histamine along the plot because it has several dramatic nerves to resolve. Excellent effort of Kurt Russell, Halle Berry and Sauchet as the leader terrorist.
