 I haven't listened previously and pitifully lately, about any other version that can beat these Four Interludes and the Passacaglia. There are many unexplainable cases in the music where it establishes an automatic and obvuious rapport between a work and a director. Bernstein had that special gaze to seek behind the score, and even Bernstein, who was always a hyperromantic director; however in this time he caught the fundamental essence and came to the center of the dramatic nucleus of this work. It owns that urgency character, and existential anguish, reflected admirably through the string section. Listening this performance and watching a Turner's portrait you will obtain the whole and integral concept of what it means the sharp contrast between the man and the sea, in all its greatness and extension. A guide... has had other succesful versions that overcome it, as Dorati Minneapolis, for instance.
