 John Sayles is a brilliant and honest filmmaker. He doesn't need to make big budget projects to involve emotional and passionately the viewer.   This is an intimate portrait around the life of a community almost isolated from the rest of the world in the Yukon heights, where the nature is a towering and invisible actor, in its multiple vestments; the salmon fishing is the principal commercial activity in this town.   The dramatic script will involve with a beauty and promising love affair among a lonely man and a singer with her daughter who tries to find some shelter and finally the man of her hazardous life: The dialogues are absorbing and the movie may be conceived as an expansive Adagio.  A half brother of our main protagonist has some troubles with the low depths and we perceive by intuition something is wrong with this guy. That crucial twist of fate will make the situation overflows and we find those three people far away from the civilization in the middle of nowhere, expecting for some rescue.  A magnificent exploration of the human soul, poetically filmed. The dramatic tool employed throughout the reading of a dairy in an empty and half - destroyed house will feed our imagination and so did them. The edition process is accuracy and apparently disrupted to accent the increasing tension.   The opened ending reminded me to the enigmatic ending of that famous Poe' s novel: Arthur Gordon Pym.  Go for this peculiar little gem.
