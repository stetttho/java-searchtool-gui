 The absence of creativeness and the absence of absolute commitment , the desperation , the hunger for winning no matter how , the maquiavelian moods and the duality , the breakthrough in the personality of a human being metaphrically represented as twins invades this original script. Obviously the movie always keeps a hidden card in your reservoir plot. The story is told through great narrative elipsis which overlaps one to another . This puzzle technique reminds us to Memento , in this sense.  And Robert Altman 's style. (The player or Shorts cuts) This smart use of two twins has been employed by other directors (Sean Penn in the indian runner , for instance) , but the resourec that keeps you in the seat is the richness in the second characters . Since a no sense accidents shapes the life of a man , who tells his private life to a greddy writer, to inspire her , will be without knowing them the sparkling issue to exploid the dramatci nucleus . The film certainly lost his fierce impact gotten in the first half of the film , seeking may be the critical gaze about the decay moral . Good work for all the cast . Superb direction and extraordinary special effects ( the crash car in both cases)
