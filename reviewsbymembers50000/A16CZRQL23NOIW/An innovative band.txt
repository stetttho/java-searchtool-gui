 One of the major achievemnts of this band turns around the sense of musicality and expressiveness that lies in their themes. In this sense, this group follows the opened road of a key trio in the eighties as Police was and even Journey band. Imagination and good taste were two fundamentals aspects to mention about this ensemble.The lyrics has its own weight; and yet several pieces are clearly influenced by sixties and seventies bands; as Byrds, Credence , Wisbone Ash , Doors , Beatles , for instance the band knew mix commercial themes filled with harmonies beyond the standards in that age. Think in songs as Everybody hurts and my favorite theme Imitation of the life, based in that Douglas Sirk old cult movie , from 1959 . This album is an excelent account of one decade and a half of this band.  Buy this one, because the time has come for REM to set up for the deserved space in the throne of the great bands of the eighties and nineties.
