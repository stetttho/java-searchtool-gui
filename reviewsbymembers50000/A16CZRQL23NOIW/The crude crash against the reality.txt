 Midnight cowboy is a bitter and satirical story about the dreams and fantasies which turn around a smart boy village (Jon Voight) who thinks, he is the master of the world and so New York is another land to domain, but this will be a wrong choice as you can imagine. Our boy goes to NYC and meets an outsider (Dustin Hoffman) who will feed his dreams. But the crude reality will show those men how far and wrong they are about New York as a promised land. With surrealistic situations , the texan boy will experience slow but progressively, the dissapointment process , and his  desired gigolo proyect will become in ashes ; and still yet ... Well, Dustin is amazing as the uncommitmed street man, the locations in NYC look like a hell's preview; the sense of anguish and claustrophobia are notorius. Hunger, loneliness and hopeless will be his true colleagues in this nightmarish journey. A well made fable about the dream and reality; the ancient myth of Eros and Psyque ; fantasy against imagination. A methaporical slap for those who still hope that NYC will receive you with open arms without any effort. An extraordinary film who won the Academy Award and threw the gladiator actoral sand to Jon Voight. Unforgettable and even recognized soundtrack even now. Undoubtly the masterpiece of John Schlessinger and one of the most solid gems of the american cinema in any age.  A milestone.
