 Carl Reinecke belongs a dynasty of the Great German Romantic tradition. His role as conductor of the famed Gewandhaus Orchestra between 1860 and 1895 talks by itself about the artistic relevance of this talented musician who composed 288 Opus. The most significant personalities of the keyboard in those ages were apart of the three colossus Wagner, Liszt (the new sounds) and Brahms (embodying the classic German tradition) Felix Mendlessohn, Robert Schumann, Adolf von Henselt, Charles Valentin Alkan,  Hans von Bronsart, Ignaz Moscheles, Carl Tausig, Philp Sharwenka, and the flashing and thundering Sigismund Thalberg. Note I just have encircled a narrow but relevant number without naming celebrities of sonorous figuration such Anton Rubinstein, Gabriel Faure, Edward Lalo.           The major musical influence received for Reinecke comes from Mendelssohn and Schumann. Nevertheless his vigorous inspiration and the acute employment of orchestration, deserves him special consideration at the time to remark one of his most visible virtues. You can realize the display and fruitful musical exchange between the soloist instrument and orchestra.  The most known of his Concertos was the Third; ambitious and extremely expressive, signed by an enrooted Pastoral character, with several contemplative passages, loaded with slender moments and lyric imagination, the cadenza in the First Movement is filled of inspiration and enjoyment. However, the First Concerto at first sight seems to engage with major easiness the great audiences, according the increasing offer of versions in the market. It is more austere and straightforward than the Third, but shines with particular intensity.  Gerard Robbins reached in 1973 a resonant triumph with the release of the Concertos 1 and 2, a curious fact that linked with a notable performance of Michael Ponti of the First that attracted the attention of new audiences in search of new repertoires.   This is a magnificent opportunity and maybe the only one to have the whole set of Concertos of this remarkable conductor and minor composer who would deserve a major dedication and concern for public and musicians. Klaus Helwig plays with  broad musical solvency, great emotional involvement, and passionate inspiration. The Orchestra is discrete but makes the best they can; remarkable conduction of Alun Francis.
