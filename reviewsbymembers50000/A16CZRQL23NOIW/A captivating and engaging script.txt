 Vittorio Gassman made one of his best performances in all his brilliant career. The first Italian actor of the XX  Century shone so passionately natural, with such acting level as few times you will be capable to admire or even compare. To say this performance influenced to Al Pacino in the later remake is more than obvious.  The beauty of Agostina Belli and the assertive script; the fine irony, the corrosive cynicism of that man fallen in disgrace due his blindness will learn a life lesson when a woman convinces him the life - even in the worst conditions - deserves to be lived.     This is the sumptuous and supreme masterwork of Dino Risi, by far. A real legacy for future generations of filmmakers and the audiences who will survive us. It's useless to state this is one of my personal top one hundred films in any age!
