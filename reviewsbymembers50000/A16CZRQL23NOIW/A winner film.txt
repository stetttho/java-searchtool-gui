 James Woods has been one of the best actors in the screen. He is outstanding and always he commits in just five hundred per cent in all his performances. Powerful and expressive, but in Hollywood he has had just isolated opportunities. Its missunderstable. Earl Dodd is very special lawyer, he isnt a typical image of lucky lawyer. and obviously our character lived with too much passion those singular decades from the sixties and seventies.  From this perpective a singular case challenges him; to assume the defense of a chinese acussed of murder, being not guilty. This movie will tell about all the resources and special methods of our antihero for winning this dark case. Robert Downey Jr. plays the  typical role of the rookie naif lawyer who thinks the world is fair and clean. Soon hell learn too many issues about how to deal with the life and specaiily in this business. A well built script allows Woods to release all his stamina and skills, specially in front the Court in the first half of the film. Solid film , with smart situations and a fine sense of humor. Worthy work.
