 The performance of the Seventh Symphony took place on May 15 1933 with the BBC symphony. Such electrifying achievement and highly energetic charge has never been equaled and committed to disc before or late. Perhaps at a very close range I should mention the colossal version of Tomas Beecham in the middle Fifties. But the inner tension, mercurial intensity and febrile concentration you will never find in any other recording.         As I have remarked previously (see my review) my favorite performance of the Second Symphony is the currently unavailable CD of Anthony Collins and the London Symphony. As wisely Robert Layton affirms: "The second symphony possesses a combination of Italian warmth and Nordic intensity." In this case the version of Koussevitzky still remains among the most treasured performances ever recorded. It is loaded of an autumnal noblesse and nostalgic reflections. But you additionally should add the following recommendations: the legendary first commercial version of Kajanus of 1930, Segerstam. Thomas Schippers and the NYC and an almost forgotten performance of Sir John Barbirolli of the Fifties.         The Fifth Symphony has a vertiginous cosmic flight, in its own nature it has that visible elusiveness so typical of a vanishing Farewell. This is one of the top five achievements of this celebrated and beloved work but I must recognize Segerstam `s performance still remains as the supreme hitherto of this Opus.  Tapiola finds in Hans Rosbaud the maximum exponent and Pohjola ?s daughter is an incandescent performance.   In resume, this is a fundamental musical treasure which will preserve the musical memory of this hyper talented conductor.    Go for this double pack.
