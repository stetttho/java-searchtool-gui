 The astonishing mind of Luis Buuel created this implacable and merciless story about a priest who is condemned for people's  ineffable rumors when he decides to host a prostitute in his home.  And this decision will become his biggest mistake due the people's  double moral will spread till the highest power's spheres.  The priest's attitude will be Buuel's  hidden Ace.  One of my top favorites films of this irreverent and overwhelming Spanish filmmaker. .  The half of the sin is the scandal!
