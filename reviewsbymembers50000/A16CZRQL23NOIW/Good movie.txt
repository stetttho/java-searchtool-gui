 Four couples are intertwined in this slow paced thriller. Eight persons are involved in different emotional levels, where the lpneliness and the hopeless are the common denominator from this very interesting human puzzle. La Paglia makes a sensnitive role ; obviously Hershey and Rish makes the conflictive couple in which the script will focuse. Rachel Blake as the lover of La Paglia is surprisingly good , she looks freh and very natural. An australian film that will reward you.
