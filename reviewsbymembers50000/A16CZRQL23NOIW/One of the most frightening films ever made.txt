 This horror tale and psychological thriller in the vein of the best Hitchcock  walks around the fragile state of an out of mind woman (Carol Ledoux) who suffers a serious breakdown , product of a disturbed life in which the hidden codes of the sexuality , the anguish , the loneliness and the jealous will work out as a whole set of chemical reactions which eventually will carry to unexpected consequences . Catherine Deneuve played one of her top roles in all her career . Her sister -Helen- in the film is girl so distant from her that almost seems the opposite mirror image . She does not seem to have any trouble with adultery and multiple love affairs. The switch will go on just in that unhappy weekend in which Helen and his married couple go on holiday .  In this state of things begins the irreversible process of disintigrating , she will suffer hallucinating bizarre encounters and a real crash against the real world. Polanski paid a colossal but discrete tribute to The beauty and the beast of Jean Cocteua in a clue sequence where ghostly arms emerge from the walls and try to catch her . In this deranged state , she will be completely out of her mind and will commit two brutal and no sense murders , due she is uncapable to distinguish in this advanced process of emotional and affective breakdown when she will reach a point of no return and the narrow line between the real and the unreality simply vanished . This film won deservedly the Silver Bear - Special Jury prize in The Berlin International Festival 1965 . One of my top beloved films of this brilliant polish director.
