 It `s not easy to be engaged immediately with this picture, at least I have to recognize it. There are two definite lines that support the script.  The first is dramatic: a schizophrenic girl - Lisa - abandons the Psychiatric Institute in search of more affection and less professional treatment: her mother is a flat mind who can not understand anything about. She will find shelter in her friend: a hairdresser who simultaneously makes appearances in night clubs as travesty, playing fantastic imitations of Judy Garland, Joan Crawford, Jean Harlow and Bette Davis with elegance far from vulgarity and common places.  In this state of things, apparently Lisa seems to be not making the best choice, but the time goes by and finally in a mutual cathartic explosion, she will find affection, understanding and human comfort with her. The picture was made with a clear resources economy, you can note it through the troubled photography and editions adjustments, but the whole result, being in the appropriate anima, can be rewarding for you.  I guess this film must have been a reference cult movie in many underground midnight circuits in the middle seventies.
