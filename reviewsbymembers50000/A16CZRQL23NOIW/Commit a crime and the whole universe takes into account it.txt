 Robert Altman is one of the absolute Direction Masters all over the world. His ironic visions reminds inexorably to Jonathan Swift. His impeccable narrative style, that wonderful movements of camera, the discretely sumptuous stage, the fabulous illumination, the acid handle of the script, the prodigious domain of the British mood, the polish and refined cynicism beneath some lines, and obviously the special care of selection of every one of the characters make of this film an absolute artistic feat.  The movie follows the great tradition of Agatha Christie ` novels. Altman takes all the time of the world to show every  one of the personages, their affections and emotive lacks are depicted with unerring clarity. The theatrical mood reveals his deep love for this artistic expression. You can realize how the camera keeps always at a discrete distance from the viewer. All of you know the efficacy to use the staircase as dramatic device and natural frontier between the well defined social classes. This will be precisely the accurate place in which we will tie clues, being able to listen the most hidden thoughts, desires or sudden dates.   It is a superb chamber work, an immense Adagio where all of us must participate in this smart game of shadowy complicities, those little details that progressively will be enhancing the whole canvas.  Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith, Alan Bates, Derek Jacobi, Emily Watson and Cliff Owen are fabulous in superlative grade. Because all the cast was splendid too. The zealous search of the artistic direction shines along the film.   There is not any detail to reject. This is a towering, egregious and majuscule film and from its immediate release, a new classic. Altman belongs to a reduced category of  out of this world filmmakers, and this work still confirms it, in case there was any person who seriously doubt it.
