 Sergio Leone was a great stylist ; a real memory film maker . He surrounded his films in a dark cloud of  saudade ; a specific brazilian term  so adequate to design the blending of tender nostalgia and heartfelt pain for those we love and never will come . Beatifully shot , incredible ambitious , haunting , erotic , and humorous as the life itself.  It seems more than obvious than the blood and dynamic mind of Sergio  Leone countless centuries of greek ancestors ran ; his stories are always told from the mythical point of view . He is just a storyteller who will send us to the roots of the theme ;  a similar resource is employed for him in Once upon a time in America, for instance . Beware in both cases he emphasizes the opening title : Once upon a time as a primigenial tale  premise. Once more the clever clues of the ancestral myths ; the Man (Charles Bronson) comes from nowhere with a debt to pay and this man is Frank who ignores to have made something wrong many years ago .  The man makes has his own honor code and builds his own justice in a clear intention of returning the actual state of things to a better state . He makes it the probably becomes into possible . This is the reason for living of all hero , At last the cycle is done but nobody is really sure if the rest of the people has been cosnscious about the progressive transformation from the blame to redemption  One of the ten best westerns ever made!.
