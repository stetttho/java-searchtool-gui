 The Civil War is an episode that somehow impregnated the American Nation about the whole understanding about United signifies. 50.ooo souls died in the battlefield in the most bloody and painful combat ever reminded in the American ground. Solid script, and necessarily overlong because the theme demands it. It is not a simple entertaining movie, but a superb historic recreation whose historic importance still remains in university classrooms and conferences around the world.       Jeff Daniels and Sam Elliot have never been better. And please, remember King Lear: "Soft hearts never become swords."
