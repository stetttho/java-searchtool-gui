 At this moment Amos Gitai remains as the most lucid conscious of his country. He is a sharp filmmaker, immensely worried by the controversies generated by the tradition against the modern exigencies of an untiring world that does not believe in tears. This movie is deeply revealing around an untouchable issue years ago. The treatment of the women in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities. Two sisters in search of their happiness and bliss in a system that seems to confine and marginalize them, limiting and reducing her gifts. Although each one of them is married, one of them is rejected due her marriage is childless. The other one is advised and seriously pressured  by a rabbi into a marrying a cruel and despotic husband.  A cry of anguish and despair.
