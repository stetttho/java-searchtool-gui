 Kenneth Gilbert gives us a fresh and luminous performance of these Goldberg Variations one of the quintessential scores of the music in any age. Contemplative, enraptured and gifted of a fabulous approach. His immaculate technique and unerring playing involve us. Go for this record. Absolutely recommended.
