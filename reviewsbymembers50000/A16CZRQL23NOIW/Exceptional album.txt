  This CD is simply admirable. The Blue chip is an optimist piece. With you I mind is a very smooth ballad with soft lyrics. Bright tiger is a piece with strong Arabian accent and Ariane is another smooth piece. Highland is tome the best of the album.  But there is still more. Boulder coaster is a summer breeze song and Hearts in chains is overwhelming.  In sum this album is extremely recommendable for any listener who appreciates anfd enjoys the jazz moods.
