 The script doesn' t  get old. That is a good signal. Because all you can experience im this movie is far from being untrue. The echoes of that fabulous work of Aldous Huxley "A new visit to a brave new world", comes to my mind.  The conceptual density of the deep implications about the subliminal messages, the huge power of seduction that the mass media impact on our daily behavior, are underlined with clear maestry by the prodigal son of the camera. Mr. Lumet, a film maker that accostumed us to face with real consequences derivated from the excess of power. (Serpico, the Prince of New York, The offence, the Anderson tapes)  Remember his previous filmography. The hill is an example of men placed in a borderline. Lumet is a thinker director, extremely exigent and careful in every take he does.  His career reached the peak with this monumental movie. And I still wonder, twenty eight years after why the Academy prized Rocky instead of Network. I couldn?t believe it.  In these difficult years, it prevailed the feeling of elusive behavior with the cruel reality of these days.   And pitifully, Network fell under this category.  But the time will be the best judge, and I?m sure Network will grow by itself, due to its inner power.   Maybe this fact justifies brightly other unexpalined facts  like not to give the Nobel Prize to Jorge Luis Borges, by example.  Anyway don' t forget that Balzac' s statement: "The glory is the sun of the dead"
