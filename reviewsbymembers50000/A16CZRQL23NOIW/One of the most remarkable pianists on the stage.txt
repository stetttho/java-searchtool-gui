 Arkadi Volodos is in the actual moments one of the supreme masters of the keyboard. His admirable interpretative eloquence, admirable temperament, limpid phrasing, passionate lyricism and steeled fingering makes of him one of the best gifted pianists of his generation.  For all those who had had the honored privilege to watch him in live (I am not among them) and for the rest of us, who only have heard him thanks to the Digital Technology, it is a very good new to know about him, because in spite of the fact of the impressive number of new soloists in the market, Volodos has been one of the few who positively has impressed me.  I hope for him new musical achievements.
