 Skip Mc Coy (Richard Widmark) is a person without colective importance; a rough pickpocket , a scroungy pretty gangster who sneeks a look into a womans handbag, turns up some microfilm and finds himself dealing with communist agents.  This is a well made film, with a lot of issues. Moe (Thelma Ritter)overtakes this role as a street peddler who sells information. A film which reveals as a few, the sordid and sinister underworld linked with the spy world which is blackmailed by a pedestrian thief.  Fullers view is incisive, bitter and ironical. Nevetheless the film has unforgettable funny situations.  Thelma Ritter was a very talented actress and bowever, she never won an Academy Award ; but her shinning presence gives to the clever script that touch of class and outrageous fierce character; and of course dont forget adding the charismatical performance of Richard Widmark. One of the most imaginative and powerful film noir made in any age.
