 Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket is one of the most relevant and significant novels of Poe. His passionate literary style, told in first person, tells us about the hidden incursion of Arthur in a boat that will make a tour through the east coasts of South America.  The prodigious imagination and febrile mood, make of it an issue of invaluable and beating actuality.  The white color will impregnate the work as another invisible actor. And its final is still one of the most sublime and admired ever written.
