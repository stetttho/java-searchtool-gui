 This film is the most acid and bitter in all the filmography . Don't expect you are invited just to watch another film of Woody Allen . This work plays hard and challenges you . Allen literally makes a social surgeon abou a lot of aspects considered as normal by mostly of us . Allen has never been so merciless in any other movie . There is a remarkable point what the creation means : all creation demands the destruction of the previous order . With this advise in mind , just proceed to watch it . You will laugh but the result may be in many cases a forced smile .
