 It 's a shame that this hyper talented director does not figure with major intensity in the musical memory of the most of Brucknerian listeners.  If  you take a look around about the fortunate association with the Vienna Philharmonic, you may check that out of a total of 19 concerts conducted five works by Bruckner: Te Deum, The Fifth, Seventh, Eighth and Ninth.  His fevered intensity and overflowing vitality, was supported by that profound and total domain of the demanding score. Schuricht conducted Bruckner as Boult did it with Elgar , (if the comparison is allowed). He bestowed those works of such stature and architectonic dimensions, nourished with that cosmic gaze and enraptured phrasing, where the meditative aspect was narrowly related with that fervent passion, who reminds us to Wilhelm Frtwangler.  It is time for the new musical generations to make this journey into Schuricht ` s universe, because the final result will justify by far those aspects the word hardly can explain.
