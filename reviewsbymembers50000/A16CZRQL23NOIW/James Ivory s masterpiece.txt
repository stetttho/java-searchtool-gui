 This is a slow paced movie, but so well acted and directed that you miss the rhytm. You feel caught from the first images with the voice in off . The photography is splendid. The art is direction is spectacular . The script is a long tale from the memories of Anthony Hopkins and a failed relationship with Emma Thompson as the mistress in service of James Fox a hard enemy of the German forces in WW2. The film travels from the passionate speechs about the destiny of the mankind , the human condition and also the intimate portrayal of this loyal servant , keeping the formalities with absolute gentleness. Never before Ivory had been so inspired and convincing like this one .  The last sequence of the film is an extraordinary metaphor. Thompson brilliant and Hopkins superb in this work. This is a heavyweight champion movie , great and marvelous . Don't miss this one!
