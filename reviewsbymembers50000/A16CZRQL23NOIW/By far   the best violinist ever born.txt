  The spiritual serenity, the velvet intonation and admirable musicality of Szigetti is hard to find in previous or later artist of this instrument. He was born gifted not only of a prodigious expressive technique but also of deep commitment sense. From the first bars of the Primavera Sonata you will convince by yourself: the purity of sound is so eloquent, discrete and limpid. The vibratos and the modulations are so well articulated that you will be engaged almost automatically from the beginning. You won't find any other recording able to stand ever near of this magnificent performance. This is a hitherto version of this Beethoven's sublime chamber work.
