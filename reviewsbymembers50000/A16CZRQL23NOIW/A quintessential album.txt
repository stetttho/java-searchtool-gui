 This set may be well considered the best work of this unforgettable ensemble. This album contains the real essence of the seventies. Filled with inspiration, and overall, commitment. This quartet was one of the top ten notable bands in USA , original sound , lyrics and wildness, charming and rebelness , country folk and wonderful songs . Think in Our house , a superb ballad , in contrast you have Woodstock .  This work is a must in your collection and in my personal opinion , one of the twenty most influyent albums in the rock music in any age.  Don't forget this team worked out in Woodstock and became one the most shinning stars in that unique musical meeting in 1969.
