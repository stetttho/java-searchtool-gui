Christian de Challonge is a very clever director who likes to bet with incisive scripts. He is a magnificent and very effective director who should be better known.  And what can we add to qualify the presence of this giant actor : Michael Serrault a true living legend who so many satisfactions has offered us around all the possible genres.   A picture that deserves much more divulgated and because some motive was not able to engage in its moment.
