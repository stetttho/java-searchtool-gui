 You have a spectacular masterpiece . It will seem you exaggerated from my position , but never before in Hollywood you could watch a peaceful , artistic and extraordinary well made film , with detailed minuteness , intelligence and good taste . The cast is simply superb . Liam Neeson gave the performance of his life as Schindler the man who broke in his business but helped more than one thousand Poland Jews from being exterminated  Ben Kingsley is the conciliate factor and obviously what else can you add to this actor who actually is one of the twelve giants actors in the world . And finally Ralph Fiennes who grew up one thousand steps with this role as an abominable and hated Nazi all along the film without falling in overacting . The locations in Poland are first rate , the sinister atmosphere, the ravishing handle camera , the splendid photography and a fine script make of this film to my mind the Best American Film of the Nineties , one of the three most ambitious and compelling films which dealt with this theme  and the supreme masterpiece of Steven Spielberg . And this happens only when the camera is an eye in the mind of a poet . Spielberg followed his bliss and won for ever . You can forget all his previous works , because with Saving Private Ryan , Spielberg has been one of the few directors capable to give a tragic and epic vision of the War in less than a decade among both films.  .  Pitifully these giants films are not the rule but the exception .   .
