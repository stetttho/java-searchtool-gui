 Ruby Dee made a  very fine acting in this poignant story about the  personal tragedy  of Roy Campanella the renowned catcher of the Brookyn Dodgers . He battles against the awful depression and with the great and unvaluable help of his therapist he wins and overcomes . It's impossible for any viewer not be touched when he tells to 80.000 fans in The Angeles Coliseum: It's good to be alive! Tastefully directed by Michael Landon.
