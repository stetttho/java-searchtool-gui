 In the Apollonian personality of Boulez Ravel is revealed from another perspective. His Ravel is far to be a pleasant and delicate composer to reveal the bitterness beneath the score. I like this approach because not only gives some interesting clues about the relevance of certain dismissed works such as La Valse, for instance.  In Scherezade Boulez makes a mythical journey that recalls us so much the similar vision concerned with Daphne and Clo, where the unconscious side of the story seems to reflect menacing shadows and twilight echoes of missed visions in a supra rational world His Valses  Nobles and Sentimentales confirm the evidence; are played with emotion but without sentiment.  Rapsodie espagnole is one of the best registers triumphs, brilliant and concise. Pavana is egregious. Le tombeau de Couperin was played with magisterial phrasing . The Concert for the left hand finds Entremont in one of his best days. In what Daphne and Cloe concerns there is a name: Charles Munch and the unbeatable version of the Fifties with the Boston Symphony. Captivating and engaging approach.  Go for this record because when a composer-director with the admirable musical maturity of Boulez, something new happens, because the baton becomes scalpel.
