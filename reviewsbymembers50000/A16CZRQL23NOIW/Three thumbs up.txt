 Undoubtly David Mamet lived a glorious decade in these eighties. House of games , the untouchables a scripter and this one. Don't wonder if this movie belongs to cult movie status. It's a witty comedy about an inept , poor experienced and low level gangster who suffers the consequences of his acts when he goes against the orders to take an old shoe - shine boy on one last fing  just before the latter goes to prison being not guilty.  Notice this disfunctional state of mind of this rookie gangster,  follows the ancient rule about the wisdom of the experience , despite this statement is not always true all the times , but it does in this case. The laughable side about the sordid universe that surrounds the underworld has been so irreverently told as in this case. Don Ameche (Coccon) and Mantegna (House of games and Alice) give a fine performance. Don't miss this funny comedy. A winner film.
