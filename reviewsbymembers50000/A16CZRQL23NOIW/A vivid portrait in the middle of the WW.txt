 This was the first awarded picture about the war. An English middle class family will be shocked and struggled as well as the small community that intends to keep living according the usual traditions until the reality exploits with awful consequences for all of them. There are very interesting secondary lines worked polished; the railroad man who cultivates with dedication his red rose, winning the expected prize; in the other hand we have the love affair of this young couple who seems to present there's no time to enjoy and even think about illusions due the cloudy horizon avoid to dream; the preacher man's sermons, far from being simple messages pregnant of hope, an epic advise, in the same line of Churchill appealing to the honor and sure convincing the liberty will impose itself; the human efforts of all those men who bravely will be help regardless the countless obstacles and risks; finally we have to our front page family Greer Carson as the abnegate, bold and brave wife who doesn't scare when is visited by this wounded Nazi Officer, Pigdeon is splendid too in his role. But this portrait would have been extremely incredible if there were not sensible losses.  William Wyler as the superb master who was, knew to distribute the emotional charge along the movie, avoiding to fall in common places and making one of his memorable films of his career. It's hard for me to pronounce myself objectively about Mrs. Carson because I have always thought she was one of the ten best actresses in the Century, so I just simply recommend in case of you have missed it, this unusual and superb masterpieces of the Decade.
