 As you know the excel passion of Gould for Bach 's music accompanied him along his lifetime. He not only rediscovered a new approach around Bach 's playing but besides he notably contributed to spread the taste for the Academic music all over the world. He represented the irreverent musician per excellence but his absolute domain of the musical socre, his absolute control and senes of every little bar made of him a must reference at the moment to establish fundamental parameters. He broke paradigms and gave back the music a renovated splendor.  Since his awful vanishing in 1982, a whole generation of new listeners, his name has become as cult pattern. So that is the mainreason to acquire this album, becuase it contains the minimum facets in the intrepretative art of the musician of musicians: Johann Sebastian Bach.
