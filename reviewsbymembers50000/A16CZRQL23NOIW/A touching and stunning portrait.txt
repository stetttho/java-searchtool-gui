 May be sound excessively exaggerate to affirm we are in front the most sincere and heartfelt homage to a true legend Australian racehorse that chewed up the track in the 1920s and early 1930s. This film is simply an additional proof of what the untamed spirit can become. From Australia came the surprise that muted many people from all the corners in the world. Phar Lap was a phenomena and force of nature. Arresting and intense images all the way.  To my mind the masterpiece of Simon Wincer.
