 Richard Strauss (1864-1949) was probably, the greatest composer-conductor of the century, rivaled perhaps by Gustav Mahler. Strauss composed this work in the dawns of the WW1, 1914. Ten years had elapsed from the Domestic Symphony , fruitful period in which composed Electra, Salome, Das Rosenklavier and Ariadna in Naxos.   This work is to my taste together with Also Sprach Zaratustra  and Death and transfiguration my favorite trilogy of him.   If you realize about the whole structure, which consists in just one movement, we can assume he was thinking in a very expansive tone-poem, his particular Pastoral dedicated to the impressive mountains and perpetual snows. He knew to extract the maximum possibilities of the orchestra, remarking the style of the symphonic ponderosity. A whole arsenal of the most unusual instruments: wind machine, thunder machine and cowbells, in addition to the usual percussion instruments, plus a specially organized brass group offstage consisting of twelve horns, two trumpets and two trombones. An ostentatious anachronism if you want, according the perspectives of that time.   The Bavarian State played this work with meticulous bravery, legitimate pride and profound conveyance. Apart the importance historic of this performance (Strauss in his 77), it remains in the surroundings a clear sensation of emotiveness and display of pronouncement respect these war years. You can feel it beneath the score.  There are in my opinion three legendary versions of the Alpine: a renown and admired performance of Zubin Meta with the Angeles Philharmonic from the seventies, a careful and elaborated performance of one of my favorite directors any time: I mean Rudolf Kempe and this one.  An invaluable performance that will endure securely the taste acid of the years, remaining such as a solid oak and also a historic legacy for the new generations who will survive us.
