 A bureaucrat,a man good for nothing is a credited police in Bourkassa, Western Africa, 1936. The corruption in its several faces rides on him, laughs of him and mocks about him. His marriage is a mess; his wife is lover of her own brother a stupid pimp.  This is the dramatic stage chosen by Tavernier to make an ambitious film where the predator concept will surround the screen thanks to a perfect script. Three out of this world stars of cinema such as Noiret, Audran and Huppert are overwhelming.  A sublime masterpiece; a legitiamte pride for the French Cinema in the early eighties.
