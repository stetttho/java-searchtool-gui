 This gargantuan piano concert demands a first rate pianist , a great conductor and a virtuosi orchestra to work out . In the late seventues I acquired the available version in vynil of the key Ravenaugh Ogdon , skillfully performed . But Hamelin is an extarordinary and best gifted pianist who matchs with Ogdon in musicality and technician equipment . And even the rapport with the orchestra does not reach the intensity of Ravenaugh Ogdon , the result is widely worthable .  Hamelin is one of the giants keyboardists in all the world .  I really expect he makes a close approach to Beethoven , He has the demanded abilties and intelligence to win this challenge . Acquire this recording to get into Busoni musical universe and enjoying of the superb craft of Hamelin. Try to find too all you can from Hamelin playing Alkan .
