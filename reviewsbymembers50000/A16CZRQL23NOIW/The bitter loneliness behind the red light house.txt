 A brothel is the saddest place in the world. Malle however finds a dark poetry behind the red house light and gives a beautiful intimate portrait since the point of view of a little girl. Malle always kept in the deepest of his soul the childhood memories , and this is a direct heritage from the French Mew Wave. And this statement is supported by two essential films of him *Zazie dans le metro* from 1961 and *Au revoir les enfants* (one of his four masterpieces) from 1986 who deserved him an Academy Award as best foreigner film. This film literally made grow up to Susan Sarandon as a top  actress in a demanding role. Jodie Foster made this role without too much effort , probably due her before playing in Taxi Driver. The script is astonishing and surrounded of a bitter atmosphere. One little gem and a cult movie from this brilliant french director.
