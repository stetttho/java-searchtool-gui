 Vladimir Horowitz is not in my ten top keyboard giants from the past. But, in this case its fair to make a sincere rendition to this album. Horowitz was a cosmpolitan citizen. Thats is an very important detail and I ll tell you why. The Scriabins school pianists Sofronitzky, Nehaus among others saw in him a russian Chopin. And I disagree with that opinion. Scriabin was a sensitive artist , but also a major colorist than Chopin was and ever a convinced man opened to experience new sounds.  The musical influences received by Scriabin were in multiple directins. Wagner , Mahler, Bruckner opened new musical spaces in the new composers.  Besides Scriabin and its sense he links with Rachmaninov; he didnt get so far from the romantic tradition; and he dindnt join to the avant garde composers as Stravinsky, for instance.  He liked to experience but without his roots. So that view in the school russian pianistic permeated this conception in pupils as Richter. Its fair to establish a hidden neuroses in Scriabins music and thats not a critical judgement. The point to remark is that Horowitz, never considered this opinion, precisely to his countless exchange ideas with the world outside the provincial Russia.  And thats why his Scriabin sounds less ecletic and more multidimensional than the re3st of his coleagues, including Richter and Gilels; his Scriabin is in many ways out of control and less influenced of the chopinian view. It sounds you less romantic and more universal.  Only Richter in the seventies could escape from that view and pianist as MichAel Ponti , Mijail Rudy or Ivo Porgorelch have understood so.  Listen to Lazar Berman and youll feel the Nehaus approach.  This is the great virtue of this recording.  But a warning; be carefully with a performance given for Horowitz in Carnegie Hall May 9 1965; because in many ways he seems to return to the chopinisque atmosphere when he played Scriabin in that recital. A must in your collection. Dont miss it.
