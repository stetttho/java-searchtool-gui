 At the moment to remind a selected and reduced list of the most intelligent and finest American directors ever born, William Wyler is a sure candidate in the most of these prestigious names.  In this portentous adaptation of Emily Bronte `s novel, Wyler enriched the literary language with suggestive angle shots, expressive grimaces and powerful traveling. For instance, pay special attention in the eloquent sequence seconds after Heathcliff has left the home of Cathy, when she and her husband leave the hall. The camera moves backward and "escapes" through one of the opened spaces of the window, underlining the sensation both of them are ensnared into a golden cage. On the other hand the name Heathcliff is so close to Heart cliff, and represents a gypsy under the social conventionalisms of the Victorian Ages, but he represents that untamed spirit, typical of the ardent embodiment of the Romanticism Age (think about in Werther, for instance) or any other personage portrayed  by Byron or Shelley. The true home of both is a risk and once more we return to the archetypical roots of the Romanticism hero. They and the nature; joined in a solid unity, melted by that unbreakable love, far beyond the rules.  The sure hand of Wyler, the impeccable edition process, the splendid cast make of this picture not only a beloved cult movie, but besides a well deserved place at the moment to mention the great Romantic movies ever made in any age.
