 The glorious sound generated by the hands of Gould made these collection a must in this age and still are. The originality of the musical reading of these pieces is the consequence of a long and exhaustive hours and hours of study. Mr. Gould knew how to mix technique, accuracy, interpretative fierce, with enchantment and lyrics. Many players have tried this style but fail and my point is that they as Mr. Gould did it, go to the middle of the soul of the piece. The delicate balance between counterpoint and fresh harmony is so difficult to achieve because you need as performer that Apolo and Dyonisus remains in your soul without one of them domains on the other. If Apolo wins or Dyonisius does youll get a dissapointed view and sound of Bach. Dry in the first case and overhearted result in the second.  Gould was an artist with high and lows. His personal choice about not making more public recitals since 1964, is an issue in which I dont agree. Besides that I feel his greatness as performer and thinker. In his books and interviews he was a convinced of his musical conceptions and all the reasons exposed convince us he was a genius of his time and perhaps for a long time. Remember, the genius is always contemporean.
