 In the far sixties there were many important vocal associations, Temptations, Four Tops, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Paul Revere and the Raiders, The Rascals, Blood, sweat and tears,  Supremes, Beach Boys, Lettermen and Peter, Paul and Mary.  But suddenly from the late sixties emerged this notable band , who mixed rhythm and blues, folk with such original taste loaded with innovations, but fundamentally supported by an incredible vocal shades, impregnated with superb arrangements; Three dog night heaped up the scenery with his formidable easy going themes.          Who can forget his most emblematic theme: One, for instance. But along their triumphal career there were other winning numbers, such Eli' s coming, Mama told me not come, Celebrate, One man band, Joy to the world, Black and White and the always reminded soft ballades such Easy to be hard, Old fashioned song and Try a little tenderness.  There is not need to convince for all those who are in his forties, fifties or sixties. I should insist to propose the new generations to ask their parents, friends for this superb band, that created a special sound and earned a special place in the musical memory.  Go for this collection without reserves.
