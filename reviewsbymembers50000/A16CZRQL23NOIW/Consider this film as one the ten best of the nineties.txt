 This film throws again to the ring to Neetherlands in the rank of great directors. This film deserved The best foreign film in 1997 ; but its inner values are far beyond this prize. Imagine what the film talks about ; you must fight not onl?y with the elusive and challenging fate that day after day wait for us when we leave from home . Our main character has to prove to his own father he's a winner ; against all the obstacles he finds in the road. His father is a hated human being ; a man without a bit of scruples. Since he was a child , was forced to fight , and always followed his bliss . This film represents not only a personal challenge but also a life experience ; a no mercy story that disturbs the viewer . The performances without exception are of first rate ; (loaded with the same essence we remind of that ancient concept from Italy in the forties titled neo realism - De Sica ,Roselini - , that really had its origen with Tony from Jean Renoir in 1934), but with a very twisted difference ; his epic commitment instead the bitter and hopeless endings , typical of those ancient classical films (Germanny anno zero , Roma citt? aperta, Paisa , The bycicles'thief and Umberto D)  . Mike van Diem made a unique film ; a jewel of countless carats. And to me , one of the one hundred best films in any age! A must in you private collection!
