 This is a crude story filled with ambitious and fineness handle camera . The photography is exquisite , the arresting images : specially this turn around the train is unforgettable but the entire script doesn't have punch . It is well told but you feel the absence of greatness . May be is the stylish documentary storytelling and the not succesfully developed sense of the drama what it strikes the film . But Gillian Armstring knows as all of we there are been so many stories about the tragedies of the war where the sense of heroism , betrayal, fatality and injustice are fundamental factors of the war . In that sense Armstrong focuses her attention much more in the dramatis personae experienced by Charlotte Gray that in the environment which surrounds her . The Gray chase in the house lacks credibility . Do you really expect it is so easy to get out and escape from the Gestapo with a simple gun ? .    The dramatic device employed for Armstrong when the train is leaving and her efforts for writting a letter seem a filled tear handkerchief thrown to the great audience . But the splendid perfomance of Cate Blanchet (one of the best twelve actress in the world to date) and a worthable cast saves the film being a positive point . One of the most emblematic paradoxs in the film is you can find your expected love in the middle of the hell. The most remarkable acting after Blanchet is obviously Billy Crudup as Julien Lavarde . But the film will not remain in your memory . You and me will forget very soon . And that it may be a weakness syntom of the film itself.
