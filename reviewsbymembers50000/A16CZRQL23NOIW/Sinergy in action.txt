  This compilation is excellent. There is a super session and constellation of consecrated stars.  Think in this magnificent theme of dazzling inspiration of Tito Puente. New arrival and so Lagrimas Negras  with Cachao and Bebo Valds. From within with Michael Camilo and Samba Triste with Eliane Elias is another triumph.   Excellent choice to get some fun with Latin taste.
