 The primordial essence of the tragic love is the impossibility for its whole fullness. No matter how difficulties you have to pass over . The tragedy of the war , the ideological conflicts . All is consummated .  There has always been a weird and sinister fascination in all the world `s latitudes for this painful loves under the most unimaginable circumstances .  The magic pen of Boris Pasternak convinced to Lean to translate on screen all the dramatis personae of two lovers in the middle of the bloody episodes immersed under the oppression , the absence of liberties being Spain and not Russia the great frame to materialize this haunting story .  Its an ambitious stage with all the mammoth spectacle required in those times. And it could not be other way , after Lawrence de Arabia , Lean was the supreme magician of enormous wastelands and superbs illumination , with glorious and magnificent landscapes.  The sexual chemistry Christie-Sharif worked out to perfection. And despite the film is overlong (197 min) the movie is a fest to eyes . Far from being a historic review of facts and episodes , the core focuses around these two lovers with the implacable presence of Tom Courtenay giving one of his two best roles of his life :(the other would be the dresser years later).  Maurice Jarre `s soundtrack is still haunting and one of the most famous melodies ever written : Lara's theme.  Absorbing accounts of an undeniable periods of the human story.     Another additional triumph in David Lean 's career!
