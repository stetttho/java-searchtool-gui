 Geza Anda possesed an unique and enviable (in the best sense of the word)rapport with Mozart. There are versions that must be underlined among the most pyramidal ever done. His First, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, 12th,the 15th, the 19th,23th and 27th justify by far its acquisition.   Geza Anda received an invaluable influence of thwo superb musicians; the unforgettable Clara Haskil and the hyper talented Hungarian conductor, Ferenc Fricsay.  Playing and conducting from the Piano he played regularly in Salzburg Festivals, being his sound pristine and crystalline. His excellent approach and above all, his formidable pianism, conform one of the most indispensable sets of these Piano Concertos.  Specially recomended in this special year 2006 in which all of us will commemorate the 250th anniversary of this sublime composer.
