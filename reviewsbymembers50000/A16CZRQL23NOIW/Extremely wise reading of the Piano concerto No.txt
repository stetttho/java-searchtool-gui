 It has been said very often the greatest piano concertos of Mozart begin since the Kv. 466 . To my mind that concept is not totally right .  If you check the year 1784 was particularly fructiferous for Mozart, but also signified his first connections with the Masons . He composed six Concerts for Piano from the Kv 449 (14) to Kv. 459 , The String Quartet in B flat major to Haydn (curious written in the same tonality) don't you?  The Piano Sonata Kv. 457 in C Minor (tragic tonality per excellence) , and an interesting point t remark : He didn't compose any Symphony between 1783 (37) and 1786 (38) , The Prague in D major I mean sixty works between Kv 444 and Kv 504 .and only two Symphonies were written in this tonality (5) kv. 1765 and the (24) Kv 182 in 1774 , the first Piano Sonata for Violin and Piano written in 1785 Kv. 481 is also written in the same tonality  and the last Piano Concerto is written in B flat major in 1791 , and the first work for Piano Solo written in 1785 is  - guess what - The Fantasy in D Minor  Kv . 475 . Let me remember you the C minor is the same tonality of Beethoven fifth Symphony ; so the question is why?    My argument is that Mozart was somehow looking the tragic side of the life and needed to breathe of the Symphonic works and  look inside his spirit.  The dark clouds which involve this Andante is very revealing about what was happening in the heart and soul of Mozart.  If you analyse carefully the First and Third Movement are written operatically but attention with the Andante un poco sostenuto you feel the all embracing presence of the tragedy not only suggested as he made it in the Second Movement of his Ninth Concert D major another tragic tonality (another mere coincidence perhaps?).  The inner dragons spied on the febrile imagination of Wolfang Amadeus Mozart who  entered in the thiving Masonic Comunity at the end of 1784 .  Barenboim playing and conducting the Berlin Philharmonic has been to my mind together with Schiff - Vegh the only two performers that somehow have been able to watch this essential detail.   That is why both interpreters are today in the top as the Best Mozart players in the world .
