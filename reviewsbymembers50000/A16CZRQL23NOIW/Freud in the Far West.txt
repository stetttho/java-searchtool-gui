 Two giant actress ; two strong characters, two Oscar winners : Crawford and Mc Cambridge play hard  and displace the man condition to invited guests . Both women will assume the action decide what is wrong and right , create her own conduct codes and fight for her happiness , never wait for the man decision , but vice versa. But Nick Ray goes far beyond there is still more . Ray avails  this original gaze to illustrate the central dramatic nucleus : Emma represents the antique Status Q ; she opposes to the railroad  construction because it goes against her interests over the territory while Vienna is the progressive vision of business and knows the railroad will enrich her possession . As you know both positions in conflict had been focused among the Indians and White men but never among two women .   Think it carefully and try to link this film with another one which is extremely related : Thelma and Louise . The first is a real combat ; the second is evasion . But both of two have many commons aspects . The man is relegated to a second plane . They only are stone spectators and only act as product of the circumstances ; I mean act reactively but never assume the control of the things . They are concerned around the effects not the causes.  Bernardo Bertolucci properly called this film "The first of the baroque westerns" and Francois Truffaut commented : It's not about horses and guns , it is about people and emotions" while Andrew Sarris stated : "Freudian feminism" . Based on Philip Yordan and Roy Chanslor `s novel this is to me one of three gems of Nicholas Ray in his emblematic career , the other two would be Rebel without cause and Bitter victory .
