 This film starts with a fabulous premise: to give a child robot of the warm  behavior, being capable to substitute a real child. But then the script experiments a sudden twist that will lead to unexpected places of the imagination with a warm homage to Pinocchio, leaving behind the possibility of making a film of major caliber and conceptual rigor. You will find certainly some intersections with Blade Runner, but the tearful approach affected seriously the original proposal of Kubrick. You can argue the arresting special effects and the laughable presence of Jude Law who adds the film a second breath but with a script so sinuous and so lineal, in which the humans are cruel and merciless in the Flesh Tournament led the film to an evasion picture and not a dramatic crossroad that somehow would have reached a major status. Think for instance what would it have happened in case of being directed by Terry Gilliam of Ridley Scott, who had explored previously in these lands, with remarkable results. Spielberg wanted to recreate a film but the main fault is the excessive use and abuse of the romantic gaze who dilapidated the treasured message of the script. Too many vanished expectations when you make the final balance.
