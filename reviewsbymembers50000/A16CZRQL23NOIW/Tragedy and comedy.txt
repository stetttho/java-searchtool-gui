 Woody Allen once more opens the Pandora 's box to carve in relief an old but passionate issue on the red carpet: tragedy and comedy. What role do they perform throughout all our existence?.  Allen places four characters around a table in the middle of Manhattan: kind spirits discuss friendly about their points of view about the tragedy and comedy, exhibiting each one their arguments. From this perspective (who reminds the famous film Louis Malle ' s Dinner with Andre), Allen bets for to put in action an admirable proposal: to present two different ways around an imaginary dilemma seen with tragic and comedy glasses. Both stories will unfold in parallel, exchanging roles, attitudes and characters but always turning around Melinda as principal dramatic axis. We have always known about Allen' s  prodigious musical culture: and the proposed examples were simply fantastic: Bartok ' s  Third Quartet and the mention of Mahler' s Second. Both works typify essentially the anguish of the modern man.     The comedy, obviously is starred by Allen in the accustomed role we have always seen him from Play it again, Sam (under the direction of Martin Ritt) and repeated over and over in many other conveyances. Allen: the understood looser, who seeks desperately the muse of his most desired dream: An Aphrodite woman but with the brain, spirit and will of Athena (The Wisdom, Arts and Prudence Goddess). Nevertheless, when such kind of woman  appears in the affective universe of Woody, the attraction is not always mutual. So this brief instant of immortality with the cosmos exploits before him as soup' s pomp. In last instance, it doesn't seem arguable he was the kind of man sought by this idealized femme. As you know, Allen had suggested and even bet his previous concern in Mighty Aphrodite (1995) with the expected results that we know. He makes an admirable script around the comic perspective of the life, placing Melinda not precisely as a centered woman but perhaps thinking of her as Don Quixote and his beloved  Dulcinea del Toboso. In fact, maybe I' m wrong but I guess this was the hidden Ace of Allen: to render a tangential but deserved homage to this famous artwork precisely in this year in which we are celebrating the 400th anniversary of its publishing.  On the other hand, the tragic vision of Melinda would seem to give us the impression Woody reflects in the feminine character his mirror image. All her tribulations and disagreements suggest us a profound sense of hopeless and disillusion respect all the men she engages, searching certain virtues but being attracted by others than apparently weigh much more in the emotional balance. Melinda 's  existential depression has been portrayed in previous feminine characters such Annie Hall, Alice, Broadway Danny Rose or Manhattan around Diane Keaton ' s role. Allen walks to the opposite side of the sex and places also, the immense burden of disaffection and ontological loneliness in tragic mood. Betrayed, bored by a second choice and seduced precisely due the boredom, the impossibility to enjoy the life as a Mighty Aphrodite but with the responsibilities of the Mother Goddess: Gea for the Greeks. This ambiguity simply can not be harmonized, because both poles pull each one to its gravity center and, as you may expect there are not any common issues between both visions. That could explain Allen bets for an opened Final, leaving to the viewer to extract his own conclusions.                       If this is not the best work of his wide cinematography, at least this legitimate approach about the tragedy and comedy, is a good signal about the change of humor of our unerring Woody, with this film of European style inspired overseas, basically in three authors: Nietzsche, Wilde and Shaw.      I liked the great finale of this almost symphonic work, who reminded an old statement of Jean de la Bruere: "Let' s laugh just before to be happy, because we died without having laughed."
