 Since I watched this movie in 1980 I became a real admirer of the genius of Mr. Fassbinder. All the story is a full circle. Its a untired fight against the fate and the search for the bliss not only of Maria Braun, but Germany in final instance, because the metaphor is brutally clear. The sense of loss, the hope (altough no matter what),the intelligent and proactive personality of Maria, the spirit of to achieve the goal, the huge tension carried under the body of Maria Braun, just for love. Twelve years are lived in this tale from 1942 to 1954. This personal epic is so really described for Fassbinder without exploring but living and suffering in silence the pain and the anguish. Fassbinder made several true gems for all the eternity, but this film in particular has a strange enchantment, so convincent and so human that in my personal view (it constitutes not only the most sincere statement of Fassbinder for ejecting the inner demons of the Germany of the postwar) one of the most perfect examples of the supreme perfection in the germany cinema together with The bridge (Rowicki),  the wrath of God (Herzog),the american friend (Wenders), the tin drum (Schlondorff) and Das Boot (Petersen). Dont miss
