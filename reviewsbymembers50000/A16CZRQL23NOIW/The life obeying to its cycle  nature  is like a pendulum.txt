 A woman of noble linage, Tamaki, places across a somber forest with her two children: Zushio and Anju. She proposes to rejoin with her husband, the Ex Governor Masauji, who had been banished because of his liberality and pleasure about the countrymen. But tin this stage they are kidnapped, she will be forced to serve as courteous and his two sons will be sold as slaves to the unmerciful Intendant Sanscho.          Many people consider this is the masterpiece of Mizoguchi and evidently there would be many reasons to  affirm it; and even I still rather Ugetsu Monogatari, this superb portrait is one the most expansive and monumental films ever made in Japan; a fundamental treasure and invaluable file of your personal collection.   A must have it.
