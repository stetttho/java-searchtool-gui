 This is probably the most intimate film of Andrei Tarkovsky and somehow this film meant for him the back to his slave roots, but expressed in such original way. In first place, we have the presence of his father the poet Arseni Tarkovsky supporting stunning visual episodes, specially the unforgettable sequence of the Spanish Civil War; second the magnificent camera work , underlining slender passages of his childhood and showing the fantastic landscapes of his homeland; third the allusive first shots of a man who has lost the essential perspectives; fourth the shocking and hallucinating sequence of a boy making piss in a art book, trying to erase the traditionalism understood as the memory's imposing; five the mirror is a journey inside oneself , a lovable cite to Cocteau's Orpheus in search of our forgotten ancestors. Somehow this film anticipates Bergman's fanny and Alexander, but with a very huge difference; Tarkovsky expresses himself poetically, instead of Bergman who subordinates the image as the final product of his will, lacking poetry.
