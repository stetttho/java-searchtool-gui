 Two thieves who have been friends a long time ago, are chased and besieged in the middle of the desert. One of them decides to go for an additional horse but never returns: this is Jack (Eli Wallach) who besides escapes with two gold bags, the other is captured and confined in a prison in Sonora during five long years. He can stand any longer and decides to escape with a partner; but there' s just an issue which has allowed him to bear all the jail's hell: his vengeance's thirst.  The exhaustive search leads him to Monterrey where his ex con has become (in an anticipated Kubrick vision' s Clockwork Orange) in the town's sheriff. Brando is not alone; he is accompanied by three gunfighters who have planned to steal the bank. So we have Jack as a distinguished law's ambassador with a clean service' page and happily married with a Mexican and her teenager daughter.  The script will be composed by an admirable web of  events that will make to hesitate the viewer; Who is the bad guy?; Is a sheriff 's badge the way to forget about it a twisted life just because you haven't seen them?; Does the law allow you to punish and humiliate a man under the mask of the suspicious?. One of the most interesting surreptitious readings is: "The redemption is not precisely, a concept in the values scale of an ex con."     Brando stars and conducted this magnificent picture, beautifully photographed and remarkably directed. The 141 min run without you realize.  An exceptional and brilliant film that acquired a cult dimension since its first release and still, forty four years later.
