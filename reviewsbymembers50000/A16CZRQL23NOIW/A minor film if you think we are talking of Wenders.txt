 This is to my mind a very moving film with some gags here and there but nothing else. Considering the artistic stature of Wenders, you feel he is in debt with the viewer.  If not consider as a huge barroque comedy. Fellini in USA, with characters completely out of their mind and the situation may be seen under this approach but no more. Jimmy Smits , Mel Gibson and Jeremy Davis are outstanding and Milla Jovovich too, but I insist it is a minor film of a major director.
