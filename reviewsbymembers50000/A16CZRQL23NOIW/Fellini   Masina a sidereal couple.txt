 It is not easy to be loved. And the odds decrease notably when you live the life. Cabiria is one of countless and unknown stories around the low depths of the prostitution, the final result of an orphan childhood whose parents were killed during the WW2. Under this tragic perspective Fellini built this supreme picture; in this sense this work must be considered another awful testimonial of the Italia Neo Realism, but enriched with that touch of genius, a landmark feature of this admirable  filmmaker.      Fellini makes and admirable tour de force portrait around the religious beliefs, the circus in which magic and illusion will shake hands. Cabiria still maintains her personal faith in love, friendship and honesty in a dark, somber and greed environment, struck by the fatalities of war.  Giulietta Masina - who deservedly, won The Cannes Award as Best Actress in 1957- played the role of her lifetime with this incandescent performance, in which humor, hopeless, irreverence, sadness and disillusion will be your distinguished partners along this journey.  This is one of my treasured movies. Go for this legendary icon.
