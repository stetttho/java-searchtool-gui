 1990 was a year signed by the return of the gangsters.  Watch by instance , four relevants movies , Godfahter III , the worst of the trilogy ; Goodfellas ; State of grace and Millers crossing. Millers crossing has been the best film about the mob made not only in the last decade but even now . Sam Mendes made a great effort with Road to Perdition but never reachs this peak of Millers. Until now , this has been the best work of the Coen brothers , after their opera prima Blood simple. The script about a member of the mob club who follows his own honor code reveals clearly the orignal approach given by both brothers , Gabriel Byrne has never best like this one . Add to this the presence of that thousand carats actor Albert Finney , in a perfect role. Marcia Gay Harden grow up as actress with this film. The puzzle narrative , the dramatic tension and the emblematic violence is told with arresting images , the dramatic bits are shown with artistic commitment , the plot is very credible , adjusted and loaded with poetic realism. Pitifully the great notice of the rebirth of the Godfather , turned the world attention around this jewel. Once more another mistake was made in prejuice of this film . But warning , despite all the facts , this film and State of Grace will remain in a adjusted match as the one two couple in this genre. The time will be the best judge. Coen brothers made a unforgettable effort with The man who wasnt there in 2002 , and that film was also ignored . Its hard to believe because the man... was one of three best film in that year . Well you know , its a taste question but watch and buy Millers crossing . I watched it in 1990 and I got in DVD as soon as I could. Please, acquire this one!  Youll be always rewarded.
