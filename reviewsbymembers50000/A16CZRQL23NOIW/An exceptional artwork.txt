  Bernard Haitink is not precisely among my most beloved directors. But chapeaux is the best expression I can find to recognize this undeniable triumph in this difficult work of Shostakovich.  The ontological anguish in the Scherzo has never best reflected in any other available version. This Symphony somehow has not received all the deserved attention due perhaps its introspective mood: most of the great audiences prefer by far to seduced by the great, gargantuan. epic, colossal and involving extroverted orchestral mass pregnant with certain optimist resolution.    But this is a claustrophobic work of defined Mahlerian influence. Even heavy weight champions directors such Mravinsky somehow have forgotten the debt for Mahler where the existential anguish is simply delimited for a line: in Mahler this anguish is internal , in Shostakovich is a conjunction of internal and also outer collective horror where Stalin iron fist depicted the destiny of many people.  Besides, if you consider the fact of being the next Symphony after that giant work such Leningrad was, the Symphony may be was not as pyramidal and deep purpose but the point is the Eighth never received the special attention about its transcendent significance.  In this case the presence of the Concertgebouw and the special rapture day for Haitink made of this recording an inestimable musical treasure.
