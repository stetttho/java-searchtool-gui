 Bresson made his most epical film in all his artistic career. This film is a monumental ode to the power of will , tenacity and high   freedom spirit , a homage to the best a man can do when he's persuaded for get that goal under the worst conditions.  The story is simple. A prisoner makes his first attempt for escape and he's back to prision. But he's convinced with such passion and inner power that his fellow realize about that and help him for his achievement. He creates a vortex around him and thanks to that magic poetry of this unique film maker all the efforts made will prevail at the end of the road . The presence of the teenager is a complement of the masterful vision of Bresson.    Lyrical and surrounded for arresting images, a perfect script , under the direction of the master of masters, Robert Bresson. What the genius has of beauty is that it looks like  the rest of the world and however, nobody looks like him. (Balzac) This work is one of the supreme treasures of the french cinema and one of the best top five films all around the world ever filmed.
