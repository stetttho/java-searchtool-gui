 The virgin spring is a milestone in the cinema story . The portrait of a faithful child (15) who one day decides to make her religious duties . She is dressed beatifully for her beloved parents and in the midle of the forest is raped for three nasty men .  But the days have shortened for these miserables and the long arm of the fate will be back them to pay hostage precisely in her house . Without knowing , her father gives them the best attention and invites them to dinner and eventually to sleep from that long journey . But suddenly he observes a pledge of her daughter in their sleep bag . Finally he will notice about who they are and the revenge will be made with all the possible rage you can imagine . The poetic violence has never shown so plenty of urgence , artistic commitment and brutal sadism as in this case .  There are terrible forces in the nature human , and it is difficult to predict how far can be the fury of a peaceful and devoted man .  The last sequence is simply arresting and even you leave the film with a bitter sensation of injustice and satisfaction for the justified revenge ; you will reconciliate with the life when you watch this ending image . One of the top films of Bergman . Another winner film whic deserved received the Academy Award as Best Foreign Film in 1960 . A classic , timeless and unforgettable movie .
