 From a mining town of Nevada, a poor girl makes her dreams come true when a multi millionaire wed her. The process of rise of his fortune will suffer along the road of certain infidelities here and there and also certain financial tricks.  She will work out as the opposite side of the balance and will lead him to secure port. But his sudden death will become of her one of the richest widows and she will have to face the inheritors whose main features are signed by the stinginess, selfishness, cowardice, with visible lack of grandness vision and undertaking spirit.  In this sense the final decision will have to do with her ancestral codes, and start all over again, if it' s necessary.  The script is admirable, the cast is superb and the handle work is glorious, watch the framing process in interiors. Greer Carson has been always one of my three favorite eternal beloved actresses ever - being until this date - the only one who has been nominated five consecutive times - from 1941 to 1945 - (Elizabeth Taylor got it four consecutive times and Meryl Streep, three times), a record hard to beat and obviously equal. Maybe this one and The postman always rings twice be the supreme works of Ty Garret.   Admirable ending sequence
