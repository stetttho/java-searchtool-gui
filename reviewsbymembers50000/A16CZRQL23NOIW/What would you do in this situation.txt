 This is a very original film and perhaps the only one which has dealt with such demolishing and intriguing dilemma.   A magnificent student of the Sorbonne, at the last Semester to make the grade; his father is a Titular docent of the same University, who is a convinced Communist. The hard times of the French May. A terrible state of emotional tension exits in the familiar nucleus.  His father is an implacable activist that diffuses material of high caliber against the corrupted system. Eventually the maxim authorities, absolutely persuaded his father is one of the most prominent leaders of this movement will defy this son with a challenging proposal.  The rest of this picture runs for you. This film to my mind shared honors among the ten best films of the Eighties.  Go for this excellent and absorbing drama that will shock you even days after you watch it.        Without any hesitation this is the supreme masterpiece of Gianni Amelio.
