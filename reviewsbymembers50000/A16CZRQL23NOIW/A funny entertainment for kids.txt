 This is a typical movie of easy evasion; it deals with a ingenious script that pitifully was wasted, due its actual relevance. The well known of stunts and special effects weighed much more than any other circumstance.   What it could have been a full and rounded off movie with major dimensions, a serious ecologic warning, simply vanished packaged by a sand torment.   But, if you overlook that premise and let your neurones rest, you will obtain a gratifying pop corn movie than will be forgotten very soon.
