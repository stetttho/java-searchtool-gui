 Schiff makes an outstanding reading of these piano pieces of Mozart . The adagio in B minor may be the jewel of the crown .  Schiff plays with broad gusto . His sound is clear , and deeply expressive . From time to time you feel the torch of the Mozart piano players . In the reduced list of the Mozart champions you must name Lili Kraus , Dinu Lipatti, Horszowski , Clara Haskill , Edwin Fisher , Robert Casadesus , Eugene Istomin , Badura Skoda , Clifford Curzon , Georg Demus , Daniel Barenboim , Maria Joao Pires and Andras Schiff .  Schiff belongs to this elite . What else may I say?
