 Who can doubt the huge contribution that USA gave the world with films as Witness for prosecution, Pick up on South Sreet , Asphalt jungle or the Killing in this creative decade? But what Rififi has in its content is much more. The famous mude fifteen minutes became a discrete but original tribute to the glorius mude films.  To be true, I have to name Bob le flambeur as another strong candidate among the best exponents of the french film noir. Its very close to Rififi about it respects to its freshness and another virtues. Jules Dassin also directed the Naked city, but Id rather prefer Rififi. Buy this DVD sooner as you can and dont forget the fact that the new wave will burn three years after. And between you and me, Rififi would be a close ancestor of that important french movement. Don't you?
