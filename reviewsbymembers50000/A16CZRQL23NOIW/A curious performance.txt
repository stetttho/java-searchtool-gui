 As you know, Fritz Reiner was not exactly a sentimental conductor. He was a clear example of an Apollonian director. But sometimes in search of the absolute perfection you miss a desired grade of humanity and expression, qualities undeniable humane. To be honest we must agree we are in front of one of the most difficult scores for the piano ever written. There are many possible ways to approach it. This way in particular, extremely taut and as I said, Apollonian, can produce an epic vision, but the remained question is: How long can you hold this conception along the work?.   I have always thought Brahms needs a certain breath, a certain equilibrium between form and bottom, flux and reflux, systole and diastole, Ying and Yang, if I may. I find this musically solvent but extremely rigid; the leafy musicality of Serkin is visibly imprisoned by Reiner 's  affiliated scalpel. In Brahms you must sacrifice sentimentalism but never emotion. This concept can produce excellent results in Bartok, Schonberg or Carl Ruggles, for instance but never in Hamburg 's beloved son.       I got this recording for historical reasons. I appreciate it but with restrictions. My favorite version Fleisher-Szell,  Kapell-Mitropoulus (see my review about it), this one and finally,  the philosophical and contemplative version Curzon-Szell.      The Sonata is very interesting.
