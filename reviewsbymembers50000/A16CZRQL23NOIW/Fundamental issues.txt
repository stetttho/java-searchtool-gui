 The happy contribution of those giants musicians under the legendary batoon of such kind human being and profound director as Walter was, made possible these golden recordings.  I must remark my favorite versions of these two notable works are both directed by Ferenc Fricsay. Those are genuine gems but these perhaps are warmer. Leonard Rose the first cellist of the New York Plhilarmonic used to play in chamber works with Schneider and Istomin loyal friends of Pau Casals and as many times I have underlined this influence of this genius illuminated and enriched the vision of those musicians,. From Serkin, Kapell, Grumiaux, Vegh and please stop of count.  So in this case, the presence of Walter (just at the end of his life) a director who conducted so admirably with so many artistic liberties, allowed to leave for the posterity this golden legacy. Musicality, discipline and efusiveness all along both performances. Do not miss this CD under no pretext.
