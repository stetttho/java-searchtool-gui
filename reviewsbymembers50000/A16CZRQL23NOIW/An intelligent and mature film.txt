 After making the whole sum of the filmography of this original film maker with great peaks and lows, I think this is and I emphasize, is my personal criterion, this is Godard's masterpiece.  There are several aspects to remark, because you have to agree the film runs in a very peaceful rhthym. Absolutely agree. But consider the hard times. The existentialism with the hard loss of Camus in 1958 and Sartre leading this movement. And the Argelian conflict that it meant a hard schock for the French people. I mean this complex web of facts surround the film, that's why forty five years later may be considered dated for many people who ignores all the political, sociological and economic atmosphere that surrounded this country in the early sixties. Who could deny the use of the torture far beyond the battlefield? But Godard faced this serious and painful reality, ensambling a powerful with much deeper implications. Our petit soldier is a single man who makes his job until he gets convinced by himself the no sense of this War and decides to get around certain politically correct attitudes, and his dual behavior with Anna Karina shows his profound hopeless and trust in a better tomorrow, He has renounced to the ancient youth idealism. His grow up process has become from him a tragic symbol. Go for this jewel and powerful film, and remember. Godard's bitter gaze has been somehow his personal trademark all along his career. Fascinating!
