  In the story of the Cinema you may count with the fingers of two hands  the films which have focused with so artistic commitment level , the ontological loneliness, the loneliness ` oppression,  and existence `s lack of sense. At first glance the films would be: Ingmar Bergman's Seventh seal, Winter light and The Silence, Louis Malle' s Fire within,  Polanski's Repulsion, Bertolucci's last Tango, Fassbinder's Desperation, Antonioni's Adventure and this one.  So, consider you are before a hostile , merciless and unscrupulous movie who will show the last frontier of the waste land of human mind. Antonioni made a powerful portrait around the life of a man bored of being himself decides to live another life. In this state of things he will experience multiple issues derived from this decision.  Somehow you must be involved with the essential roots of the Existentialism Literature Movement and having read at least three fundamentals books: Albert Camus' The Stranger and Sartre' s The wall  and The word. So having put in context the fundamental basis it will be easier to come to the dramatic core.  And thanks to that advise you'll understand why Antonioni maintains almost twelve minutes the camera absolutely quiet in the middle of the desert .  To my mind this film meant for Nicholson the definitive jump as actor , facing and winning with this unusual performance and excellent film leaving the normal critics of peaceful movie and extremely slow script.   Remember you will initiate a weird journey with the master of the silence: Michelangelo Antonioni.
