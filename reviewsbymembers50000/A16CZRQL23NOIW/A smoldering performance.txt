 Henryk Szerying made in my opinion, the most volcanic , mercurial and expressive reading of the Schumann's concerto. His phrasing and tune were unique. Antal Dorati contributed with his immense talent and musicality to lead this version tho the glorious Pantheon of the unequal performance of this work. The Mendelssohn sounds OK but there are other superior versions. Szigetti, Stern, Heifetz, Gitlis and Rosand are the best exponents of this concert.
