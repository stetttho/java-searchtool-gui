 This is a mature western film . Its implications are far beyond the rest of the affable previous or next entries of the usual genre. This powerful story deals about a reformed outlaw - Gary Cooper - forced to rejoin with his ex-boss (Cobb) to save himself and other people of the several mistreatments . Along the film there will be hard to watch scenes . If you add the superb final duel , and the astonishing camera work , you will obtain a sum much major than the sum of its parts . The dialogues inside the house and the shot angles showing the low instincts are simply top notch . A legendary Western . To my mind one of the best ten ever made with that painful and fatal explicit and brutal act in Julie London humanity .
