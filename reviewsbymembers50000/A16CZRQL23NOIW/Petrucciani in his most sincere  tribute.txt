 The sense of comittment that Petrucciani gave to every one of the themes (with special emphasis in African flower), made of this CD one of the ten best recordings in that year. All of us know (and everyday the statement seems growing) the huge poetical stature that Duke Ellington placed. No other jazz musician has never been above him. And I must recognize that I'm a great collector of academic music, not even Gershwin could reach this height.   Ellington as composer, knew comuniccate his inner visions like no other jazz musician. When he composed he had the power to express not only his troubled emotive world, but being an exceptional witness for making us translating us to the lowest and deep regions of the soul. No matter where you're from. Petrucciani knew it and the approach he did to his music was a superb homage, and altogether with the tribute paid by Dave Grussin the before year (1992) to Gershwin, both of these two records are the best acknowledgment that two jazz musicians  have given us in the last twenty years. Please, buy that CD . You'll be literally by the nostalgical poetry generated by Petrucciani in memoriam of that legend living who was Duke Ellington.
