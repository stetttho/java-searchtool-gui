 Von Henselt piano concert is the peak of the crown . Absolutely agree . This work , despite its countless difficulties that demands from the player is surrounded of a romantic majesty and aristos presence . But think in Chopin's Allegro de Concerto : Chopin was planning to compose a third Piano Concert in 1849 but he only could finish the first movement . So this work literally was frozen for players . Nadia Reisenberg (vynil Westminster in the fifties) and Claudio Arrau (in the sixties) recorded this work and played for solo piano . But Michael Ponti aceppted the challenge and this was the world premiere recording with orchestra) The result is a fifteen minutes piece complete by itself with a mature Chopin loaded with new proposals and a revitalized concept of his beloved Poland . You notice inmediatly that the important 1848 revolution , permeated the soul of Frederick . Hiller ' s piano concert is a bravura work . The notes fall incisively on the listener , and suddenly the mood is made : its introspective moods and fevered lyricism will steal your mind . Acquire as soon as you can this weird album .Ponti reveals himself not only as a superb pianist , but also as an untired searcher of the unknown pieces of the XIX century , happily for us .  Thanks for Ponti , Earl Wild , and Raymond Lewenthal , extraordinary pianists inmersed in the purest romantic tradition.
