 Scary science fiction movie around small town residents who are replaced by inert duplicates sown by alien pods. Tense dramatic and anguish from beginning to end . This movie may be well the best sci fi film in the fifties due its originality . Directed by Don Siegel . The open ending is a classic and still menaces to you .  So let's do what Hamlet and let's kill the dream!, because remember in an insane world only the insane is normal.
