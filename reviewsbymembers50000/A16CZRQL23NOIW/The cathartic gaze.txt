  If you think it over there were six fundamentals films that focused in the adolescence crisis from four different angles between 1965 and 1970. If of Lindsay Anderson, The Young Torless of Wolker Scholondorff, The Strawberry statement (the weakest of the set), Easy Rider of Dennis Hopper, Carnal knowledge of Mike Nichols, and obvious this one, may be the most pyramidal of the set.  Michelangelo Antonioni, the great master of the silences, profited by the huge cry of inconformity all around the world in the late sixties to explore the roots of a dysfunctional portrait of fissured family, absolutely disintegrated. And since this vision developed a fascinating and powerful allegory of the youth's dreams against the somber perspectives offered by the future.  So this love affair is much more than a simple love story it's a poetic picture that emphasizes the supported conviction of distant voices as Jack Kerouac, and Allan Gingsberg in the middle fifties when the lost dreams of the steaming wrecks of the War left a raising boyhood not only orphans in the real sense but far beyond: ideals or trust in the future. The film may be result dated for you considering all the flown water under the bridge but if you real want to analyze a wider perspective of all a generation from L.A. to the 68's French may (Forbidden to forbid), go for this emblematic movie.
