 The life and times of a depressive drunkard (superbly played by Nicholas Cage), who gradually losses the essential connections with the real world to live the most awful of the thinkable nightmares. A real fall to the depths of the moral degradation and the swampy sewers of the life. This abrupt descend will involve a love affair with a pros (Elizabeth Shue) who eventually will do her best she can for trying to rescue him from his inner dragons but the effort will be useless. A very bold film that inevitably recalls us the eternal beacon in the darkness: Billy wilder 's Lost weekend with Ray Milland (a winner too), Blake Edwards ` Days of wine and Roses with Jack Lemmon (a nomination , he lost with Peck) and finally that jeweled film of the early sixties, Le feu follet (Fire within) with Maurice Ronet and directed by Louis Malle.  To set such tragic portrait in the middle of Las Vegas was a top-notch punch, and so show us the analogy of the contraries.    FOOTNOTE:  If there has been a true sense of fairness, this Prize as Best Actor had to be shared with the unforgettable acting of Massimo Troisi in Il Postino (The Postman), who was posthumously nominated. I am absolutely convinced this decision was not well received in Italy and to emend this mistake, years after Life is beautiful was excessively overprized to try to compensate this slip. Anyway, this is part of the story.
