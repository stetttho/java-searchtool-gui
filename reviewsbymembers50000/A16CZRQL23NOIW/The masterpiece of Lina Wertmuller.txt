 This film revealed the enormous vitality and mercurial force of this incredible italian actor : Gian Carlo Gianini. In fact this role is powerful and demands an actor of first line . Gianini was in his top , one year after of filming The innocent under the dazzling and arresting visually director: Luchino Visconti. Since Pasqualino is a miniaturized Casanova in a little village , his growing up process will be reached in the war hell , when he became a POW . But the acid script set to our Casanova in a terrible dilema with the abominable monster woman guardian of two hundred pounds weight who falls in love with him . You laugh but such laugh is so poignant in the middle of that campament. Wertmuller played hard , some scenes are loaded of the highest realism level , hard to comment here , Fernando Rey is towering in this work when he decides to take his final decision . All the wounds and scares will permeate the soul of this man who once was a trivial guy and will be back transformed after this crude voyage . One of the greatest italian films ever filmed in the cinema .  A must for you . You will not find just a hole on this splendid script . A perfect movie in all the sense of the expression!
