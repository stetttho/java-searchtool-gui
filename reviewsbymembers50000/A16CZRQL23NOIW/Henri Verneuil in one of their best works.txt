 Verneuil was a gifted french director and obviously he couldnt escape from the New Wave influence. Sooner or later he should make a film who woul express that sense of hopeless and disturbing underground bits of fate. In this bitter movie about two enchanting thieves Delon and Gabin ; they have a smart plan : to steal a casino in the famous blue coast. Everything seems under control but!  The smart script carries us to an unexpected and bitter ending. Gabin as always stating why he was the greatest and most complete french actor in the XX century. Fine script and dialogues. A must in your collection!
