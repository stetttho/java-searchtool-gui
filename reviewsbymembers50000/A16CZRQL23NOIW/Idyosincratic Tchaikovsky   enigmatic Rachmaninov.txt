 The Tchaikovsky piano concerto was approached for Richter as a imperial concert and not as a simple introspective and romantic work . This idea is extremely remarkable since you muts notice the fact the three first symphonies are deeply imperials , epic and surrounded for the epic majesty and russian pride .  But since the four till the sixth , the conception changes completely . We see the man and his inner sorrows and his fears. In this sense the most of the western pianist play Tchaikovsky , as the wounded man tired due his personal tragedy . Richter turns around the clock and reveals Tchaikovsky with the same spirit that we know in his first Symphny , radian and filled with vitality and fierce. The slow tempo does not mean a rendition but a clever statement about a transition between the youth and the mature age . Karajan in this sense did not make any special contributtion in this case . He respected Richter and knew about his special rapport for Tchaikovsky . I mean you will feel the required histamina in the last bars but as a natural consequence of the musical language and not a simple firework exercise. In the case of Rachmaninov , Richter keeps the romantic mood , and he avoids the excesive self indulgence so typical of Rachmaninov .  The emphasis turns around another levels , such as the epic nosthalgy for the land he will never see again and obviosuly the hidden homagge to his beloved friend the hypnotist doctor Dahl who rescued him from the alcohol hell .   Rowicki was one of the best polish conductors in any age . He understood perfectly this rapture feeling and the key was simply overwhelming . Fundamental issue in your personal collection.
