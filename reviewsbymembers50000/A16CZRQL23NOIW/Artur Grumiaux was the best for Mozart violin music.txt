 Joseph Szigetti gave a towering surprise with the ten violin sonatas , but Grumiaux was a real fighter for this Mozart music so plenty of lyricism. The vibrato and musicality given for Grumiaux is out of this world. His playing is kindness enjoyable extremely cantabile and above all deeply idomatic , loaded with majesty and charm and intimacy. This belgium violinist was a pupil of Georges Enesco . Pleas acquire also the trio Kv 563 . I've never a recording that rivalizes with that. Certainly Grumiaux was a champion master in this field!
