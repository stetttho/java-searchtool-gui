 Undoubtly, Fassbinder made this film thinking in Douglas Sirk. The script is carefully made, around a woman in her third age who decides breaking the rules. "It's easier to break an atom instead a prejuice". The Einstein's statement is translated to this picture with all its consequences. Once more , Fassbinder becomes in the warning voice of a troubled Germany surrounded by past phantoms.   A simply movie , but in hands of Fassbinder reached the major possible level. Watch this film. It will let you thinking.
