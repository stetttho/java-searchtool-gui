  This artwork is possibly the biggest portrait about the loneliness  hopeless and frustrations of a group of teenagers who suffer in silent voice and materialize their anguish with violence as cathartic manifestation.  We should wait to Pixote and Ciudad de Deus to watch similar height quality films.  Surrealistic and haunting movie that you will never forget.  Another gem work of Luis Buuel.
