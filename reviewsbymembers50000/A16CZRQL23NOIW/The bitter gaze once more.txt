 Once more the merciless eye of Raibner Werner Fassbinder focuses in a German American Vietnam veteran hired for Munich police to murder local criminals .  Imagine a lonely man in a room with thousand mirros. The images are placed next to each other reflecting the ambiguities , the blame and revealing the horror and the hell of the war do not finnish in the battlefield. A potent film and visceral drama. Do not miss this film of the early times of Fassbinder who literally gave a twist of fate to the Film Noir genre with this original work.
