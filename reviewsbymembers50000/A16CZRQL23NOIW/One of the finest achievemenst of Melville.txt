 Tauting , provocative and sugestive thriller ; this monumental work still hasn't received the important place it deserves widely. The script turns around three men linked by the faustic fate . Delon joins with an unknown ex convict and an alcoholic ex cop. The premise is extremely interesting ; don't forget the film noir still lives in France and from time to time it makes feel itself. The sequence of the robbery is a warmth homagge to Rififi ; Melville was so meticulous that almost kept the equal timing than that one . Jean Pierre Melville has been called the most american of the french film makers and the most french of the american film makers .  But, far the bitterness hidden behind those adjectives ; Melville made in 1970 a great contribution for the film noir . He's a gifted director . Bob le flambeur , and L'arme des sombres are two important films that prove widely he's a fine film maker and his concerns turn around the great challenges ; no matter the moral of your action ; you feel passion aroun the human beings who are involved in the mission. This film will reward you always . A winner film!
