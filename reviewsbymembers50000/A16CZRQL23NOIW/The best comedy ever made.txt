 This film is outstanding. Exhilarating, superb with an overpowered cast. Dennis Price in the best role of his life and Sir Alec Guiness showing once more why he is in the top list of england actors,altogether with Laurence Olivier,Michael Redgrave,Leslie Howard, Gielguld, Burton,O Toole, Albert Finney, Trevor Howard,Dennis Price,Dick Bogarde, John Mills,Michael Caine amog others.  England experienced a sudden creative explossion of talent in that decade like no other country in the world. And the golden age of the english comedy places in this decade like no one else. Remember the lavender hill mob,the lady killers, the Hobson choice, the man in the white suit. Unbelievable,do not you. The fact that Sir Alec Guiness has played eight roles in that movie is just a little detail. When you think it deeper,you will notice that this is an irreverent film . The plot is so well made,the sense of ambition reminds us the laughable side of  the sinister Richard III and his epic efforts to reach the top.  All this puzzle flows with such organical coherence that leaves you stunned. The edition, the amazing plot, the creative situations will not let you indifferent. If not for that movie, I would consider Dr.Strangelove like the most enjoyable black comedy ever filmed, but this film heads the five supremes comedies ever filmed. Kind hearts, Dr. Strangelove, The lavender hill mob, the lady killers and the gold rush can be in this group.May be you do not agree but in this particular  selection. Three of this five are from the fifties decade and enriched with the presence of Alec Guiness, somehow the godfather of Peter Sellers, partner with Alec in Lady killers.
