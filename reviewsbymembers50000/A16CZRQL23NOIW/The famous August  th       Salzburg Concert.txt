 This invaluable and treasured historical register is a billions carats performance. Blithering spirits joined with this masterful artists that glorious evening, conducting from the piano the Vienna Philharmonic. Fisher in his 60 played this marvelous program with astonishing ?clat and radiant inspiration.   This is one of the very first surviving postwar recordings, that explains and widely justifies all the technical efforts that finally have allowed us to enjoy and evocate that overwhelming Concerto.   When you listen this CD, you will be in hypnotic state from the first bars; such interpretation level pitifully is missing. Mesmerizing and engaging rapture state where the joyfulness and innocence will invade your soul  The Concerto 25 is played with fascinating conviction and sumptuous lyricism. From the epic initial bars until this Operatic finale. The No. 22 to my mind was his favorite one: Perhaps nobody has been able to play this work with major sense of bliss than Fisher. And believe me when I tell you; I have tried with more than one hundred different versions. Forget about it; you will experience Fisher ?s playing has such superior coherence that hardly you will find in any other pianist.       Perhaps these wise words of him, extracted from the notes of that Concert may give us a best idea about him: " Mozart? s works should be approached  free of prejudice: the musician should imitate neither the harpsichord nor the orchestra in the piano compositions, but instead should experience the music with imagination and feeling... Mozart is the touchstone of the heart...a noble human heart, full of infinite purity who speaks the divine language of the music..."
