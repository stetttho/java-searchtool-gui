 The unerring Buster Keaton made one of his most reminded pictures with a fine and delicious humor sense, brimming with invention and original twist of fate but loaded of profound humanity and joy of living. His funny innovations do not hide at all his profound devotion to the cinema and the multiplicity of uses you can give it.   To me there is not a wide space between his craftsmanship and Charles Chaplin. Perhaps,  Keaton was not so satirical and ambitious as Charlot but his only presence and his ever serious face was by itself an invitation for the easy laugh. And it does not sound exaggerate to affirm that due his ever looser style he influenced and inspired two undeniable and future filmmakers of this genre: Jerry Lewis and Woody Allen.
