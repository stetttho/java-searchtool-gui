 An original and challenging script where a psychiatrist on the verge the retirement faces a man corporal , spiritual and mentally persuaded he is Don Juan the greatest lover in the world . But , through the days a transfer of this romantic passion occurs and in this clever exchange of opinions Don Octavio will be twice the bridesmaid fairy who will help him and engage with his fantastic illusion. It is a real pity the insane have no right to speak about the madness of the normal persons . This Shakespeare works out to perfection in this smart film . The metaphor is cler . In an extremely rational world , Leuwen sets a handsome man in the middle of Queens to adopt a posture which in many cases reminds us to Alonso Quijano when he became Don Quixote . And what clever words of Franz Kafka in this sense when stated : The disgrace of Don Quixote is not his fantasy ; it is Sanho Panza .   Brando overwhelmnig as always and Depp amazing with Dunaway making a believable role . There is always a little madness in the love ; but there is always la little reason in the madness .
