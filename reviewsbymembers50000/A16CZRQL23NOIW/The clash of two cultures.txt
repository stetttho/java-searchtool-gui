 Kaufman's adaptation of Michael Crichton's Japan-bashing potboiler is a realtively light approach, a simple buddy-cop movie featuring a pair of entertaining star performances. In spite of the fact the novel's alarmism about the dangers of a dominant Japan would soon be undercovered by a mellow script that confers much more importance to the opposite views between Eastern and Western worlds around a lot of issues, the director muted the xenophobic material that had made the book so terrific and brutal, transforming it into an interesting film, whose plot is nourished by great visual effects and the stunning differences between both cultures, with Sean Connery working out as the common link between two ways of life with a great doses of suggested violence and alarming use of the technology to create unexpeceted accusations. Yet Sean Connery makes a very credible performance, as the detective, the script seems uncapable to surmount the anecdothic character of good guys and bad guys, and the ominous presence of the Japanese mob with pretensions of Noir Film, the picture leaves us a bitter taste, because even if there are good sequences, the whole material promised best best and major intentions.
