Despite four previous screen gems that deal with the warrior' s epic such as The Seven Samurais, Ben Hur, Henry V and Braveheart, the superb recreation of the Roman Coliseum, the handle of camera, the splendid cast, the arresting script, the glorious sequence of the initial battle in the forest and the final combat now belong to the history. Russell Crowe gave a towering acting and my sincere acknowledgment for Derek Jacobi `s performance curiously neglected by many spectators. A sublime tour de force that was deservedly awarded with the maximum honors.  A new classic of the Cinema .
