 Mira Nair won the expected recognizement on Cannes with this painful and real movie filmed on the heart of the Bombay streets with actors not necessary professionales , Mair literally drowned in the deepest holes of a city who sees how the things are and however are inmovilized may be by the costume itself .  The awful experiences of the orphaness with the drugs dealers, street hustlers and  merciless peddlers. From the initial sequences came to my mind the famous brazilian picture Pixote . This movie revitalizes in itself the initial spirit and commitment who threw to a group of film makers in that french artistic movement named The New Wave from the late fifties . And specially , Truffaut The 400 blows , since this works goes far beyond.
