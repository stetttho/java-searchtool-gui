 I must state my most fervent and sincere opinion repsct one of the most considered cult movies for many critocs and great audineces. In this sense my personal considerations goes in counterflow and I know this position may offend to many people but I think basicall all serious filmaker must to respect the intelligence of the public.   It' s really amazing the awaken scandal by this stupid film which can diminish your IQ in case you watch several times. I've always thought if the Marx Brothers or the three stooges would have worried by such movie , the result would have resulted even superior if the hidden purpose would have been satirical.   Indeed, even you kept your neurons far from irritating just for ninety minutes, and you made a concession with a friend or decide to bet a dinner invitation, considering it a extremely bad joke of long duration, you should lose because it doesn't get it.  Terrible edition, worse acting, infamous script, ridiculous dialogues and beyond all those epithets, a real lack of respect to the viewer.   But if after all those adjectives you decide the same I did in 1970 of risking your money and time, well understand my silence.   You assume the challenge.
