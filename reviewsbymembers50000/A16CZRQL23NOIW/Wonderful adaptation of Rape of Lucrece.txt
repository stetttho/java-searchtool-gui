 Sometimes the greed seems to be not enough to fulfill the feelings of the power . The envy and the impotence act as catapults to guide the human being to make the filthiest and nastiest things when the desire and the not reciprocal attraction enter in conflict . This unavoidable train collapse will be the dramatic nucleus when a warrior be in love with a married noblewoman . The exotic color is another fundamental actor . The incredible textures and graphical compositions make of this film an unforgettable experience that will last long in your memory for a long time. One of my personal top greatest one hundred film choices in the XX Century . Exquisite and memorable film . Winner in 1955 as the Best Foreign film
