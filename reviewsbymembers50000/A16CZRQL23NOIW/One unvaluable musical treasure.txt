 Lets start stating that Thaikovsky fifth is wild , caucassic , you feel the roughness and lyricism mixed and thats the way you must conduct Thaikovsky , specially in the last movement. Ive heard this version at least one sixty times and believe me ; there are few performances that even get close to that. because they lack incandescence, balcanic rage, and dyonisiac rapture. This is the jewel of the crown of this set. You may find out in the market Van Kempen Concertgebouw , Sawalish Cocertgebouw and Fricsay Berlin . I have them all but Koussevitsky wins. Dont forget that the strings , winds and woods of that orchesta are pure gold , the deep expressiveness and the craft of this master allows to develop the sense of the span , so necessary in this symphony. Because the three first symphonies of Pyotr Illich are imperial and the three last are introspective in their  mood. The Isle of the dead is superb. And the Sibelius seventh is first rate. This is , after the fourth, the most complex symphony for winning . You must underline the inner mood , the forrest sounds and avoid to fall in a sentimental mood due this is an epic work. Beethoven fifth is the less fortunate recording of the set. Its well played , only that there are giants versions that are far beyond this one. But if you are a hard fan of Koussevitzky and if you really want to know how the Boston Symphony sounded in their golden years, you must acquire this album.  This is a historical document.
