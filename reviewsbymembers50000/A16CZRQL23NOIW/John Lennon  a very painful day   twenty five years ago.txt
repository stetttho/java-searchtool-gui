 That fatidic day signed the physical departure of Lennon but also meant the birth of a musical legend. Lennon was the active creator, the irreverent wing of the Beatles, the troublemaker, the inexhaustible peace fighter.  In our memory are still fresh the first signals of an unavoidable breakthrough in the early seventies. Since that moment the artistic profile of Lennon literally acquired a new dimension, his fertile imagination and unquestionable lyricism made of him one of the last exponents of the beat generation, in the tradition of Bob Dylan or Donovan. Lennon was an openhearted creator, he opened sliding doors and allowed to convey the concerns and existential anguish of all a non faith generation. And his themes were poems transformed in songs: Since the first bars of my first choice of his first age: Instant Karma, the barefaced cry of loneliness and bitterness expressed in Mother, or the universal song of Give Peace a chance, his personal poem dedicated to Yoko: Woman, or his undoubted masterpiece: Imagine, work that would become his immortal hymn that still engages the newcomer listeners.  This is a sad day, but also an opportunity to think about him, wherever he is. In the name of so many people who are reminding him through his records at this precise moment, or visiting his New York Department, Farewell and let' s enjoy because he followed and achieved his bliss.
