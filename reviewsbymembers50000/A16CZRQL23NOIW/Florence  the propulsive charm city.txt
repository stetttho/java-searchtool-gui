 For all of us who have been successful to know such captivating city, it is nothing difficult to understand why its peculiar radiance attracted and seduced so many artists in the past: Michelangelo, Goethe, Liszt, Frtwangler and a countless crowd of artists of different latitudes and tendencies.   In this city, an inexpert young lady will experience her transformation from nymph to woman. Ivory made an superb exercise of good taste and sensitive use of the color and notable direction who reminded us to Luchino Visconti in what sobriety and expressive eloquence concerns.   Wonderful artwork, that deserves a special place in your collection.
