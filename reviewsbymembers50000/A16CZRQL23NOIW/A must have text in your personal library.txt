 Of the great conductors of the past, the egregious figure of Furtwangler emerges with a special effluvium. His unique and inimitable style of conduction are in last instance the fruitful result of a whole life devoted to art, music and Philosophy. According to a famous statement Goethe we are what we do. And that fact seems prevail and dictate the artistic trajectory of this notable maestro.   Backstage, Furtawngler was a deep thinker and besides a profound knower of the hidden details beneath the score. He argued any conductor should conduct from memory, even he had the score in front of him.  This is a sumptuous and full detailed biography around the figure and vital importance of a conductor who molded a way of thinking and playing the music.   Just think about those names in the conduction : Ferenc Fricsay, Sandor Vegh, Daniel Barenboim, Franz Welser Most and those musicians: Pablo Casals, Edwin Fisher, Wilhelm Kempff or andras Schiff. Behind every one of these performances, there is a propulsive vision that clearly molds the final result.               This valuable and fundamental biography will illustrate unknown aspects about the lives and times of this genius of the baton, who has been considered for many people as the greatest conductor in the History.  In this order of ideas, the book is not a source of musical information, its relevant details will allow you to wrought a wider opinion about this director (1886-1954) who believe or not is relatively little known in America.   I still remind a striking statement of one musician who played in the Berlin with Furtwangler and Mr. K: "He argued this cynical reflection: with Mr. K, undoubtedly we won much more money, but with Wilhelm we played much more music."     Absolutely recommended.
