 Gyorgy Sandor typifies as any other pianist, the whole universe of this outstanding composer: Bela Bartok. Sandor never played best any other composer. When he played him, there were a lot of livings, affections, shared issues, absolute commitment and such level of understanding around the score that you will be in shock state, once you listen him playing the first bars of the work you choose.   Very few times in the story of the music there has been such kind of rapport and authentic fondness, mercurial and visceral display of pianism. I was a loyal witness of the art of Mr. Sandor when he came to Caracas, his percussive sound, his incisive, leonine, steeled fingering did not permeate his marvelous inspiration, serene mystery and enraptured lyricism.  It is time for you to get close to Bartok' s universe but if additionally you decide to choose Sandor as his musical Ambassador, you will acquire one of the twenty recordings of the XX Century.           And after listening those works, you will know the reason of my enthusiasm. Buy all that you can around this team.
