 This is one of my favorite films of the second period of Woody. In this case, Woody focuses the well known differences between a couple, but concentrated about the shadow of a doubt. Was or not a murder the death of the beloved wife of their neighbor?   She likes Wagner, he dislikes him; she really likes to meet her new neighbors, he does not; she suspects about the weird behavior of the widow, he thinks there is nothing to worry about him. But in the meantime, there will be a series of vignettes loaded with fine irony and clever cynicism that encircle a nice and outstanding picture. There 's a deserved tribute to Double indemnity.   Keaton and Alda are specially refulgent in this original proposal of the untiring mind o this singular filmmaker who has filmed about his beloved city with much more fervor than any other else, becoming his flag and helmet; NYC.
