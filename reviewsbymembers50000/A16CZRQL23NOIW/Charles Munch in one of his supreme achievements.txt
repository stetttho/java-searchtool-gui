 The alsacian conductor Charles Munch found in this Saint Saenss work the perfect road to show us once more, not only the inner incandescence of this monumental symphony, but also his endless atributes as conductor: virtuosism, elegance, enchantment, that touch of class, and the magnificent sound of the aristcratic Boston Symphony. His playing is colorful, precise fullfilled with dionisiac imagination , expressive power and sublime sense of lyrism. His untired seek for revealing the essential inner facets of every work he conducted, made of him one true icon of the conducting craft. I had the opportunitty for watching him in TV cable conducting fragments of the fantastique and these brief minutes confirmed once more why he has reached such place in the reduced group of virtuosi. Please, acquire this record. And I swear you this will be just the point of start for you at the moment of enjoying the radiant presence in every recording that he made.
