  The prolific career of Rainer Werner Fassbinder (thirty six films in seventeen years ) reached one of the glorious peaks with that work . A fruit peddler watches his unexceptional life abrades slowly as a tragic adagio. The creative powers of Rainer made of him the tragic memory of the Post War Germany . His talent allowed him evoke with horrid precision the timeless and small tragedies of the common people . All these films served him as the secure plataform for his mythical Berlin Alexanderplatz , some years after . Powerful script and ensamble process . Watch once more to that supreme goddess and exceptional actress of the german cinema : Hanna Schygulla .
