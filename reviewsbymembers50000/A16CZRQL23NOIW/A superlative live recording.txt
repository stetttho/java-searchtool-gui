 Despite the numerous recordings made by this Bandoeon 's giant this one remains as one of my beloved. In Astor 's hands tango 's expression is elevated and ranked beyond measure. The modulations, dissonances, dynamic shifts confer this album a very special must for you.    The sublime tracks would be Hora Cero, Tanguedia, the impressive performance of Milonga del Angel and Luna -may be this version be the richest and most sublime of the countless performances made by this poetry musician- convey us to the nucleus of this sensual, mysterious and fascinating universe of shadows, partially illuminated where the disillusion and the fragmentation blend each one to conform a kind of delirious nocturnal tragedy.
