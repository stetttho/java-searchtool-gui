 Mircea Eliade defined the triviality as the absence of physical tension in the human being. If we agree this concept ; then the argonauts represent the fight against the triviality. Notice for instance the greek  meaning of Argos: the white ship. And the white color means purification. The seek of the golden fleece means the search for the triumph of the truth ; since the gold symbolizes spirituality and the fleece innocence ; the circle is completed.  Besides the mission has one last goal: to fight against the dragon and exterminate it ; because the fleece is its prisoner . The dragon symbolizes the perversity ; so if you want to access to the sublimity . you must to kill the dragon. This movie is a winner. Ray Harryhausen inspired to many film makers , specially a teenager called Steven Spielberg who confessed this confidence to James Lipton in The actor's studio . The mythical monsters are the magnificient background all along the movie. A film conceived as family entertainment but loaded of smart clues , who teachs us the huge wisdom who lives beneath the underestimated term myth: wrong choice as you know. Great special effects ; and from all standpoints a cult movie since its release.!
