 This surrealist picture is a magical mysterious tour around a bizarre world where the emotions have been lessened for the social conventionalisms, the double moral, the frivolity, epidemical visions, unresolved gilts, an easy going approach that do not seem to be so far of Rabelais or Moliere.  One of the freest films in any age and a milestone reference picture. Another sublime artistic feat of Federico Fellini; these dilemmas, far from being diminishing, have been growing up, what it proves its magisterial precognition and penetrating sights in the social body.         A must see!
