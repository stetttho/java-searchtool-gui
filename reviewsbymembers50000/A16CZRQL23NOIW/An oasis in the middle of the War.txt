 If there is an essential feature in the cinematography of this famed director is the memory `s employment to recreate these brief moments of happiness the life gives us, even in the sad and wildest moments.     In 1941, some Italian soldiers will remain stranded in a paradisiacal island which will work out as an adequate oasis to partake in la dolce vita.  A tongue in the cheek film that will reconcile us with those pleasant and funny instants of perpetual remembrances as only the Italian filmmakers are capable to make it.   A film to endure our memory, refreshing and visually arresting. A superb artistic triumph.
