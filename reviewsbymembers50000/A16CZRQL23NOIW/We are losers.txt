 That cruel statement belongs to Pfeiffer lines in the middle of the dinner where she has a dramatic confrontation with Al.   This is an ambitious film: in every little detail, and that's precisely their demerits. Al Pacino looks overacted in every frame of the picture, and his recent acting in the Godfather II makes of his character a simple extension of Michel Corleone. I know every one of Brian de Palma previous works and I guess he wanted to add a different and renovated gaze to this terrible gangster. But I think there was an exaggeration touch all over the film, making it perhaps extremely narcissist and hyper realist.  In the other hand it seems a big task to try to demystify Howard Hawks' s Scarface.       But the huge talent and his magic handle of camera save the film, leading it to secure port. There are however highlight sequences in slow motion that even would be improved in The Untouchables, so you may consider this film as work in progress.  The final sequence is anthological in purpose and reveals the Fall of so many dictators on the history but sinned of ambition and petulance.
