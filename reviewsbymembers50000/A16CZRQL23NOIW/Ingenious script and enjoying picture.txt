  Somehow this film -with the wide perspective of almost twenty years- showed the opposite side of the coin of what Midnight Cowboy meant in the late sixties. The intentions are very similar but the tone in what it is told marks the difference. This is not just a simple comedy it's a fine satire about the insights of the Corporative World.  Michael Fox made to my mind the best role of his career with this portrait of a risky youngster who will face the defying New York City in all the possible angles. His fresh acting style allows him to win as the daredevil employer of his own uncle the President of this huge Corporation. And the story , filled with unforgettable funny situations will define the ambition and the achievement's motivation for reaching the highest peaks the faster he can.   Add besides a smart puzzle hidden behind stage, when in a clear homage to the Graduate he will be seduced by his boss wife, Aunt Vera and simultaneously he got involved sincerely with his aunt's lover. As you know all the main ingredients of a typical mistakes comedy and a fabulous cast made of this film one of the best ten comedies in the eighties, headed obviously by "When Harry met Sally".
