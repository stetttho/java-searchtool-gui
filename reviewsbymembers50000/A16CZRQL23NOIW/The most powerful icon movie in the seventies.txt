 This work established to Mr. Kubrick as the most complex and deeper director in the western hemisphere. From 1956 to 1971 , Kubrick made a amazing journey , with films gifted with undeniable maestry and deepness ; think it: The killing , Paths of glory , Spartacus, Lolita, Dr. Strangelove, 2001 and The clockwise. This film is  deeply autobiographical, and describes painfully crude livings of Anthony Burguess. Kubrick , read a sublime adaptation from this work and signed once more his name for the story. This film doesn't age a bit. That's a good signal. The status of cult movie was born almost the day it was released.  Malcolm Mc Dowell reached the peak with this film; the role is unique in the cinema story ; he is not just a rebel without cause ; he also loves Beethoven's ninth and that makes still more interesnting and obviously weird his character. The experiment Alexander , will be the spark of the film. The lesson that you learn about the sense of revenge you may cause in an industrial and well educated society when you disturb the status Quo as Malcom did it with his fellow man , the crimes committed on the social body are very awful but it means nothing when you compare the force of the revenge of the society. No one beleieves in him when he is reddemptded , even his parents. And our pacified man will experience by himself all the secondary effects of the order he disturbed. In the nineties Transpotting and The experiment have been two reference films clearly inspired by this legendary movie. Watch this film, there are many points to remark , but I think you should comment with your closet friends this picture. Rossini never sounded so cynical in any previous film , specially with The Garzza ladra overture. One adittional issue the Ninth Beethoven version is from Ferenc Fricsay  conducting Berlin Philarmonic from 1957.Watch Mc Dowell with the casette. One golden cult movie, undoubtly.  Don't miss this original and bitter film.
