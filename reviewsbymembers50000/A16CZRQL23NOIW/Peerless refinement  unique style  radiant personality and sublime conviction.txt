 Maybe that statement sounds exaggerate to many readers or even reviewers. But I have not ever heard any other pianist in the keyboard story with such expressiveness in  what cantabile line concerns.   The sublime and wrought pianism demands all our possible attention. Since I watched this invaluable DVD, you may notice how he makes of every single bar, a task by itself. His gaze is simply enigmatic. And you cannot simply understand, the reason why so many pianist tend to fall into a wordiness sea, without nothing to say.   Wilhelm Kempff had surmounted that typical pedantry and stupid arrogance that feature so many pianists today. As a true artist, he besides to lay, created an atmosphere; and suddenly he achieved to mesmerize all the audience, because his personal convictions were so strong that you felt he had something to express and communicate too.  The Schumann ` s Arabesque is played with increasing lyricism and austere elegance. The Papillons Op. 2 are played with vibrant expression and serene poetry.   The tempest Sonata to my mind is the best achievement of the whole set. The aristocratic ?clat shake hands with those outbreaks of passionate breath and outstanding commitment. As a sculptor of sounds he outbraves the task with absolute solvency. Moonlight Sonata under his hands acquires a cosmic voluptuousness with that engaging charm and discrete persuasiveness. Sonata Op. 27 is played with such discrete humbleness and remarkable persuasion that astonishes even the most indifferent listener.  I just only would like to underline the fundamental relevance of this invaluable musical document, that will maintain into impeccable preservation for the future generations this legendary bequeath.
