 If we drew a straight line between Hitchcock and his most remarkable followers two names: Claude Chabrol in France and Brian de Palma and weaving finer we should agree that Dressed is the best and most mature film of De Palma. Evidently there are more than happy coincidence respect top previous Hitchcock entries. First at all Angie Dickinson has committed an unforgettable sin, she has infringed adultery and now like Leigh in Psycho she will have the weight of the guilt with her early death, curiously by the same sin.  The first part of the film concludes with her murderer, brilliantly made with a superb slow motion and astonishing handle camera. The psychopath is a twist of  Norman Bates. Two crossed and antagonist personalities living in the same body. Opposite sides of the same coin facing one each other and trying to maintain a fragile equilibrium, as we will see.  In the other hand we have a Peeping Tom but smartly embodied by a nerd: a brilliant electronic student who will become eventually in the target of funny double jokes.  But the main character is Nancy Allen that made an accurate role ( the best in her career) as charismatic and sympathetic pros who will be the hook and future victim of her dangerous game in her particular search of the assassin. The script is smart and in despite of the fact more than twenty have elapsed, the movie maintains its febrile tension.  An undeniable triumph of de Palma, without forgetting obviously the fantastic performance of Michael Caine who lived his Golden Decade in the eighties: Educating Rita, Hanna and her sisters,  Mona Lisa and this one. He had to win at least another additional Award with Mona Lisa, too. Watch it over and over and you will always find traces of good cinema. That' s a good signal and the best evidence we are in front of one of the four best suspense movies of the eighties.
