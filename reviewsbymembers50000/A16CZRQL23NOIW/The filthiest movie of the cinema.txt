 Pink Flamingos was the first film of John Waters which went over all the underground circuits. But his career has nothing to do with Jonas Mekas, Ron Rice, Lionel Rogosin or Jim Jarmush. Water is absolutely unworried about the form; but engaged with unhealthy tendencies of the human being.    The aberrant competence is established between Divine and the Marbles. The main guests (in this beloved cult movie among whom I don' t belong) are perversion, coprology, torture, blood, overweight and visual aggressions that conform an obscure journey through an awesome exhibitionism.   As accurately Danny Peary states, that weird fascination by blood, meanness and pain around the camera would seem to delight itself may be suspicious of fascism.  If you have an iron stomach, watch it. If you don `t,  abstain yourself.
