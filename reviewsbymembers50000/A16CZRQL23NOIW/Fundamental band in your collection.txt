 The creative sound of this band will reward you ever . It was not a heavy metal band ; but they had personality and creativity . Wait for a million years for example is to me his best song ever , but there are others pieces that will translate you to the soul of that unforgettable and so glorious decade . Midnight confessions was his most known theme ; and it was a reference track in the ancient discotheques of those times . Baby hold on is a summer song ; filled with that naif expression but inmensely sincere . Lovin things is another remarkable which maintained the essential mood of a golden decade loaded with thousand and thousand groups that sounded so homogeneus in his intentions .  But Grass Roots survived to that bubble gum music and has kept a status cult through the years . The personality is in last instance the vital oxygen which has allowed to groups as this , The Doors , Blood, sweat and tears, Procol Harum , Credence Clearwater , Three dog night , Guess Who to live through thirty five years without losing his expresion and represent the illusions and the dreams of a generation tired of waiting.
