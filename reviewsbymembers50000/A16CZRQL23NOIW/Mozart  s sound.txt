 In this Mozart'  s year maybe you have decided to acquire the basic discography of this outstanding composer and this set is part of this ambitious project. There have been genuine musical treasures: I would recommend as first choice the set of Grumiaux, Menuhin and Kremer-Harnoncourt. In what violin sonatas concern there is just a name: Szigetti.        These unerring recordings fit admirably in the personality of such venerable violinist. Menuhin possessed that genuine and heartfelt whiteness, main feature to make those Concerts sound not only wonderful but gorgeously.   As all of we know, Yehudi' s gentle phrasing worked out splendidly in almost all of composers. But perhaps his best feature was the easy and fast adaptation he assumed when  played with a determined soloist (think in Louis Kentner, Glenn Gould or Wilhelm Kempff, for instance, who were so different in approach and musical preferences). We still remember the astonishing collaborations with Dorati and Frtwangler playing Bartok or Brahms.  His exquisite phrasing, nevertheless never shaded his precise intonation until the middle sixties. Pitifully, since those ages we cannot to sustain this affirmation. Its gradual decay reminded another famous soloist: Artur Rubinstein who suffered many playing mistakes in the early seventies.                        So these recordings belong to the previous of this fatal and awful circumstance. In this sense Heifetz gave a wisely life 's  lesson. He knew to retire himself just in the right moment and that fact allowed him to increase his legend.
