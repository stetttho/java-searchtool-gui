 The unforgettable Edith Farnadi was undoubtedly the major female Hungarian pianist in the first half of the XX Century. She won more than deservedly twice the Liszt Competition in the thirties.  His playing brings us the efussiveness and the true essence of the Hungarian sketches without affections but a real sense of this special commitment you will find it in the first bars. I have not heard until now any superior version of Liszt's  Sonata in B minor, after having listened her. Go for this album and you will be surprised.
