 If you think it carefully, this movie might be considered as the seminal seed of The discrete charming of the bourgeosie. The mental incapacity to take decisions conceived as decay state, twilight creative, accustomed frivolity, amazing triviality (understood as the lack of physical tensions), and existential laziness are shown through a acid fable inspired in the Surrealistic airs enrooted in the great tradition of Beaumarchais and Voltaire.    It tells the story of guests invited to a sumptuous dinner party who find they are unable to leave at the end of the soire. An enigmatic and undecipherable force compels them to stay in such reduced space. And the previous and kind ambit gradually becomes a hellish place: they will know about thirst, hunger, boredom, fear and the arousing of the hidden demons will appear in the middle of this unbearable tension.   A merciless and bitter film, but also a penetrating and overflowing reflection about the human nature, that will remind that cynical and terrific Bernard Saw 's statement:  " Perpetual vacations: here you have a very close definition about what hell means."
