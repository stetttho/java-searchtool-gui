 Two opposites gazes. One of them is the counterculture embodied by a man literally inmersed in his own universe of the sixties. He lives in the time tunnel: in the other hand a special agent extremely conservative and following every line of the established codes. This agent will have to make a unforgettable ride through a train from to other state. And then a funny chain of smart and laughable events will fill the screen.Highly inspired and intelligent comedy that presents to Dennis Hopper as he wolud have got out from Easy rider twenty years later.  A tour de force comedy with many, many highlights. Recommendable all the way. Hopper and Shuterland made a maginficent team!
