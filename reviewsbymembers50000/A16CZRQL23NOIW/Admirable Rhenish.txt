 Neville Marriner has always been a solvent conductor. His apollonian approach would seem dictate all his musical temperament .  But fortunately something happened in those sessions when Marriner decided to record the Third symphony, best known as Rhenish. He literally got out from his intimate and well articulated approach to feel and giving us the most effervescent and passionate reading of this work in years. The ravishing effluvium of the nature, the authentic Schumann `s Pastoral can be listened with all its radiant exuberance and mercurial enjoinment with Mother Nature. The First movement is simply outstanding with the cantabile line of the horns making a true tour de force; the strings section giving the best of themselves, led to a splendorous and sublime recording. The First Symphony is extremely interesting and the Second Symphony is inside the standard, because there are two majuscule performances of this work the unbeatable reading of Leonard Bernstein in the early sixties with the New York Philharmonic and one superb performance of Hans Vonk with the Concertgebouw of Amsterdam in a live recording. The fourth is perhaps, the weakest of the set and this Symphony has four excellent versions: Hermann Abendroth, Wilhelm Furtwangler, Paul Paray and Bernstein with the Vienna.   Anyway, this a wise election.
