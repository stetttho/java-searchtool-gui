 If there has been an authentic Godfather of the American Western, this is John Ford.  This admirable movie with such Farewell taste is a personal homage to this genre. And there are so many details that support this statement: the black& white edition, the theatrical stage, you may realize Ford filmed indoors, the Saloon, the Shinbone Star remarks an important detail to take into account; the Press liberty, the duality between two men who pretend the same woman, John Wayne the hard good guy, accustomed to resolve the villains according his own wild rules: to kill or die; on the other extreme we have the emerging spirit of the law, the civilization embodied in James Stewart who plays the role of the tenderfoot good guy, a good will guy who will understand the Far West will not assimilate so soon those rules of the new times.   The legend has been wrought, but we will have to hide the secret. So beware where the historical truth begins and the legend ends.        Three giants actors: Wayne, Stewart and Marvin (and three awarded actors), the presence of Vera Miles and the raining star Lee Van Cleef, the secure directorial hand of John Ford. What else may we request?  A true classic.
