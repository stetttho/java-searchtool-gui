 I must confess that every time I decide to read a biography of the Great Painters of the past, I use to harmonize it with this enraptured music. The serenity emanated and the astonishing equilibrium of the form is simply unequaled.     Frescobaldi was organist for excellence and exerted that office in San Pedro, Roma between 1604 until his death in 1643 with a brief period as organist in Florence between 1628 and 1634.   His Canzoni constitute perhaps, the most refined evidence of his creative talent. Admirable from all standpoint. Fortunately for us, in the second half of the century XX there was a sudden interest about his musical legacy, that allowed to many ensembles as this fabulous and relatively recent (1979), or Andrew Parrot soloists have made possible the rediscover of such appreciated and many times forgotten gems of this Period.   Perfect tonal balance and aristocrat musicality characterize this excellent ensemble. Go for this CD without dilation.
