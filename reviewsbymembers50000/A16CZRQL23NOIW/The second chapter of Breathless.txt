 Incisive, iconoclast , pretentious, hilarious and irreverent movie. Godard built an admirable collage nourished with documental style, hyper kinetic rhythm with frenzy personages at the verge of despair.  The nervous camera tells about an initial murder and the escape with Pierrot in search of the coveted liberty, with clever statements and a profound love for the literature and the cinema.   The movie maybe result of date for many viewers, and it is absolutely comprehensible. You may consider it as a Theme with Variations, a clever ensemble of vignettes al along this poetic ride.   The main character will be a fatal victim of his irreverent attitude, and the abrupt ending simply was in perfect correspondence with the frenetic lifestyle of such lovers.
