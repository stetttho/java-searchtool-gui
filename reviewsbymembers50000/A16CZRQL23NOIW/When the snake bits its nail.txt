 This fresh, funny and smart light comedy reunited the same successful cast: Paul Newman and Robert Redford; two con men who eventually prepare the majestic and sublime fake with a twist of fate for the viewer. Seventeen years after there would be another picture that it would pay its tribute: I am talking about The Grifters. I really think the true winner film of that year should have been Day for night, but sometimes there are other points of view and other interests that have nothing to do with the artistic proposal.
