 In the the third film  of this Bond series this may well be his favorite : (for me it's the best) there are enough reasons to hold this statement. Harold Sakata is the most hated villain in any Bond picture, the maquiavelian mind and overwhelming presence of Auric Goldfinger , the unforgettable swiss landscapes , the girls Honor Blackman who is two steps behind of Daniela Bianchi (From Russia with love) and Claudine Auger (Thunderball) in what beauty concerns , the laser sequence , the poker game , the fine and suggestive dialogues , the ambush in the hall , the battle in Fort Knox and that hair raising final combat in the airplane, the dazzling direction of Guy Hamilton and the spectacular Aston Martin. What else do you need for watching by the first time this one or remind it in case you saw before as a timeless cult movie ? And please beware of any other hat in the head of someone like Odd Job.
