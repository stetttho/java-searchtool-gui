 For all of us who have been admirers of this notable pianist (whom I have personally watched him five times) and moreover still collect some old vinyl items which have not been released in CD format (an absolute mystery), know of his devoted and profound musical culture. Somehow, he represents a classical example (and pitifully an exception in those times) of a Renaissance man, whose honesty, conviction and commitment have deserved him a special place among the great pianist of the XX Century.         To my mind, the sublime inspirational peak achieved by Joseph Haydn with this Theme with Variations, in regard to we could define as a launch to the future. We should categorize it of thematic transfiguration, that clearly anticipates the late Beethoven. Such level of stylistic maturity, of enigmatic expression is something breathtaking. If you inquired me about the major achievement in the entire Haydn piano works, I would chose this one without an apex of doubt. The thematic development shows an unusual display of dramatic sense dealt with   The Sonata No. 60 is perhaps the most known of his entire cycle of Sonatas. It `s a lovely work, that clearly denotes the happy mood and absolute domain of the form. The thematic material that nourishes the First movement is played with a superb phrasing and sumptuous expressive elegance. The lovable Adagio is filled of a discrete scent of sensuality, ornamented with delicate thrills, the formidable change of modulation in the central section is played with notable mastery.   The Sonata in D Major is the most modern and shortest of the three. Built in two movements one thinks in Beethoven 's Sonata Op. 111.  The Sonata No. 62 is the most Mozartian of the whole set. It' s a cantabile piece that reveals an enthusiast anima state. With regard of its formal construction is the most classical of the set; if you check the timing of every movement you will notice there is not any special musical center of gravity; which markedly appears in the Allegro of the First Movement of the Sonata No. 60. Watch for the enraptured Dionysian mood of the joyful last Movement, authentic evidence of the impressive domain of the form.     The sublime achievement around the Variations sur l'Hymne "Gott Erhalte Franz den Kaiser" is engagingly emotive and touching; Badura Skoda shone with radiant intensity and discrete charm around this notorious piece.    As you may notice, Paul Badura Skoda in his sixty four, was in absolute top form.
