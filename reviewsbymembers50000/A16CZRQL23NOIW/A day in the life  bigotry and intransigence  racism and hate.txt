 These are basically the four primordial elements which integrate an intelligent and absorbing. The detailed process of several psychological profiles which concur in L.A. are narrated with an impeccable edition work and engaging stories.   Supported by a visible documental style and forceful visual images, the anecdotic feature is however its main virtue and not necessarily a flattening proof of originality and creativeness.  To my mind there are four previous films that portrait with all the possible crudeness, this painful reality.   In what formal construction and narrative style concerns, Robert Altman was the pioneer with "Short Cuts"; on the other hand there is French film of Mathieu Kassovitz "The hate" which focuses on parallel issues; there is another forgotten and underrated film of Dennis Hopper : "Colors" , the superb "21 grams" and finally we should not forget the admirable and absorbing work of Spike Lee "Do the right thing".  In this sense Crash prized as Best Film retains this bitter taste and seemed to turn around the circular nightmares and the absence of possible redemption. Its opened ending reflects and reveals with powerful strength the perpetual dynamic of the cyclic human condition.                This is a good symptom to take into account, because fortunately the special effects seem to have achieved the majestic peak (Lord of the rings) and returning to what it may constitute an authentic inner gaze, where the author `s cinema would seem to be recovering its missed dignity.  In last instance, if we take a look over the last seven years around films of  emblematic status such as American beauty, Mystic River, The hours, Lost in translation, The believer and 21 grams would seem to support my opinion.   Or perhaps this is a hidden tribute through to that sublime masterpiece of the American Cinema : Griffith 's Intolerance.
