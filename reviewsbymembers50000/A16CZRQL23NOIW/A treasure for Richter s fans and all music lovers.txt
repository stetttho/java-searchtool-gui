 Richter was an outrageous pianist; you may admire or disagree with his musical conceptions; but instead of that statement, you must recognize the presence of the genius in this unforgettable russian artist.  In this recording Richter has peaks and lows; his Haydn's sonate performance lacks of humor and spirit naif; his Chopin sounds cold; even expressive.  But listen Ravel's jeux; with the only exception of Cortot achievement's from 1928 , I've never heard such sound; loiaded with warm imagination and deep nuance.  The Prokoviev's sixth is the best of the record.I've matched with Sandor; Bronffman and an ancient russian pianist Yuri Boukoff (not released in CD yet) and forgive all the items. It's a winner.  In general terms it's an important document that lets you approach to Richter's craft.  Buy this one.
