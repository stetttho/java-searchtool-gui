 In the great brittish tradition of similar items as A brief encounter or The Browning version, we find this treasure in the middle of the eighties. Only the overwhelming presence of two giants actors as Mrs. Bancroft and Sir Hopkins could this work was a winner. The film presents multiple challenges that only two legendary actors as them were capable to play and even go far beyond the script. The script talks about the fraternity and the reciprocal admiration that these two long distance friends feel, their letters are a powerful inspiration motive to reveal much more issues than a simple intelectual exchange of wisdom and points of view. The hidden feelings of love are suggested with elegance and nuance, a wonderful sense of rapture without affection, in that sense this relationship reminds me to Clara Schumann and Johannes Brahms. Watch this DVD , because this film is now part of the romantic cult eighties movies.  A winner.
