 I had the privilege to watch this famed pianist in Caracas, in 1990. He is refined pianist, a colorist with an accurate sense of the tune, gifted with a charming temperament, always searching the texture in the score, with a visible tendency to explore the impressionist corners of the work.  That is why his Debussy possesses that lyrical flight and enraptured scent. In spite of the fact the presence of other pianists much more renowned, I would suggest you to acquire this rewarding option, maybe you get by far, much more than you originally expected.
