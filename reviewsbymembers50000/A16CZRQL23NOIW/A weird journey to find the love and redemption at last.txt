 First at all I must to invoke your attention about the countless times where doors open and close . I just remind one film besides this one : One watchable film of Liliana Cavani named : Oltra la porta which meant Behind the door. This smart device employed by Bresson keeps on guard about the terrible human condition of all the characters in this play . Every one of them has something to hide and that's why the doors allow them to maintain their secrets behind their troubled souls .  Once more we find to Bresson in one of his most emblematic works . Pickpocket deals about a loser who consecrates his life to improve his skills as pickpocket . The elegant refinement and the several variants lets you amazed , thanks to the masterful direction of Bresson . You feel immediately the powerful influence of Fedor Dostoievski in this brief but passionate tale . La Rochefoucauld told in certain opportunity that the sin was born from the exaggeration of the virtue.   Our antihero is simply a man without collective importance to put in Sartre's words . He is a very introspective and mysterious human being . We know almost nothing about him . His mother is dying and he is is unable to visit her till her last day of life in her deathbed . Somehow the narrative resources have very common points with Dairy of a country priest and in many ways our pickpocket is the mirror image of the priest. The initial dialogue with the policeman chief is fundamental to understand his weird manners and behavior . He uses some Blake 's arguments in the sense of "Those valid rules for the ox are not necessarily the same for the lion" . The hidden codes of  Nietzsche precepts taken from "Also sprach Zaratustra" . The superior men should not live as the rest of the mankind .    The graphic resolution and Bresson 's  camerawork are breathtaking in this brilliant and overwhelming story .   	 Another gem film of this unique and maestro film maker.
