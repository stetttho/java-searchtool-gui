When Leonard Bernstein crossed over the Atlantic Ocean to record these works, a new and powerful inspiration loaded his spirit and intellect. The Haydn `s 102 is top notch, enhancing to my mind his famous recorded set with New York Philharmonic. The Ravel Piano Concerto is extraordinarily showy and sensual; vitality and inventive freshness  permeate this curious recordings.  Kraus gave one of the milestone performances of Beethoven `s Mass, while Karl Bohm will surprise you with the admirable reading of Arnold Schoenberg' s Pelleas ever made. Sumptuous phrasing and expansive virtuosity of this Orchestra is carved in relief, but Richard Strauss' Tod und Verklrung Op. 24 will leave you absolutely astonished.  Frtwangler gave us one his most reminded versions of Leonore III as well his notable version of Brahms Second.     Bruckner 's Eighth finds in Karajan a good choice, in spite of the fact Mr. K is far to be my favorite conductor.   The jewel of the crown is the enraptured Mahler ' s Fourth conducted by Bruno Walter in a live performance in 1955.      In sum, the undeniable relevance of these legendary recordings are far beyond all descriptive adjectives. Go for this jeweled album. You will listen it over and over due its majestic realization and historic transcendence.
