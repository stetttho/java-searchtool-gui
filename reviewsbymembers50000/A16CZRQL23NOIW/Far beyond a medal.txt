 It is not enough to win a medal: It is precise also, to deserve it. Once more the monumental directorial work of Sam Peckinpah based on a memorable script, magnificent handle work, remarkable set up process, sharp cynicism and tension state all along this work make of this film one of my personal favorite movies in any age. Russian Front War: 1943. The German troops are progressively confined to abandon their positions. An outlaw officer, Steiner superbly played by James Coburn who to my mind made the best acting of his career has his own ethic war with the Captain Maximilian Schell who wishes with frenetic obsession to win the Cross of Iron no matter how. After a sinister and brutal attack in which Andrews the real leader of the Group is killed in action, this nasty officer pretends to make a false report appearing as the head commander, but sooner the truth will be revealed when Steiner winner of the Cross, denies this wrong statement. So, as you can see, the war is not more than a simple frame in which the effective war will be placed in personal terms. Steiner will be sent to a secure death when he refuse to inform about an evacuation order.  There have been many films in which the delicate and candent issue of the moral, ethic and honor are used as smart device to get undeserved honors falsifying the reality, but really there are such a few that exhibit with all the required intensity and realism: Paths of glory, Bitter victory and this one among the most representatives in this sense.  Peckinpah' s  artistic commitment is -once more- carved in relief with astonishing fairness. Mason is solvent and expressive in his secondary role.  Watch for Berthold Brecht's statement after the final credits. A must for you to acquire this outstanding film!
