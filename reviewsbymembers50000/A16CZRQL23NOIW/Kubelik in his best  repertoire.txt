 Rafael Kubelik swimms in Dvorakian waters as the great master directors of the past as Vaclav Neuman or Vaclav Talich . We know about the long and succesful career of this well talented conductor . In this opportunity this Dvorak works are played with soverignnity , energy , wildness and noblesse .  Even if you may argue about the powerful rerading of Dorati Minneapolis , you may consider as the exact balance between the warmthness and the fury , the nuance and the radiant patriotism which Dvorak demands .  Excellent transfer process . If you go tho the great works , then go to Kertesz and the Symphonic poems too .  The Ma Vlast that I love is the performance of Talich with the Czech Philarmonic .
