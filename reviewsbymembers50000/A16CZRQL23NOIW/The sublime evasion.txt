 I still wonder why this superb and unusual film has not been released on DVD format by Criterion Collection. Consider these variables: A industrial town and a young music teacher. His boring life will take a new twist when his fantasies of her female love affairs become figures from the history. With this original script, the outstanding good taste and talent of this director and the presence of the unforgettable actor Gerard Phillipe imagine the odds. The whole result?: a supreme masterpiece and one the great treasures of the French Cinema.  My favorite film of Rene Clair!
