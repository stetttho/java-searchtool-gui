 Herman Scherchen was a true legend in the musical direction. His interpretations were so distant to be absolutely idiomatic: and that' s why he can be underrated or underestimated. I must confess that with the only exception of Beethoven's Octave, I have been quiet reluctant about Bonn' s genius.  Nevertheless his Mahler to my mind is always fascinating. Evidently Mahler was a very beloved composer for him, considering he was a young viola player in Berlin,1911 when he took part in the local premiere of Mahler' s Seventh. The First Movement is fiercely contemplative, The tempos sin of being quite low.  But in the Third Movement, the best achieved, he conducts with a grotesque humor and sinister bitterness. That' s a punch because the sense of nostalgia is even more accented.     In the second theme Scherchen enters literally in a glowing rapture, a kind of fevered dreamingly state and so retake the initial motive . Finally, we have this brilliant and incandescent entry and participate of this anguishing existential frenzy. This half-witted introduction will lead us to a sublime farewell song of inspired lethargy and paused reflection involved by an almost Wagnerian lyric mediation.           The slowly from the depths of the dark cavern will emerge that triumphal and apotheosis motive to conclude the work. May be you disagree with the tempos; and the excessive use of rubatos, but the whole approach is extremely convincing.    The adagio is simply sublime and is one of the best versions you can find in the actual market.
