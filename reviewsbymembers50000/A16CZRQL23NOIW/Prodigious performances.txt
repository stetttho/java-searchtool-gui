 Mark Ermler made a fascinating account of this set of symphonies. By reasons of musical architecture, the Second Symphony is the best known of his works. It keeps the captivating Caucasian spirit, the obvious Russian reminiscences built with a portentous musicality that has allowed it to be used as musical ballet frame and incidental music.  There are two previous famous versions: Silvio Varviso and Ernest Ansermet, but this one in particular has such force and conviction power that it makes a wonderful contribution for all those who appreciate these minor works if you want, but nice to listen them from time to time to rejoin with the Group of the Five.(Cesar Cui, Mussorgsky, Balakirev, Rimsky). Specially recommended the Second and the Third.
