 This bitter and merciless film still reminds in my memory . The sinister metaphor about a man who wants to leave his past and begin a new identity with othe job , name and profession will be loaded for the unsatisfaction about the new concerns to face . Crude warning about the articial world and the promised land . There are clear references faustic too .  Hudson was never better than this one .  This is a unfinnished nightmare . One supreme cult movie .  And forget the happy ending!
