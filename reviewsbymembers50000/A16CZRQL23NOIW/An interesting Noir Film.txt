 A very dark film whose script is surprisingly effective and very, very original. An informer makes a deal, and he introduces in a mobster band as a simple writer who has lost his muse. his right arm will be a simple guy who obeys orders: extremely predictable with a clear of cultural ascendent. Our hero William Petersen much better actor than most of people believe makes a sharp portrait. He works out as a mirror image of Pygmalion and tries to open his eyes through a painstaking reading of Moby Dick with a lot of new discoveries about the life. The drama completes its circle when Diane Lane a real Supreme Goddess, with natural talent and well gifted skills for acting eventually will be in a brief love affair with our informer. But Petersen is a very straightforward human being. And suddenly something simply doesn't fit where it should have been. A thriller that keeps its cohesion and dramatic force from beginning to end. No fissures, good cast, excellent illumination and a very good cast. Lane and Petersen shine brighter with more intensity, obviously and establish a very good sexual chemistry. Above average.
