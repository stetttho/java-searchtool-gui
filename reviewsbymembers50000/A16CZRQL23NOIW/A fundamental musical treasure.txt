 Serge Kousevitzky reached that session recording, November 22 1944 such cosmic heights as never we had felt before or even late. At that moment the Boston Symphony was by far, the best American Orchestra that ever existed. This achievement was a colossal feat; because in spite of the fact there have been a major number of ensembles, a major training, a considerable number of new directors, it has literally impossible to climb such heights. The formidable passion, the glorious phrasing, the fantastic articulation among the 110 members of this overwhelming ensemble was product of other time s, in which the conviction constituted by itself the propulsive motor capable to generate such magnificent sound. If you know about any other Fifth, played with such wilderness, and Cossack fierceness, please be my guest.        All this program was performed with such histamine and mercurial conviction that hardly you will be able to find another similar recording. Fire, voluptuousness, expansive accelerando, magisterial attacks, and sublime epic expression in what concerns to the Fifth Symphony.   The rest of the CD is supreme and worthy to listen.
