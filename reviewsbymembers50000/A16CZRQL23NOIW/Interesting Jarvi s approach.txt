 Prokoviev was very, very sick when he decided to write this last Opus Symphonic. But the sum of the final result was an incredible work without any little bit of self indulgence or affection. From the first bars of the First Movement you can perceive the composer is looking for his beloved land in this melancholic main motive; it is not tearful it's just reminiscent, articulated with accuracy . The Second Movement is characterized such a festive movement. It seemed the composer is just making a living account of his early years. The third Movement is simply a ravishing melody; tender and slender, the last suspire just before the ending.  And finally that glorious and unforgettable Fourth Movement loaded with joy of living. The second theme is a re insertion of the main motive of the First Movement and suddenly he turns the mood, bringing us in the coda an assertive and dazzling climax. Very short but equally affirmative. There have been very few versions capable to reflect the real insight. Prokoviev abandons the poignancy and literally searches for his last elevation, simplicity but ornamented by a sumptuous orchestra and a major director. If both factors do not blend the result can be less than satisfactory to say the least.
