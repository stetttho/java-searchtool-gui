 The fifties decade was a real transition age . That meant change , innovation and curiosity to explore and research new ways of expression .  From Pollock to Faulkner ; Deming and Tucker ; the Cold War and the Rock & Roll birth , there was nothing safe under the sun . The adults opened the eyes from the WW2 demons and faced the countless challenges of a rasing generation deeply requesting to whom you had to convince and persuade . To be true there were few films who stroke the heart and soul in America like this one . There were others works such as Asphalt Jungle , All about Eve , The man with the golden arm , The night of the hunter , Anatomy of a murder that broke the walls because talked without any kind of restrictions the real world and the way the people lived . Baby Doll is a powerful film who strikes the roots of the mach man , accustomed to keep in home a sexual slave,  to consider the woman a desire object instead a lovely human being : the terror of the Cold War , the new dreams , seemed not include the woman in the project and Kazan decided to accept the challenge and he did it . The images  talk by themselves : the hidden desires of a child woman under the domain of a merciless and elemental man will be the main ingredients to show you an extraordinary picture . Censored and ignored in its age for all the Moral League and Institutions which decided to look to the other side of the highway instead to face the reality , were the best catalysts for throwing this film to the posterity . One of my favorite cult movies in this decade . Dazzling direction of Elia Kazan . Malden is terrific in this role !
