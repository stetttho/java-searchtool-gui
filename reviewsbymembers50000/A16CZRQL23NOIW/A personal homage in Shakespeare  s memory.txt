 This is an enraptuirng and engaging picture. Bergman invites us to think and laugh through an admirable and solid script exploring the lives and times of different characters.  I can still remember this solid statement from the first time I saw, in the late Sixties: "The youth lives with the illusion of not growing old".  A film that deserves all the honors.
