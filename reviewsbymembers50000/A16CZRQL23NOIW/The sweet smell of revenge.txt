 In the first part of this sequel, Jean de Florette, there has been a murder. So remeber Emerson statement: Commit a crime , and the world is made of glass. Emmanuelle Bart is one of the most beautiful actress in the world, his charm is so arresting that gives us the perfect role for this work. She made her debut in the screen in this one. She knows more than Daniel Auteil believes, he falls in love with her but... The second part of this work is extraordinary. You can miss the absence of Depardieu, that's why the director makes a clever less lineal with more surprises and even satirical approach. Remember the miracle water, for instance. Yves Montand may well have done the best achievement of his long career in this role.  Watch this enjoyable film, and remember this is the second part of the story.
