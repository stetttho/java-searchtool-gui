 this is one of the most pwoerful movies ever made in this new Century . The scandal is the half of the sin . But what a sin .  Are you able to reconsider the role of the Christian Church after this abominable fact in the WW? The historical roots are rigorous . Costa Gavras has always been a very minucious director and hardly makes a bad film .  Watch this film and then think it over , over and over . Amen!
