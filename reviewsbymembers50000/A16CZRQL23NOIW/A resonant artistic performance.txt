 Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli as Sviatoslav Richter  belonged to the reduced elite of artists who shone with brighter incandescence through the live performances. The final impression invites us to think about the stage magic that it seemed to work out as an additional enrapture motive.  Benedetti had to play this Piano Sonata many times in different stages through his life. But in this case all the multiple incident factors that influence positively were in perfect synchronism. The result was simply lavish. Brescia' s  pride played to my mind the most amazing version of this Op. 35 I have heard in decades. I had in my personal collection the well known versions of glamorous pianists as Rubinstein, Horowitz, Malcuzinsky, Cortot and Casadesus but no one of them has been able to reach, explore and portrait the nucleus of the work as Benedetti did it.  Please go for this record and listen this unique performance, because you do not need too many words to express the qualities of a authentic good wine.   The authentic is inimitable, the false is unchanging!
