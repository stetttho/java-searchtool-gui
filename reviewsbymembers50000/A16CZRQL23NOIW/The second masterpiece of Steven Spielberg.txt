 We must recognize you can have three different visions about the war. You may have an epical approach (Spielberg, Schaffner) ; a tragic approach (Fuller, Stone) or a comical approach (Altman).  Surprisingly Spielberg has taken the first sight. And this is an interesting point to remark. Spielberg assumes that challenge because his personal style has been always to rescue the dignity and the best of the human being can give and even do in the most awful circunstances.  He never tells us story about loosers , nevertheless he always seeks events or edge knife situations where you must face and win. Let's forget all his sci fi proposals (whre he {s obviously a winner) and let's focus on the flesh and bond films. In Ryan he reminds us the glorious D day .  No other movie in the story until now has shown more realism than this one ; the first thirty minutes of the film now has become in a classic. He puts the attention about the private Ryan ; he doesn't talk about great challenges ; he refers about the humanity which lives in men even in the worst circunstances. Schindler (his number 1 masterpiece ) runs by the same concept, but the concerns are major. With this one Spielberg signs his name in the reduced list of the great supremes war films in any age.
