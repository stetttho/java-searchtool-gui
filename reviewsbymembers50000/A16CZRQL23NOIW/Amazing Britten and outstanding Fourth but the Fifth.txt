 The Fourth symphony of Dimitri Shostakovich is a true allegory about the oppression, the anguish and struggle feelings lived by the composer. Shostakovich completed this work in 1936 but withdrew the work after a great number of rehearsals under Fritz Stiedry an it was not until 1961 that the piece was finally premiered in Moscow.      The approach of Previn is excellent, the abrasive and mercurial performance is quit different from Ormandy. If you imagine a giant U each one of both are in every corner.  Ormandy is more sinister and dark; while Previn is more sarcastic and cynical. It' s emotively closer to Mahler.  It is impressive the echoes of the Fifth present throughout the development of the Fourth.   Previn shines with radiant splendor in Britten. His Sinfonia da Requiem with London Symphony is bitter and soberly expressive. The long sonorities and chromatic texture are exuberant. The rhythmic expansiveness and rich shades accent the pain caused by his father' s death.        Four Interludes from Peter Grimes are eloquent. The drama and the sense of horror produce in the listener a similar effect than the horrid injustice committed against the Doctor in Henryk Ibsen 's An Enemy of the people.  In what the Fifth final balance, I have my reserves. There is a sensible lack of rage and grief in the First Movement. This First Movement must by itself be able to arouse the hellish Stalin 's fist struggling and menacing us. Pitifully he does not get it.  That' s the reason why I can not give the five stars. The rest of the double album is A-1.
