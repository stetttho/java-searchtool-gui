 Boticellian Tryphtic is still a hidden jewel for many music lovers. This is one of my beloved works of this excel composer. The whole work is a real musical treasure; it contains musicality, but also expressiveness and above all commitment. Written possibly in an age in which the real interest of the listener turned around other composers and new forms of daring musical expression, this work deserves a better treatment, now the time has passed away and we are able to distinguish the shining bagatelles of the brighter gold, perhaps we are capable to enjoy with much more frequency in the hall concerts, this overwhelming composition.  Meanwhile try to get this record and compare by yourself about the inner virtues of this work.
