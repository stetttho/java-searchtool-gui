 Fuller gave us a ravishing work. plenty of kinetic energy, without anu pause, directly he engages the viewer, around a prostitute who refuses making that job, and to establish in another land with the illusion of reborn with a new name and profession. She turns in nurse and works in a hospital. she's very pretty and soon she'll meet a man who ask for her to marry him. Suddenly she finds out awful who'll give her life a twist of fate. You are the judge and make your own opinion. But meanwhile her past is known by the little neighborhood and you can imagine what that means. After inquiring her, she'll be free, but she'll let the town, because it doesn't deserve the efforts made for her. Fuller established this bitter film just in the middle of the sixties in a world shocked by high tension : Vietnam's war, Kennedy's murder, and the racial issues. May be this was the main reason why this film was underrated. Too much high point temperature in the social body of USA in that moment. Please notice the films awarded by the Academy in that age, there were elusive pictures, think it Mary Poppins, My fair Lady, Tom Jones , Irma la dulce , for avoid to remind  the troubled state of things for that special moment. However the film has prevailed and thanks to the efforts of Criterion it's possible to appreciatte this cult movie. Don't miss this one.
