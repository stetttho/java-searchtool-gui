 It's hard to put in words the essential terms which describe that brilliant masterpiece . Marcel Carne and Jacques Prevert made an eternal film. The poetry envolves the plot from start to end. The locations, the superb performances of Barrault like the mime and Maria Casares are amazing. The atmosphere you breathe since the first sequence , seems to carry us to another dimension, to that extatic experience that trascends us. When an artistic expression gets it (like Beethoven's Eroica or Miguel Angel's Sixtine ) ,  becomes unique due to its  originality. Carne gave us big remarkable films like Le jour se leve, The night visitors , Les portes de la nuit, Le quai de brumes and Therese Raquin, but none of them will reach the height of that monumental work . A must for every human being , in any age, because like a genuine masterpiece, it goes far away its historical circunstance and maintains the eternal freshness for all the eternity. A venezuelan poet (Rafael Cadenas) said once upon a time: "The genius is always contemporean" . And the rest is silence (Shakespeare - Julius Caesar)
