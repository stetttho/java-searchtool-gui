 From the first bars of this enormous Symphony you can feel the authoritarian death 's call; this spiritless atmosphere must permeate the entire hall and connect you immediately with Thanatos; after this frightening introduction comes a dreamlike state to reinsert the initial theme with major chilling intensity.    The Third Symphony, composed between 1893 and 1896 belongs to "Symphonic Cantatas genre"; an enriched canvas with orchestral colors and iridescent textures; the whole orchestral mass, a children chorus, contralto and feminine chorus. This is a true nature 's claim for dissolving as reality. According to own Mahler 's words: " My Symphony will be something the world has not listened yet." Indeed, the entire nature has its own voice and tells such deeper secrets anticipated perhaps in dreams.   The perpetual and fascinating score is characterized for this changing character of the Symphonic language, the alternation of the Apollonian and Dionysian, nocturnal ardors and mysticisms those fabulous timbering inventions always noisy, childhood `s  celestial condition and the sublimated innocence, expressed as love.  It is useless to admit this is my favorite Mahler 's Symphony; a magic journey through the memory 's labyrinths that anticipated the nocturnal shadows in Schoenberg `s Verklaerte Nacht , loaded of that precognitive tragedy, repressed nostalgia for a world which will never be the same,  the dreamy remembrances of those walks in the forest and pantheist charm permeated by a cosmic gaze.  Horenstein underlines magnificently this aspect, and it deserves a special place at the moment to rank it among the most celebrated, expansive and heartfelt recordings ever made.   A must-have in your personal collection.
