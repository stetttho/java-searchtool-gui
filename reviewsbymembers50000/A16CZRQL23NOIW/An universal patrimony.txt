 The huge and significant loss that for the musical world  represented the disappearance of Glenn Gould resides in the simple fact that even twenty four years after his sensible departure, there has not been another pianist able to fill his place. His legacy seems to enhance proportionally through the years. His powerful cantabile line, his profound conviction still deserves him this status ?clat, that certainly have guaranteed a well wrought name in the immortality.   This enraptured anima state is not a mere product of the casualty or a mass media phenomena; he restored to music that divine majesty, sensitive effluvium and introspective gaze, far away from the delirious crowds, deeply focused on the meaning of the sound, and not in the beauty of the sound.  That `s why his legend has been increasing, in spite of his well known aversion to the advertising flashes. He never cultivated the public relationships, but the elevated rank of his musical partners, such Yehudi Menuhin, Jaime Laredo, Leonard Rose, Leonard Bernstein, Vladimir Golschman would seem to confirm that far beyond his countless irreverent behavior, his musical heritage eclipses all the previous misbehaved statements, opinions or his well commented and questioned attitude in the sense of deny to make future public appearances since 1964.
