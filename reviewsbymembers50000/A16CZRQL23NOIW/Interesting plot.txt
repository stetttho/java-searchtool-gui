 Three dramatic vertices converge in this smart script: The painful stunt's death and the sad memories left behind in a famous director characterized precisely by his dangerous EFX; a murder who has been hired to kill him; and the last act of love redemption when the things are out of control and you have no time to put the things in its real context. Interesting thriller that shines by the presence of James Caan as the fallen in disgrace director and Mathew Broderick as the mercenary. Some problems with the poor photography diminish the sum of the final result.
