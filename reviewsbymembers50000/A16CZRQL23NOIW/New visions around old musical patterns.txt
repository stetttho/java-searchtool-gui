 After a quarter of Century from his death, Gould `s fame is still increasing. Glenn Gould constituted for Canada and the rest of the world, the new prototype of the rebel generation of the piano. He literally demolished barriers and imposed a new approach  in what concerns to play Bach.   This album constitutes a true rarity in all senses. This is a repertoire that few or nothing has to do with him. From his interview of 1959, he stated clearly he did not like Chopin at all, according him, Frederick was not a good composer and just a superb miniaturist. But in the early seventies something deep inside changed and decided to play the Third Piano Sonata and these selected pieces of Mendelssohn.   For all those purists this approach, surely may be not pleasantly well received. It' s an Anti Romantic approach, Gould was always an enfant terrible and these works must be listened taking into account this statement.  His Scriabin is fabulous; enigmatic and loaded of a dark poetry. His Prokoviev is extremely interesting.  And please remember: All new art demands the extinction of the established order. That explains that, behind the ashes of the Romanticism, the Impressionism was borning : Death and transfiguration.
