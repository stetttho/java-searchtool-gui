 This chilling tale established for Sissy Spacek her great lap to fame. I watched her in Badlands after this movie. And it was extremely easy to predict for her the future triumphs at that moment. Who can forget -searching and scrutinizing inside personal memories- about the jokes, funny situations and sometimes great doses of black humor in our fellow classmates? In this opportunity we find a seriously mental wounded teenager, by the fanatic harassment of a frustrated mother who found relief in the exacerbating practice of the Catholic Religion, castrating her daughter and pretending become of her an extension of her will, suppressing the NATURAL wishes and illusions of the youth. On the other hand, we have her classmates, who ignoring her hellish familiar background, are continuously mocking at her.  Particularly pathetic is the sequence when she experiences her first menstruation, that submerges immediately in her particular and horrid hell.  She possesses a weird gift, better known as Telekinesis, that will be in last instance her mortiferous weapon in the code of the film. This film established for the great audiences the name of Brian De Palma and the platform of two raising stars: John Travolta and the beauty Nancy Allen (the future De Palma's wife). A great acknowledgement for Piper Laurie for her towering performance.  A classic film with remarkable special effects that rides between the terror and thriller.
