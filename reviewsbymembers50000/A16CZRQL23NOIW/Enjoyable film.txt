 Imagine this cast: Grace Kelly , Frankie , Bing Crosby , Satchmo and add it a Cole Porter score . The script is more than obvious it is the typical comedy of mistakes where the good girl at last will make the right choice , plenty of smart gags and clever funny situations and double sense jokes . Entertaining and one of my favorite films of the fifties.
