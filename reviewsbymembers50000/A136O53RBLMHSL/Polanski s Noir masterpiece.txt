 Sheer cinematic perfection. Roman Polanski's  total mastery of direction and details. Jack Nicholson at his sexiest with an unmatched cool ( a far cry from the scene-stealing ham/clown  since the 80's)and the ultra divine Faye Dunaway at her most mysterious as the glamorously dangerous  Evelyn Mulwray who is living with a startling secret. The best art direction, cinematography and the higest production. A classic  noir experience filled with intrigue and a solid plot.
