 An excellently realised film focusing on that ever so mysterious relations between men and women. Especially those that are tainted by personal gain, manupilation, lies, deceipt, lust, jelousy, revenge and a pile of control issues. This dark, gothic  all- girls  boarding house is well occupied by the brilliant  leads (as well as an outstanding cast of assorted fine young actresses): a very handsome Clint Eastwood ( as a handicapped  soldier fresh from battle and eventually a very compromised object of desire)  and the  rare, unique and  gifted Geraldine Page as the ruthless headmistress with some scandalous secrets  to hide. Once the lies are discovered , the plot charges  dangerously  ahead to a wonderfully stunning conclusion that will leave you silent.  Fortunately , hollywood hasn't felt the need to refilm this  extremely UNDERATED psycho-chiller.
