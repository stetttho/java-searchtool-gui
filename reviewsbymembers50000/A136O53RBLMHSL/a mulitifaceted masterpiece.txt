 Monsoon wedding is a wonderfully realised piece of story telling about all sides of the human experience: love, passion, lies, deception, rage, denial, truth, integrety, joy, humor to name a few. The gifted director , Mira Nair, is in full command of her craft as she builds the multilayered story which spins around the preparations of a glitzy, colorfully flamboyant traditional Indian wedding ceremony.  There are quite a few characters involved in their own mini dramas to track, but  miss Nair handles the complex narrative beautifully , weaving the many lives and issues into a seamlessly rich emotional experience and never neglecting to explore the darkest  depths of our human behavior, complete with  the very painful consequences that often follows. The superb art direction and photography only heightens the uniquely colorful way of indian life and  gloriously ancient customs. You'll be charmed, entertained and possibly moved to tears.
