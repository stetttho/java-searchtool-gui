 A wildly exaggerated black satire delivered with a wink and a glossy black eye. Ed  Nortan's  corporate drone is the perfect  persona to set off Brad  Pitt's  wonderfully witty and outrageously  glam character Tyler Durhem  who lives life on his own terms.  A stylish and hip treatment of an age old dilemma:  How does one avoid being owned / controlled by corporations and losing one's  inner and outer self to plastic consumerism and wretched materialism. Brad Pitt once again throws himself  (literally)  into this role with full throttle gusto and  is dressed so amazingly making Gaultier, D and G , Gucci and  Dsquared (all euro high fashion envelope pushers) proud as all hell. Helen carter Borham  is the single female presence and matches the fellas in her own delightfully twisted way, and has a bedroom scene with Brad that is as intensly violent as it is hilarious with a killer one liner. A  high concept  cinematic treat handled with twisted humor , high octane energy and comic book graphics .
