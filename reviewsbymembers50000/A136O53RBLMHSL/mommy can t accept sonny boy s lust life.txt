 A wonderful , black and white, old -school hollywood dramatic  film where the tragic , gruesome death of a pampered poet , Sabastian, is told by the two women who he used as bait to attract  his special brand of  'mouthwatering" rough trade. Katherine Hepburn creates an unforgettable character as the wealthy, pampered, imperial mother (in full high camp-mode) who refuses to accept her precious son's  erotic addiction...and  the ultimate price he paid for it. A spectacularly comely Elizabeth Taylor, flashing eyes, wasp waisted and full bosomed, is perfect  as the younger woman who Sabastian traded in his mother for when she became much too old to attract (and therefore to bait) his brand of  'delicious"  thugboy-toys. He was no fool...he understood what bait needed to be. She had the  grave misfortune to have witnessed that horrific final attack which  brought Sabatian's  life of romantic, artistic  leisure (somewhere on a sunbaked ,exotic island) to a sudden, unthinkable end. (An island where the rough young lads must have been even hotter than that merciless tropical  sun). Violet, the mother, spends much of the movie trying to get a doctor to perform a lobotomy on miss Taylors' character in order to stop her  from "babbling" about  Sabastian's  preferred tastes in pleasures of the flesh....and his  shockingly violent end.   Montgomery cliff plays the  doctor who ends up refereeing  these two extremely watchable old-school drama queens . He's the least effective casting choice, much too weak and fey and  he seems more "intrigued" by Sabastian's "adventures" than appalled by them. It was hard NOT  to imagine the doctor as Sabastian..especially since Sabastian's face was never shown in flashbacks...a great directorial  choice.  In conclusion, a rather controversial and somewhat vague story done up old hollywood style leaving plenty of room for one's imagination to fill in the blanks.
