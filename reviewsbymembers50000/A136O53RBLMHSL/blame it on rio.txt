 This is by far my favorite among Bruce weber's books. it is a beautifully edited collection of images from many different decades all involving some sensually stunning man or woman living a life of passion, be it sport or narcissitic pleasure.  What makes this "bruce weber book "so special is that not all the photographs were shot by mr. weber, however all of them have caught his eye for more than obvious reasons. So it's really in his editing is where the fun lies.  A big change is in the variety of males presented, not all are the usual silky-smooth northern european weber cliches. If you are at all intrigued by  mr. weber's male and female ideals, you are sure to be delighted at this wonderfuly light hearted and super sexy homage to the state of mind that is Rio ...and Brazil. The sepia tones further heighten the feeling of heat and sun-bleaching where the only way to escape the sun is to give into an erotic adventure. An intoxicating fantasy created with the chicest taste.
