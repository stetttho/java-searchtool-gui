 A fresh new premise, a stunning new 'monster"....just  when you think you have seen every new variation of terror, comes this very SLOW but  fascinating  tale about the very dark  and violently twisted private life of a very quiet, shy and sensitive young japanese beauty.  Great suspence and a strong cast , Be patient,  horror lovers will be rewarded. Good reason to be open to foreign films....foreign monsters....
