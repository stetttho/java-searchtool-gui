 One of my favorite titles from the helmut newton library. This books offers that rare opportunity for us to see some of the "studies' that lead up to the defining newton final print. It  covers both newton's personal work as well as many fashion campaigns from those magical years in the seventies at french vogue. A thrilling book for  any Newton fan. many of the polaroids have notes scribbled over them that are often witty and revealing.
