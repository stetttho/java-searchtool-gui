 An extremely personal record of the inner workings of one of the most brilliant romantics to work in french couture. If you admire artists that follow their own vision (and a wonderfully extreme vision at that!) this "scrap-book"  will forever inspire and delight you. Mr. Lacroix's strong interest in historical research, passion for color and textiles. and fascination with  creating one-of -a-kind-looks for a dramatic, glamorous, accentric woman fills his book of ideas with an unusual richness. A true fashion original.
