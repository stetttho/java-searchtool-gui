 A perfect fashion fantasy combining the daring photographs of Vogue's  original bad boy imagist, Helmut Newton, the lusty, excessive energy of studio 54 era manhattan, the  stiletto heeled chic  of Faye Dunaway and the violently raw sexiness of Tommy Lee Jones  ( to say nothing of  the red hot disco soundtrack).  The story spins around the controversially provocative  high-fashion photographs shot by  the infamous Laura Mars ( Dunaway looking as hot as the models) and her  murderous preminitions.  Casting  the actual vogue models (and hair and makeup people) who actually participated  in those racy fashion photos at that time  makes it  wonderfully authentic. A  sensational  thriller  that captures that spirit of wild erotic abandon which the high fashion world was totally lost in at that time .  To witness the  outrageous photo-shoot sequences , gorgeous half naked  lingerie-clad models  cat -fighting  in front of  burning cars, models in evening glamour posing with pistols and dead male models-  is worth it alone.  And we can all thank mr. Tom Ford for tapping back into that special time for his work at gucci....and later at saint laurent. A very modern film noir showcasing the glam-fantasy of disco- drama- murder mad manhattan.......pre- disney-fication!
