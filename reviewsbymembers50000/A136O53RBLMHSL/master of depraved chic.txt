 Anyone  who ever was blown away by the spectacularly original  and  outrageously suggestive  fashion photographs  of the notorious  French and Italian  editions of Vogue from the red-hot seventies....will savor this collection of  legendary images by the twisted visionary master, Guy Bourdin. Mr. Bourdin, alongside Mr. Helmut Newton, changed what was acceptable as  images to sell luxurious, overpriced designer products. They introduced imagry inspired by pornography, violent crime , surrealist art and film noir to high- fashion magazines and started a trend that will never go out.....even though the versions recreated today no longer have the style, taste or originality of these masters.....an odd statement considering their work was considered "tasteless" by many subscribtion cancellers. This book could have had better printing quality....and some actual magazine spreads could have been included....but overall, it documents and celebrates the art of a man who pushed the envelope  creating images of extreme sophistication and style inspite of the shock value.
