 Two words; Brad Pitt. Two more words: EARL LEE....what Mr. Pitt creates out of this damaged, deranged, dented, debauched soul is quite the work of art....every low rent..(what rent ?) detail is gloriously etched to perfection. Starting with a perfectly chiseled and toned physique curved into a lazy slouch, the  speech pattern and accent, wonderfully foul table manners mixed in with assorted grunts , snorts, and twitches makes for a wildly amusing caricature. Yes ,there's the sudden, shocking violence, there's also the perfectly cast juliet lewis ...doing......well.... juliet lewis- an overly mannered, ridiculously self conscious actress doing her deranged, psycho/ nieve child-woman...but hey, I'd rather watch her version than any one else's. Must be that face of hers.... which defies discription.  In dramatic contrast are the cool city slickers,  particularly the bitchy, cynical girl friend, you'll not find a more boring cliche'. The slick photography , poetic sound track  and hip art direction all work well here to create a laid-back, easy  mood that's suddenly rocked by brutality, courtesy of  the charming mr. Earl Lee...watch it for him....he's worth every last greasy drop.
