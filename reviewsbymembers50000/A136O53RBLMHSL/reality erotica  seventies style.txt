 A welcome contrast to the overly studied and glamourized coffee-table porn books of late, this book  contains images from the notorious seventies underground erotic quaterly. edited from a  unique series of magazines that featured the Mythic sex appeal of seemingly ordinary black men.  Produced during the height  of the black exploitation period, these images may be hard to look at during our current P.C. times. However, as a historical artifact of seventies pop culture and sexual liberation, it's an interesting item. The complete lack of sophisticated art direction is precisely it's strength. The garish interiors and un-polished men are period perfect. This work did not share mr. mapplethorpe's  ultra refined visual taste and obsessive eye for artistic details. Museums  and galleries were not the intended targets......it was all about arousal. Direct and immediate....for anyone who had a particular fondness for a specific type of ebony brother.
