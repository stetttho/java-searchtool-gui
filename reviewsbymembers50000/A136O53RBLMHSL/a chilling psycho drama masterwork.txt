 Liliana Cavani's  The Night Porter has been on my list of "perfect" movies ever since i caught up to it over a decade after it opened. A chilling psycho-drama involving the re-ignighting of a mysteriously obsessive, erotic and somewhat 'unhealthy"  relationship between a jewish girl/woman and an nazi officer. A very difficult story to undertake in general without turning it into instant sensational-trash. But in the masterful hands of the director, Liliana Cavani, and in the two powerful and very intelligent leads, Charlotte Rampling (exquisitely /animalistically beautiful with the most subtle facial expressions )and Dirk Bogard ( always perfectly creepy, tragic and tortured), this "sordid" tale explores depths  of human behavior quite rare in cinema. The intimate tone,  elegant art direction, moody cinematography and assorted  "fringe' characters all make this an unforgettable film experience  to savor in the oversaturated Nazi  Films genre'. A very personal and risky relationship handled with great tenderness and amazingly elegant  style. I recently rented a dvd and the picture was flawlessly sharp....as a tack. A wonderful film to discuss after viewing.....let the doom enlighten.
