 If anyone other than the magnificent old school drama diva Faye Dunaway had signed up to portray (that other magnificent-old-school-drama-diva )Joan crawford, this film would have been instantly  forgotten. That goes for any number of films featuring miss dunaway's considerable talents. She has a gutsyness and her  commitment to character acting is very unique. Never one to play it safe, she goes for the core of the woman in question and entertains us endlessly in the process. ..okay, there is that wonderful tendency to push the facial expressions  a touch too far...but It's so much fun to watch! Faye delivers  and elevates the art of camp to great heights.  as with all film-bios , the facts are just a starting point. Here we are treated to scene after scene of delicious over acting , glamour gone mad (not even crawford's classic beauty could survive the harshness of  40's heavy hair, frightening brows and overstated shoulders...and on dunaway's less classic beauty it's  disasterously unflattering), heavy control issues, knock down-drag out fights  and screaming hysteria.  The tension between the actress who plays the very young  daughter, christina, couldn't be better matched- they are wonderful together. Unfortunately, the actress who plays her older is not nearly as intense or fun to watch.  The character of her personal  assistant , Carol Anne, however,is very touchingly played with enormous heart. The men..well, they were there to suit miss Crawfords needs at different stages in her life...and visa versa.  Thank god she had her Carol Anne, they had a special understanding and truly appreciated one another.
