 As a longtime fan of the fantastic Newton visual universe,  I finally got to read this much awaited autobiography while on vacation under the unforgiving tropic sun....much like his favorite light. Unfortunately, the book left me wanting much, much more than mr. Newton chose to share. The first half or so of the Newton tale is rich in detail and held my imagination captive ( I almost forgot all about his life as a photographer). Newton's pre-vogue life was truly fascinating , filled with twists and turns, fate and chance , portrayed with great passion and humor...a juicy read indeed.  However, once he starts to produce work that helps define his genius, the book became very dull and lifeless. mr. Newton rushes through a very short list of moments to highlight the vogue universe that he ruled in the seventies. I was hoping to get much more insight  about the  great designers (YSL, mugler,valentino, versace , chanel) , models  (jerry hall,  lisa taylor, vibeke, iman, the entire crew of exotic -YSL-vamps), editors (polly mellon, grace mirabella, alex leiberman) and art directors that strongly contributed  to create the Helmut Newton universe. Many key names were glaringly missing  (one can only imagine the reasons),after all,  he is the man who brought  images of glamourized death to the polished pages of vogue. ....and so the mystery continues.
