 Tony scott's stunning directorial debut  makes the most of his background  in  filming commercials. Imagine the haughty images from the most rarified french couture houses mixed in with a splash of vampire blood and a lusty triangle of omnisexual predators. Throw in the darkest, most seductively violent punk rock track alternating with the most elegant classical and you have an amazing atmosphere worth dying for. No one can wear a veiled cocktail hat or pose their mannequin-like face quite like Deneuve (since Dietrich) or play the icy glamour queen of the night . Bowie is perfect as one of her (many, many)  elegant ,devoted lovers  facing  sudden decay and abandonment. Sarandon holds her own against these legendary style icons as she falls deeper into Deneuve's dangerous web.  The scenes where Deneuve is "courting" and finally seducing Sarandon is something to behold. Perfect editing with style and drama to spare. A vampire tale involving  rabid  lab-monkeys,  an ancient Egyptian blood thirsty queen,an 80's manhattan  swinging couple , a male prostitute, the search for everlasting love and life and  lots of  angular, black and white high fashion straight out of  any 1980's Italian Vogue.
