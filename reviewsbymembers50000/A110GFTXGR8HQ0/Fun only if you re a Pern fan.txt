 I was glad I got the book from our local library instead of buying it.  I sat and read it through in less than a night, not because it was that gripping but because I could skim a lot of it.  The main drama is buried under a lot of visiting with 'old friends' that really doesn't have much to do with the plot.  And when the drama hits, it is quickly solved with something that is suddenly tossed in as an "oh, here's the answer, something that just suddenly appears, now let's go back to socializing".  An interesting subplot gets introduced, then left hanging at the end of the book, so she obviously (hopefully) plans to solve it in the next one. I figure I needed to read it to know what goes on in the next one; but it's not one I'm putting on my shelf, not even as paperback, unless someone buys it as a gift for me or I get it in a sale.  And I'm certainly waiting on buying any more until I check them out at the library to make sure they're worth paying for.
