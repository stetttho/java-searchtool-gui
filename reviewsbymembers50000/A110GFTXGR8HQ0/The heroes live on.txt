 If you like Sword & Sorcery, even if you have never read Leiber, you will enjoy this book.  If you have read Leiber, you'll enjoy it even more. Usually when an author tries to step into someone else's shoes  (series), the fit is not exact.  Being a fan of Leiber's Fafhrd & Gray  Mouser, I was a little worried Bailey would disappoint me.  He didn't.   Swords Against the Shadowland has all the adventure of the original series,  all the action.  Bailey's style is not quite the same as Leiber but he did  not try to force it to be.  Instead he created a strong story worthy of the  series rather than a pale copy of it (a fault many authors fall prey to in  trying to continue someone else's series).  He did his homework and  included links to previous stories, the character's backgrounds, and  Lankhmar itself.  What emerges is a Fafhrd & Gray Mouser tale that can  rest on the shelf with the others with no shame. The book is good enough  it could stand on its own,  but by being part of a series I like it is that  much more enjoyable.  I eagerly await any more, confident Bailey will do  right by Leiber's duo.
