 A friend got me started on Black Company, although I had already been reading the Garrett series.  I had begun to lose interest in the Black Company, but this book brought it back!  I've been recommending it to all  my friends, and have already ordered a copy of the next one (release August  2000. Hardback but I'm hooked again).
