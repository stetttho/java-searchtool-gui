 I first read RELIC and then went for years before I thought to check about sequels or other books.  I was pleased to see a nice selection.  THUNDERHEAD caught my eye because of the description so I tried it.  And loved it!  Great descriptions, wonderful portrayal of characters, and I even got my favorite reporter back unexpectedly.  A very interesting idea about the Anasazi too.
