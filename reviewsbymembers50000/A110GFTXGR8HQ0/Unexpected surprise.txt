 I had never bought a singles CD.  I hadn't heard any of her music until I got this.  I was more than pleasantly surprised with what I got. Where has she been hiding?  A great voice.  "More than life" is a very good song.  And then to find an old favorite of mine also on the disk just finihshed my joy. This was well worth the money and I definitely am buying the album.  And I've been telling my friends about this great female talent I stumbled over in Native People magazine.
