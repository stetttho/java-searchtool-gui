 I had used other 'Teach yourself' something 'in XX days' before and liked them.  I sure got fooled with this one!  Avoid this book unless you are already comfortable working with J++.  The examples are confusing.  It  rambles.  It presents bits and pieces but never gives you a solid  foundation.  I really regret buying this book.
