 Very disappointing.  Contradicted himself in several places, stating one thing in one chapter and saying the opposite in another.  The pictures were nice but I've seen them elsewhere and they were nothing new.  The stories  were all pretty much what I've heard elsewhere also.  And his 'follow-up'  book is nothing more than a compilation of emails and articles other people  sent him and he published, which I can get on any of the newsgroups he  frequents. Kiss and Sell was much better for giving a feel of what was  happening backstage and in the hotels, and I didn't catch any major  contradictions in it.
