 I picked up and enjoyed the first book in this series, so bought the second and third together expecting more like STORM FRONT.  Unfortunately Butcher fell into the same trap so many authors have done.  The reviewers compare this series to that of Laurell Hamilton, and it does do the same pattern only faster.  It only took three books for Butcher to change what was a good urban fantasy/mystery about a private investigator/wizard into an attempt at a modern fantasy epic in which the main character is the pivotal element in a worldwide war between wizards and vampires. I don't understand why so many of the fantasy writers seem determined that any character they create has to become Frodo.  I was looking for a nice urban fantasy/mystery like Mercedes Lackey or Tanya Huff do so well. Buy the first book, skip the rest.
