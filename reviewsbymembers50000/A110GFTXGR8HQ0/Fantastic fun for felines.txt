 Don't let the 'some assembly' worry you:  the unit arrives in 90% assembled condition, just two small additions to attach and that took a klutz like me all of 10 minutes.  Looks great.  My nervous kitty was sitting on it in less than a day, and she is a bit paranoid about anything new.  I've not been disappointed by anything I've bought from this company.  All well constructed, shipped in reasonable time, and my cats enjoy.
