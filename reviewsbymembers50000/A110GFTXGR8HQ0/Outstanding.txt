 I came looking for a good urban fantasy that got its facts right and found it. M.R. Sellars does not fall prey to the common failing of so many urban fantasy writers who seem determined to make their main characters into pagan supermen saving the world from all evils (while usually mangling the precepts of the religion and everything else). The characters are believable (not just the pagan, but I loved the Native American policeman, who was very well done.  Being native I notice when I have run into so many books that botch that one). The facts (pagan and police) are correct.  The plot is well thought out.  The action keeps you turning pages. I am very impressed with this author and am recommending him to my friends, some of whom are pagan.  That's how accurate I feel his portrayal is.  This is a book my friends can read without cringing.
