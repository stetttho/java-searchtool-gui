 I'm not usually into romance novels but this one caught me.  Victoria McEwan is a modern girl, with realistic concerns and desires.  She seems to have her whole life in order when something happens to make her re-consider what she really wants in life.  I won't ruin it by saying more. Victoria is not a two-dimensional placeholder character.  Ms. Smith creates a character you quickly feel comfortable with, one you can relate to, and one that you can empathize with as she faces tough choices.   A very well-done story, with interesting characters and nice scene descriptions.  An enjoyable way to spend an evening.
