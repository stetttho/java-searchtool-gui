 This was a fun read, exploring a unique world with very interesting characters.  Ms. Merin's bio mentions she earned a masters in chemistry, which explains her excellent grasp of science.  But she does not bury the reader in scientific formulas or confusing technical material like some scientists-turned-fiction-writers have done.  She uses just enough to make it fit without being too strong with it. My only complaint was it was too short.  I wanted to read more about Trisha and the Temporal Anthropologist.  The book did not leave me hanging though, and at least it is not like many that give you 400+ pages where 350+ of it is throwaway descriptions.  There's no throwaway in this book.  It's all solid writing. I hope this is only the first in a series, because I definitely want to see this cast of characters in more adventures.
