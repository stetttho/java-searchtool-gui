 This and KISS & SELL (not to be confused with KISS & TELL which is good only for levelling a table) are the two books I recommend to anyone wanting to know about KISS. Mr. Sherman does an outstanding job of research, and then adds to his laurels by doing a great job of presenting  the facts to his readers. If you want the truth, if you want to know  about KISS; buy this!  You won't regret it. And Mr. Sherman  does a great  job with fiction too.  I look forward to seeing more from him.
