 I tried several other books and about gave up on J++.  Then I got this book and everything clicked!  No fancy jargon.  Just straight forward explanations, clear examples, diagrams that explain what the J++  environment is doing and what 'buttons' to push to make it run. And one  of the best explanations of Object Oriented Programming I've seen.  I've  taken college courses in OOP, but never felt that comfortable with it until  now. It's not fancy, it doesn't toss in a bunch of 'computer-eze', but  this book does what it says:  It gets you to the point of being able to  write J++ very quickly.
