 I grew up reading and re-reading theses stories.  I never found a compilation of the Mowgli stories I liked though, at least not an affordable one. This one gave me not only Mowgli but Rikki-tikki-tavi.  All with excellent illustrations that add but do not intrude on the stories. This is a classic that should be on every bookshelf.
