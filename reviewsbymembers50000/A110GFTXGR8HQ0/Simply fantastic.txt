 I don't know why the record company sat on this one. Peter's distinctive  voice and style makes this album.  The more I listen the more impressed I  am with his music.  This was his first album on his own, and he shows here  the talent that has  made him a world class musician for four decades.  He  is best known, perhaps, as one of the founders of KISS; but his solo work  shows he is a musician that is able to handle many styles and does so very  very well. No, it's not heavy metal and you won't need earplugs.  But I  recommend you find the time to sit down and listen to an artist who has won  awards for his songwriting and performances.
