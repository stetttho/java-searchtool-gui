 It's hard to write a decent sequel to an excellent book, but RELIQUARY is everything we could expect from the team that gave us RELIC.  It builds from the first book but does not just copy. The great characters are back but have been allowed to react and grow from the events in the first book: something many authors forget to do, and how could anyone not change after the events in RELIC?  Suspenseful, well written, a definite great read.
