 After my experience with other Norton series resuming with a co-author (Solar Queen's new books I read and quickly shelved to gather dust; Time Agents I enjoyed and re-read) I was a little concerned when I saw a new Beast Master book due out.  Could they recapture what I loved in my  all time favorite of Norton's SF? They did.  Yes, there is a new character, a female character, and a beastmaster herself.  But she's not just a female version of Hosteen Storm.  Tani is a well-developed independant character, with her own distinct personality and past.  Everything fits in with the pevious books.  And the danger is suspenseful and well handled. I would have enjoyed this book even if it was not part of a series, but to see Storm, Logan, Brad; Surra, Baku, and Hing; all of my favorites - portrayed as I remembered them and in a story that kept me interested to the end was wonderful.  And we even got to see more about the planet and its natives;and a bit more on the history that brought things to where they are. There's another book in the series coming, and I eagerly await it.  It's very hard for a writer to bring in a new partner and resume an old series. But Norton and McConchie pulled it off in grand style with this one.  Bravo!
