 This album, like his first solo effort, got caught up in problems  the  record company was experiencing or we would have seen a lot more action on  these because they are both excellent albums by an artist who can obviously  stand on his own. Unlike his first solo effort, most of these songs are  not written by Peter.  His distinctive style and voice still make them  worth listening to.  This album shows a more varied selection, which makes  the album a showcase of his wide range.  Soft songs, fast songs, pop to  rock to a little hint of about everything are here. Peter is already  working on several solo projects for when the Farewell Tour for KISS  finishes.  This album provides a hint of what he can give us.  For an  appetizer of what's to come, check out this and his previous solo albums  (OUT OF CONTROL and the KISS Peter Criss solo album).
