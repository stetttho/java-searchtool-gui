 I bought this, the first in the series, and enjoyed it very much.  It's a good urban fantasy, dealing with the idea of a wizard as a PI.  Nicely done and so I ordered the next two books together with the expectation of more of the same. I was disappointed.  Butcher falls prey to the fantasy writer's curse that seems to make it impossibly for them to write a series that doesn't end up with the main character becoming the key player in the fight of Good vs Evil in the whole universe.  #2 starts setting it all up and in #3 the series has become just another such book like several dozen on the shelves.  He also seems to like to abuse secndary characters but then has them keep coming back as if nothing happened. Buy this first book but skip the others.
