 This is Cook's house-cleaning book:  Tidy up a lot of loose ends,  explain  some things, add a few new touches.  Some surprises.  Leave room to add if  he wants to start a new cycle.   But I found the plot being allowed to  force characters into things they would not have done according to previous  books.  Some 'conveniently' overlook things blatantly told them.   Military-trained soldiers walk into obvious ambushes.  Please!  I know some  of these characters are older but that doesn't mean they're senile! A  decent book, but I think he could have done a lot better.  He has in the  past.
