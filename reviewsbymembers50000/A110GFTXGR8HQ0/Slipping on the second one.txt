 I was impressed with #1 in this series.  Unfortunately, Butcher decides his series won't hold his readers unless he makes the protaganist into a pivotal character in world-wide affairs instead of 'just' a wizard/PI.  #2 shows the signs of the change and #3 has it in full view, with Dresden being the spark for a major situation. I wish fantasy writers would provide strong characters without having to resort to turning them into Luke Skywalker or Frodod.
