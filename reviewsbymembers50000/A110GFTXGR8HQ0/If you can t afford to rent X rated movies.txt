 I had heard Laurell started writing her Fey series so she could 'get it out of her system' and bring the Anita Blake series back to what it was with the first few books.  So when I checked this book out of our library, I had high hopes.  After less than three dozen pages I saw what writing her other series did was just the opposite.  Not only are we seeing the same level of wanton sex, we are now also seeing extreme torture and bondage.  I tried to stick with it in the hopes the book would not be too bad, but when Anita ended up in bed with 4 men at the same time I called it quits.  But Laurell did at least have the characters take steps to make sure Anita did not get pregnant.
