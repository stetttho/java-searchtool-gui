 "Truth is the daughter of time," according to the saying from which Josephine Tey took the title of her book, and time affords Tey's detective Alan Grant plenty of perspective on the mystery he sets out to solve. Laid up with a broken leg, Grant begins investigating the alleged crimes of Richard III after scrutinizing a portrait of the fifteenth century king. According to many historians, (e.g. Alison Weirs' recent, "The Princes in the Tower"), as well as Shakespeare, St. Thomas More, and common opinion, Richard was a monster who murdered his nephews to secure the throne of England for himself. It is giving nothing away to say that Grant comes to disbelieve these authorities. Who he concludes was the real murderer I won't say, but it is interesting to think about his conclusion in the light of the economic consequence of the Reformation. Teys skillfully summarizes the historical facts and the case for Richard's innocence and presents them in an entertaining way, but considered strictly as a murder mystery her story comes off somewhat strained and contrived.  Also she is bit hard on St. Thomas More ("the sainted More") on whose history of Richard much subsequent history depends, even though she determines that More was deceived by the testimony of the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Morton. If your interest is piqued by Tey's account, do a search for "Richard III Society". They have a website with lots of further information on the question.
