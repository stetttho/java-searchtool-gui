 Richard Fugate manipulates the word of God so deftly in this book. He takes Holy, Blessed words and uses them to validate his abuse of his children. If one truely cares for his child and what the Bible says about their children they would do better to burn Fugate's book for light so they can read the Bible for themselves and see what the true word of God is. His flagrant manipulation of the Bible is a shame and it is a further shame if people follow his book and abuse their children.
