 Amazon does a disservice to JumpStart products by putting all of the reviews for JumpStart products under this product. The Advanced 1st Grade product is fun. My son, age 7, enjoys playing it. My daughter, age 5, isn't ready for it yet because it is a bit more difficult than the other games she has been playing. I would recommend this program for anyone who has a child at or near the 1st grade level.
