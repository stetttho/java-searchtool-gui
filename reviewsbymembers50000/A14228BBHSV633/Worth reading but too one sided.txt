 I read this book several years ago because I was fed up of hearing about Northern Ireland on the news and (like most people in Britain) not knowing what the conflict was fully about. However Tim Pat Coogan only half rectified this.      On the plus side this book gives a comprehensive  account of the main incidents, in a clear and engaging style, occasionally  giving personal anecdotes to add a more human element to the proceedings.  It quickly becomes apparent that contrary to the main conception, the  conflict has very little to do with religion and all to do with a typical  power struggle complicated by nationalism and ineffectual British  governmental policy. Coogan presents the horrors (and there are some very  disturbing ones) and the missed opportunities in an intelligent fashion.  He's also an expert on the IRA.      Where the book falls short however  is in it's blatant bias. Coogan is firmly on the side of the Irish  nationalists (as am I), however he does not go far enough to explain the  Unionist view point, thus many readers will go away bewildered at the  protestants, perceiving them as deranged orange devils, as many British  people already do (though in Ian Paisley's case they may be correct). Thus  Coogan is pretty irresponsible especially as this can be a very emotive  issue.      Overall, this book should still be read (it is a very  enjoyable read), but with caution or preferably in tandem with another  source that gives the unionist side more fully.
