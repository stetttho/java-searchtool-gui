 The three stars are awarded for the detailed content of the book- it's only good point. The style is very academic, lacking life and fails to captivate. Despite the book being named after him, Pol Pot is hardly  mentioned in it's 465 pages. Furthermore the book isn't self contained- if  you want to know how Pol Pot came to power, you'll have to read another of  Kiernans books. Here he paints an incomplete picture, merely informing us  of US governments prominent role (surprise, surprise..), whereby Nixon had  150,000 civilians killed in illegal bombings, which were capitalised on by  the Khmer Rouge to get mass support. The book also basically ignores what  happened after Pol Pots fall, thus leaving it seemingly incomplete. Also,  you'll need to know about the Vietnam war and Mao's China, as Kiernan  doesn't bother to briefly explain either, despite them being pivotal in  this context.      What the book does excel at is it's main focus- the  role of racism in Pol Pots exceedingly bizarre, deranged and horrific  strain of communism, which consisted of an intense xenophobia, especially  focused against other communist countries. Still, this doesn't make up for  the stale writing style. Overall, this book is not for the casual reader,  and is more suited to those who know a fair amount about Cambodia in this  era.
