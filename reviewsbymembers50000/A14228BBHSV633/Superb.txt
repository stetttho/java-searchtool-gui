 Malcolm X is possibly my favourite figure in North American history (though that isn't saying much ;-) and this book does him justice. While usually I stay clear of autobiographies due to there obviously subjective  nature, I made an exception in this case because one of the most  interesting aspects of Malcolm X , to me, was his life long intellectual  development and the charismatic and powerful way in which he articulated  his views. Thus an autobiography is an ideal way to get inside the mind of  a person, and trace their line of thought and progress. This book does this  superbly, and is both gripping and interesting throughout. It should reveal  that calling Malcolm X a 'racist in reverse', would be like condemning  Ghandi solely as being 'anti british', i.e. highly simplistic and greatly  missing the point.      A further strength to the book is that Alex Haley  provides a highly insightful biographical foreword that helps set the scene  for those unfamiliar with Malcolm X. The book is at times amusing in it's  anecdotes, and some of iconoclastic statements delivered by Malcolm X.        The downside of the book is that, as it is an autobiography, it lacks  the third person analysis that a biography would contain, thus it doesn't  really analyse issues such as who was really responsible for his  assassination. It also rarely describes any media appearances Malcolm X  made, thus we miss out on some of the important points Malcolm X made and  believed in. Overall I highly recommend this book, as do nearly all those  who have read it.
