 Early on in the book, Radzinsky claims he did not write the book out of hatred for Stalin- which is a blatant lie. While his writing style is very gripping, the book is ruined by his sheer one sidedness. From ignoring  credible proofs that Stalin was a victim of paranoia to the wholly  unrealistic depiction of Stalin being exclusively monolithic, apparantly  personally responsible for every single murder in the USSR during his  reign. This excessively hostile account based on sometimes the flimsyist of  evidence makes it impossible to understand the genuine affection Russians  had for him at the time or the reasons for self denunciations in the show  trials, and is the books eventual undoing. This hostility is also evident  in his descriptions of other figures such as Lenin who is criminally  misrepresented. Indeed, Radzinsky seems to gloat at times over the tragic  torture and deaths of the key Bolsheviks. Still, the book is still a  gripping read,just don't go away thinking you have the definitive  explanation of Stalin and co.
