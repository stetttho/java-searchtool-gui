 Louis Fischer does his subject justice with a fine account of Gandhi's life. Despite the long duration of the Mahatma's struggle, the author keeps the book interesting pretty much throughout. Fischer's two first hand  accounts of his meetings with Gandhi serve as a plesent break in the course  of the book, giving it greater life, as well as providing a more personal  insight into Gandhi. Thankfully the author remains well clear of blind  adoration for the man, highlighting both his flaws and weaknesses. The only  short coming is that the book was written before the rise of M.L. King and  Nelson Mandela, thus fails to address the full influence Gandhi had and  will have beyond India. Overall, I whole heartedly recommend this book of  such an important subject, which was also the inspiration for the film.
