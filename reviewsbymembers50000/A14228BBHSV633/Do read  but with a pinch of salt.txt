 I write this review as possibly the only Scottish person who hated the film- after reading this book it was huge disappointment. MacKay's book is very engaging, providing a very powerful tale of one of Scotland's two biggest hero's that is very enjoyable to read. Wallace's rise from  obscurity into a national hero, his massive victory against the odds  followed by his spectacularly rapid fall from grace are truly  inspirational. Furthermore MacKay has made the effort to try to correct  common misconceptions and redirects the spotlight onto those important  figures whom are commonly neglected. No, unlike Mel Gibsons claims, William  Wallace didn't believe in 'The American Dream'. No, he didn't reluctantly  resort to violence and war as a last resort and in revenge for a loved one-  he relished battles out of hatred for the english oppressors and corrupt  scottish barons. And finally, no the Irish soldiers didn't change sides and  join the scots out of a desire to please Irish-Americans and thus increase  box office takings for a motion picture to be made hundreds of years later-  they stuck with the english against their fellow celts. There is a large  problem, namely how much of the book can be trusted as being true. As very  little documentation from the period exists, Mackay heavily uses a poem  written by 'Blind Harry', which in turn was based on a second hand account  by a church figure. Thus parts such as the claim Wallace rose from near  death, must be taken with a pinch of salt. In addition Mackay sometimes  bombards the reader with too many names at once, which makes it harder to  decipher who the main figures are. Still, I would certainly recommend the  book as a fine historical tale, which is about as close to the truth as we  are likely to get. Oh and to find out what happened next, read Caroline  Bingham's book on Robert the Bruce.
