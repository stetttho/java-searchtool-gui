 Possibly the best book I've read- it's thorough, accessible and objective. Che comes over as being similar to William Wallace- both only really had one big vicory followed by repeated failure then execution, but are  inspiring none the less.      Not only does the bookdetail Che's life, it  also studies realpolitik in action, with the disgusting exploits of the CIA  as they assassinate, and help to violently overthrow democratically elected  governments when they disagree with the result, showing their true beliefs  are those of property not freedom. The events of Guatemala, Chile, the Bay  of Pigs, the Cuban missile crisis, Sino-soviet split, and more are all  documented. Famous figures such as Malcolm X, JFK, Evita, Nasser, Nehru,  Mao all crop up too. Overall this should be considered a compulsory read,  particularly to those in America who know little of communism, the cold war  etc. other than the propaganda they've been fed over the decades- it  probably won't convert you but it will give you a greater understanding as  to the other side of the argument. Granted, if you're intimidated by large  book, this won't be for you- but then again what would Che think of someone  who's afraid of an inanimate paper based product?
