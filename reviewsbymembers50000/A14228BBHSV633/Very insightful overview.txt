 This book is based on the superb BBC series, however it is not necessary for the reader to have seen it. Bregman and El-Tahri, a jew and an arab, have produced a clear, balanced and insightful book on one of the on going  conflicts of the 20th century. This book is ideal for those who continually  see or read about the Israeli conflict on the news and in the papers,  without actually knowing what it is all about. As an overview, it will  rapidly educate the reader as to the causes of the conflict and the reasons  for the solution being so elusive. At times ironically amusing, it depicts  the constant back stabbing, plotting and betrayal by all sides- jewish,  arab, american and russian. If this book is to be faulted it is that it  doesn't go into great depth with regard to some of the personalities and  events, however if it had done it would have been a much longer book. The  writing style is very accessible, though somewhat bland. Also the  photographs are relatively poor, and uninteresting. Thus, I recommend this  book as an introduction to the Israeli conflict, rather than a complex  in-depth historical work.
