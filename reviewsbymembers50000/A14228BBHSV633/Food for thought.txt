 I finally got round to reading this 'classic', and I must say I wasn't too disappointed, as up until now I've disliked nearly all the so called classics I've read. The first two parts of the book are largely mediocre-  Orwells writing style has never really been particularly special and the  world and characters he depicts are somewhat clumsy.       It is only  upon reading the final part of the novel that this book rises above the  crowd, as Orwell firmly clarifies the message of the book, not only  depicting the true horror of an omnipotent dictatorship, but also the  systematic manipulation of information and fact to it's ultimate extreme.  This latter point has tremendous relevance as it does occur in western  societies, hence in America words such as 'liberal' have had their meaning  altered by the media to the point at which they become non descriptive,  merely remaining as a form of abuse. This use of language manipulation is  revealed in the book to be the final step in ultimate control- to  manipulate peoples actual ability to think.       The book does leave the  reader with much to ponder, and indeed many will take different messages  away from it, though I must admit how anyone who has read the whole book  can go away thinking that it was merely a straight forward attack on  communism, is beyond me. Left, right and centre poltics are all capable of  using the methods warned against in this book, and have all done so to a  certain degree.      Overall, well worth reading.
