 I happen to stumble upon this book at  library. The book provides information that most people doniot hear about Nubia. The book however does try to present racial differences between Nubians and egyptains. The weakness of the book is it's inacuracies,and it does have many. The book also goes on to say the people who founded the civilzation of Menore were no nubian,but of a different Ethnic group. The Egyptains and Nubians did fight many bloody war,but there was never any racial tension based upon color. There is murals in tombs scenes that draw the Nubians and Egyptains in the same shade.   Another fatl flaw is the label of negro. The word negro just means black and does not describe racial defintion. The egyptains in a sense according to countless Greek testimony based upon the description of Negrio would be classified as just that. The question is how can you dismiss evidence of the burial at Qustal as being the seat of the foundation of the egyptain dynastic era. The insense burner they found at the site is the very first description of a per aa aka pharoah in greek. Professor Bruce Willams documents this,and also wrote the article in the Archeology magazine the lost pharoahs of Nubia.   The other evidence is also that Sudan and not Giza plataeu bear the oldest pre historic sites,the oldest pottery found in the world,and key evidence at Nabta of where the ancient egyptains came from. I woyuld recommend this book to spark your interest in Nubia,but it was written at a time when there was very much biased scholarship. The book contridicts itself with worthless racial opinion.
