 I liked the book,but it did have many faults to and left much information out abotu the truth and reality of Africa people. I would recommend this book to any one starting out on the path ot learning about African people and African cultures,as well as the dispora. I am not the biggest fan of Henery Louis Gates considering his documentary made also left out much information and was very disrespectful to African people. I know many people feel Gates as a negro saxon.  Gates may have his faults,but it seems there are hints of Afrocenttrism in his book. I am glad Gates talks about the black peole of Russia that not very many people know about the mysterious black people of the caucaous mountains.  I don't like however how Gates twists the theroies about Ancient Egypt by making Cheikh Anta Diop look less creditable. The other thing about the blacks of the caucaous mountains, the russian goverment has relocated from.   They are the possible link to the ancient egyptains also people known as the colchians.
