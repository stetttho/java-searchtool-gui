 I have read many books that show africa in a negative light and say that Africa people have never accoplished anything. The books are still coming out from the Bell Curve to J.Phillipe Rushton. I feel all these people have a biased eurocentric view of the world and are writting these just because of politicks. I read Sunjata and it really changed my perpective of Africa history.  Sunjata is worth a read for anybody uif they want to know the truth about Africa and not the biased perceptions we have of the so called dark continent.
