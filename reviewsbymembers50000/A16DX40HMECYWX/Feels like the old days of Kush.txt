 Nubians in Egypt are know rejuvenating their centuries old culture that is older than egypt aka Kemet. Many people donot know the nubians even exist any more,but they still continue like the fellahin in Southern Egypt their ancient lifestyle. I just love the way Hamaza combines the enchanting sounds of the OUD,and breathes life into the ancient strings. The OUD is not a arab instrument,but in fact a instrument that goes back to the period of the Old Kingdom. The arabs discovered of course at about the same time the Phophet muhammed died and the arabs started to bring islam to the rest of the world through the sword. I wish though that Hamaza would bring the kissar into more focus because it is a beautiful nubian instrument.  Buy this album because it is a document of a culture that once was,but know can only be seen in museums and exhibitons.
