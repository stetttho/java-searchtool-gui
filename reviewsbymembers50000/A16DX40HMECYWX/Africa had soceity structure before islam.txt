 I see another person has put forth their opinions on Africa,and let me quess pre roman europe was so great also. People fail to realize that in pre islamic Africa they have found evidence to urbanization that people once thought was prouduced by the interaction of arabs and tuaregs.  They discovered an African city called djenne.  Djenne actually had a population bigger than medevil england. Islamic Africa also was a great civlization that boasted many libaries and Quranic schools such as Sankore, Katsina in Kano.  The Agrican genius comes from the fact that African black smiths had a cure for small pox way before the europeans.  The Yoruba,Edo, other cultres lived in cities with walled cities,moats and doors with locks. I mean sure they never had a reinassance nor a Scientific age,but they were not savages running around in the jungle with no political organization.
