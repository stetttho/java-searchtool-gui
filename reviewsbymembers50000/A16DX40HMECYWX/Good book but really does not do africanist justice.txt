 I read this book and thought some of the thoughts in it was thought provoking,but at times the book was shallow. I know the racial identification in America among scholars has been very racist in the past. There are people before George james that sugested the egyptains came from sub saharan african,probally somali.Punt,was the name of anicent somali and it is offened refered to as the land of the ancestors. I recommed everybody reading this book,please pick up a book by ea wallis budge. I would also like to mention that many greek writers mostly wrote about nubians. One of the greatest heroes in the trojan war was an ethiopian by the name of memnon. Greeks probally was not racist and neither was the egyptains. The egyptains bitterly hated the asiatics hitties and nubians. nARMER THE ONE WHO FOUNDED THE PRE DYNASTIC ERA CAME FROM THE SOUTH. I have been to egypt and seen many shades of colors there. If you go to the villages around abydos you will see darker people than in the northern area. I am proud of my lineage to,and i happen to be a white man. You also check out richard poe's book. THe other crucial point is there is pyramids in greece,and even pyramids in rome. The people of the ancient world if they was around today would be ashamed on how they are deplicted.                                                                             Located in today's southern Egypt and northern Sudan was most probably the oldest cultural complex in Africa. Known as Nubia, "The Land of Gold," to Egypt, the people of this land first called their civilization Ta-Seti, "Land of the Bow." Named so for its famous archers, Ta-Seti was a land of natural wealth, of gold mines, ebony, ivory and incense which she traded heavily with her neighbors.

REEVALUTATING KUSH Nubia is probably one of the most underreported cultural complexes of antiquity. In the ongoing attempt to minimize the African involvement in such regions, even the inhabitants of Nubia sometimes fall prey to the Mediterranen Race Myth. (See Egypt page for more on Hamitic Hypothesis). When this is not the case, Nubia is minimized within the Nile Valley as a purely Egyptian cultural invention. This has been the case so much so that some researchers have come to call Nubia, "the other Nile Valley kingdom." Often the myth portrays Egyptians as "superior whites" ruling over the more "primitive Blacks" to the south. In reality however, while Nubia and Egypt did war with each other, there were more years of peace than battle. These conflicts were usually territorial or economic and never racially motivated as certain Egyptians and Nubians obviously shared similar physical features. The victors were more often the larger kingdom of the Egyptians but sometimes the Nubians as well. A closer look at Nubia reveals startling information. Below are some revelations which have come from reevaluating Kush.   Egypt's Dynastic rulership may have originated in Ta-Seti, thus signaling the first such form of government known to mankind.  The idea of a pharaoh (king) may have come down the Nile from Nubia to Egypt (and) that would make Nubian civilization the ancestor of Egypt's...  Dr. Bruce Williams, Archaeologist  Egypt referred to its southern regions as Upper Egypt denoting its affinity with Kush. The Southern Kingdom, Upper Egypt, was clearly conceived as the dominant of the two regions. It was from the south that the most enduring influences in Egyptian society came and without doubt most of its greatest leaders were southerners too. Through her long history Egypt constantly needed to return to the south to refresh herself and to restore her institutions, even perhaps her soul, when the weight of years or of external pressures laid too heavily upon her.  Micheal Rice, Historian  Egypt was believed to have been a colony of Kush in antiquity.  They (the Ethiopians) say also that the Egyptians are colonists sent out by the Ethiopians, Osiris having been the leader of the colony... And the larger part of the customs of the Egyptians are, they hold, Ethiopian...
