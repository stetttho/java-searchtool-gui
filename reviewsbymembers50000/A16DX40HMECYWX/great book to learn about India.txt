 I found this book very fasinating. The book documents India from the earliest times,untill the later time around british occupation. The most fasinating aspect of this book is it exposes the African pressence in Ancient India. The book documents that the Ancient Harappa Valley civilzation was started by AFRICAN PEOPLE WHICH WE KNOIW TODAY AS DRAVIDIANS.
