 i am really disapointed in one of my favoriet groups from the south the  only truth and reality that black folks had in the sence of our sneeky and  shady goverment i felt the first two albums exposed the ills and blues of  ghetto life but it seems to me like some foul play had come out about i  think that song cell theray and many others was to real for the goverment  to handle because it put ameikkka's worst nightmare up on game what goes on  behind close doors and was refreshing to all the comercial and abuse of the  black man in sterotypical context it shows how with a little money uncle  sam can even courrupt any one i just hope that the fedz don't get to dead  prez
