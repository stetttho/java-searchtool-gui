 The story goes back to a time in history when Ethiopia was a great trading civilzation. The kingdom of Ethiopia of course being tied betweeen the Sabeans and Abyssinians. The story of Saba was greatly absorbed into the lore of the ethiopian people. The Abyssinians adapted christainty under the king Ezra and wrote many sacred book in the native language of Ge'ez. The story encompaes a Queen by the name of Makeda that would give birth to a mighty son named Ras Memelik. Memelik would then lead nations under the Solmanic dynasty that would be ruled in Ethiopia,and giving way to Aksum. I recommend anyone that want to learn about the mystical and magical place known as Ethiopia. The book will take you into the root of Ethiopic soul. I wouldn't Recommend Budge, but the other two versions of this are filled with biased or rastafarinism. If you can get another book by Budge called The Ethiopian book of the dead aka the Bandlement of rightenous. Overall Budge's translation is not all that bad,but sometimes he is not liked because he is one of the White Egyptaintologist who sugested that Egypt had an African origin.
