 aiight i been down with suave house since coming out hard and i loved eightball becuase they was a perfect balance of pimp lyrics and consious ouytlooks on life inb this album they just resort ot commerical means to attract mass apeal i hate to say but i really expected some better ish than this eightball has lost his edge and spits mindless chourus and hooks also this album misses the nice jazzy beats displayed by t mix which beside organized noise is probally the best beat maker down south  a weak lp to gain mass appeal that will fail but at the same time repel all the once loyal eightball and mjg fans  i suggest if you a real eightball and mjg fan go cop the albums before this in our life time is very good album that was slept on peace
