 I am very disapointed with the book and the hidden message in the book. I will admit that Africans have many problems and many things they must work out. Black people all across africa have rich cultres and plenty of history to them,but it seems the only thing Europeans want to do is build safari trips and exploit the land ofr all the natural resources. I noticed that he seemed to linger in places that are hot spots and focused upon making african women look very cheap. What he fails to mention is that cecil Rhodes,King leopold,rothchilds and many others have abused Africa and Africans very badly. King Leopold and the Belgium govement killed over 5 million people,not to mention the ethnic conflicts with the tutsi and hutu was brought on by Belgium by convincing the tutsi they were hamitic aka dark white people. The problems of Africa cannot be blamed on all europens,but we must not forget how europeans have looted and robbed just about every cultural site in africa. Europe seem to love preaching the myth of primitive culurless africa with no history. If you don't believe africa does not have culture south of the sahra maybe you should spend some of your time reading basil davidson a white man who wrote over 30 books about african empires like Mali songhy ghana benin edo and the yoruba.
