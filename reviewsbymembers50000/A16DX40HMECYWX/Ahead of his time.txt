 JA Rodgers was ahead of his time when it came to historical reserch. He exposed alot of things that even in our xenophobic world we are afriad to talk about. He discovered through his reserch many of the great people of the past was infact blacks,and that they had been covered up by white wash over centuries. People should read these books with an open mind,because it explains alot in our soceity that are very race conscious people. I learned about Al Jahiz though him and he taught me about many great people I had never even heard of. I never knew about lokman the southern Arabian sage that was considered one of the wisest men. I never knew about the black vikings in this book called blaumen. The book also discussed how many people of the royal family have indeed black ancestry and how they have tried to hide these facts. Get this book to expose the truth and check out other JA Rodgers books.
