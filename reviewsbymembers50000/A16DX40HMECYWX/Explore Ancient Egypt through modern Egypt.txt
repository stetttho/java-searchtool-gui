 I happen to stumble upon this bopok through all my reserch of Ancient kmt.  The book explores rual Egyptian life and writes from a perpective of a Egyptian chjild named Shahhat.   One interfesting this is that many people are often unaware that Rual Egyptians still hold on to their ancient heritage,unlike the city dwellers who live in places like Cairo and Alexzandria.   Foreigners never completly penetrated deep into Upper Egypt,and much of the cultural heritage downb to physical phenotype of the original Egyptians is still there.   I like the way the author unfolds and combines the fact that many ancient traditions exist in the life of rual Egyptians which goes back to the time of the Pharoahs,and this can be clearly seen in everything from relgious traditions to funerals.   Many readers often ask where have the Ancient Egyptians gone after all these years,and this book provides the answers and fills in the gaps.   The book is so realistic and potrays saeedi life to an exact.   Definatley one of the best books I have read all year.
