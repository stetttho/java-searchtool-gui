 The book I happen to pick up by chance at a libray,and even through the first pages it shocked me how humanity can go so low to exploit other people.  I am glad the author took the chance to get a book like this published. These types of stories are nothing new for European people. The very time they set foot in the Kongo they knew what they wanted and took advantage of a people that did not have that well of a well devleoped millitary or wepaons. The people of the Congo got called primitive ape like creatures at the expense of a more industrialized Europeans nations. The Romans did the same to the celts,Germanics,and Iberians. I guess it is hard for the Europeans since they were the last people to devleop a civilzation they had to out do the previous Grecoromans civilzation. The African people of the Congo did have kingdoms,or to some cheifdoms. The One tribe called the Bakuba as pointed out by the author had similar desighns in their raffina cloth to the ancient Egyptains. The Luba for some reason also produced stools and head rests similar to the ones found in TutankhAmon's tomb. The natives thought when the portugeese touched down they were their dead ancestors.  King Leopold according to this book seems to be a insecure person,who uses his power and domination for a self esteem boost. The Congo as painted by many people are nothing but a bunch of Bantus wearing lion cloth,but this book also talks about the missionaries that seem to be deicated to one thing and that is rape and pillage. The should be read by everyone that has morals and consideration for humanity. I was real shocked however that people were actually taking babies and killing them. The people seemed to not even care. Also something crucial this points out is the Jewish invovlment in all this. He makes no haste to also indicate the Rothchids had a big role in the colonization of Africa. This book may be hard to read,but it really teaches you about corruption and greed.
