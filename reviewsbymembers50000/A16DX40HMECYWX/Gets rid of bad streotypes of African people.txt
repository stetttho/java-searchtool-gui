 Ivan Van sertima may at time jump overboard,but He is often misunderstood by the people who try to label him a Afronazi. Van Sertima sets straight with actual proof Africans did excel in Science before the conquest of the Europeans. What the Europeans thought of as withdoctors were actually people that had great knowleadge of herbal medicine.  The recent find in South Africa is that African bush willow has been shown to help with the treatment of cancer. What westerners don't tell you that there is plenty of herbs in African that has been dhown to fight such dieases as Aids. The problem is drug companies exploit cheifs and priest for their knowleadge of herbal medicine. The drug companies don't want common people to know about these herbs because it will make them go bankrupt.I recommend anyone reaching and exploring to shatter the myths of primitive Africans to read this book. Another thing this book explores is the evidence they found in kenya of an astronomical observatory. The book does show the lack of study in the scientific nature of indigenous African people. The book does not mention that bantus of Southern Africa have the ability of accupunture,and this ability according to records has been with man since he first evovled.  I wish Sertima would have explored the indigenous calender system. I am glad however that he showed that secret socities in Africa comunicated with symbols andf sighns, and had a form of written language.
