 yo at times li wanye come off straigfht illiterrate and unable to grip the mic when compared to other southern giants as outkast or goodie mob i can't believe people but the same cash money joints over and over again when people such as cash money don't even care or have the talent to write new lyrics to their music i hear the same lines repeated in almost evey one of their cd these cd's are horrible and lack all the things to nmake a good emcee people where i stay love this stuff but i ain't much feeling all this flash but no lyrics it has nothing for me cause i am not a matrelistic cat i just miss the days when people had skills and didn't try to rhyme every thing with simple words like ha and blindg bling cash money is a fad
