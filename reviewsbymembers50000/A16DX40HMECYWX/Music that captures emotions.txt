 I have to say I really enjoy Les Nubians,and their style of singing. The style brings it all the way back to Billie Holiday and the jazz age. The girls also seem to capture the essence of the whole African experiance as well. I noticed that their logo is that of a scarb beeatle,which is a sacred sighn to the Nubians and Ancient Egyptains. The other tracks like makeda tell the story about the black queen of Yemen known as Sheba. The favoriet track of mine is the Princess Nubieans. The vocals on that track is wonderful and also matches the production. The two singers hail from Cameroon and one I think is the result of a interracial couple,not that matters. There is one thing for sure these two women can sing their heart out and produce such a soulful album. The quality matched in this album is quite rare these days. Most singers don't have half the soul these two women have. Hopefully more will learn from them,and stop it already with the cheap bubble gum crap .
