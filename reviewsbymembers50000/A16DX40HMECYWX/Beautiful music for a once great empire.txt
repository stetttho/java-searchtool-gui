 Malian music is some of the best music you will run across in Africa. The enchanting sounds of the kora takes you back to the once great empire of Mali. The empire beside egypt was one of the richest empires in Africa. Jelis or griots as the western world knows them still tell the tales of the great sunjata to mansa musa. The cd ecompasses on a mgacial journey and on empires that once were and still live in the imnds and hearts of the fabric of time. I recommend anybody interested into learning about Mali and the mende people pick up this cd.
