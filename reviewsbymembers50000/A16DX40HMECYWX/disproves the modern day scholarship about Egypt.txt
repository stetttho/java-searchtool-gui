 The book documents the salvage project that was taken by Professor Bruce Willams at the Chicago Oreinetal insitute of many nubian cultural sites in Northern Sudan and southern Egypt. Mr. Willams made quite a shocking discovery at Qustal,he found an insence burner that show the earilest representation of a per aa or a pharoah. The western academic were unware of this finding. A lot of people don't know about these findings excpet the archeologist and egyptaintologist themselves. The book puts to rest myths about the white egyptains. I suggest all fans of Mary Leftowitz pick up this,because it is a real work of scholarship by a white man.
