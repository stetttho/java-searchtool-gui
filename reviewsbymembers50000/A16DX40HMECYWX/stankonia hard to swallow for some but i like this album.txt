 yo this album is one of the best of the year and outkast always lives up to their imgage and have alwayus empressed me i didnt like this album at first but later as i listened to it i started to really liked it this album is not for the typical hip hop fan and probally sounds more like p funk and prince than really hip hop  nice album for a decaying art form
