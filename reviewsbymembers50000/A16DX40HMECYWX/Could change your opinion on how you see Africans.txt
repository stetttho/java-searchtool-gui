 The big argument in the biased academic community is about the Olmec enigma. People were shocked when they found heads in Central America that did not look like aztecs or Mayans,but pre dates their civilzation by many years. The head they found seem to resemble a African. People have seemed to critize people like Van sertima,but never seem to do any reserch about Africans themselves. Western academia knows that Columbus was not the first to America,but we keep getting feed the same dogmatic material. It seems in the academic world we are back to the world is flat argument when it comes to history. The academic just don't see any plausibility in Africans reaching America before the Europeans,even though Thor Heydral has made it clear with his experiments of Tirgris,Ra,and Konticki it does not take alot to sail to the new worlrd.    The king of a African empire called Mali was Abubakari,which was brothers to Mansa Musa. MUsa told a scholar in Cario about the plan of his brother to sail betond the Atlantic. Musa had enough skill and money to complete this mission. The question is however how far did Abu bakari make it to sea. People around Mopti Mali still construct vessels worthy of sea travel. They build and use these boats to transport salt up and down the Nigera river. The other thing which makes this possible in Brazil they have found markings which are very similar to the Made langue of Vai. The other clue that leads people to believe this is the winds which are around the Atlantic seem to lead right to Brazil.  Accounts by Cristobal Columbo himself seem to describe a black race of people described to have traded with the Taino Natives of Hispanola as it was named by the spainish invading forces. Devaca also desrcibes maninka living around Texas area.   In the recent conquistidors this is explored by the narrator. He also read quotes from the conquestidors themselves.  So Abubakar equipped 200 ships filled with men and the same number equipped with gold, water, and provisions, enough to last them for years�they departed and a long time passed before anyone came back. Then one ship returned and we asked the captain what news they brought.  He said, 'Yes, Oh Sultan, we travelled for a long time until there appeared in the open sea a river with a powerful current�the other ships went on ahead, but when they reached that place, they did not return and no more was seen of them�As for me, I went about at once and did not enter the river.'  The Sultan got ready 2,000 ships, 1,000 for himself and the men whom he took with him, and 1,000 for water and provisions. He left me to deputise for him and embarked on the Atlantic Ocean with his men. That was the last we saw of him and all those who were with him.  And so, I became king in my own right." Mansa Musa, talking to Syrian scholar Al-Umari. I also recommend checking out the PBS documentary THe conquestidors,because it clarifies quite a bit also.  In Brazil there exist a species of plantins called Musa X. What is the only explanatory reason that has the name it does. You makie the judgement,but I am convinced. Not bad for a skeptic of Afrocentrism
