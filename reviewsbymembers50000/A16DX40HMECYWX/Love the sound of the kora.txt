 I have to say there is something that is enchanting about kora music. Kora is one of the few instruments that made it over to America from African slaves. The kora has even a deeper history than that. Kora is often played by jalisor griots,which are the offical historian of the tribe. Every time I hear the sound of the kora I am reminded of a culture that was thrived and was dominant around the 13th centery. Kora is forever etched in the history of Western Africa. The modern day kora is probally know as the banjo.
