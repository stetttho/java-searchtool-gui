 I read this book and I was shocked how the author let his racial bias get in the way of academic work.  I praise the book for providing some great information on Pharaonic survials in Ancient Egypt,but the racism really got to me around the first chapter.   The author however makes the mistake of assuimng that Dark skinned black Egyptians in Upper egypt,aslo refered to saeedi are desedants of slaves.  This is entirely not true,because African slaves from the interior of Africa were never brought to Upper Egypt.   The dark skinned Egyptians in Upper Egypt are indigenous and been dark brown for since pre dyanstic times.      Besides this fatal flaw that the author makes,the book is packed with lots of informative information.    The author dedicates and entire chapter using Egyptian texts,archeology,anmd anthropology detail that clearly shows that Ancient Egypt is alive and well,anmd has never went away.   I would recommend this to anybody who is deeply interested in teh study of Ancient Egypt as I am myself.
