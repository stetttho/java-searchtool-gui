 this cd was tight when it first came out mr mike to me is one of the  tighest from the south and if you a fan of the suave house pick this cd up  it is worth your money mr mike takes typical gangsta clickes and makes them  interesting and good production by tmix i don't recommend mr mikes lyrics  cause this ain't true hip hop but it is nice rap listen to it and give mr  mike a chance
