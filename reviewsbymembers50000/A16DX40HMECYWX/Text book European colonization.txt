 The book is hearld by many people as being a great work ,and it is in it's own right. I read this book and it has many qualities that european males find model behavior. The book is a great model for such people as King Leopold to just murder and kill over Five million Congolese with no remorse. The ideal thinking since these people throw spears.live in mud huts and have never achieved the things we have they don't deserve to breathe and walk the earth. The people have no emotions or state of awareness. The Europeans didn't realize that these people in the furture might have something to offer. This book in my opinion is a disguise for profaganda colonization and a justification. The very inaccurate thing in this book is the description of cannibalism which has never been proven other than overzealous missionary accounts to exist in Zaire. The book reminds of every thing the Europeans value,and that is murder,destruction,and dominance over other people. The real twist to this story is that the Belgium KIng Leopold was the real savage. He had African skulls laying around his castle as if it was a real big trophy and had regular incidents or murder fests where he would go into villages and kill helpless Bantus. The europeans have never cared about African people or their side of their story,they just put out novels and disguise them as classics to brainwash the general public. I recommend if you read this book,to take the time and read King Leopold's Ghost. You wil disocver the truth behind this novel and it's motive.
