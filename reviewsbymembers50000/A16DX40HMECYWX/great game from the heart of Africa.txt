 I think most peole who play this don't realize where it's origins are. The game of mancala is one of the oldest game board known in existence.  The game was said to come from ancient Egypt and latter past down to other parts of Africa from there to Asia. The game exists in many other variations throughout the continent of Africa.  I would recommend this to any parent who wants to teach their kid mathematics at a young age. The game can also be played by adults.
