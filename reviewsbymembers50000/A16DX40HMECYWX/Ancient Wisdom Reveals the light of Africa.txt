 Many people are unaware of the magic of the Orishas. The   Europeansthat first encounterd this form of divination called it witch craft and mislabeled the greatness of it. In A dogmatic christainsoceity of today it seems more and more people are going back to pagan roots. Yoruba is a very old relgion in Africa, and possibly it does have connections to that of ancient kemetaka Egypt. I myself being a white person so enchanted by the nature of African spirtuality probally cannot turly understand the Orisha or how deep it goes for a person of African ancestry.  I do not practice this form of whorship,but I love the concepts of the relgion. The book is the Vedas,Bible,Ouran, Bhavagad Gita to those individuals that are dedicated to the divination of Ifa.     If you want to see the wisdom of an ancient people and relgion shine through please pick up this book.
