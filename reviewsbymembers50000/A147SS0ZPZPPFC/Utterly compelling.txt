 I first saw this book on an artist friend's coffee table in Santa Fe. I know they say don't judge a book by its cover, but that's exactly what compelled me to pick it up & upon opening it, gasp at the wonder of being introduced to the work of this incredible photographer - though to say he is simply a photographer does not begin to do justice! I'll admit I'm the first to spend all the grocery money on books, but this book, though dear, is printed to the highest standard of quality & not sparse in any way, so to me, well worth saving for & splurging on.
