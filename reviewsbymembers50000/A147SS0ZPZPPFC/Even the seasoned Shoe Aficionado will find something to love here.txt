 Hafta say, I am not at all a beginner in this type of journaling, but I STILL find this book a perfectly swell addition to my library.  Even for those of us lacking fear, what a pleasure to sit down with a new book in a fun & funky format; of course, darling, it IS visually appealing.  The paper on which it's PRINTED has a nice feel!  The book is written in an encouragingly upbeat - yes, FUNNY - style, with excellent advice for all comers and interesting, cool & graphic examples illustrate every page. When you finish this book, if you still aren't all about the journal keeping, at least make yourself a pair of Traveling Shoes.  Linda, Karen?  Thanks for some ideas I definitely plan to try.
