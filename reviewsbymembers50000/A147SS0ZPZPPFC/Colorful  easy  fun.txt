 Abode a la Mode hadn't been on my wish list for long when it disappeared! To my great surprise & delight, a dear friend had it sent to me.  She'll be visiting me next week - she's from France - and I can't wait to show her! Filled with easy to re-create OR expand upon ideas, the book covers almost everything, from wall art & accessories to furniture & floors! Instructions are concise, with inclusive lists of materials & tools.  Photos & diagrams are clear & easy to understand.   This book is perfect for getting a jump start on design & decorating with economy, fun AND taste, and proves they needn't be at all mutually exclusive.
