 From the clever concept of pinking shearing the edges of the pages of your scrapbook, altered book, handmade book (and THIS book is the perfect example of a commercially published, pinking shear-edged volume) to an amazing tour de force of a traveling journal kit created by Ann Mabee and shown on pages 52-53, this is a can't-go-wrong book you must include in your own library if you have any inkling that you may now, or at any time in the future, wish to incorporate fabric and all its accoutrements into your scrapbooking bag of tricks.
