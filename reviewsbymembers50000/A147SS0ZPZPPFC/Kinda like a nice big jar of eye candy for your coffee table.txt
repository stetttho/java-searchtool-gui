 Don't have a subscription to the magazine, but bet I'd like it!  Also, I don't mind when magazines publish "best of" compilations of articles to a specific theme - it saves me having to go hunt down those particular issues, which I may not have saved anyway!! The photos in here are fabulous for examining in detail.  Definitely a swell idea book.  I found the prices quoted to run the gamut from REALLY low, to what I personally might consider moderately high, but I am more of an "idea gleaner" type girl than an "I want to copy this entire room down to the very tschotkes on the tschelves and not pay a penny more" type girl.  And there are so many cool ideas between the pages of Home Cheap Home you'll be inspired and doing the interior design thing yourself as quickly as you can utter the words "Oh yay! Pop Art's still alive"!
