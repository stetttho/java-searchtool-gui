 Wow!  My mum - so NOT a party lover - gave me this swell book, as she knows I LOVE a great party and love coming up with unique invites of my own. I don't know where she came across it - probably at her local library, but I'm really happy that she did, & that she thought of me! I disagree with the reviewer who stated something to the effect that only with a team of fab designers could anyone make these invites.  Marc Friedland presents them, not to be copied exactly, but as jumping off, inspirational material from which to glean ideas. The presentation is gorgeous, with fabulous, clear photographs.  *Invitations* could not be more packed with info on where to get supplies, how to choose looks, etc. No, it's not a step-by-step how-to volume.  But for those of us who want to make what we create truly our own, it couldn't be better.
