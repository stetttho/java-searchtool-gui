 Traditionally, quilt making truly IS a form of fabric collage.   How cool, to see the directions in which narrative quilting is moving!  It's expertly shown to those of us lucky enough to run across this swell volume by Ms. Riley.  And we realize from the eye candy, ideas, inspiration & techniques illustrated in this charming (& nicely made!) book, that it's not the size of a project that guarantees its impact.  I especially love the "Gallery of Quilted Memories" beginning on page 110.  Each example is a small treasure of the four elements I listed above & something to which I will continually return.
