 Erikia has done it again!  Another book with ideas & how-tos which will get those creative wheels turning for scrapbookers & altered artists alike.  This volume contains arted up tags to any taste, from simple + elegant to fun + funky, from shabbily chic to totally country. Some of my fave pages include the ones showcasing glass, mica & polymer tags. Wait til you see what can be done with modern ephemera & photo negative tags!  Each category - and there are 39 in total - includes the basic idea with variations, a step-by-step how-to photo sidebar, a full page spread & additional samples showing some of those oh-so-clever variations on the theme. In short, this volume will make an excellent addition to any scrapbooker, paper or mixed media artist's library.
