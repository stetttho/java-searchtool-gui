 As a kid growing up in the 1960s & '70s, I LOVED the yummy Yardley of London products & thought Jean Shrimpton, the beautiful young British woman who modeled them, the epitome of hip glam. How fabulous to read her autobiography years later, and discover someone who, beneath the makeup & groovy clothing, could easily be a good friend. She tells her story in a forthright manner; it makes for an entertaining snapshot of the times & the places, but is more engaging for her down to earth assessment of what is really valuable in a life; what really counts for the most in the end.  And she, like me, has definitely come to the conclusion that fame isn't all it's cracked up to be.
