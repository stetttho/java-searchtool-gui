 - just long enough to be able to buy this book!  Even if it weren't jam packed, fuller than a sardine can, with fun & useful anecdotes, how-tos, ideas and projects, and with great detailed diagrams and instructions, it includes a mini course in art history, and is excellent reading material at the breakfast table or in the bathroom, even on a cross-country road trip.  No kidding!
