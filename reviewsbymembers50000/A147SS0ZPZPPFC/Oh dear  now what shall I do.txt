 Although there were bits & pieces of this excellently entertaining novel about which one could possibly say, "Well, that was kinda predictable",  there were many more bits with neatly surprising twists.  *Restoration* is cleverly written,  as if the author respects his potential readers.  New Orleans lends a swell backdrop.  I intended to save this book for an upcoming trip, but was going to let myself just read the first few paragraphs, for a little preview.  One thing led to another & now I've finished it & what can I take to read?  Maybe I'll just take Restoration anyway, & try to pretend like it's my first time!
