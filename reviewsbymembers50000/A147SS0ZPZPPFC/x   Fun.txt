 You know what I love the most about this book? The large format photos of the art, standing alone on every page - you really can delve into the intricacies and details of each and every piece shown. The "Telling Detail" sidebars are fabulous - they add further layers of exploration to the text and photos.  If you think you liked picture books before now, you will surely see the ante upped remarkably by Alphabetica!
