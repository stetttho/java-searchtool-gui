 This is a veritable encyclopedia of fun ideas to get anyone started or encourage their continuing on the path of "art" journaling.   Techniques are shown which can easily be made one's own, and which can provide many hours of art-making pleasure, or be whipped out in a few spare minutes between appointments & phone conferences.  I LOVE that.
