 If you're a scrapbooker looking for new ideas & inspiration, then baby, have  you picked the right book!  If you're a collage artist & think you have nothing to learn from a book marketed to scrapbookers, think again!  Erikia & Pamela have put together a treasure trove of fresh & fun techniques to keep both groups happily experimenting, thinking out of the box, & of course, creating their own fabulous pages & more, for scrapbooks, journals & framed art. From novel approaches to altering photos & making one's own background paper, to using scratchboard & etching glass - it's all here.  These girls are as handy at wielding a metal hammer as they are at showing us how cut our own stencils or print a cyanotype! And by the way, I am just wild about that funky retro '70s clock on page 35 - can't wait to make my own!
