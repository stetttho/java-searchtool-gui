 Altered Art showcases some of the most fun altered art out there today. This field is expanding exponentially - it seems so accessible - and offers a relief from the generally serious world we live in. Not that altered art can't (and doesn't) have a serious side all its own.  As illustration, compare the Nori Dress by Dee Fontans on page 140 with I'll Fly Away on page 128 by Betsy Reeves.  They each speak to the same theme in two entirely different languages. Terry Taylor has assembled an incredible array of talented artists, doing what they do best, altering the bits of our wonderful, wacky, crazy and sometimes sad world into a storytelling vision of art that transcends time.
