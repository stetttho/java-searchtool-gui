 The section on the use of digital artistry in altering alone is worth the small price of this incredible book.  It is such a pleasure to see a sophisticated presentation of some of the fabulous art being created by a current group of book artists. Excellent, simple photographs of innovative book art abound. I applaud Harrison and Grasdal for this excellent and lovely book, chockful of intriguing ideas for interpretation by all artists of vision.
