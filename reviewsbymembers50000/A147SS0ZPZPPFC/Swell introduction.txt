 Although I note some of the other reviews of this book are  not too favorable, for me it's a very cool introduction to an artist of whom I had never heard.  I received it for a gift from a good friend who knows that as an artist, color is "my thing".  To learn of this woman, who worked color to its absolute max during the years I was growing up, is thrilling.  If nothing else, it has inspired me to seek out more of her work & what can be bad about that?  If a book doesn't serve the reader/observer by piquing one's further interest, then and only then has it failed.
