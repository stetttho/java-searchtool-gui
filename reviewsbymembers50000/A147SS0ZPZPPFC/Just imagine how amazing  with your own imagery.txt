 I *TOTALLY* disagree with the reviewer who complained that this book doesn't tell you "how to do it".   While there may not be an exact, step-by-step list & diagram for someone to copy & thus exactly replicate each of the pieces shown (which, anyway, why would one want to, as most of the art is done using highly personal iconography for each artist?), I fail to see how one can help but learn "how to do it" from the extensive discussion of techniques at the beginning of the book, not to mention the detailed commentary & artist's tips accompanying all of the art shown in the Project Gallery.   And if that's not enough, the contributing artists all supplied contact info, so if one is still at a loss, well, the artists are generously offering a way to get ahold of them for further clarification!
