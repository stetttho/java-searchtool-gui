 this book remains one of my all time favorite novels.   It has held up on train trips, bus rides, even reading aloud to my husband on a road trip (which by the way, I love to take and he's not so fond of) thus keeping him entertained & happy. I don't remember how or where I first found it, & have now gone through several copies, but it was a lovely introduction to the extensive writings of Alice Hoffman, with whom I am sure, were we to actually meet, I would be fast friends!
