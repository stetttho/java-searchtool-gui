 The elegant presentation and richly detailed photographs of "Collage for the Soul" lend it the air of an artful treasure. Its squarish format is pleasingly different, the colors rich, the layout clean, and the instructions for creating similar projects are easy to follow.  For the purposes of this book, the definition of collage has been expanded to include techniques in assemblage and mixed-media, especially valuable to aspiring and practicing artists in these days when recycling has come into its own! I adore being introduced to the work of artists with whom I am unfamiliar, like Candace Walters, whose piece "Memory of Home from an Island" is striking! She juxtaposes images of animals that look like illustrations from a children's book, with the meticulously painted face of her daughter, then repeats those same animals painted in tiny versions on her daughter's collar. The piece is filled with symbolism, some of which is explained in the written details and some of which is left to one's own interpretation. The book is chock-full of such pieces, with photographs that easily allow for detailed examination. As an artist, I was particularly intrigued by the in-depth explorations of the creative process. Harrison and Grasdal have put together the perfect book for an artist's library - one that combines practical techniques, inspiration and beautiful graphics. Whether you are looking for an excellent addition to your own reference bookshelf or coffeetable collection, or in need of a gift, I unabashedly recommend this gorgeous book for anyone who loves unique, colorful, thought-provoking art, as well as for those who simply appreciate collage in its myriad forms.
