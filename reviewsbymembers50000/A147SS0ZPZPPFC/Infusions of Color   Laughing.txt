 Art de la Soul is swell.  I LOVED it.  The projects are funky, instructions easy to follow, necessary "ingredients" easy to find.   The narrative, interspersed with the how-tos, is dryly hilarious.  She confesses to so many wacky moments of inspiration gone awry that I know we must be soul sisters.  Thanks Kathy, I actually HAD seriously been considering spray painting my shoes. The illustrations by Kathy's husband are a fun addition.
