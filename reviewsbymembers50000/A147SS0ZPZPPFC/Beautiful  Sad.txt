 Reminiscent of Dan Eldon, Offscreen is an incredibly moving glimpse into the everyday lives of everyday residents of Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Oman, Syria, Turkey & more. The artists are collagers, painters, photographers, videographers, writers. The book is compiled from art/journal pages made over a year spent in the Middle East. It reveals more than we see in the relatively few & far between snapshots we receive from mainstream media. After giving away several copies of Offscreen, I have finally gotten a copy which I'm determined to keep!
