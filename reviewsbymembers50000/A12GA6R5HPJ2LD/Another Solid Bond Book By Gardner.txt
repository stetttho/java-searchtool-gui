 As John Gardner's third Bond novel, Icebreaker shows an increasing understanding of the character.  The novel shows a good deal of creativity as far as situations and the Neo-Nazi villains are concerned, and keeps the reader guessing as to who on Bond's team are actually on his side, especially as the book progresses.  All in all, a nice adventure for Bond, and a nice time for any Bond fan.
