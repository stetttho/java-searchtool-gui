 On the aptly named 1972, Josh Rouse creates an interesting tapestry of songs and sounds that set him apart from many of the singer-songwriters working today.  As indicated by the album's title, 1972 in many places sounds like it could actually have been recorded thirty years ago.  "Love Vibration", which would not have been out of place in the heyday of AM radio, bobs like a lost Brady Bunch hit.  "Comeback (Light Therapy)" features a throbbing bass line straight out of countless disco records.  "James" features some killer jazz flute. Rouse and producer Brad Jones do well production-wise with the seventies sound, as all the songs have distinct and different textures that suit Rouse's subdued, hushed vocals.  Rouse also does well by not relying on the seventies motif as a gimmick; the songs here are strong, and would have been solid even if they had not had flutes, vibraphones, or other trappings of the era.  The only real misstep is the overly silly "Slaveship", which feels a little raw in the midst of the other, more well-produced songs. 1972 is an album that recalls another era without being ironic or kitschy.  Josh Rouse's songwriting and the strong production values combine to make something which sounds unique, creative, and memorable.
