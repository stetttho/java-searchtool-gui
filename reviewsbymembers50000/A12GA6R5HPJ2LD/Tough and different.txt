 Timothy Dalton's second and last turn as 007, Licence to Kill is a clean and total break with everything Bond has done before, including the similarly rule-breaking On Her Majesty's Secret Service.  In this movie, Bond resigns as a 00 agent and goes after a drug lord who has harmed Felix Leiter and his wife.  The movie is hard-edged and often uncomfortable to watch, but it's exciting, and fun to watch Bond give people their comeuppance.  Dalton's tough-edged take on Bond is perfectly appropriate for a movie like this. The Good: Robert Davi makes an appropriately sleazy villain; any movie with Wayne Newton as a pseudo-New Age-televangelist can't be all bad; an action scene with trucks near the end is extremely well-done; Q is spotlighted in a much larger role; and the change of pace keeps the viewer guessing. The Bad: the cast, of mostly TV veterans like Davi and Bond girl Carey Lowell, plus the low budget, give the whole thing a slightly B-movie feel; the Mexico set design and the music by action vet Michael Kamen both give the movie also a generic 80s action feel. Uncomfortable and tough, but undeniably fun and exciting, Licence to Kill is a standout in the series and a great exit for Dalton.
