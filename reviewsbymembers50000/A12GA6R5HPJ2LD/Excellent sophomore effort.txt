 David Mead works in a style of music that, in years gone by, might have been topping the charts.  Catchy melodies, strong production,  and a beautiful voice should all be a recipe for success, but in this day and age of fragmented listening tastes and corporate radio playlists, Mead has not found a wide audience for his craft.  And that's a shame, because "Mine and Yours" (like his debut album, "The Luxury of Time") is a very strong set of well-crafted pop/rock that would surprise a lot of people who think that music for adults has to be glossy or brainless.   On his debut, "Luxury of Time", Mead seemed to want to touch every stylistic base, succeeding at most of the music styles he tried his hand at.  "Mine and Yours" is not as eclectic - on this album, he seems more content to remain in a melodic, mostly down-tempo style.  It may not have all the high points that "Luxury" had, but it results in a more cohesive listening experience.  Mead is more confident in his writing and singing abilities here, contributing gems like the pretty "All I Want to Do", the bouncy "Girl on the Roof", and the strong title track.     Likable, enjoyable, and definitely worth your time.  If you enjoy pop music in the vein of the Beatles or Paul McCartney, then David Mead will be a most pleasant discovery.
