 The first posthumous release after Buckley's untimely drowning death, "Sketches. . ." is an an in-progress document of the album he was working on at the time of his death.  It's a two-disc collection, with the first disc comprising what the final album might have been like, and the second with alternate mixes, demoes, and the like.  Listening to the first disc, it doens't sound like a work in progress. . .the songs actually sound pretty well complete, although two or three more songs would have made the album itself seem more complete.  "Sketches" is a dark pop record that showcases Jeff Buckley's gifted songwriting and absolutely beautiful voice.  The best songs on the album are the opener, the raucous "The Sky is a Landfill"; the sexy "Everybody Here Wants You", which features a vocal more soulful than most of what's out there today, black or white; and "Vancouver", a chiming rocker.   If there are any major problems with the album, it's mainly that the second disc is not a very satisfying listening experience for the casual fan.  The alternate mixes of songs already heard don't add much, and the demos are very, very rough.  That being said, the casual fan is probably not the reason the disc was added, and so for them it just has to serve a historical purpose.  All in all, a good set for the price.
