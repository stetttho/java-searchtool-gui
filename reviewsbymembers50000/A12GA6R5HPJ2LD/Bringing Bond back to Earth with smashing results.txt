 After James Bond went into outer space in his last adventure, Moonraker, where could he go next?  Would you believe. . .MARS?!!  Well, I wouldn't.  Actually, in what could be termed the wisest decision the producers made since not letting an American play Bond in Diamonds are Forever (actually almost happened), a decision was made to totally strip the character of his gadgets, his larger-than-life villains, and his having to save the entire planet every movie (which he had to do in the last couple movies).  Rather, Bond is sent to find and retrieve a small computer that can send instructions to the British nuclear sub fleet, before the Russians get it.  So, yes, I guess, he is saving the world, if you want to get technical about it. The whole movie has a stripped-down feel, and some great stunt sections - a car chase through the Greek countryside in a little European car, the best ski chase scene in the entire series (and maybe ever), and a literally nail biting mountain climbing scene.  Plus, we see a Bond who must survive on his wits, not on something the Q branch whipped up for him.  Also, as a reader of the books, it's nice to see a good portion of the plots from those used here, not just a title. It all works remarkably well; Moore is in fine form, one movie before he officially reached "too old" status, and the whole movie has style and local color to spare.  One of Moore's best (in a dead heat with The Spy Who Loved Me), and a highlight for the series.
