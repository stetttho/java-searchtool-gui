 "For Special Services", John Gardner's second James Bond novel, improves on the first as he builds a tale of mystery and almost constant suspense. This time, Bond is teamed with Felix Leiter's daughter Cedar to find out more about the return of SPECTRE. More fleshed-out villains, a great Bond girl (who Bond can't go after due to her father), and exciting, suspenseful writing make one realize how underrated Gardner's books are. One of his best.
