 Another victim of the ridiculous American label pratice of releasing some overseas albums up to a year after they've come out (Supergrass fans, you feel my pain), One All is Neil Finn's second solo album and the best thing he has done since Crowded House split.  He doesn't seem burdened by expectations, as he did on his solo debut, 'Try Whistling This'.  Rather, he seems to accept and embrace his ability to create an unpolished pop masterpiece.  The whole album has a loose, yet carefully crafted and jubilant feel.  Rather than bow to trends as he earlier did, or trying to make difficult pop, Finn concentrates on crafting a strong set of songs that offer hints of the textured sounds of the debut but don't get overwhelmed by those same sounds. There are a number of highlights here: the gentle opener, "The Climber"; the pounding "Driving Me Mad", with background vocals by Sheryl Crow; the 6/8 ballad "Last to Know"; the bouncy "Anytime".   Any fan of Crowded House will find Neil Finn at his warmest since the album Woodface, and living up to all the potential he showed in Crowded House.  This is the kind of solo album people expected McCartney to release when the Beatles split.
