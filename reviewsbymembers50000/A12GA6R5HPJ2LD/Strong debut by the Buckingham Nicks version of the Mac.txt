 The debut album by the Buckingham/Nicks version of Fleetwood Mac is neither as cohesive or compelling as their follow-up "Rumours" was, but it is still a fine album that stands nicely alongside "Rumours" as a great example of Fleetwood Mac's effortless pop skills.   There are a number of well-known songs here, the most notable being "Landslide" and "Rhiannon", both written by Stevie Nicks.  "Over My Head" and "Say You Love Me", both written by Christine McVie, are also quite well-known.  Although he is not known for any of the hits off of the album, Lindsey Buckingham holds his own here by contributing the great upbeat opener "Monday Morning" and co-writing the funky "World Turning" with Christine McVie, among other songs.     Although the songs are not quite at the "Rumours"-level, the "Fleetwood Mac" album is almost as enjoyable and maybe more so do to the fact that not all of the songs have been played as frequently on the radio.  You can see the elements beginning to gel here that would make "Rumours" the compelling blockbuster that it was.     A good starting place for checking out this era of Fleetwood Mac.
