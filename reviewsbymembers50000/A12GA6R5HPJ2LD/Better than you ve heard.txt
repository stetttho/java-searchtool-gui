 "Star Trek: Generations", featuring members of the original crew and the entire Next Generation cast, acts as a bridge of sorts between the Classic Star Trek cast and the Next Generation.  Those expecting a non-stop shoot 'em up are advised to pass this one and go straight to "Star Trek: First Contact".  What viewers will find, however, is a somewhat dark, cerebral Star Trek take on aging, death, friendship, and emotion.  These elements result in a movie that feels nothing like any of the others in the series, featuring strong performances by the entire cast, Patrick Stewart in particular.  The Kirk/Picard scenes are wonderful for highlighting the contrast between Kirk's "shoot first" attitude and Picard's "let's negotiate" approach. Ultimately, though, the movie does contain plenty of excitement and a strong story that leaves the viewer thinking.  I would recommend it first to fans of Star Trek and Next Generation in particular.  I don't believe it to be the best in the series, but I think it holds its own with those that came before and those that were to follow.
