 James Bond enters the eighties in "License Renewed", John Gardner's first Bond book. Although Gardner's novels have had a fair share of criticism, "License Renewed" is a good read and fairly exciting, as Bond goes up against a madman who also happens to be a nuclear physicist. Although not a perfect book (the requisite Bond girl is a little bland), it is a good one, and a wonderful way to pass the time while waiting for the next James Bond movie to come out.
