 Count me among the 2,000,000 record buyers who became enamored of Mr. Gray and his acoustic/techno whirligig after listening to his last album, "White Ladder".  On his follow-up, a great fact about Gray emerges.  It seems that although he had an unexpected smash with "White Ladder", he doesn't really care.  It's obvious here he's not trying to write a 'Babylon III' (there's already a 'Babylon II'), and in the process, he makes another album which is solid and cohesive as the last.  It's a compliment to these albums that you really don't want to listen to the single tracks - you just like to absorb the whole thing.   While still using a lot of the techno/acoustic hybrid from the last album, Gray embellishes it with a little more hope and optimism - the opening tracks "Dead in the Water" and "Caroline" are rocking and carefree - Gray even lets loose with a "Whoo!" on the second one.  "Be Mine", another standout track, is an unabashed love song. That's not to say that the whole thing is a jolly good time: "The Other Side" is a beautiful piano-driven ballad that closes the album with a hint of darkness, and tracks like "Freedom" and "Last Boat to America" are White Ladder-ish in their bleakness.  If you get into it, the album is a dark trip with occasional glimpses of light.  It's probably not as strong as "White Ladder", but worthy of attention nonetheless.  And who knows, just like time has been kind to that album, it may reveal this one to be even better.
