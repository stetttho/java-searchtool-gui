 The third film in the series and maybe the best.  This is where the series really got locked into the groove- almost everything considered part of the James Bond "formula" started here.  The meeting with Q; the souped-up car; the over-talkative villain; the title song at the beginning with scantily clad women; and the infamous double entendres (Pussy Galore, the "Bond girl").   This movie flows well, has one of those villains that has a real motivation and makes good use of Sean Connery as Bond.  Those that say he was the best (and I am one of those) will give this movie as their chief example.  One of the interesting things about the first few movies as opposed to, say, Diamonds are Forever or You Only Live Twice, is that Bond does some real investigation and uses his wits, rather than just being carried along by the plot.  This Bond shows you why he's one of the top agents in Britain.  He uses his mind - the golf scene alone is one of my favorites in the entire series, as Bond uses his wits to classic ends.
