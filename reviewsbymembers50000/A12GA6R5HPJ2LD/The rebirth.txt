 "Sound of Lies" is the first album by the Jayhawks after Mark Olsen's departure.  As the writer or co-writer and singer of a majority of the band's material, not to mention the fact that one of the Jayhawks' trademarks was the harmonies of singers Gary Louris and Olsen, the new band was going to sound a great deal different.  And indeed it does.  Maybe they should have called themselves "Jayhawks, Mark II". . .and played free jazz (one has to take any opportunity to make a Spinal Tap reference).  The Jayhawks, under the untested direction of Louris, emerge as a more poppy band, but also one that more visibly wears its emotions on its sleeve (and the previous version of the band was no slouch at that, either). The album starts off with a set of fantastic songs.  In fact, if it was a record, the first 6 songs, side 1, would be worth the price of admission alone.  The opening track, "The Man Who Loved Life", sets the tone for the new lineup by incorporating large doses of piano, female vocals, and more studio trickery than before.  "Think About It", the next song, is possibly the heaviest  thing the group ever recorded.  "Trouble", the third song, may be the most beautiful.  "It's Up to You", the fourth song, is the closest to Jayhawks past, with more acoustic instrumentation.  As the album begins the second side, the songs take on a more hypnotic feel, all mostly slower, and less memorable.  The standouts of this side are "Bottomless Cup" written and sung by Tim O'Reagan (the drummer), and the album's title track. Sound of Lies is a good album to get to find out what the Jayhawks, Mark II are all about.  If you're looking for the country-rock Jayhawks, go with one of their three previous albums.
