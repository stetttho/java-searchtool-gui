 Okay, quit snickering.  Seriously.  Blessed with the most outlandish movie title in non-adult film history, Octopussy is actually a solid adventure and one of Roger Moore's best, despite the fact that it looks like your grandfather is doing the spywork here (Moore was 56 when the movie was released).  Here Bond (get ready) goes after an exiled Indian prince, who has teamed up with a smuggler and a rogue Russian general.  The smuggler (who goes by the nickname "Octopussy") uses a circus front to smuggle jewelry.  The prince and the general are using her circus front to secretly smuggle a nuclear device that will start World War III when detonated and give Russia full control of Europe.  I think that's it - this plot is amazingly hard to comprehend. When people say that all the Bond movies are the same, I'd like to point them here.  Shot mostly in India, this movie has an exotic flavor all its own, and at times feels almost Indiana Jones-ish.  In fact, this movie had a gross-out eating scene a good year before the Temple of Doom did.  So there.  Once again (following the back-to-basics For Your Eyes Only), we see a Bond who is less reliant on gadgets and more reliant on wits.  This movie relies a little less on the big action sequences and more on suspense and character interaction. Maud Adams is a wonderful Bond woman, someone who actually looks like she is within 15 years of Moore's age, and there is more chemistry than anyone Moore starred with in his run.  Of course, this ensures the uncomfortable feeling of watching your parents kiss, but they work well together.  The whole movie is a good time, a pleasant excursion to foreign lands.  Oh, and get a load of that title (snicker).
