 "A Hard Day's Night" (hereafter referred to as AHDN) serves as both the soundtrack to the Beatles' classic film of the same name and the Beatles' best album in the "early period" of their career (which runs from 1963's "Please Please Me" to 1965's "Help!").  Although it's not necessarily a stylistic departure from what the group had done up to that point, the Beatles were taking big steps: not only was their songwriting becoming more mature, but on AHDN, all 13 songs were credited to Lennon/McCartney, a first for the group.    Lennon is the dominant voice here, as he wrote 10 of the 13 songs, including the classic title track, the country-ish "I'll Cry Instead", and the beautiful "If I Fell", Lennon's best ballad up to that point.  John also sings lead on 9 of his songs, leaving "I'm Happy Just to Dance With You" to George Harrison.  He dominates the album, and does so with confidence and assurance, both as a songwriter and as a performer.   Although it can be said that Lennon is the chief presence on the album, it can also be said that AHDN would not be nearly as successful without the contributions of Paul McCartney.  Although he only contributed three songs, the songs - the well-known "Can't Buy Me Love", the acoustic ballad "And I Love Her", and the minor-key "Things We Said Today" - are all essential, and on the whole are of a higher quality than Lennon's.  Paul also contributes a beautiful high harmony to "If I Fell" that becomes basically a second melody.  It transforms a very good song to a great song.   Although their early work does not carry the power of their later material, "A Hard Day's Night" is a excellent pop album that contains many of the Beatles' best songs of the period.  The Beatles were confident, swaggering, and growing at their craft, and their energy is infectious.  Their highest points were yet to come, but "A Hard Day's Night" is still a career highlight for the boys from Liverpool.
