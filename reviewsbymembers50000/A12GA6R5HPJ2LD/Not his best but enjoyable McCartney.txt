 Flowers in the Dirt remains a bit of a mystery and a tough nut to crack.  On the one hand, McCartney sounds energized and his collaboration with Elvis Costello seems to have really inspired him - some of the songs on this album, like the mid-tempo rockers "My Brave Face", "Figure of Eight", and "This One", and the dirge-like "That Day is Done" are among his best since Wings, and he should be playing these songs in concert- they're too good to have been forgotten.  On the other hand, some of the songs, like "Rough Ride", "How Many People", "Motor of Love", and "Ou Est le Soleil". . .are either lightweight or have dated from their late-80's production.  I'm not saying the album is bad, it just doesn't hang together as an album.  It works more as a collection of songs for me, one that I usually end up skipping through.  You may disagree: for instance, this is my Dad's favorite McCartney. On the whole, the album is enjoyable, but not necessarily essential.  The high points are among Paul's post-Beatles best, and the lows aren't bad, just blah.
