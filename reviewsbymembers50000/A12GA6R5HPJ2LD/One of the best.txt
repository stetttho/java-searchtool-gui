 There are a lot of reasons why "Star Trek IV - The Voyage Home" should not work.  In this movie, the sci-fi franchise makes a big shift towards comedy, which in and of itself could alienate a large fanbase (see: Superman III).  On top of that, the movie features a fairly substantial environmental/conservation plot, which could come across as preachy.  Yet, surprisingly, the movie is light, nimble, and funny - and it's these characteristics that make the film one of the highlights of the series.   In "Star Trek IV", a destructive alien presence threatens Earth as it tries to communicate with humpback whales, which are extinct in the 23rd century.  Kirk and co. must venture back to 1986 San Francisco, in order to bring back a couple of whales to the 23rd century so that Earth can be saved.  Trust me, that makes a lot more sense on film than it does written out.     The movie naturally gets a lot of laughs out of its "fish out of water" premise.  Spock in particular is hilarious to watch as he attempts to blend into his 20th century surroundings.  In fact, the whole crew displays a light touch with comedy and they all seem to really enjoy themselves.  This movie, more than any other in the series, gives them all a pretty good chance to shine.  "Star Trek IV" also handles the environmental aspects of the story well, without getting heavyhanded or preachy - the story presents the problem of illegal whaling as something that can be solved, rather than being fatalistic about it.     Definitely the most fun movie in the series, "Star Trek IV" might offend the purists but should entertain everyone else.  A film highlight for Kirk, Spock and the gang.
