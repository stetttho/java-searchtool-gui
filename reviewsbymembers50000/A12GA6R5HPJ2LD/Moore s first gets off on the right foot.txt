 Roger Moore's first turn as James Bond is an interesting film that showcases James Bond trying to stop an island dictator from creating a massive drug problem in the world.  The film features a large element of voodoo, a largely black cast, and the absence of Q, who was excused as part of a plan to make the series more current - these elements make this a unique Bond adventure. For some reason, this feels like a holdover from the more intimate, stylish Sean Connery era, probably due to veteran Guy Hamilton's direction (he directed Goldfinger and Diamonds are Forever), and the more down-to-earth sets, which lean toward the more realistic ones of movies like From Russia With Love. The movie is a fun adventure, with a so-so villain, an interesting Bond girl (Jane Seymour, practically the only one who had a career afterwards), and a boat chase that goes on WAY too long.  It also features Bond's first (and so far only) movie trip to New York City.  The movie has a nice pace (aside from the chase), good changes of location, and it's just fun.  Not a series highlight, but one that sits firmly in the middle of Bond's adventures.
