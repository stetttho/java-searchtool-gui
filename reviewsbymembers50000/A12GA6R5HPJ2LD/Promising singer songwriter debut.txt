 It's both fortunate and unfortunate for Jason Mraz that he's coming to prominence in the wake of John Mayer's success.  Fortunate, because Mayer's success has created an atmosphere that is safe for sensitive male singer/songwriters to function and thrive in; unfortunate, because as a sensitive male singer/songwriter who works primarily with an acoustic-based sound, Mraz is destined to be dismissed as a John Mayer clone.  They even have the same initials, for crying out loud.     All of that is unfortunate, because on "Waiting for My Rocket to Come", Mraz takes big steps toward establishing himself as an artist worth following.  That's not to say that there aren't a number of Mayer-isms on the album, but most of them are in the glossy production by John Alagia, who also produced (you guessed it) John Mayer.  While not quite the songwriter that Mayer is, Mraz distinguishes himself in a couple of different ways. One is by bringing a sense of humor and fun to the forefront.  Songs like "The Remedy", "Curbside Prophet", and "Too Much Food" are sung in a rapid-fire, no-holds-barred style, with Mraz dropping witty quips and references right and left.  This may be jarring to some listeners in the context of the album, but it also provides a nice glimpse into what Mraz has to offer on his own.  Jason also works a number of different styles into the song selection, notably a couple of very pretty ballads, "Absolutely Zero" and "Who Needs Shelter".  There's even a smooth, horn-laced, soulful song, "No Stopping Us".   "Waiting for My Rocket to Come" proves that Jason Mraz has a lot to offer as a singer/songwriter.  He stretches out in a lot of different directions on the disc, and he handles them all pretty well.  That versatility suits him nicely - it will be interesting to see if he is able to gel those elements into his own unique style on his next release, and shed the "Mayer-esque" tag for good.
