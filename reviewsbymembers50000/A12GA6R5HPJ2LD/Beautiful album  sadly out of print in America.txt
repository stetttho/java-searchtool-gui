 The Boos' second major label album following the underwhelming Everything's Alright Forever, Giant Steps was indeed a giant step forward for the band.  Led by songwriter Martin Carr, Giant Steps features a stunning variety of sounds - the Boos seem to try almost everything, from acoustic pop ("Wish I Was Skinny"), to jazz ("Leaves and Sand"), to trancey dance music ("Rodney King [Song for Lenny Bruce]"), to dub (the amazing "Lazarus"), to Oasis-style rock ("If You Want It, Take It" - recorded a year before Definitely Maybe came out) and succeed an enormous amount of the time.  In fact, if the Beatles had been a 90's group, I'm tempted to say that they might have sounded more like the Boo Radleys than Oasis - the Boos had the same experimental, try-anything attitude that the Beatles had three decades prior. The album almost sounds like a mess upon first listen, but repeated playing brings out the adventurous nature and quality of what the group did.  It's very rare for a contemporary group to push limits like the Boo Radleys did, and do it with such success, but Giant Steps is just that- it's a great, well-done album from an underappreciated group (even in Britain). Highlights include all of the aforementioned songs, plus the opener "I Hang Suspended", and the poppy "Barney (...and Me)".
