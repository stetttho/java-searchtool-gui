 Released in 1973, Paul McCartney's Red Rose Speedway was his fourth solo album after his split from the Beatles and his second with Wings.  A more polished, better-written effort than Wild Life, its near-disastrous predecessor, Red Rose Speedway conforms to the pattern of many of Paul's solo albums: the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  That is, taken out of context, some of the tracks are silly, and none really hit the highs Paul hit with the Beatles. . .but put them all together, sequence them correctly, and the album is strangely charming and quite likable.  Sure, looking at the track listing, you may only recognize the hit "My Love", but there are several good songs here - the bouncy "Big Barn Bed"; the funky "Get On The Right Thing"; the passionate "Little Lamb Dragonfly" (I just wish the song's subject matter was something to actually get passionate about).  The album closes with a final medley that is nice, but hard to listen to without directly comparing it to the Abbey Road medley.   Final thoughts? A fun, quaint album. . .if you're looking for the best, skip on ahead to Wings' next album, Band on the Run.  If you like Paul, you'll get a kick out of this one anyway.
