 Dr. No, the first adventure of the James Bond series, is one of the best for several reasons.  One, it's far less pun-fixated and silly than a lot of the movies (Man With the Golden Gun, I'm looking at you), and two, the character of Bond, as played by Sean Connery, is hard-nosed and clever.  He actually feels more like a secret agent , and a good one, in this movie.  The movie involves Bond's quest to track down the titular villain, who has been sabotaging rocket launches from his island base.  The movie is high on action and low on gadgets.  Moreover, it's concise, a quality not shared by all the Bonds.  Dr. No sets the table for the many (currently 20, not counting outside Bonds produced by someone other than EON) sequels that followed.
