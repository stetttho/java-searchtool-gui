 If you've been blown away by Abbey Road, and ready to see the next step Paul took in his creative journey. . . don't get your hopes up.  "McCartney", released in 1970, was the first major post-Beatles statement released by the group.  In fact, Paul used the album's release to announce he was leaving the group.  The album is basically a one-man affair (Paul played all the instruments, Linda did a few backing vocals), and it is a record with simple pleasures.  The songs are not the complex, tightly constructed beauties of the Beatles' last few albums: they are simple, with low-key arrangements and instrumentation.  They sound almost spontaneous.  The 5 instrumentals (yes, I said five, and it's a fact that made me incredibly bitter when I first bought the album - heck, I just wanted to see what the words were to a song called "Momma Miss America"), while making you wish there had been actual completed songs in their place, do not detract from the other songs and actually help unify the overall theme/sound of the album. The best moments on the record: "Maybe I'm Amazed" - simply an amazing piece of work that ranks up with pretty much anything Paul did as a Beatle; "Every Night" - a fun love song that's easily singable and gets stuck in your head; "Junk" - a Beatles outtake dating from the White Album period; and "That Would Be Something" - a very, very simple song that scores points on its funkiness and instrumentation. If you can get past the hopes of a "Lost Beatle Album", you'll enjoy this glimpse into McCartney's world.
