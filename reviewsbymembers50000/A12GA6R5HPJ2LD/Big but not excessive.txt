 The fourth adventure in the Bond series, and the one that was the biggest worldwide smash, to this day ($427,000,000 in the US alone, adjusted for inflation).  Dealing with Bond's attempts to recapture two stolen nuclear devices before the evil organization SPECTRE uses them, this is the first film in the series that seems to really divide the fanbase as to its merits.  To a lot of people, it's overblown and slow-moving, especially since a lot of the climactic action takes place underwater, and that can be very tiring.  Others think it's a great example of the 60's Bond, with a great Connery performance.  I fall into the latter camp.  I concede the fact that the movie runs a little long and the water scenes are slow, but I like the fact that the Bond series was on top after Goldfinger, and this film reflects that.  It shows the swagger of a cast and crew that knew they were the best and wanted to give the best: the sets are bigger and grander, there are crazier and different gadgets, and the situation is more dire if Bond doesn't succeed.  This is a stylish movie, with great sets and beautiful Bahaman locations.  Not to mention Claudine Auger and Lucianna Paluzzi, two of the most captivating Bond girls ever.   One of the best.
