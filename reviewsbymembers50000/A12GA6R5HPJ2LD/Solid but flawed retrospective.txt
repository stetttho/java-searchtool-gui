 As an introduction to the Band, that paradox of a group (a rootsy Americana group from the psychadelic 60's, made up of mostly Canadians) with a confusing name, the boxed set Across the Great Divide works pretty well.  The first two discs concentrate on the Band's first recording career (I'll be ignoring the late-Eighties comeback), and lean mostly on the first two albums, Music from Big Pink and The Band.  The song selection is well done, and you get a good sense of the Band's different singers, Levon Helm, Richard Manuel, and Rick Danko.  Plus, you get the classics "Across the Great Divide", "I Shall Be Released", "The Weight", "Up on Cripple Creek" and "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down", as well as some late-career gems. The main problem I have with the album is the third disc, containing rarities.  This has some good songs, like some pre-Band Hawks recordings and some Last Waltz material.  The only problem I have with it is that some of it doesn't qualify as rare- the Last Waltz stuff is not rare at all and some of the other tracks are available in other forms on the Basement Tapes collection.  The Last Waltz is important to the legend of the Band, and should be sequenced in a way that makes it more of a part of their history.  As it is, it resides at the end of the third disc, after all the rarities.  It seems like a small quibble, but a confusing picture is painted as a result.   Still, not a bad set, and a most enjoyable listen and introduction to the group.
