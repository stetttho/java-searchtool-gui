 Finally, a little new blood.  Timothy Dalton takes on the 007 mantle in this, the 15th official Bond adventure.  In it, Bond helps a defecting general who then gets kidnapped.  Tracking down the how's and the why's, he stumbles onto a weapons scheme.  Trust me, the plot is as confusing as Octopussy's.  Just hang on and enjoy it. Although Timothy Dalton only had two go-rounds as 007, I like and appreciate both him and his run on the series, for a couple of different reasons.  1)After Moore's pun-filled tenure, it's nice to see a harder-edged Bond than even Connery.  Although Dalton still has a few puns (mostly the result of the script being written before he was cast), they're not as overboard.  2)Both of Dalton's movies tried to push the character out of his comfort zone in the movies - this one features him doing more espionage things, like arranging defections, and being an assassin.  The next, Licence to Kill, would see him going on a revenge mission.  All these things make his movies seem fresh to me today, and although he is much maligned, he brought a lot of interesting things to the character.  I'm sad he couldn't have done one more movie before '95's Goldeneye. As far as faults go, the villains are so-so.  I mean, any time you have James Bond squaring off against Joe Don Baker, its not ever going to live up to your expectations, or lack thereof (and don't get me started on the fact that, thanks to his roles in Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies, Baker has now appeared in more Bond movies than Dalton).  Also, the climactic battle between Bond and Baker is woefully short. It's still a good time, however.  A good Bond and the most cold-war flavored Bond movie since From Russia With Love make this a nice chapter in the series.
