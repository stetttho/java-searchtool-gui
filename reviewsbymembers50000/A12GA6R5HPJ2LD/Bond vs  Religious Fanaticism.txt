 John Gardner turns in a solid Bond thriller that manages to be a little different than usual but still solid.  This time, he goes up against the head of a fanatical cult bent on destroying England's political system.  The book works well because the threat feels very real and imminent throughout the book.  Bond does a little more detecting than usual, and despite what could be done with the premise, Gardner reigns it in and keeps it mostly down to earth.  Not one to start with, but another underrated Gardner entry.
