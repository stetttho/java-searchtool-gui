 Crowded House's second album is considerably darker than its first, but it's where the Crowded House formula was working almost at 100%.  Temple of Low Men was not your standard pop release like Crowded House's self-titled debut was, and as a result met with indifference in a market that saw the first album go platinum.  It IS a dark album, with songs about extramarital affairs and death, but anyone with an ear for quality pop music would do well to expend the effort the album requires - they'll be rewarded. One thing I like about Crowded House's albums is that they never outstay their welcome.  Temple of Low Men is no different, 10 songs totalling around 40 minutes. Highlights include "Into Temptation", a dark ballad that explores the emotional impact of an extramarital affair; "I Feel Possessed", the rolling album opener; "Better Be Home Soon", a beautiful acoustic ballad that some country music producer would be wise to turn into a Nashville hit - the song practically begs for it; and "Love This Life", my personal favorite Crowded House song and the one I think sums up the group the best - a dark, minor key verse about life weighing you down, that explodes into a beautiful, bright, major key chorus. A few missteps on this album makes Woodface the best album done by the group, but this one is quite a runner-up.  It's a shame this group is not better known here in the US.
