 In a series where the hero has gone into space, battled metal-toothed giants and fought in a hollowed-out volcano, this movie has to take the cake for being the weirdest adventure 007 has had yet. What if I told you I had a movie that featured: a 58 year-old leading man pairing up with a 30 year-old woman; a bleached-blond Christopher Walken as the villain; Grace Jones - GRACE JONES - as a villain's henchman; and a love scene between the aforementioned 58 year-old and the aforementioned Jones?  Well, its all here.  This was Moore's last go round as 007, and he looks at least 30 years older than he did in Octopussy.  In fact, his stuntman is used a lot here, and it's pretty obvious that it's not Moore when you can see the guy's face.  In fact, I even think the stuntman did Moore's walking for him.  The plot is somewhat of a Goldfinger rehash, a tale about a madman computer chip maker(Walken) seeking to destroy silicon valley for the purposes of cornering the market.  There's some stuff here to like - all of the Bond elements are here, as well as a great fight on the top of the Golden Gate bridge;  Walken is always a convincing madman, the sight of gender-free Jones and Moore together is a hoot - ol' Rog looks TERRIFIED to be sleeping with her; and Duran Duran's title song is one of the series' best.   Not to like - Bond girl Tanya Roberts is nice to look at, but plays the least convincing scientist in the whole series up until Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards) in The World is Not Enough; the teaser sequence, in which "California Girls" is played while Bond snowboards (don't ask); and the fact that the movie is a little too creaky to hold up to a 131 minute running time. Any Bond is better than no Bond, but the series needed a shot in the arm at this point.
