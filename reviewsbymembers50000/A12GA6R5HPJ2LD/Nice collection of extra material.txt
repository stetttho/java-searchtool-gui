 Not quite a "lost album", but almost.  Afterglow collects 13 tracks, the "Odds and Sods" of the group's career, as the Who might say.  If it were an actual album, it might have been the group's third best, although by nature, the album is a little disjointed.  As far as tone goes, the album leans more towards the brighter aspects of the Crowded House and Woodface albums, as most of the songs were recorded in those periods.   The album is a nice collection that flows pretty well, and there are probably a number of groups that would like a collection of songs this strong to be their greatest hits album.  The best songs here are "Recurring Dream", a jangle-pop number that predates the group even being called Crowded House; "I Love You Dawn", a pretty love song penned by Neil Finn for his wife, and "Time Immemorial", a folky ballad that was to have closed the Woodface album.  Also look for drummer Paul Hester's vocal spotlight on the silly "My Telly's Gone Bung".  He's no Ringo, but on the plus side, he's no Ringo.  That makes sense if you think about it. Don't start with this one, but no fan of Crowded House will dislike this album.
