 One of the quirkier James Bond films, which causes me to love and loathe it in equal measure, You Only Live Twice was Sean Connery's fifth and penultimate go-round as James Bond ( I don't count Never Say Never Again, and neither should you).  The plot deals with Bond's efforts to figure out who is capturing American and Soviet rockets.  I love it because like all the great Bond movies, it feels like a travelogue - you get to see a lot of Japan, where most of the movie takes place; a change in director to Lewis Gilbert makes the whole movie feel more epic; the volcano set, where the villain hides out, is a classic; and "Little Nellie", the little helicopter, is a great gadget that we should all be using by now.  Why aren't we?!! What DON'T I like?  First off, our man JB doesn't really do a whole lot.  He mainly gets carried along by the plot as needed - he doesn't even drive a car at all in this movie (it's the only one where that happens).  Also, the whole thing feels strangely half-formed.  There are parts where you might think your DVD player has skipped a chapter - I mean, you don't even learn the Bond girl's name until the credits!  The whole thing is just a little too far over the top- giant sets, giant plot.  The plots got this big when Roger Moore took over, but he was more capable of handling it by treating the whole thing with a tongue-in-cheek attitude.  Sean Connery was just too much of a man's man to deal with hollowed-out volcanoes. Check it out, though - you may disagree. It's still mindlessly enjoyable if you don't think about it too much.  The score and title song are great, and it's fun seeing where Mike Myers came up with virtually every joke in the Austin Powers movies.
