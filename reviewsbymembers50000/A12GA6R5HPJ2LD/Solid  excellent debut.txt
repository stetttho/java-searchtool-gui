 It's not hard to listen to David Mead's debut album, "The Luxury of Time", and imagine that you're hearing a longtime fan of pop music getting his chance to run wild in the studio.  Lush arrangements draped with strings, sound effects, and backwards guitars drape unabashedly hooky songs that recall other popsters like Paul McCartney and Ron Sexsmith.  Going back to that opening statement, it's really not hard to listen to "The Luxury of Time" at all.  Mead has one of the best, smoothest tenors in pop music today, and he's not afraid to use it to dispell the belief that it's not cool to sing the high notes.   Besides Mead himself, the album has a number of strong points.  At thirteen songs, around 52:00, it's just about the perfect length for an album in the CD age.  Everything hovers around the three to four-minute mark.  Mead also takes great care to make sure that the songs themselves are distinctive and different from one another, from the cinematic pop-culture ode of the title track, to the the barnburning faux-zydeco stomp of "World of a King", to the stripped-down, yet beautiful "Apart from You".   Mead's best song here, though, is "Landlocked", which sounds like it was included on the album in its demo form, as background noises and flubbed notes are both audible.  It helps the song's immediacy, actually.  Using a metaphor relating a frustrating relationship to a piece of area being confined from touching water (hence the title), Mead paints a beautiful picture in a way that's pretty complex for modern pop music.   The album is an auspicious debut, and its only noticable flaws are perhaps it being occasionally too eclectic for some people's tastes, and Mead's reach occasionally exceeding his grasp (most notably, on the lounge-y "Make the Most Of").  Still, David Mead has established himself as a talent worth following, listening to, and celebrating.
