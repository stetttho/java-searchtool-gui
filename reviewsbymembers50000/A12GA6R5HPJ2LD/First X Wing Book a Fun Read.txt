 For some, Star Wars without the main characters would probably seem kind of strange. Star Wars: Rogue Squadron proves that there are many stories left to be told that don't involve Han, Luke, Leia, et al. Detailing the reformation of Rogue Squadron under the command of Wedge Antilles (one of the few supporting characters to appear in all three of the original Star Wars films), the book tells the story of some of the New Republic's victories after the death of the Emperor. Although the technical jargon and space battles can be a little tough to visualize at times, the characters are interesting (almost all of them have a backstory) and the plot draws you in. A nice look at another side of the Star Wars universe.
