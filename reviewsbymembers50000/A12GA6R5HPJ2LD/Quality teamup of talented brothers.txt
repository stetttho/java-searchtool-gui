 Neil and Tim Finn team up for the first time since Crowded House's Woodface album, and if you're coming into this one expecting the glossier pop tones of that album, you won't find it here.  Finn is a raw album; the brothers play all the instruments (except for one bass part on the last track), and it sounds like much of the album was recorded live in the studio.  It almost feels like Neil Finn's Ram, only without a Monkberry Moon Delight. What the album does have are a lot of intricate, pretty melodies that reveal themselves upon repeated spins, and the sound of the brothers' voices harmonizing, which, as you might guess, is a nice thing indeed.  This album is not really the place to start to understand Neil Finn and his grasp of the pop song, but rather another piece of the whole puzzle. Highlights of the album: "Eyes of the World", where the brothers trade vocals; the absolutely jaw-droppingly beautiful "Last Day of June"; "Angels Heap" and "Where is My Soul", where the brothers' harmonies take the forefront; and the echoey, almost trance-like  "Suffer Never". Finn is a solid album with no clunkers; it rewards patience and repeated listens.
