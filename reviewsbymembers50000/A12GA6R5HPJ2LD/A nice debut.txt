 The Police's debut album, released in 1978, is a strong debut that benefits from its unencumbered production and lack of pretension, something that would occasionally overrun Sting in the later years.  The performances are distinct, yet straightforward, and the songs are well written: "Roxanne", "Can't Stand Losing You", and "Truth Hits Everybody" are all here.  Listening to the album, one realizes that the early Police were more than just "white reggae", as is the common misconception.  In fact, Outlandos d'Amour probably owes more to punk and new wave than reggae.  The album's 10 tracks move by at a brisk pace, and the album's  energy is contagious. All in all, an easy four stars.  Loses a little steam towards the end, but any Police fan looking to go a little deeper than the hits, or anyone looking to see what the Police were all about, should enjoy this album.
