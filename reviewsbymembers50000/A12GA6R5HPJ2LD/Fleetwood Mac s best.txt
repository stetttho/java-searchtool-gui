 Here it is, one of the sheer titanic classics of 70's rock.  It sold 17,000,000 copies.  If you've spent any time around a seventies station, you probably know half of this album by heart: "Dreams", "Don't Stop", "Go Your Own Way", "The Chain",  and "You Make Loving Fun" are all mainstays of oldies radio.  "Gold Dust Woman" was covered by Hole.  So, if you're buying the album, you may be only getting 5-6 songs you're not familiar with.  Is it worth it?   In a word, yes.  In three words, most definitely yes.  In this album, the engine that is the Buckingham/Nicks version of Fleetwood Mac is firing on all cylinders.  Rarely have many bands with multiple songwriters had them all on the same page like McVie, Buckingham and Nicks are here.  I guess emotional and romantic devastation will give people similar outlooks on things - the romantic turmoil going on in the band during this period is well documented.  The aforementioned songs, heard so many times before, gain new power in the context of the album. Rumours, which clocks in at a lean 39:03, has a terrific flow and keeps you captivated throughout its run time, and lesser-known tracks like "Second-hand News" and "I Don't Want to Know" are revelations.   Fleetwood Mac, long derided for being glossy mainstream pop, are finally starting to get some respect and recognition as the terrific band that they are.  This is their peak, a classic album that deserves its classic status.
