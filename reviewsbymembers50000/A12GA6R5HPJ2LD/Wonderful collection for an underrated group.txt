 It would be hard to argue with any collection that spreads a little love on the woefully unknown (at least here in the States)Crowded House.  The fact that Recurring Dream does such a good job is just a little icing on the cake.  I'm not going to spend time talking about what's not here (personal fave "Love This Life" is absent, though), but rather what is.  The compilers did a good job of not informing you what the best albums are by their song selection; rather, the collection features 4 songs from each of the albums, plus 3 new ones.  Normally, I am not a fan of the Best of+new tracks, and I wouldn't classify any of these as better than most of what got left off, but it's nice as a sort of goodbye to the fans, and the tracks are still the House doing what they do best, which is singing catchy, intelligent pop music.  That much is evident here in songs like "Don't Dream It's Over", "Something So Strong", "Fall At Your Feet", "It's Only Natural", and "Distant Sun".  The only album I would quibble with on song representation is Together Alone, but again, I said I wouldn't do that, so I won't. If you can find it, there is an import of this with a bonus live album.  Get it, because it's a great intro to the live talent and unique humor that makes the group extra special.   Despite all my minor quibbles with the set, on the whole it's the best retrospective this group could hope for, and it's a wonderful way to be introduced to some of the best post-70s pop music there is.
