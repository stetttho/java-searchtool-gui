 Woodface is Crowded House's third and best album, the one that should have given the group a larger American audience, but didn't; it's a real shame, because I have heard very few joyous, fun, involving albums like Woodface.  Tim Finn, Neil's brother and bandmate from the Split Enz days, joined the group for this one album and cowrote a number of the songs.  His voice harmonizing with his brother's is one of the highlights of the album, especially on my favorite track, "It's Only Natural".  Although I would say that the previous album, Temple of Low Men, may have had the higher high points, Woodface is the more consistent album.  The only misstep on the album is the opener, "Chocolate Cake", which is not bad, but is an anti-American song that portrays us all as fat and uneducated.  Wait a minute, it's right! The highlights of the album are "Fall At Your Feet", a classic ballad that should have been more than the minor radio hit that it was; "Weather With You", a feast of harmony vocals and Neil Finn's typical dour worldview; "She Goes On", a beautiful musical eulogy for a wife; and the album's closer, "How Will You Go", a song about an alcoholic. If you're looking to get into the House, you can start here or on their debut album.  If you're a fan of quality pop music, you won't be disappointed with either.
