 Together Alone was the fourth and final album for Crowded House (not counting compilations), and as such, cements the group's pattern of light album/dark album.  The album is more of a stylistic brethren with the band's second album, Temple of Low Men, than the joyful Woodface.  In addition, as their only album without famed producer Mitchell Froom at the boards, the group's sound takes a stylistic turn to darker, more textured pop.  Hearing Neil Finn's songs wrapped in textured layers is a good sound for the group, and one that Finn himself would explore a little more in his solo work. The album itself is a dark (could I use that word just one more time?) beauty, with a fairly strong selection of songs.  The echoey "Kare Kare" begins the album and sets forth the new feel of the group's music; "Private Universe" is a gem with a intense personal feel, given a world music feel by log drumming; "Walking on the Spot" is one of the most beautiful things Finn has ever written; "Distant Sun" is one of the closest stylistically to what the House has done before, and another great song. Crowded House tries a lot on this album and succeeds at a lot of it.  There is more variance in styles from song to song than on any other CH album; this can make the album feel slightly disjointed, and it mainly holds together by the unity in sound.  This is a pretty good way for a group to go out, reminding you that they were still trying to expand and trying new things.  Start with one of the other albums first, but get this one eventually.
