 London Town was a 1978 album by Paul McCartney and Wings, or better yet, Paul, Linda and Denny, because that's all that was left by this point.  What's interesting about this lineup is not only does Denny Laine hold his own on this album, the album as a whole is almost consistently strong, with distinct, consistent songs that vary from Paul's typical "Silly Love Songs". . .that's not to say that they're necessarily deep songs, but they are different, and that scores a lot of points with me.  A lot of highlights on the album: the title track, a Beatle-esque view of London and ordinary lives; "Girlfriend", a pop-soul number with a high falsetto that Michael Jackson would later cover on his "Off the Wall" album; the hit "With a Little Luck", which is unfortunately not the single edit - this version contains about two (2!) extra minutes of synth doodling; "Don't Let It Bring You Down", a kaleidoscopic number in a waltz time; and "Deliver Your Children", a strong, dark folky song sung by Denny Laine (DENNY LAINE!).  Even the misfires have a lot to recommend- "Famous Groupies", which is a little silly for my taste, has great production and sound effects; and "Cafe on the Left Bank", which deals with yes, a cafe, still has a great, slick sound. There are a couple of minor problems: "Backwards Traveller/Cuff Link" which takes two minutes of a fantastic, creative, well sung melody and turns it into THREE MORE minutes of synthesizer doodlings.  (note to Paul- finish this song!); and a little ditty called "Morse Moose and the Grey Goose".  Now I know what you're saying - how could a song with that title be bad?  Well, what if I told you if the "Morse Moose" part was a disco song, and the "Grey Goose" part was a nautical folk song, and they just swapped back and forth?  Would you believe me now? Despite those problems, the album is a lot of fun and a little different from some of the other stuff in Paul's catalog.  If you like Paul, you'll enjoy this album.
