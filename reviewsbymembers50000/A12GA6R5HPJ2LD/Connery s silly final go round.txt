 Your first impression upon seeing Sean Connery in this movie might be, "Good Lord!  What happened?!!", and you'd be right.  Released in 1971, DAF came 4 years after Connery's last turn as Bond in You Only Live Twice, and it would be his last real appearance as the agent - no, no, no, no, no, Never Say Never Again does NOT count.  Strangely though, he looks at least 15 years older than he did in YOLT; he might even look older in this movie than he does now.  You can tell he hears the jingle of money all throughout the movie; in fact, I'm pretty sure he didn't even try to get into shape. Whew!  Besides all that, it's an enjoyable Bond film, but only if you allow yourself a few preset conditions: 1)you, upon seeing the earth-shattering revelations of the previous film On Her Majesty's Secret Service (starring one-timer George Lazenby), don't expect this movie to address them in any way; 2)If you liked the bald Blofeld of You Only Live Twice and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, you don't mind him with hair and acting effeminate; 3)You can accept Jimmy Dean as an actor rather than a sausage maker; and 4)you don't mind Roger Moore Bond movies, as this is basically a Roger Moore movie with Sean Connery in it - it's the silliest one he ever did. ALL that said, this is a lot of fun as long as you don't think about it at all.  Bond makes a great match for Las Vegas as he tries to track down some diamond smugglers.  The documentary on the DVD says this movie was made in the style of Goldfinger, and although it is not quite at that level, you won't get bored watching it.  Bond girl Jill St. John is nice to look at, although strangely she changes from tough/saavy to stupid over the course of the movie. . .just about the time where she starts having. . .well, did you ever see the Seinfeld where George got super smart? All in all, not the best in the series, but a unique adventure for Agent 007.
