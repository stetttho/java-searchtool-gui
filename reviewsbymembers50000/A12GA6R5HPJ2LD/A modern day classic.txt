 What?  You don't have this one yet?  At our college, I think it was sold in the bookstore in a bundle of three with James Taylor's Greatest Hits and The Eagles Their Greatest Hits: 1971-1975.  Well, for those of you who don't, this is where it (actually several things) all started.  For starters, this is where many people began to dislike this fellow named Adam Duritz for being too wordy, too morose, too eccentric.  It's also where many people began to follow the poet for what they saw as an insight into the human condition. Which camp do I fall into?  Well, I was initially turned off by everything except "Mr. Jones", "Rain Kings" and "Murder of One".  I couldn't handle the strange vocal quirks of Duritz or the predominance of slow melodies.  But then, as time passed, and I moved into adulthood, and I actually began to experience pain and heartbreak, the album clicked into place for me.  I think Adam Duritz unchecked could be a dangerous thing, but here his melodies are somber and beautiful , his vocals are restrained, and his words seem to give you an "I've been there before" feeling.  For me, the album is perfect.  It flows smoothly from one song to the next, and all the emotion it captures feels 100% real.  I'm not saying that if you're a Crows hater, that this is the album to change your mind, but this is the best place to start. Highlights of the album include the aforementioned songs, as well as the beautiful "Anna Begins", about the dissolution of a relationship.
