 Roger Moore's third time around was one of his best, a movie that found him growing into the role, and the series finding its voice with him as the lead.  No longer (at least for the Moore era)were the movies going to be as stylish as they were with Connery, or as silly as The Man With the Golden Gun got (although Moonraker lives in the same neighborhood).  Moore's Bond was going to be a suave secret agent, a reluctant killer with a slight overreliance on puns.  Moore's tongue-in-cheek nature has earned him the scorn of many a hard-edged Connery lover, and I must admit Moore grates on me sometimes.  However, is it possible to say that I like his movies better than I like him as Bond?  Because I do.  Moore's Bond adventures are grand, sometimes over-the-top adventures that have rarely a dull moment, and strangely enough, he's just the actor to not get overwhelmed by it.  Imagine Sean Connery in Moonraker! TSWLM is a fun jaunt across the globe, as Bond and rival Russian secret agent XXX (played by Barbara Bach, future Mrs. Ringo Starr, that lucky lady)track down a madman who is capturing nuclear submarines with the intent of wiping out humankind.  Really, though, the plot is not overly important.  The movie is big and exciting, Agent XXX is a good foil for Bond (with personal reasons for wanting him dead), the submarine car makes its appearance, and Jaws is here. . .are you sold on this yet? Moore's peak in the role, though "For Your Eyes Only" comes very close.  Rent/buy this one today.
