 If you want a description of Mystery, take a look at some of the other reviews (but I'd discount the ones by the adolescent hockey dudes),  If you love hockey, particularly if you play on a recreational or adult team you'll appreciate this movie.  It was much better than I expected, and funny as well.  I've added Mystery to my library which includes the classic, Slapshot, and the historical, Miracle.
