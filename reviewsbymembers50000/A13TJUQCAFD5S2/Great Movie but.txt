 A true American classic.  This will be required viewing in anthropology classes in a thousand years (yes, even at Harvard).  Rodney's insults are to die for, and Bill Murray rapping with Chevy Chase, well, we baby-boomers remember times like that.  The movie is so stupid, it's irresistable. I have the tape version and want the DVD real bad, but based on the reviews, I'll wait until a decent DVD version is released.
