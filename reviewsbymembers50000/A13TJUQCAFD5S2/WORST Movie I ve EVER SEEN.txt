 The acting is terrible!!! (Redford should have hung up his spurs after the "Sting"!)  The dialogue is Terrible!!! The Directing is terrible!!!!!!!!  The pace and tempo are out of wack.  They must have spent all their budget on Redford and shiny old cars rather than story, direction, continuity, and production.  AND yet there was so much potential.  My frustration is unbearable!!!  Any movie I can think of is better than "Havana"!!! Try "LA Confidential", "Chinatown", "Casablanca", in fact any Bogart movie...the list is endless!!!  I'd recommend my five year old's "Dumbo" ahead of "Havana".  AHAH!!!  I just had a stroke of genius!!!  Redford crash lands his Gulfstream V in remote Africa and loses his ability to speak, and the chimps nuture him back to health.  The name of the movie, "The Homo Sapien Whisperer".
