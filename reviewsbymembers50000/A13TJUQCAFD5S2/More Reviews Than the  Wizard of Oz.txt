 For a relatively obscure film, "Butterfly" has stimulated a lot of discourse and counter opinions.  Reviewers' descriptors include: romantic, entertaining, mystery, sleaze, violent, thriller, dark, psychological, horror, sinister, time travel, evil, scientific, disturbing, etc.  These come from both favorable and unfavorable reviews.  To understand Butterfly, one has to understand what the "butterfly effect" is; otherwise the viewer will be sorely disappointed.  The official editorial reviewer, Shannon, points to "Jurassic Park" for edification, but that's nonsense; don't waste your time there.  Without going into detail, the butterfly effect is a very real scientific postulation that includes elements of chaos theory, non-linear differential equations, and how infinitesimal differences in initial conditions can drastically change outcomes.  Specifically, the butterfly effect refers to how the action of a butterfly in one part of the world might have unexpected but profound effects on weather systems half way around the globe.  Sounds absurd (like many found the movie), but it is an accepted theory in the scientific community.  I recommend "Chaos" by Gleick for a clear and understandable explanation of the effect, and for a general understanding of chaos theory.  If I had no understanding of the butterfly effect, I would have panned the movie too.  On the other hand, I found Butterfly to be a provocative interpretation.
