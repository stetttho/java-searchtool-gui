 I was upgrading from a 5 (really <3) sheet Fellows to a 10 sheet Royal 85X which I happened to see at Target. Got it home and found the basket interlock switch was intermittant.  If the basket was in place the unit wouldn't work.  Called Royal to see in there was an adjustment I could make so I didn't have to make another trip, but the tech said to return it.  I exchanged it for another one; got it home and it was absolutely DOA!!!  Shame on Royal for making such a lousy product, and shame on Target for selling it.  Moral of the story:  I'll do my due diligence, then buy it from Amazon or Costco.  No more Royal or Target!!!
