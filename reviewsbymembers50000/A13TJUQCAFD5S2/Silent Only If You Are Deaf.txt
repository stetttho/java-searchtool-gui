 Here are the facts:  I just received my second warranty replacement Quadra in three years (thank goodness they have a five year warranty!).  (My brother is on his fourth in three years.)  Even though I kept the unit clean and followed Sharper Image's instructions, each unit just suddenly died - failed to turn on.  Regarding Sharper Image's claim of being silent, my units were  anything but.  Even after thorough cleaning the units hummed.  They were loud enough that I had to turn them off at night in order to sleep.  This "new" third one hummed right out of the box!  Will I purchase another one?  No.
