 I first saw this movie when it was released at the Cinerama theater in Hollywood. I was ten, and I loved it.  It was my favorite picture at the time.  My expectations seeing it decades later were not high, thinking that it might be silly and boring.  WRONG!  It was even funnier seeing it as an adult. Non-stop laughs. One of my favorite scenes is when Phil Silvers gets outwitted by a little indian boy. For those of you familiar with California, or perhaps having been born or raised there, many will recognize some of the locales such as Santa Monica and PCH, Malibu, and Long Beach (The Pike, Villa Riviera), etc.; albeit four decades ago.   By today's standards this is a relatively simple movie (minimal sex, profanity, special effects, etc.) yet it goes to show that good movie making is an art and doesn't require all the titilations found in current movies or huge budgets to be enjoyable. If a DVD version were available, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.
