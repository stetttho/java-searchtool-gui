 I had high expectations for this book after seeing a favorable reference to it in the "WSJ".  I was looking for insights and generalizations that characterize market explosions and their inevitable collapse which could be applied to future financial booms and busts. Instead I was treated, check that, tortured by a dry narrative that wandered between centuries and continents and back again all in the same breath. As I read, I kept asking myself, "What's the point?  Where are those nuggets of insight?  Where is the critical thinking? Surely, they must show up at some point!"  They never did.  Kindleberger presented a lot of historical (and disjointed) facts, but the meat of it was sorely lacking.  He clearly would be classified as an economic theorist rather than a practitioner, but I can't see his work being useful to pure economists either. While Greenspan may be acquanted with him on the cocktail circuit, I doubt he has much use for Kindleberger otherwise.   Rather than repeat what others have said, I recommend the reviews of 12/26/98, 11/8/99, 2/16/00, 9/15/02, 1/18/03, and 2/25/03 which are on target and worth reading.
