 I won't play professional critic and describe the plot or talk about the style in meaningless flowery words as if I went to prep school in the East.  Others have already done that.  To disagree with the positive reviews would be like disagreeing with proponents of the "emperor's new clothes" - you'd never win the argument.  But in a word this movie "SUCKS".  I bought it for my wife who wanted to turn it off in 15 minutes.  I convinced her to stick it out until the end.  Bad decision!!!  I'll be paying for that awful mistake a long time!  This movie is NOT a murder mystery.  It is NOT a psycho drama. It is the product of some "filmmakers"(?) throwing you-know-what against the wall and hoping it sticks.  As even the 5 star reviewers have said, there is no sense to this movie.  (There is more sense in the waiter serving Cox an empty glass of water and her trying to drink it than there is in the rest of the film).  If you want to experience an abstract film that seems to not make any sense, but actually does, see "The Butterfly Effect"; it at least is based on an underlying theory and has a defensible thread from beginning to end.  The only mystery is why I was stupid enough to buy this movie based on the preview and a couple of one line adverts.  Shame on me!
