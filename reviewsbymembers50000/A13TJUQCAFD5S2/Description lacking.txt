 I was looking for a carrying case for my new Vaio.  There were no technical or product descriptions, but the title included "case".  It was advertised as a Sony accessory for my Vaio laptop, and the picture looked like a carrying case.  I naturally thought it was what I wanted.  In fact, I chose it over a carrying case from Kensington, because I was concerned about a possible compatibility issue buying from another manufacturer.  How could I go wrong buying a case expressly listed for my Vaio model from Sony? I'll tell you.  This "case" is nothing more than a thin wetsuit material slipcover for the laptop to prevent scratches and keep out dust (but it has a nifty Vaio logo for the vain)! (No, it's not waterproof; it's wetsuit material not drysuit.)  IT IS A PROTECTIVE SLEEVE; NOT A CARRYING CASE! Bottom line is I was very disappointed that I didn't get what I wanted.  I rate ... For those who want a wetsuit for their Vaio, the product's probably a 4 or 5.
