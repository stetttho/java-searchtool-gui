 The Dimage Xi exceeded all my expectations.  The small package is unbelieveable.  It is simple to use out of the box, yet I can see it has a lot of capabilities that I will have to learn about. But I can tell you this, my three year old 35mm Rebel SLR just got put on the shelf next to the buggywhip.  I can't imagine why I would ever use it again, and it's a good camera! No more waiting in line @ one hour photo, and hoping more that 25% of pics are good. I'd short your Kodak and silver stocks! The 16meg memory that comes with the Xi is not enough.  I bought a 256meg and an extra battery.  Can't wait to use it's full capabilities, but in the mean time it is cool as is.
