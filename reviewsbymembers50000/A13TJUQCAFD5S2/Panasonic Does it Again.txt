 We have four Panasonic 900 mhz cordless two-line phones in the house, which all work very well.  However, the one in my office picks up interference from my Intel wireless keyboard and mouse which operates @900 mhz.  Another problem I wanted to resolve was that our Casio answerphone would lose messages when the power was off - its battery backup never worked.  Solution? The Panasonic TG2593B.  The 2.4 ghz signal gives hardwired quality audio.  The handset lasts 50+ hours outside the cradle w/o recharging. The programming features are incredibly flexible.  For example, with four phones and two lines and receiving faxes at all hours, we have programmed the base on my office phone to be the only one that rings in the house. The answer phone is very flexible, for example we've programmed it to only answer on one line and not the other which we use for faxes and outgoing calls.  Messages are stored in flash memory and are not lost when power is disconnected. While the phone worked right out of the box, you do have to read the manual to implement its many features. After looking for the perfect two-line phone I've finally found it.
