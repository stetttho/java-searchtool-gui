 I really loved this camera--for 13 months.  Then, like some other people who have reviewed this camera, the lens stuck open.  Fortunately, thanks to another reviewer, I discovered that American Express doubled the 1 year warranty, and issued me a credit. (Took about a month of back and forth faxing, returning the camera, etc).  I love the camera so much that I'm tempted to buy the same one all over again---as long as it breaks within 2 years, I'll be fine :)  Most likely I'll upgrade to a newer Canon model---again, as I said, while it worked it was a wonderful camera, easy to use, easy to upload photos via the USB port of my PC, and with my Viking expansion memory card, stored a bunch of photos.
