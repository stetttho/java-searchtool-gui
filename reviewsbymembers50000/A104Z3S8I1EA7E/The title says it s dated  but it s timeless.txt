 I hadn't realized I forgot to review this book. I teach VB at the university level, and have used this book as well. In my opinion, it's one of the best VB books ever written.  I use Peter Wright's Beginning Visual  Basic book for my Introduction classes, and use the second part of Peter's  book along with the Revolutionary Guide to VB for the Intermediate and  Advanced courses.  This book has indepth coverage on Database, OLE  Automation (now called ActiveX Automation), and has a pretty detailed  application that is developed throughout. The title may scare you a bit,  but I still think for the price, this book is a bargain, and can really  help you get a grasp on some of the more complicated VB mechanisms.
