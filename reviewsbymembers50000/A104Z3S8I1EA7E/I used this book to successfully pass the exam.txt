 I used this book to prepare for the VB.Net (70-306) Certification exam and I think it's a good one. The book gives you a great roadmap to Certification--showing you (with almost perfect accuracy) what's on the exam and giving you just enough information to properly prepare. Don't use this book to learn VB.Net--that's not what it's for. But use it, in conjunction with a good study group (such as one of mine) and an exam simulator such as Transcender, to understand the breadth of knowledge required to pass the exam. The book breaks the major objectives of the exam into sections that it then deals with chapter by chapter. The author's knowledge is obvious--and what I really liked about the book is that he doesn't waste a lot of time trying to impress you with hard to follow code examples.  The code examples, for the most part, are short and sweet---and he follows these up with multiple Step-By-Step exercises interspersed throughout the chapter, and several follow up exercises to complete on your own. In addition, each chapter has a Self Test section that has some excellent exam type questions to further test your knowledge. As I indicated, I used this book to successfully prepare for the exam---it's the best one on the market that I've seen. Of course, every book has some minor glitches--I've compiled a list of errata and posted it on my website here http://www.johnsmiley.com/mybooks/0789728192/errata.htm John Smiley
