 I loved the movie! I have never seen it before and the pleasure of having a DVD with my sound system made it better then the movies!  The quality is unbelievable and the deleted scenes were great!  There were so  many extras in the movie like the delted scenes and you find out why some things are red (there is a reason) and all this other great stuff.   I would definitely recomend this DVD.
