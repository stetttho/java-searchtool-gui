 This is one of my all-time favourite films, and I don't normally watch many foreign films. If you want to pick a foreign film to get a taste of what might be on offer than the usual English/American style, this is a good place to start. It's deeply French, deeply meaningful, and deeply haunting and beautiful. It's themes of renewal, hope, betrayal and fate are as old as the quaint French limestone hills upon which it is based. The style may be slow for some, but the depth of the characters, the realism of the story, and the tragic unfolding of the narrative will undoubtedly inspire more thoughtful viewers.  The film is only the first part of an unfolding story, which concludes in Manon de Sources (Manon of the Spring). As a whole the story is well rounded, true to life and deeply fulfilling. The writer Pagnol, is widely recognised as a genuis, the director and the actors/actresses reputations preceed them. This film does them justice. Be prepared for a moving and well-written experience, and don't miss the astonishing unfolding of revenge and hope in the sequel. A truly inspiring work, well adapted to film. The book also is a great read-The Water of the Hills.
