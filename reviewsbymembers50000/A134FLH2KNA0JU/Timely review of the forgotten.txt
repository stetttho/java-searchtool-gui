 As with much else of western culture and history, the role and importance of exceptional women in science throughout the ages has been, sadly, under-appreciated. This book seeks to address this point. Their  achievements have been even more remarkable when one considers the  male-dominated societies in which many of them lived. Hypatia herself was a  magnificent scientist, as were many others, sadly under-represented in many  historical analyses. Hopefully in the future, with our growing awareness of  our societys' inherited irrational and unfair bias towards women, anyones  place in the history and future of science will become what it should  always have been, as scientists, irrespective of gender.
