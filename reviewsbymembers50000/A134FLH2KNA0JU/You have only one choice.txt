 I have only one thing to say: "You have only one choice, one of you- must buy the director's cut- with an extra 30 minutes of film, forget all the pricey distractions in deluxe sets on the way, and cast it into your DVD player for 3 1/2 hours of pure entertainment. All other options are usless, as we cannot use them".
