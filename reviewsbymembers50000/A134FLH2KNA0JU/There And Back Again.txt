 Want to know the background to the Lord of the Rings? Want to know how Bilbo Baggins really got his magic ring? Want to know more about Hobbits? Look no further. The Hobbit is a delightful book about Bilbo Baggins' journey with 13 dwarves to recover their lost riches beneath the Lonely Mountain, taken by Smaug the dragon. Encouraged by Gandalf the wizard, he sets off with 13 dwarves on a quest to recover the hidden treasure beneath the mountain. On the way he has many adventures, including finding a magical golden ring which makes him invisible-not bad in hiding from enemies! He also meets wood elves in the forest of Mirkwood, fights wolves and giant spiders, is rescued by giant eagles, and finally returns home with his share of the dragon's treasure. One of the best chapters is where he finds the ring beneath the Misty mountains, and has to win a riddling game with Gollum to get out of the deep caves where he is lost.  It's written mainly for children around the 10 year range, but older readers will find a refreshing tale of hobbits, dwarves, elves, men and wizardy; courage and light-heartedness, and learn much about the background to the Lord of the Rings as well. If you intend to read all of J.R.R.Tolkien's books, you should probably read this one first, as it was the first to be published, and is set just before the events of the Lord of the Rings take place. It isn't too long, and is almost certainly going to be made into a feature film eventually, after the Lord of the Rings is finished screening I'd say. Oh, and one more thing, the best edition is definitely the illustrated edition by Tolkien artist Alan Lee-his artistry is exquisite!
