 Despite being originally rejected by numerous publishers, this book has become widely recognised as a classic of the modern era. One doesn't win the Nobel Prize for literature because of ones lack of insight. Cuts deep  into the heart and spirit of man, at times revealing a side of us all that  we don't really wish to see. Recommended for those who wish to obtain a  deeper understanding of the human condition.
