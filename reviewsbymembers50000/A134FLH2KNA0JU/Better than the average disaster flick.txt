 In short: exploding volcanoes, lava, falling ash, excellent special effects, simple story. Fun, and invigorating. In length: This film interested me on two levels. Firstly, as a geologist who daily studies volcanic textures and rocks, and secondly, I happen to like the western United sates. I was pleasantly surpised by the film, although at times succumbing to the usual Hollywood predictablility, it does occassionally incorporate some good science, and some ok script.  The viewer will learn several things about volcanoes in this movie. First not all 'extinct' volcanoes are extinct. Second, they often give seismic warnings, as magma rises from depth, of an impending eruption. The trouble is always predicting the exact timing, likelihood, and magnitude of an event. There are places in the world, in South America, Indonesia, New Guinea, possibly New Zealand and the USA, and many others, where towns really should not be situated. Evacuation, livelihood, tourism, and real estate prices are real social concerns amongst people living in such areas throughout the world, as the people of Pompey, Mt Pelee, and many others, were they still around, would like to tell you. Eruptions can be very explosive, and wipe out adjacent towns even some distance away. Studies of past eruptions can give clues to likely effects from future ones. People living today in some parts of Oregon and Washington state will tell you that it is only recently that some have found that certain towns are built on ancient lava flows from still active volcanoes. Not so nice to know!  Science is fun, informative, interesting, and economically important. The US geological survey is not full of bearded old rock doctors, with little to do. Some of them have very enviable jobs, with an important role. These are the sorts of things that viewers will learn from this film, along with all of the excellent special effects.
