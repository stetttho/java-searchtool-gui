 This was one of my most favourite childhood books. I still have a copy that is about 30 years old, safely stowed in my library.  The book lists attributes of various land and marine creatures ranging from the smallest, to the biggest; from the slowest to the fastest; from the lowest dwellers in the sea, to the highest living in the mountains; from the deepest swimmers, to the fastest runners, the biggest jumpers, the highest fliers, and the widest roamers.  The book includes some of the smallest land animals (eg flea- 1/4 inch), to some of the biggest (eg Kodiak bear- 10 feet), with sea creatures including giant squid (to 20 feet), and blue whales (to 100 feet). The Yak climbs to above 20,000 feet, the bar- headed goose flies up to 28,000 feet, the sperm whale dives to 1500 feet, the gulper lives at 38,000 feet, the swift flies to 200 mph, the cheetah runs up to 70 mph, the sailfish swims up to 68 mph, the lemur leaps to 35 feet wide, the dolphin to 18 feet high, and so on.  A great book for young kids to learn facts about animals in the world, illustrated with colour pictures for each.
