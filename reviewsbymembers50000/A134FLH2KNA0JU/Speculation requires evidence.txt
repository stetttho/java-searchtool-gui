 The trouble with this book is that many of its hypotheses lie purely in the realm of speculation, and not in the realm of empirical evidence. Suggesting that males and females parted in evolutionary history, to take one of many examples, requires some empirical justification. It is a nice story, but where lieth the evidence? I could just as well suggest that we received an evolutionary kick from the stars, the trouble is, Von Daniken notwithstanding, and the attractiveness of this idea as expressed in 2001 a space odyssey, there just isn't any evidence for it as yet. Bold ideas require bold evidence. I have no trouble with attempting to incorporate various relgious tendancies into human evolution, as it it obvious that 'religion' has played a significant part in our development. But as yet its origins are obscure. More research needs be done in this area, as others have noted that there is indeed a case for defining ourselves as 'homo religiosis' (religious man), not homo sapien (wise man). There is little doubt that religious tendancies have their origin in biological forces, but they are nevertheless very obscure and complicated. This book doesn't seem to shed much light.  I laud the attempt to intergrate 'religious tendancies' to human evolution, I just don't think this particular book has much in the way of empirical support to be worth spending too much time fussing about.
