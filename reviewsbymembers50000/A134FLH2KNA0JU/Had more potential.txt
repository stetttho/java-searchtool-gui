 I was a trifle disappointed with this film. Ocassionally these sorts of arty farty movies are outstanding, occassionaly they are so-so, and sometimes they are a flop. This fits in the middle for me, with the following reasons.  The idea was first class. A mathematical recluse, highly intelligent, with an existential existance, serching for a pattern to the stockmarket, and the natural world at large. He is ever so close to a complex formula he believes is the basis not only for the stockmarket, but for much of nature. The world has patterns, the language of nature is math, or so he believes. He has brief encounters with numerological sects, who somehow find out about him, and corporate thuggery, who want to steal his formulas for the stockmarket. (These experiences incidentally don't do a great deal with his tendancy to paranioa).  But although these ideas are very good, the film never gets off the ground. The encounters with religious sects could have been done with more subtlety, and developed more carefully. People who encounter religious-like sects don't usually do so with all bells ringing, usually one is drawn in deep before the reality manifests itself (eg Eyes Wide Shut). The corporate thugs also aren't stupid, they needed to be portrayed more deceptively, and developed more carefully. The film overall has little structure, even though these ideas themselves are very good.  And where is the escapist music? Where is the dreaming peace of the paraniod recluse? And the film needn't have been all dark; contrast light with dark, and the dark becomes more potent, and more meaningful.  Arty movie, great ideas, but could have been so much better.
