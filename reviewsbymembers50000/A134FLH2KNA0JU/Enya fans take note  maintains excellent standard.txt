 Lets cut through all the dross. You want to know if the new Enya CD is as good as all the others. In a word, yes.  You want to know if Enya's music is losing its originality and freshness. No, it isn't.  You want to know if there is new inspiration and new themes to explore in this work. Yes, there is.  You want to know if it is worth buying. Yes, it is.  It is as good and as fresh and as new as when the first Enya CD came out. This one explores new themes of freedom and reflection, and is even slightly rebellious in parts-the second track "Wild Child" especially I think is sure to please all the melancholy dreamers out there.  Excellent, and lives up to reputation. Buy it!
