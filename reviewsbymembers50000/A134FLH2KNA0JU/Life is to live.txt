 This review is an attempt to bring to mind many of the deeply invigorating and inspiring themes this film adresses. This is a story of young men in private boarding education, discovering life. Sounds mundane, but it isn't. The real strength in this film is that it doesn't leave 'heroic tales' to the 'heroic past', it brings heroic ideals and potential to the life of everyday students in modern society. Every student is special, every student is capable of special things, and perhaps most of all, every student is capable of happiness and true freedom. We ourselves are heroes, we ourselves can make the future beautiful.  What is poetry? Is it a quaint little way of expressing words and ideas suited to the old or the quiet types? No, it is life, it is the expression of the soul, the heart and expression of the struggle for independance, freedom and happiness. "So it is about a bunch of guys standing around reading poetry", asks one of the students? No, they didn't 'read it', they were themselves the embodiment of it, they were life itself finding itself young and beautiful. The 'dead poets' refers, I believe, to the death of mediocrity, the birth of substance and freedom of the free. The motto is simple, sieze the day, sieze the time, live life in beauty and grandeur, die to mediocrity, and express all of who you are. Wise words. The trouble is, some will not like you for it, in rare cases you may die for it. This film captures many of the passions and the troubles young people of all ages experience, but importantly, it also manages to put these passions and troubles in the social sphere of modern young humanity. It gives some answers to difficult issues. As so many poets have done. Tragic yet beautiful, thy name is humanity.
