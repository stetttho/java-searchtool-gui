 This is an exceptional piece of spiritually uplifting music. I happen to like music that takes one into the realm of the mysterious, the enchanted, the beautiful; where souls find peace amidst our very deepest yearnings,  and escape into spiritual journeys and forgotten cultures.  Having said  that, this CD for me is quite something, fulfilling the above in more ways  than many, including other pieces of Loreena McKerrits music. I know people  mostly like to write only about pieces of music which they like, but for me  this is something well beyond the ordinary.  It holds a consistent theme  through the individual pieces, while being able, at times, to entice the  soul into new and fulfiling adventures. I love the old celtic cultures,  and in general people today have come to recognise that some of the old  celtics'cultures best treasures, both in ancient and recent times, was, and  is, in its' music. And the beauty of this, is that music doesn't die or  pass away, but speaks to us across yearning gulfs of time and place, and  allows us to feel something of those who live in forests of ancient Europe  aoens ago.  For me, this CD gives me both great hope, and great  fulfilment. If this is the kind of music that people are capable of, if  this is the kind of stirrings that reside within us, then at least for me,  it renews my faith and my love of both ancient celtic culture and humanity  in general. Thoroughly recommended for those who like deep and haunting  music, and for those who wish to explore the inner depths of both their own  souls, and the souls of those in different times, and different worlds, who  have gone before.
