 For those who want to understand and explore what science is discovering regarding what makes people sometimes nice to each other, and sometimes not, this book is for you. You'll need a bit of courage, this book is  pretty heavy going, but well worth the effort.  I think parts of Ridleys  analysis are close to genius, others a bit watery, especially towards the  end. Nevertheless a good expose of (more or less) current thinking on game  theory, motivation, evolutionary theory, and what we describe as 'virtue'.  Remarkable insights.
