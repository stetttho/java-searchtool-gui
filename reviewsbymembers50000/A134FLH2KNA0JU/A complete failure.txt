 This film is, in a word, pathetic. It is also all the more disappointing after the soulful vitality of the original. It reeks of corporate theft and slick marketing ploys, which have tried to steal the unstealable heart and soul of the original, and then sell it off for a cheap price to the ignorant. You can't take the inspired creativity of an original and manufacture it into some kind of old-age substitute. Like a bunch of geriatrics banjo players standing round trying to entertain some teenyboppers at a police club rock concert, this film just doesn't work.  The only good scene for me was the opening scene, when Dan Akroyd waits patiently on the side of the road for his long deceased brother to come pick him up after getting out of jail. It goes down from there, after about 5 minutes.  You can't buy freedom and good hearty rebellious souls. You can't buy the inspiration of deep south soul music, and you can't buy the things which The Blues Brothers were in the original. Don't you blaspheme, my names Bob and this here is my place, where we play both kinds of music, country AND western, so get the licence plate of that car, have an orange soda, and don't pick me up the day I get out of jail in a police car! Don't you blaspheme! And as for you marketing experts, I am just going to write that check on the dash of my car.... Soul music, rebellion, the 'mission', and freedom are things which return in a regathering of old rock bands only, and only  when they aren't made to fulfill the agenda of yuppie executives who don't have a clue what the original film was about.
