 This is an entertaining compilation of some famous, and some not-so-famous, movie blunders. Mr Sandys has collected thousands of 'movie mistakes' from a variety of sources, mostly from keen internet users, and with some diligent checking, has lead to this good summary of various movie goofs.  The book is divided into various categories such as the all-time most popular mistakes (as voted on his website), visible crew, things that move that shouldn't (such as the dead), instantly changing weather, and the like. Some gems include wristwatches in 19th century Africa, visible land in the open ocean, actors knocking into doorframes, gas cylinders in ancient Rome, animals which don't care for directors ambitions, kids who cover their ears when a gunshot is coming, and the like. Its amusing, varied, painstakingly compiled and checked, and generally good fun.  Its not meant to be a criticism of various movies, just a lighthearted look at various movie goofs. If you have a DVD you can easily check some of the mistakes listed herein, although in recent years, wise editors have deleted some of the worst mistakes from DVD releases.  I have checked about 100 mistakes that interested me, and I have found that most of the time Mr Sandys and his horde of internet compilers are right, although I have found the odd 'mistake' amongst the listed mistakes, so to speak, at least in my opinion. But never mind about splitting hairs, most of the mistakes listed here are the more obvious and less contentious ones. Movie editors aren't perfect, and neither are mistake spotters!. Its lighthearted, entertaining, and recommended for movie buffs, not to be taken too seriously. There is a good website also with much more detail, which gets quite a bit of traffic.
