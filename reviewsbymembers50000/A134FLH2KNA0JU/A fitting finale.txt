 For those who want a review but not be told much about what happens-here it is. You want to read it yourself, so I won't give much away-not like a friend of mine who told me just how Sauron was defeated! Don't worry I won't do that! Of the three books it is probably the most hopeful and the brightest, although it certainly doesn't start that way. Characters- especially Merry, Pippin, Frodo, Sam and Aragorn, as well as Eowyn and Faramir and Denethor, come into their own. There are cameos from Elrond, Arwen (who will surely get a lot more place in the film), and a host of new characters, new uglies, and new suprises thrown in. The Battle of Minas Tirith is really detailed, and will feature prominently in the upcoming film in 2003, to be sure. Tolkien fans will also be waiting with anticipation for such images as Mount Doom erupting on the big screen. One of the more interesting parts for me is towards the end in the "Scouring of the Shire"-a suprise thrown in by Mr Tolkien with some ingenuity. It brings evil back into the homelands of the hobbits, which they must defeat for themselves.  When you finish it's on to "the Hobbit", if you haven't read it already, and then "the Silmarillion" if you're really keen. Good luck!
