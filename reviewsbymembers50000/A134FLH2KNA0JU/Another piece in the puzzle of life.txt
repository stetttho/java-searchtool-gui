 This is an excellent overview of current scientific discovery and argument regarding that inheritently common, but innately variable blueprint of 23 pairs of chromosones we all share.  Our knowledge of our genes is progressing at a rapid rate, so much so, that by the time I finish writing  this sentence, our knowledge of the human genetic code has been updated. If  you wish to know what kinds of things are being discovered, this book is a  very good place to find it. Matt Ridley devotes each chapter to one of  our chromosones-23 in all, and describes some useful dicoveries and  speculations regarding each. From such things as the ability to digest  lactose, blood groups, cancer suppressors, 'instinct',intelligence, ethics,  free will, allergies, aspects of language, ageing, sex, cloning, test tube  babies, Mad Cow disease etc, he describes in a clever and clear way the  discoveries being made in the field.  I would give the book 4 1/2  stars,(but there are no halves in these reviews), as no book is ever  perfect, but a point to remember is no understanding of our world, or our  genes themselves, is ever perfect either. But we can find pieces to the  puzzle, useful and uplifting, and that is what this book is about.    Ridleys style is clear and clever, my only quibble is that he displays  perhaps just a touch of arrogance, and a subtle air of bias. But give the  author his due, an author is entitled to his opinions and leanings, what is  important is that he generally makes it clear when he does so.  The book  is highly recommended for both those familiar with the jargon, and those  with enthusiastic minds who wish to learn about it.
