 I first read The Call of the Wild when I was 11, and it had a profound effect on me. I loved the story, the adventure, the romance of the wilderness, and the themes of hope and the struggle for survival in the  wilds of Alaska. The book is mainly written for the young, but adults  will find something refreshing, true to life, and escapist in the book.   Set in the goldrush days of the late 1800s to early 1900s, it is the  story of a stolen dog (Bucks') experiences in the Alaskan wilderness, and  his struggle for survival and for dominance amongst the huskies and  half-breeds of the sled dogs in the extremes of the northern wilderness.  The story is harrowing, but ultimately delightful, encouraging young  readers to imagine, to feel, and to be inspired to search for adventure and  meaning.   Another book by Jack London is White Fang, which is very  similar, so those who like this book might consider reading this  also. Recommended for those who like dogs and dog adventure stories, the  Alaskan wilderness, the goldrush days, and those with a spirit of  adventure-especially the young, but also the young in spirit.
