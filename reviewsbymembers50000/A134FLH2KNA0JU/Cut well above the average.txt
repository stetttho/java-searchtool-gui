 This is an excellent buy for natural science enthusiasts. It has been  arranged in splended fashion, with large scale maps, great illustrations,  and more and less detailed sections of text-depending on the tastes of the  reader, in different sections of the book. It contains beautifully coloured  palaeogeographic maps of the contintents (eg if you are one of those people  who likes to know where Alaska was on the earth 250 million years ago), and  a fairly detailed notes and reference section at the back, where historical  outlines, scientific debates, stories, glossary, biological, and other  technical information is discussed. There is descriptions throughout of  famous fossils, fossil sites, major historic finds, scientific debates, the  origin of life, the Burgess Shale, the ediacra fauna, the Cambrian  explosion, dinosaurs, mammals and their origins, birds and their evolution,  the K-T and other mass extinction events,the rise of the hominids, the ice  ages, and so on.   The authors have done a really 1st class job in  packing in so much information, arranged in a way that can be understood  and perused according to the tastes of the reader. Not to mention the  fantastic illustrations/and or real photographs-from in situ-stegosaur  fossil finds, to early Cambrian Hallucegenia, to T rex skeletons, to giant  kangaroos, to mammoths being dug out of the Russian steppes, to Mongolian  dinosaur eggs, to Hominid illustrations on the African savannah.  A  fantastic book, one well above the average 'atlas'-type compilation, for  both scientists and the general reader.
