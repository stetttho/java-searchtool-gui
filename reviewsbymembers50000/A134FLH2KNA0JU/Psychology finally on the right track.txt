 This is a review from a visiting UFO, and we are pleased to find that the science of the mind on your planet has finally understood that your species  mind has evolved! Isn't it obvious that things like pregancy sickness,  religion, emotions, gambling etc etc have a biological basis, and which  have been selected for and developed over time? We wish you well on you  endeavours to understand your species minds in terms of evolutionary  theory, but we must say it's about time. (PS Incidentally don't think all  the answers are there yet, but at least you are now on the right  track....).
