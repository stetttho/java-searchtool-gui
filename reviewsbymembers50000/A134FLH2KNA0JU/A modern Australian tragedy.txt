 This is an insightful, but ultimately sad, true story of modern Australian culture. It is set in a most bizarre university college in Australia in the 1990s. The story is one of reckless youth, trust, power structures, farce and betrayal. In it Dr Cameron has captured something quintessentially Australian and contemporary.  It is the story of an exceptionally gifted man, holding an important and ultimately symbolic position, over a period of five years as the Principle of an apparently unremarkable university college in Sydney. But the reader, like the author, is soon exposed to a rather alarming expose of modern youth culture. The casual, somewhat inauspicious beginning soon develops into an embroiling series of events; heated debates,'carpark conspiracies', the recklessness and idealism of youth, and the like; laced with side excursions, charming anecdotes, and insightful caricatures. But I can't find the words to properly convey my feeling of this books intensity, diversity, and worth, or the overall respect that I have for the author himself.  Dr Camerons charming style and eloquence speaks volumes over those with whom he had cause for argument, and whom ultimaltey caused his sad and ultimately 'resignation'. This is a story with deserves to be told, and it is told by someone with an extraordinary gift for the telling. Not for the faint of heart or mind, but a truly great and timely book nonetheless.
