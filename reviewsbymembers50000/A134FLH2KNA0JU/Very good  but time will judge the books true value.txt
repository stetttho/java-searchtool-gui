 The book discusses much of the usual very good sociobiology of Mr Wilson, intergrated with extensive philosophical excursions; the central theme being harmony, or consilience of knowledge, and the value this brings. It  is not easy going, so one would have to be prepared for this kind of thing  to get through it, and in that sense the book is primarily for those who  are, intellectually speaking, the co-ordinators, the administrators, those  who attempt to harmonise thought and people, rather than 'divide and  conquer'. If you feel you are of this type, this book is for you.   Someone else has described this book as "Wilsons Impossible  Dream", and I guess I probably agree. His fundamental thesis is the  consilience of knowledge, that is, societys institutional and traditional  structures are predisposed to encouraging divergance of thought, with  little to encourage convergance, or consilience. I think it may be possible  for a paradigm shift to alleviate some of the faults fruitful divergance  brings, but it is not going to be easy to bring this about. He does have a  strong point in arguing that for too long independent disciplines,  especially between the humanities and natural sciences, have been just  that, independent. He thinks one way to alleviate this is to use the  growing understanding evolutionary theory is bringing to the humanities as  a means of harmony-a good idea. What he basically confronts is the  limitations of human nature itself-still that isn't cause for being  tentative, it's just that it is going to be difficult to achieve. Maybe the  times are right, societies may be in such positions in history to do such  things. Consequently, historians may be rather interested in this book  also.  Mr Wilsons reputation in the international academic community is  very highly regarded. It may be that he is a true visionary, only time will  tell.
