 This is an excellent true story about a part of our existance which has not been investigated all that much in modern literature.  Into the Wild is a story of a young man (Chris McCandless) who wished to embark on some  thoroughly testing and meaningful adventures in the North American  wilderness, which is what any average backpacker wishes to do, except that  Chris McCandless wished to take this adventurous reckless abandon to its  strongest possible extreme. It is a most remarkable story, meticulously  researched, full of mystery and intrigue, and a must for adventurers of the  wilderness, both young and old. There are also several other thoroughly  intriguing true stories of 'wilderness seekers' in the book. What is it  which motivates those who abandon 'normal life' and seek to obtain a deeper  fulfilment in such things as the wildness of nature? Are those who seek a  deeper understanding of their own natures and yearnings to be seen as  'foolish idealistic wanderers' and such like? Where is the line between  reckless abandonment and truely testing adventure?  A life unexamined is  not worth living Socrates said, and some would argue that we can't have  truly examined ourselves unless we have thoroughly tested ourselves amongst  such things as the wildness of nature. This book is a timely examination of  these ideas, and a must for all those who are touched by wilderness, for  all those adventerous in spirit and in heart, and for those who wish to  obtain a deeper understanding of their own natures, the wilderness, and  their place within it.
