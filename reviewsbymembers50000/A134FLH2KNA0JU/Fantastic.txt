 Tolkien's world is one which continues to inspire, educate, and touch people all over the world. It is a most unusual piece of work. What I have cherished most over the years from Tolkien's works is the understanding it  gives of the human spirit. People who have dismissed it as "idle  fantasy", as "useless" and/or "boring", really  miss the point. It is about the very depths of our existance, our  yearnings, our dreams, and our deep-seated fantasies. And it is also about  our character, both good and evil. "Dreaming" is not an idle  waste of time, nor is an understanding of our nature "boring". A  mythical/fantasy world reveals much about our own, real world, and often  gives us new meaning about what it means to live, to experience, to feel,  to laugh, to lose, and to die. These are  the very purposes and nature of  myth and fantasy. Many ancient cultures have myths or "dreaming"  as a very important part of their existance, and Tolkiens world fulfils  much the same role.  It will continue to educate, to fulfill, and inspire  new dreams and new hopes for some time to come.
