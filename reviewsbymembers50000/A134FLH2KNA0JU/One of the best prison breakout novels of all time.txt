 Don't be put off by the recent "out of print" status, this book is a great true story of a prison breakout in WW2. You can also easily pick it up through Amazons second hand bookstores for a relatively cheap  price. Written by the escapee himself, it retains all its charm and  spirit since it first received rave reviews in the late 1940s to early  1950s. The breakout came from a novel, yet brilliant idea inspired by the  Legend of the Trojan Horse- ie to use a gym vaulting horse as cover to hide  an inmate who dug a tunnel to the nearest concentration camp fence. It  succeeded, but I won't ruin the story with all the details, you will have  to read it yourself! Rest assured the book is well written, and as it is  told by one of the escapees himself it has a certain charm, readability and  authenticity about it.  Getting out was just the first part, the escapees  still had to travel across most of Germany to reach home, right amidst the  heartlessness and desparation of WW2. I found the description of the lives  of everyday German people within a major war as soulful, revealing and  harrowing as the concentration camp itself.  A remarkable story, a great  and uplifting novel, sure to inspire for many years to come. No mundane  "political correctness" here, truthfully told and recorded with  all the desperation, fear, and courageous spirit of many involved in the  war-on both sides.  There was a film also made in the 1960s I think,  which was almost as good as the book, but not quite. Of similar genre to  The Wooden Horse is "the Great Escape", also made into a film,  but the Wooden Horse is more realisitic and better done overall in my  opinion. Uplifts the spirit.
