 I really like this kind of music. This CD is much like the Floating into the Night CD, and the Twin Peaks soundtrack, so if you liked any of those you will like this one. I particularly liked the first piece, the next few,  and the last few. Can anyone inform me of any music they know which is like  these pieces?  Enchanting spiritual romantic music.
