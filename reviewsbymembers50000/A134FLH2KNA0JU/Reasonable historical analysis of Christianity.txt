 Douglas Lockhart attempts to critically analyse the origin and development of "Christianity" from an objective viewpoint, and appears to  shed light on some of the conumdrums which scholars have troubled over for  many years. Don't expect an unthinking biased appraisal of Christianity,  nor a conventional and mundane interpretation of the development of this  complex sect of Judaism of the 1st century AD. I was impressed with the  intergration and recognition of gnostic thought with early theology, as  this has not been adequately recognised in the past.  Also important was  the emphasis on much within Christianity which has always been of a  political nature, in addition to the normal failings of human beings to  properly understand the nature of the truth, goodwill to others and  whatever this sect of Judaism ever had that was any good, much of which has  been changed and lost over time. The book comes closer to understanding the  nature and purpose of Christianity than many others of its type.
