 Michener was drawn to stories of the Klondike gold rush whilst researching material for his voluminous Alaska, and thought this story, set dominantly in Canada, too good not to publish.  It is a fictional story of a few  gold seekers of the Klondike gold rush, and seeks to capture the romance,  the exhilaration, the recklessness, and the overall madness of the time. It  is an invigorating adventure story, however if I had just one quibble, the  characters for me were a little one dimensional, and the story told in a  less complex manner than it probably deserved.  Nevertheless a thoroughly  enjoyable expose of the spirit of adventure, capturing much that is part of  the northern spirit of romantic escapism and self discovery.
