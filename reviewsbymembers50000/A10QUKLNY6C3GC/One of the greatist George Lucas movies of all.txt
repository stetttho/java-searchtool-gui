 From the creator of Star Wars comes Willow which does have some feeling to Star Wars, but is a lot more fun and appealing. The story starts off with the birth of an infant who will bring upon the downfall of an evil queen. When the queen learns of this prophecy, the baby is abandoned, and discovered by young Willow Ufgood(Warwick Davis), a farmer who is an inspiring sorcereer. With time running out, Willow must soon embark on a quest to protect the child from the queen. With the aid of a great swordsman(Val Kilmer), Willow races against time in this very appealing adventure for all ages. Granted the story does have some feeling of a J.R.R. Tolkien novel, but the charm and appeal it has could be told none other than from George Lucas who is both a story-teller, and a old-fashioned movie buff! The movie also has the greatist James Horner(Titanic) musical score of all. A must for all fantasy or action buffs.
