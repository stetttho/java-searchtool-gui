 Since he's become so popular as Anakin Skywalker(the future Darth Vader) in "Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones," and since he's making a wise move not to be type-cast in the role, Hayden Christensen gives a very believable if not touching performance with this movie. Sam(Christensen) is a troubled teen who's being forced by his dad(Kevin Kline) to help him build a house, and in the process rebuild their troubled relationship. The movie is indeed very touching, and Kline and Christensen have excellent chemistry with their performances. Granted it's not a great film because of its content, but still it is very touching, and uplifting. Congradulations on your performance with this movie Hayden. I'm sure your career will take you far in years to come.
