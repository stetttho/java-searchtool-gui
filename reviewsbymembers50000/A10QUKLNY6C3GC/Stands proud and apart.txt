 The sequel to the first "Star Wars" stands proud and apart, and is very fast-paced, fun, & takes no prisoners (well, at least they are carbonfrozen). As Princess Leia and Han Solo become more close, Luke skywalker continues his jedi training under Yoda. However, Dart Vader and Emperor Palpatine are desperate to turn Luke to the dark side, and finish off the Rebellion once and for all. Fun movie for all ages.
