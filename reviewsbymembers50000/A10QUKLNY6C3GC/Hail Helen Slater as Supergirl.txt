 I really did enjoy this movie even though like many have said there are holes in it! Slater is beautiful and brilliant in this movie! She could truly bring a great sense of determination and innocent curiousity of her surroundings as Supergirl! I wished though the story could have been done better because she probably would have made more sequels, and be typecast forever as Supergirl! Well, what am I saying she already is! Even though the characters could have been created a lot more better(Dunaway as a true example), you can't help but enjoy them, and be entertained!
