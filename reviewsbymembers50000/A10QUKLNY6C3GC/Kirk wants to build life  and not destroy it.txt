 The fourth book in Shatner's "Star Trek" series is just as good as "The Ashes of Eden," and "The Return!" A story that is a sequel to the classic episode "Mirror, Mirror" (as well as the mirror-universe episodes on "Deep Space Nine") Even after Kirk has admitted that the federation doesn't need his help anymore, and that he may spend the rest of his life with his true love Teilani(a beautiful woman who's made him a better man in my opinion), deep down am inner part of him wants to be a hero once more! Although he's denied it to Teilani, she encourages him to back out into the universe again!     Eventually, this leads to another encounter with the Mirror Universe Spock & Katherynn Janeway (the captain of "Star Trek: Voyager") who needs Kirk's help to straighten things out due to his first encounter! Soon, things go from bad to worse when Teilani is kidnapped, and Kirk must reunite Ambassador Spock, Admiral McCoy, and Scotty to get her back! Look for Captain Picard, and the "Next Generation" crew along for this adventure!     Keep the adventures coming Bill Shatner!
