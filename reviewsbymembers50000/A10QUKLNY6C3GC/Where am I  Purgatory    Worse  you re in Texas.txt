 Those 2 lines to this movie are classic from both Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock who had great chemistry as the 2 hit men. But the rest of the movie really shines because of Renee Zellwegger's performance. I mean I fell in love with her totally in her performance as Betty: a young, charming, beautiful woman who's inspiring to be a nurse, and who's in love with a soap opera doctor. After her husband is brutally killed in her living room, and I mean brutally, the shock changes Betty into thinking she needs to get back with her ex-fiance(the soap opera doctor). This leads Betty to going out to Hollywood, and unknowingly carrying stolen goods the hit men are after. Very funny movie all the way, but it is a dark film as well. Still this is one of Renee's best movies of all. There is doubt to her beauty and her charm which really shines through with evey movie she does. She makes you fall in love with her instantly.
