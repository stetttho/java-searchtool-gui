 Guys like Danny Glover don't die on toilets in the Lethal movies because it wouldn't be the same without him and Mel Gibson! The boys come back for another round in this excellent sequel! When you bring in the comic relief of Joe Pesci as Leo Getz ("Whatever you need, Leo gets! Get it?"), and some nasty South African Diplomats hiding behind Diplomatic Immunity, then you got a very good "Weapon" which really does top the first movie! Mel and Danny have really good chemistry together, and that shows out a lot with their portrayals of Riggs and Murtaugh! However, the movie can have it's really dark-sides (in terms of what happens to Patsy Kinset's character) that really make you sore! However, moments like this in the movie later become justified, and you can't wait for the 2 wacky cops to come back for another sequel! A really great movie alltogether!
