 Which is very much the case now that Star Wars has made the leap into DVD! Still you could have wished to have seen the deleted scenes in the movie when it was out in theaters to begin with! Probably would have softened the blow the critics gave it! Still that is what DVD's really are all about, and this one is very special indeed. While taking us into the making of film, we also got to see the theatrical trailers (the teaser I liked the most), as well as interviews with the cast and crew. Now in terms of the story and the characters themselves, I really did like the story format, and how Anakin Skywalker begins his road to the dark side of the force. It does mimic the other Star Wars movies, but in a way it makes you really think of the paths these characters have or will take. It's also very much the case of what George Lucas would have done with the previous movies, if he had the digital technology back then. Ultimately, "The Phantom Menace" really does stand proud, and apart. I can't wait to review "Attack of the Clones" when it arrives on DVD. A great movie all together!!
