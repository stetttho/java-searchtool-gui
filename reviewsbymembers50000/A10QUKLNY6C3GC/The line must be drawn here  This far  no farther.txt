 And the only hope for the federations survival lies upon Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), and "The Next Generation" crew. The sequel to the popular TNG episode "The Best of Both Worlds" has Picard take his revenge on the Borg(a half-organic and half machine race) who once assimulated him into Locutis of Borg. Led by the evil Borg Queen(played by the beautiful Alice Kridge), the Borg plan to assimilate Earth in the late 21st century. This is around the time where Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell) and his assistant Lily Sloan (Alfre Woodard) plan to make the first warp drive experiment leading to first contact with an alien race(well, lets just say its a very special Star Trek moment). While this movie does borrow from some scary sci-fi films like "Aliens" or "The Terminator," it does show that "The Next Generation" can handle the big screen by themselves. A truly great entry in the Star Trek films. Bravo TNG!!!
