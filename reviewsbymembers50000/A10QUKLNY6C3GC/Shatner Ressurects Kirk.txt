 Many were ultimately grieve-stircken to see Captian Kirk get killed at the end of "Star Trek Generations," but rest assure that Kirk is alive and well even if we don't see him in any new movie or any of the other Star Trek shows! Having made an uneasy alliance, the Borg and the Romulans have brought Kirk back from the dead to kill Captain Jean-Luc Picard! And it falls not only to Ambassador Spock, but the crew of the "Next Generation" as well to stop all chaos from happening! Not only do you have the orignal Star Trek crew teamed up again with the "Next Generation" Shatner also brings in the crew of "Deep Space Nine" as well! Look for Quark and Dr. Bashir in this novel! Not only is the story action-packed, but it also ties up some lose ends with the movies and episodes of Star Trek as well! If you are a die-hard Star Trek fan, then you'll know what I mean when you read this novel! It was a wise move for Shatner to team-up again with co-writers Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens for this novel (look for the trio's wrok in their other novel: "Star Trek: The Ashes of Eden")! Long live William shatner and Captain James Tiberius Kirk!
