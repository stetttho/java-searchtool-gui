 Granted the movie could have been done better, but what made it so wonderful is GOldsmith's beautiful music! Supergirl's Main Theme goes so well that Goldsmith gives you a true sense of daringness and determination which the character bestows to the audience! But Goldsmith blends the innocence of Supergirl very well as she begins to learn of Earth's customs! Somedays, for me at least, the music brings a tear to your eye! Beautiful music!
