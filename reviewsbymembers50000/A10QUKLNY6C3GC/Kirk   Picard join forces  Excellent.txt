 And that was the feeling I had when I went to go see the movie in late 1994. It was indeed a historic moment to have gung-ho Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner the man) teamed with the very strict and strong Captain Jean-Luc Picard(Patrick Stewart, a marvelous Shakespearian actor). When the diabolical Dr. Soran (Malcom McDowell from "The Clockwork Orange") plans a scheme that will bring closer to an energy ribbon known as the Nexus that will include the destruction of the Enterprise, and millions of lives, Picard's only hope is to join forces with Kirk to save the day. A very appealing movie that was a huge milestone for "The Next Generation" cast, and Brent Spiner (the android Data) who steals the movie as his character is given an emotion chip to allow him to be more human! I'm very sure Gene Roddenberry(the creator of Star Trek) would have been very emotional to see both his greatest creations grace the screen so well. I know I was.
