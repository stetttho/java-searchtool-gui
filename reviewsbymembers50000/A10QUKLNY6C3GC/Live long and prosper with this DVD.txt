 Indeed, it is one of the best "Star Trek" movies of all that tells a good story with a very perfect villain! This sequel to the "Space Seed" episode is a perfect vehicle for bringing back Khan(brilliantly played by Ricardo Montalban) to take his revenge on Admiral Kirk(William Shatner: the man!), and the crew of the starship Enterprise! Having been left on the planet Ceti Alpha V by Captain Kirk, Khan is accidently discovered by a federation starship! Soon Khan takes control of the ship, and a very powerful weapon called Genesis, for his plan to finish off  Kirk once and for all. With time running out, it's up to our federation heroes to save the universe! Fast paced, and action-packed, it's a must for any "Star Trek" fan!!!
