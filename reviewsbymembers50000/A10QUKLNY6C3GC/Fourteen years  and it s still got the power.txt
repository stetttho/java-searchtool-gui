 This movie has always been so cool to me since I was a kid because I obviously grew up with "He-Man and the Masters of the Universe" cartoon show, and to have it on DVD is totally awesome! Granted the movie was totally differant from the toyline and cartoon serious, and to me it always borrowed from "Star Wars" in a way too! But then again, director Gary Goddard wanted to give it a realistic kinda gothic look while at the same time make it a great film for all the fans (myself included)! Personally, when I think of this film, it's more closer to what you could really get out of a childhood dream than anything. Dulph Lungren and Frank Langella will always be remembered as He-Man and Skeletor. No one can ever replace their performances! A film for all ages even for the "old" He-Man fans like myself! I just wish they could bring out DVD's for the cartoon episodes someday!
