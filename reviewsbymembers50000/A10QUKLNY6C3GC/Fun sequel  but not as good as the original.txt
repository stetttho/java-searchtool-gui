 I remember going to see it in theaters when I was 9! I thought it was very cool to see the Ghostbusters come back to save the day from Vigo the Carpathian who's spirit resides within a painting, and who is planning "the season of evil" for New York! Even though the tone is more light-hearted than the first film (even with the one great scene with the Statue of Liberty smashing her torch into the huge mold of slime kicks butt), and we are missing the old Elmer Bernstein score (although Randy Eldman's music score was good), "Ghostbusters II" was and still is a good movie for all ages!
