 For anyone who loves traditional country music, and who is a fan of George Strait, then you are advised to watch this very fun movie. This movie was very well made for George Strait(which was motion picture debut) as Dusty Wyatt Chandelor. As Dusty becomes more popular as a country music singer, his manager (Lesley Ann Warren) stages all his tours with smoke, strobe lights, and really loud music to where no one can even see or hear the "real" country artist. To be honest, what Strait's character goes through is more like being in one of Garth Brooks tours which is more rock & rap than it is country. So he decides to ditch it all to go back to his small town roots, and there he falls for the lovely Harley Tucker (Isabell Glasser). A very wonderful movie that has a heart and soul. Thanks for being true to country, Mr. Strait!
