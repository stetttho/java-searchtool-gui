 The conclussion of William Shatner's "Mirror-Universe" trilogy of his "Star Trek" series offers much action, drama, and an ending that does leave the door open for Captain James T. Kirk's next adventure! With more ties to some of the original episodes of "Star Trek," including the one episode "The Paradise Syndrome" which first introduced an alien race know as the preservers, William Shatner reveals more insight to that race with this book, and how it becomes clear that Captain Kirk & Tiberius will both be the catalysts that may cause universal destruction! However, the end of this book is a bit too much to take in with regards to Kirk's personal life, and where it is going! It will make you cry extremely, and if you've read Shatner's other 5 novels, then you'll know what I mean! Still a must for die-hard fans!
