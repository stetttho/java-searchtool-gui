 Having read the first 2 books of Shatner's "Star Trek" novels, I was more than eager to read "Avenger" when it came out 4 years ago! Once again, you have Kirk and Spock back together again (oh but look for 144-year old Admiral McCoy in this novel) along with the "Next Generation" crew to save the Federation from this lethal virus! What Shatner does with this story is go against Gene Roddenberry's theory that by the time period of the 24th Century, poverty, desease, war, and hungar will all be obliterated, and we will all live in a heavenly universe! Not so much the case when you have this group of anarchists trying to prove their point to the Federation by unleashing this virus upon solar systems! Shatner must have had this idea a long time ago, because if you read his novel "Teklords," it's the same type of story-telling and style! But it's still fun to read!      Again, Shatner works with co-writers Judith & Garfield Reeve-Stevens for this book! They truly have clear knowledge of the "Star Trek" universe, and you can see how creative they are with their story-telling! What's more interesting is Kirk's statement in "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier" of how he's always known that he will die alone! Finally, Shatner answers that question with this novel! Also, he re-unites Kirk with Teilani from "The Ashes of Eden!" She is probably the most perfect person in Kirk's life, and the 2 of them are great together in this novel!       Although, we may never see him again on the big-screen or in TV episodes, Shatner keeps Kirk's torch lit with each new novel! Like the saying goes: "To boldly go where no man has gone before!" Keep it up Bill!
