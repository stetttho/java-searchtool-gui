 I actually reviewed the movie on VHS when I bought that copy, but now since I've had my DVD player recently hooked up, I marvel at how really wonderful this movie is! Ever since I was little, Christopher Reeve was and I'm sure is everyone's favorite Superman, and that same feeling applied to Helen Slater as Supergirl! Like Reeve is Superman to all of us, Helen was Supergirl(the very first one also) to all of us! Even though there is the scene with Helen looking at a poster of Chris Reeve, I always wished they could have worked together, and I have to wonder if they have even meet each other personally! Though I grant that the movie should have made more sense to all of us, I for one label it as my all-time favorite movie because scenes were restored totally than on the VHS, and one of my favorites was a scene between Marc McClure and Maureen Teefy who are held captive in Dunaway's castle! I think the DVD special edition added more layer to Slater's character! What's really great was the making of the movie special they included along with the original theatrical trailers! For me, it's like seeing Szwarc's film for the first time, and it's not the first time he got this type of scrutiny! Remember, he directed Chris Reeve in Somewhere in Time! It's funny, the other night, I remember having a dream where this movie came out for a 20th anniversary release, and it looked absolutely beautiful! If this were to have really happened today, it would have been the first time I've seen Helen Slater on the big screen! Thank you Anchor Bay Entertainment for bringing true magic to a truly special movie!
