 And Luke Skywalker comes very much on top of his father in this final installment to the original trilogy. After Luke learns the whole truth that Darth Vader is actually Anakin Skywalker, he has no choice left but to confront the Sith lord to save the Galaxy, and redeem his father before its too late. The battle at the end is so good that it one of the best in the series. Definatley the battle to redeem one's lost soul from the dark side. A pity this was the end with the original characters. Excellent film no matter what.
