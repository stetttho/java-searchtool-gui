 I was a big fan of Helen Slater's ever since "Supergirl," and so I decided to rent this movie! Throughout the whole movie, I was laughing my guts out! All of the cast members including lovely Slater (who's one of the shiest excuse of a kidnapper you could ever ask for) are a great stand-out! I'd like to own this movie someday if it comes out on DVD! I now declare it as one of my all-time favorite movies! I mean these people are so ruthless and wacky you can't help but laugh constantly throughout the whole movie!
