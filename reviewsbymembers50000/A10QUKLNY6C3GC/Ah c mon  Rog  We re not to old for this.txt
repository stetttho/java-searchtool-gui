 Movie #4 has really great kicks to it! This time, Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover) take on a very evil chinese crime lord (Jet Li), and face some domestic crises where Riggs and Cole (Rene Russo) are gonna have a baby and Murtaugh's just learned he's going to be a grandfather for the first time! When you kick this story up a notch with the comic greats of Joe Pesci and Chris Rock, you come out with another great entry in the series! It's really a shame that this movie is rumored to be the last in the series! I personally would love to see the boys come back for another round!
