 I can remember my mom first getting this movie for me when I was about 3 years old, and she told it had Don Knotts & Tim Conway from "The Apple Dumpling Gang" in it! To this day it continues to make me laugh, and it is one of those movies which has withstood the test of time! But with these 2 comedy greats playing the spoofs of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson to solve a murder in a dark haunted mansion, it's a movie every family of any age will treasure! A must for the whole family!
