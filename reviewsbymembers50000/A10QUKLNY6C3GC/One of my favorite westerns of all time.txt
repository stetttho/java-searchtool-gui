 I remeber watching this movie as a little kid, and I thought it was really cool! A story where mexican villagers are in danger of the ruthless Calvara! Their only hope is a group of mercenary gun-fighters to come to their rescue! This was a true proto-type for other action movies to come! Yul Bryner is outstanding as the gun-fighter Chris! Great scenes between him and Eli Wallach's Calvera! An excellent movie!
