 Although the film lacked because of the special effects, and the crude editing, I regard it as one of my favorites in the series! It's great because all the other cast members from the first 2 films come back to reprise such brilliant roles! Christopher Reeve's story idea for the film in regards to nuclear weapons was very interesting, and it's the core of everything that Superman stands for! Still I hated the series to have ended like this, and I felt they should made a better film where they all say good-bye to each other! Warner Brothers can try, but they can never replace Christopher Reeve, or any of the other actors!
