 I truly did fall in love with this movie, and John Barry's classic score! It is one of the most realistic time-travel love stories of all time! A story where Richard Collier (Reeve) falls in love with a portrait of the very lovely Elise McKenna (Seymour), and wills himself back in time to meet her! It makes you laugh and cry all at once, and the cast truly does shine! It's such a shame it never did get the praise it has now when it first came out, but it has truly become something special like a true piece of art! My compliments to Christopher Reeve, director Jeannot Swarcz, and the cat and crew of this movie for making it such a true classic for all of us!
