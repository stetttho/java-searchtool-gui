 This is no doubt one of the best PO5 episodes of all time! When it's rare to find a television show which deals with family drama, you can look no further than "Party of Five!" When I first got hooked onto the show in the spring of 99, I thought it had great potential, and great characters! It started after I saw Lacey Chabert(Claudia) in "Lost in Space," and since then I wanted to see more of her in other things! She truly does shine in PO5 with this episode! As does Scott Wolf who gives his character Bailey more drama with his alcohol problem! What makes this episode stand out from the other episodes in my opinion is because it's all the characters in a closed surrounding when they try to make Bailey come to terms with his drinking problem! With the other episodes, you jump from one character to the next, and it's often to soap opera at times, and hard to keep up! This is one episode where the siblings all come together to save their brother! My compliments to Scott Wolf, Matthew Fox, Neve Campbell, Lacey Chabert, and Jennifer Love Hewitt for making this episode truly work! It's too bad you couldn't see this movie become like a motion picture event(giggle)! That would have been neat!
