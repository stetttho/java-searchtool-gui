 To have this movie on DVD is a real treat for me! Not only do I have the original widescreen version to the film, I also have the original theatrical trailer, deleted scenes, and commentary from Ivan Reitman, and Harlod Ramis! I could say about ten million things i liked about this movie, but I'll try not to blab too much (giggle)! It starts out with these three scientists (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroid, and Ramis!) who after losing their college grants become para-normal investigators & eliminators! The result is a very good movie that is both scary, and funny all together!      When I started to learn more of the history of the movie, I was fascinated to discover Aykroid originally wrote it for himself and the late John Belushi who travel to the future, and become Ghostbusters! When Aykroid later showed it to director Ivan Reitman, Ivan liked what he read, but felt that it should be wise that they set it in modern-day New York, and bring Bill Murray on board! It worked so well that this movie later resulted in a sequel, and the famous cartoon series!     "There's something strange in the neighborhood! Who ya gonna call? Ghostbusters!!!"
