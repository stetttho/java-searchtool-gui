 For me, this Weapon is probaly one of the best in the series besides the first "Lethal Weapon!" Once again, Mel and Danny return for their roles of Riggs & Murtaugh, and yes Joe Pesci comes back as Leo Getz! Joining the cast is the very lovely Rene Russo as Lorna Cole who's character is just as nutty as Riggs (Gibson)! While trying to be a bit-more light-hearted copmpared to the first 2 films, this Weapon succeeds very excellently. With the subject dealing with armor-piercing bullets, and how they are being supplied by a crooked cop (Stuart Wilson) makes a very interseting story to watch! When I think of this theme, I remember an interview director Richard Donner gave where he mentioned that he was a member of the NRA at one point of time, but soon dropped out! Just the fact that he's speaking out against this subject with this film makes you feel really good for anyone who's just flat out against guns! It makes you think how much we're putting our life on the line when it comes to a gun! A very good Lethal alltogether!
