 In this fifth chapter of his "Star Trek" series, William Shatner brings Captain Kirk face to face with his worst nightmare of all: Emperor Tiberius (the mirror universe counterpart of himself)! Clearly he is a true match for Captain Kirk because he thinks just like Kirk does! This leaves Kirk little time for peace with his beautiful wife Teilani, and their unborn child! When Tiberius puts Teilani's life at risk by exposing her to a lethal virus, it's up to Kirk to hunt him down to find a cure for her! In the 2 days it took me to read the whole book, I found it to be action-packed and drama filled! One of Kirk's best adventures of all!
