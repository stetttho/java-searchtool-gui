 The movie has good cast members for the various roles! Evigan is perfect as Jake Cardigan, and you actually get to see old William Shatner in a movie that was based on his first best-selling novel of the same name! The only problem I have is that it's totally unlike the novel which is set in the 22nd century! You would think that since this is Shatner's baby, he should have had more control over it rather than let someone else do damage to a book! If I was Shatner, I would have let Paramount Pictures produce a big-screen version of the movie, and of coarse allowed Shatner to Direct it! Universal did a good movie, but I wish they did better!
