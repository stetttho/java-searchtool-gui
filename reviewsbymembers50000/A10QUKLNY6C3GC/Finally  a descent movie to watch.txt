 I remembered Lacey Chabert when she played Claudia on "Party of Five," and so I was surprised to see her in this movie. She really has matured and become a very beautiful woman before our eyes. So I decided to rent this movie which is one of the best sports movies I've ever watched. When the town of Athens which has has had a 12 year fottball losing streaks faces the reality their school maybe closed forever, along comes a young kid named Elvis Jackson (Nick Cornish) who will bring back the spirit of the game, and in the process take them to the championships. A very decent movie with good story-telling, and a great cast. Terry O'Quinn actually starred in a role that gave him a chance to be funny and great as the coach.
