 Thsi is one of Spielberg's greatist movies of all time! It was so realisticly acted and written that it brings such tears to your eyes! Thomas (Elliot) gave one of the most innocent and heart-warming performances of his acting career as a young boy who befriends a little alien! E.T. is shown by Spielberg as a wonderful character who learns about life on Earth! Just by looking at him, you can find all the qualities that could ever find in such a wonderful friend! I cannot wait for Universal to rerelease it into theaters for 2002 because I never got the chance to see it on the big-screen, and so this will be a dream come true for me!
