 Honestly, I'm not really sure what type of review I could give this movie! I mean the hard rock in background music was okay, and it has some pretty good action scenes to it! I really rented it because I wanted to see Helen Slater in it! I did get my fair share with Helen playing the Mary, the dim-witted flight attendant! I liked the scene with her and Russel Crowe debating who's the better "Star Trek" Captain! Crowe liking Kirk (of coarse), and Slater adoring Picard! But honestly the movie was a bit loud and story undeveloped (especially the ending)! Crowe did some fair share with his role of Zack Grant, but if Mel Gibson was cast in the role, that would have given the character some style and justice to his part! In all honesty, and not to offend Ms. Slater, but I feel that a 2 star rating fits this movie perfectly!
