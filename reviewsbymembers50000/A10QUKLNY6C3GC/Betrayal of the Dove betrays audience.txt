 I remeber watching this movie about 7 years ago, and I really didn't like it at all! I wanted to watch it first off because Helen Slater is one of my favorite actresses of all, and I thought she did a wonderful job with her performance! But the whole movie itself is too psychological and depressing that after seeing it 2 or 3 times, you really don't want to see it again! My compliments to Helen though for doing her best with this movie! She's as beautiful as she is talented!
