 Once again, I had decided to watch a movie that featured the lovely if not charming Renee Zellweger. It is a fun movie about about the life of Bridget Jones. A 30's single woman who is secretly terrified as to why she has not found the right man. The tough call is trying to decide which man she is destined to be with: the-all-too-good-to-be-true Hugh Grant, or the very handsome but only slightly boring Colin Firth. Tough call indeed! Renee is totally believable in the role, and she does truly stand out in this movie. The problem's I slightly had the most with were the content of coarse, but the most was the scene where Bridget finds an unexpected visitor in Daniel's (Hugh Grant) apartment. That scene made me very upset. The character of Bridget is indeed a lady you can fall in love with because I do have an ex-girlfriend who is like her in some ways. Personally, I would not mind dating her myself. Renee indeed had put almost a lot of herself into this character, and she should have the Academy Award for this performance. Bottom line: A good movie, but it could have been slightly better.
