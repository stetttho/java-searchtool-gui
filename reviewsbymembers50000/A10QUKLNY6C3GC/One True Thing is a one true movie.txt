 Since I became very interested in Renee Zellweger, I had decided to rent this, and I thought it was such a beuatiful movie. After learning that her mother has cancer, Ellen (Zellweger) is asked by her father (William Hurt) to come back home to care for her. At first, she refuses, but finds the strength to do go home, and in the process begins to have a more loving relationship with her mother that she never really had before. I had never watched many of Meryl Streeps movies before, but just watching her playout this character who is indeed suffering a great deal made me totally upset, and like Ellen you wish so much to want to help her even if you can't. However, when I think more of it, it really is better to have loved than to have lost. And in a very beautiful way, both Ellen and her mother found that bond which will always be with them. I wish I could review more, but in a way as I write this, I am feeling a little emotional over it. There really are no other words. Except one love: love. I guess less is more.
