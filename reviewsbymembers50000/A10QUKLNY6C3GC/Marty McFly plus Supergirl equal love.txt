 I really was smitten with this comedy, and it is now marked as one of my all-time favorite films! Helen and Michael have really good chemistry together as Chrissy Wells and Brantly Foster(a.k.a. Carlton Whitfield)! First Michael is definately smitten by her when he first meets her at the water fountain, and then he grows fond of her more as they go out together! If I had to pick a favorite scene, it would be when they share their first kiss on the boat! True magic right there! It's too bad they didn't make a sequal to this, it would have been great to see the both of them again!
