 Although this movie did not have the best reputation as a worthy remake of a classic TV series, it was not too bad considering! First off the special effects were very beautiful for this movie. Especially the scenes were Dr. Smith( played excellently by Gary Oldman ) is mutated into a part human part spider monster. Excellent music by Bruce Broughton is very fitting to John Williams classic television score. And the redesign of the robot was excellent. However, the movie did lack a lot because of its major theme: family problems (particularly where Will Robinson feels more abandoned by his father who hardly has time for him or his whole family for that nature). Also it could have had more charm & appeal without taking itself so seriously, and being so dysfunctional. To be honest, the original show was about family & fun which was its secret ingrediant. Maybe if they made a better sequel where family problems are resolved, and they had more scenes with real action and danger (heck have the Jupiter 2 fall victim to more alien attacks) then you may get much better! We did at the start with the "Star Trek" films, and so we can with "Lost in Space."
