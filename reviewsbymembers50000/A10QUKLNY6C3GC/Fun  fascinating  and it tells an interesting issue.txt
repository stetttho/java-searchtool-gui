 For many fans, even my mom and I, this is a good entry in the "Star Trek" movies! It is very entertaining, and the crew of the Enterprise bring out some good laughs with this movie! Within the 23rd century, Earth falls under attack by an alien probe that is trying to find information about the extinct species called humpback whales. With time sort of running out Admiral Kirk and his crew time-travel back to the late 20th century to save the 2 known living humpbacks (George and Gracie) and bring them back to save the future. At the time of this movie, the humpback species were indeed on the verge of extinction by whalers, but in a way this movie played a big part in helping to speak out about it. By my understanding the species is still alive, and well, and indeed will prosper hopefully into the 23rd century. Great special effects, good story, and great characters, Star Trek does indeed prosper for all to see.
