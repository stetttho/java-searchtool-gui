 The first time I saw this movie was just a couple months ago, and the reason was I didn't think it would be worth the effort to sit and watch. But...I started to take notice of Renee Zellweger, and the various roles she played. Even this movie which made her an instant sensation overnight. Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is the most miserable excuse of a human being who has the job of a sports agent, and he gets canned from his job real soon. But as he gets ready to leave, Dorthy Boyd(lovely Renee) finds the courage to wanna leave with him. Jerry's only hope in wanting to stay on top of the game is to stick with his one client Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr. who really steals this movie). Ultimately, it is a movie about finding not just a love and respect from other people, but with the person inside you. And in the end, Jerry truly does find it with Dorthy who completes him very much. Not the greatist movie of all, but yes it's very appealing.
