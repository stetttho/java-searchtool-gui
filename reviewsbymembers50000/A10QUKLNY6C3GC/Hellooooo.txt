 No one can ever replace this film! It's one of the best and funniest movies of all time that that reflects upon our life when we have a mid-life crisis! Very touching, and heart-filled that mixes in with good comedy from Crystal, Stern, Kirby, and Palance! Scenes that make you choke to death come from no one else but the little guy who stole the show: Norman the calf! trust me, the sequel didn't have much to offer than the original!
