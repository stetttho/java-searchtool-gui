 Since I first got hooked onto the series after I saw "Lethal Weapon 4," I've been a devoted fan ever since! Personally, after you see the first film a million times like I have, you really regard it as the best of the series! Interesting and funny story about a burned-out, criminals worst nightmare, cop named Martin Riggs ( Mel Gibson ) who has a death wish gets teamed up with easy-going, just-turned 50 Roger Murtaugh ( Danny Glover )! They start off not liking each other at all, but as the bad guys start to get nasty with them, they turn out to be a really cool team! With this kind of lethal pairing, what kind of moron bad guy would wanna step up to the plate!
