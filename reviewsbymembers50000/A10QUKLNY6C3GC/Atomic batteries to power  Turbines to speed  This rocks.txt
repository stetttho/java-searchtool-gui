 You never would have believe it possible to finally own the original "Batman" movie with Adam West & Burt Ward on DVD which is a real treat! I first got myself hooked onto Batman after I saw this movie, and the original TV show which should have episodes put on DVD. Personally, Adam West and Burt Ward are both Batman & Robin to me (second to Michael Keaton and Chris O'Donnell), and they will always be. With this movie, you actually have the four dastardly villains: the Catwoman (Lee Meriweather who took over for Julie Newmarr in the role), the Joker (Ceaser Romero), the Penguin (Burgess Merideth who also played Mickey in the "Rocky" movies), and the Riddler (Frank Gorshin) who all plan to take over the world. Holy Battle to the death, Batman! The Gloves come off, and the camp and fun all come together. Great interviews with Adam West and Burt Ward. They both still look great for our favorite superheroes. Great fun and great movie. Holy DVD Batman, this is really exciting!
