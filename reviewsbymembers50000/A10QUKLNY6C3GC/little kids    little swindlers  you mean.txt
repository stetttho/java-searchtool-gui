 If there was one movie I'd like on DVD someday, it's "The Apple Dumpling Gang!" It's a timeless classic where Russell Donavon (the late Bill Bixby) gets stuck with three orphaned kids who become popular in the town of Quake City after they discover gold in the father's old mine! Suddenly, everyone is after their gold! Including bumblers Theodore and Amos (Don Knotts & Tim Conway in one of their best movies)! Hopefully, someday I will be able to get the DVD version of the movie! Your kids will love this movie!
