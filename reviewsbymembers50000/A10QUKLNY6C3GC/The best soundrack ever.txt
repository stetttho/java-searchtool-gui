 Superman was one of my all-time favorite movies, and I am pleased to now own the complete soundrack of John Williams brilliant score! Music which I love to play constantly whenever I go to work! I actually own the soundrack to the film that I bought last year, but I was so pleased to now own the "whole" soundrack to the film! If you are a die hard frran like I am, you'll know the differance of this track compared to the first one! You'll thrill at John Williams score that brought a fictional character to life in 1978 when the film was released! I know I was!
