 I thought it was a very lovey film which was filmed beautifully and contained beautiful music! Thomas Guiry did a wonderful job as Matt! A young boy who having lost his mother feels more alone and left out than anything! Even though his stepmother(Helen Slater in one of her best performances) tries to be there for him no matter what, he finds a true friendship and love with a dog named Lassie! With this very new version of Lassie, they treated the legend very fair, and showed us a clip from the old Lassie TV show! You will love this film!
