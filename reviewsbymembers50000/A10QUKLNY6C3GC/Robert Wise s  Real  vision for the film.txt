 And it really has been fixed to where fans who despised this first entry in the "Star Trek" movies can now relate to it more! Director Robert Wise made a smart move when he brought back most of the deleted scenes into his final format which make it more easy to understand, and keep the plot moving at very good pace. However, with other scenes he did delete, and did not use in the final version, he is able to let us see them on the dual disc DVD set! Along with the new scenes comes new CGI scenes which make the scenes more easier to understand. As the Enterprise goes further into the V'Ger ship, you'll know what I mean! As the new scenes have been added in, it also gives more heart to the chracters of Kirk and Spock, and we understand more of Spock's personal quest for fullfillment with each of the new scenes. Finally, I also love the remastered music and digital score. It made me cry when you heared sound effects like the beaming effect from the original series played in this film. Look for a promotion of the new "Star Trek" series "Enterprise" on this DVD. Thank you Robert Wise and Paramount for the care you put back into it.
