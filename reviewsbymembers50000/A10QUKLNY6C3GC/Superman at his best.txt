 It was definately a dream come true to see Christopher Reeve perform again on the screen! Being a fan of his since the Superman movies, I so excited to watch this movie! I found it very heart-warming and touching a story about Jason Kemp who is a qudriplegic! Reeve invested most of his experiences into this role which was indeed very tailor-made for him, and the result is good chemistry between him and Hannah! I could understand why many did not like this movie because it wasn't like the original, but since I've never seen the original, I really couln't passjudgement! I guess for me, the real thrill was to see Superman still prove that he is our hero evfen through his determination to walk again! A must for die-hard Reeve fans!
