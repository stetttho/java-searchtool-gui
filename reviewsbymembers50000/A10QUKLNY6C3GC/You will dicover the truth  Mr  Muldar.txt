 The first time I ever really watched "The X-Files" was when I went to see the movie 3 years ago! Since then, I've been a big fan of the show ever since, and of Muldar and Scully! What makes the film great is that it really introduces new fans to the series, and you don't have to be an X-Files fan to know exactly what it's about! At that point of its release, the movie was intended as a culmination of 5 seasons! It tells an interesting story about an alien virus which has been around since the last ice age that has been covered up by the government for so many years, and how Muldar and Scully have been trying to uncover the truth about it! In terms of the movies realism, the visual effects for the building exposion are very beautiful, and it gave you a real sense of what it was like in Oklahoma City 6 years ago. For many who have never seen the TV series, then you can always watch the movie for a good starting referance, and enjoy it! I know I did!
