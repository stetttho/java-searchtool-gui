 For me, I personally loved this entry in the series because it goes back to the magic of the original show in a way. Finally, you have Kirk demoted from Admiral ("The Voyage Home") to Captain, and he gets to live out another adventure with his crew as captain of the Enterprise. You bring back Jerry Goldsmith ("The Motion Picture") to compose a masterpiece of all Trek musicals. And you give the characters more roles than they did in the last films. It truly goes back to the spirit of the show. After all, one of the dillemas with movie adaptions is that they tend to take away that magic. William Shatner does recapture that magic with this film which was his directorial debut. He brings in an interesting story in terms making you wonder if God could really exist out there in space. In a way the whole movie is about understanding each other, and our place in the universe. Although it does mimic the first movie, it does have a fast-paced feel, and it makes up for the first film in more special ways than one. Fun and enjoyable no matter what.
