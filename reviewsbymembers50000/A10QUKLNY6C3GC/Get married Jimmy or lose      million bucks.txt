 After I saw this movie, I became crazy for it because it's so funny, and it has the very lovely Renee Zellweger. After his grandpa bites the big one, Jimmy Shannon (Chris O'Donnell in a very funny role), a marriage shy bachelor, learns he will inherit a hundred million bucks unless he gets married before he turns 30 years old in 24 hours. Only problem is he messed up his proposal to his girlfriend Anne (lovely Zellweger), and she wont consider marrying him now unless he's totally wanting to strap on the old ball and chain. Now Jimmy's only hope is to ask every woman he knows to marry him. Oh boy! Soon things go from bad to worse when his buddy Marco puts his face on the cover of the newspaper, and now every woman in the city is dying to be his wife. Very funny, and charming all at once. O'Donnell can sure run fast especially with a thousand brides on his tail! I just hope my wedding will never be like Jimmy's (laughing)!!!
