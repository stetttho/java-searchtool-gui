 Like many have said before, watching "Superman: The Movie" is not like just being a kid again, it's better! Especially, with this new DVD version! It was great to watch the interviews they had with the cast and crew! Along with the theatrical trailers to the movie, and the deleted scenes(which are probably some of the best and funniest moments in the film)! What makes it more cool is when you can just listen to the soundrack (music by the master himself John Williams), and just read the subtitles to the film, it gives you a true feeling of being part of a silent film where the music really tells the story!      But the actual Superman story itself is a true piece of magic! This wonderful story where Kal-El, the soul survivor of Krypton, grows up in Smallville, then goes to Metropolis to become Superman (and who disguised as Clark Kent), and fight for truth, justice, and the american way! Superman is really the greatist hero for all of us to have, and somedays I wish he was real, and he could handle the major problems of the world! A must for all devoted fans!
