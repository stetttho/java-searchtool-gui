 While the last 2 "Next Generation" movies were good entries in the series, I regard this one as a very excellent film because it does go back the spirit of what the show meant to us. In "First Contact" we got to see Captain Picard(Patrick Stewart) be a man of action, but in this film we see the "Real Picard" when when he must defy Starfleet to save a race known as the Bak'u. The theme is very-light-hearted as we learn the Bak'u inhabit a fountain of youth planet which means millions of Federations citizens will benefit from its regenerative qualities. However, this will mean that Starfleet must force the Bak'u off the planet. Picard's only hope in both preserving the dignity of Starfleet, and preserving the peaceful Bak'u is none other than to rebel. Great feeling of home with the other TNG charaters, and Riker(Jonathon Frakes)& Troi(Marina Sirtis) renew their love for each other. What makes it even better is F. Murray Abraham's performance as the vengeful Ru'afo. I can't wait for the crew to come back in the next movie to be called "Star Trek: Nemesis!"
