 Not even could Christopher Plummer who's performance in the live stage version was good, but not as good as Fonda! In his final film which earned him the Academy Award, Henry Fonda plays the retired Prof. Norman Thayer Jr. Thayer and his wife Ethel (wonderfully played by Katherine "the great" Hepburn) decide to have a birthday celebration at the family lake, and hope to reconcile the bond with their daughter Chelsie (Jane Fonda)! What made me like the film so well was obviously Henry Fonda's character as he deals with the fear of turning 80. Just watching Norman go through these obstacles really made me cry because it's so heart-wrenching to have a person you admire go through all of this! He would almost be like the grandfather you really love, and who you would hate to lose without having a relationship with them. In the end, Chelsea and Norman finally rekindle the bond of a father and daughter relationship. One of the finest movies ever made with one of the finest actors of all time.
