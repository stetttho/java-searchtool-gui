 Star Trek: Generations was one of my favorite movies of the series because it was action-packed, and it brought Captain James T. Kirk and Captain Jean-Luc Picard together to save the day! His themes in regards to the lives of these 2 individual as they go through various changes in their personal lives are done beautifully! The themes for the nexus are done so superbly that it gives you such a great sense of joy! Marvelous score!
