 The movie adaption to the original TV series probably could have been a lot better, and been a bit more serious, but it was a fun movie! It borrows a lot from movies like "Mission: Impossible," and "The Matrix" while at the same time being a bit stupid and only borrowing some stuff from the original TV show. It is cool to see Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu be beautiful and kick butt as the three angels! Too bad Bill Murray didn't get to do much in this film with his portrayal of Bosley, and you couldn't see cameos from original angels like Kate Jackson or Jacklyn Smith. Still it was a funny update for the new millenium.
