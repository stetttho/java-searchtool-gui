 And the search for Captain Spock begins. Afet his apparent death in "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan," Kirk soon learns from Spock's father Sarek(the late Mark Leonard who will be missed very much) that Spock's katra(his spirit) is alive within Dr. McCoy. This leads Kirk to reuniting his original crew, and hijacking the Enterprise to recover Spock's body on Genesis. However, Kirk will soon confront the evil Klingon Commander Kruge(Christopher Lloyd from "Back to the Future") who is attempting to steal the secret of Genesis from Kirk's son David; the end of this is not a pretty picture. Fun, heart-warming, and nicely paced, the crew of the Enterprise gets better with every new entry in the movie series. This one is no exception.
