 I would like to have reviewed this movie if it were on DVD, but since George Lucas will not do that untill Episode III is finished by 2005, I'll just go ahead. This is pretty much a ground stone in science fiction fantasy action movies. While Lucas updated the era of Flash Gordon for a new age, he created characters we love so well. Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill) has always been my favorite hero, but yes I love the others as well(giggle). A wonderful story set around the time when the evil Empire led by Sith Lord Darth Vader plan to finish off the Rebellion forces with the ultimate weapon called the Death Star. After Princess Leia (Carrie Fischer)hides the stolen battle plans in lovable droid R2-D2, Luke Skywalker discovers them, and with the aid of Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (the late Alec Guiness)and rogue pilot Han Solo (Harrison Ford), embarks on a thrilling quest not just to save the princess, but the hope of the entire galaxy. Great fun and entertainment in a true Saturday matinee fashion told by the great Jedi master Lucas himself. With wonderful special effects that were a milestone in movies it will always remain a classic of all movies.
