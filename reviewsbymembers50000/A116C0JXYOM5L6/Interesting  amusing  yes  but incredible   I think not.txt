 I wish they had 1/2s, in which case I would have assigned a 3 1/2 to this book.  I would recommend the book because it gives one a different perspective on things.  It is a fast, easy read.  But after reflecting on it you realize that you acquired some interesting bits of information but information that is not terribly useful.  OK, so we learn sumo wrestlers cheated while in a pinch, as did some school teachers.  No great surprise there, especially when careers are potentially significantly impacted.  So, then we learn that a swimming pool is a much greater, and upon reflection, more likely, killer than a gun.  Again, no big surprise.  Levitt also makes it a point to insert death figures from the Holocaust to put things into perspective for us.  Odd indeed.  Nonetheless, I think readers will find this an interesting and fun book to read, even though they may then say, "Oh, how nice.  Now what?"  There are some other interesting bits of information that really sell the book and will create controversy.  The fall in the crime rate over the past decade, Levitt tells us, was, in fact, not due to superior policing, but due to the legalization of abortion.  We are also told the real name of Roe and the origin of the name of the KKK (to list a few).  Take it to the beach this summer, and maybe look at things a bit askance.
