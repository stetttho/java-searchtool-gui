 Hitchens can make most things interesting and readable, which is why I chose to read this book at all.  However, I found this book to be a bit more esoteric than I would have wanted.  It seems to have been written more for the true disciples of Orwell (or Hitchens), whom Hitchens clearly regards highly.
