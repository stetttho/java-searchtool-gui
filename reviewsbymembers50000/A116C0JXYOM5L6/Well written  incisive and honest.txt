 I found D of D to be a very interesting and honest assessment of religious origins.  Sutherland explores chronologically, from Judaism, to Christianity, to Islam, ending with Communism.  The latter may seem peculiar given the scope of the discussion but it is apropos.  Sutherland wants to explain why people act in a collective manner, what binds them.  He also wants people to honestly examine and explore the reality behind the myths.
