 I enjoyed the story line.  Furland is a good writer.  The only problem is the story ends 200 pages into a 600 page novel.  Granted he said it was the first of a three volume set, with the other two yet to be written, but all other trilogies I have read at least wrap up the loose ends before going to  the next book.
