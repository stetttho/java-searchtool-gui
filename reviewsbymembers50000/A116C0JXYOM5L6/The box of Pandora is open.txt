 Hitchens is willing to go places no one else will.  Here he examines the real life and actions of a modern day icon.  He raises real concerns and questions about Mother Theresa's actions and alliances.  I would have given the book a 5 but, to be honest, some of it seemed extreme in its criticism.  I would definitely recommend reading this book to at least create awareness of the possible hypocrisies that do exist with this extraordinary woman's life.
