 The commentary that accompanies this film is so bad that one is tempted not to recommend this DVD.  However, for those who want to see excellent footage of Hitler and the Third Reich, this is worth the purchase.  I cannot overemphasize how bad the incessant remarks are throughout the film.  To give an example, at one point Hitler is surrounded by throngs of adoring supporters, many of whom are women dressed in traditional clothing.  In the speech given, Hitler talks about the importance of the merging of the people and the government.  The commentator states at many of Hitler's speeches the tone was orgiastic, the people writhing in sexual overtones, the man merging with his supporters.  Every single comment made about Hitler was his messianic, maniacal ways, thoughts and behavior.  It is really over the top.  Just dates and facts about the footage would have been plenty of information and would have made this an excellent DVD.
