 Judaism, like any culture, has at times been insular and ethnocentric in its pursuits.  There is nothing surprising about this fact.  MacDonald, in my opinion, does an excellent job in presenting unbiased facts.  Since facts, viewed in their entirety, are not always flattering (again, as would be the case with any culture) some would like to dismiss them as anti-Semitic.  This is preposterous. MacDonald meticulously takes you through the history of the Jews and provides quotes from notables and facts of that time, both pro and con.  At various times Jews have been treated harshly.  Why would anyone NOT want to try to understand how and why this happened, in hopes that it would never happen again? To simply say he is at times quoting some people who said less than flattering things about certain Jews at certain times, is to bury your head in the sand. I can only say, read the book and draw your own conclusions.  Don't let someone else tell you how you should think.
