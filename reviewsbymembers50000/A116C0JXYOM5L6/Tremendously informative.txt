 This book concisely explained the probable causes of anti-Semitism.  Lindemann was careful to acknowledge that by attempting to understand anti-Semitism, one can misinterpret this to mean accept it in some way.  Anti-Semitism is never an acceptable expression but by understanding why it has occurred perhaps steps can be taken to prevent its future occurrence. If you don't have a lot of time but want to better understand this troubling issue, I can't imagine a better book to read.
