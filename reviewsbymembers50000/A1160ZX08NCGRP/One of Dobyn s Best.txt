 Fleshpot is one of Dobyn's best books!  It is narrated by Victor Plotz (call me Vic) - who is much funnier than Charlie Bradshaw (Dobyn's main character in the Saratoga books).  Vic is a funny, wise-cracking kinda guy and his adventures kept me amused and interested.  If you haven't read Dobyn yet - read Fleshpot - and if you are a Dobyn fan, you've probably already read it - and enjoyed it.
