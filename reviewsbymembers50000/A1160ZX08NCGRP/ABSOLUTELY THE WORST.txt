 I have read every Robert Parker book ever written - I love Robert Parker.  However, this was his worst book ever.  There were so many characters in this book that I couldn't keep track of them all and finally got so frustrated that I didn't care who they were.  Of course, being a die hard Robert Parker fan, I read it to the bitter end, but it wasn't worth the effort it took to turn the pages.
