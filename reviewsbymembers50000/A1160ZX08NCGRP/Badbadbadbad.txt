 Once again I am writing a negative review on one of my favorite authors.  I am beginning to think that as authors become more and more popular, they put less and less effort into their work -knowing that their name alone will put the book on the Best Seller List.  I'm also wondering if they just start hiring ghost writers to write their books for them.  I couldn't believe how bad this book was.  The dialogue is so trite that it's painful to read.  Bad. Bad. Bad.
