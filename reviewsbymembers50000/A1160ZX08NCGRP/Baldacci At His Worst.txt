 I don't understand the rave reviews that have been posted for this book.  I can only assume that they were written by the publisher's employees or friends of Baldacci.  I have read and enjoyed every book he's written, but this one was awful.  It was loaded with characters and possible suspects.  It had a convoluted, confusing, shallow plot, and it alternated telling the story between the main characters.  One of the main characters got kidnapped and the others acted like it was no big deal.  Very little mention of her fate, no drama, no concern.  Very strange.  After reading this book, I would have to recommend that Baldacci stick to "lawyer" books.
