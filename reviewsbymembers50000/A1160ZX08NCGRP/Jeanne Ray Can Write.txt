 I loved this book and I love this author!  When you read her books, it's like you're talking to your best friend.  I read Step Ball Change first and knew I'd HAVE to read everything Jeanne Ray's written.  So I read Julie and Romeo next.  This is a small, simple book - nothing heavy, nothing ponderous here - just total enjoyment.  So enjoyable, that I'm currently reading -and loving - Eat Cake.  The bad news is that she's only written 4 books - the good news is that her fifth - Julie and Romeo Get Lucky will be out June 1st!  Read this book - you won't regret it.
