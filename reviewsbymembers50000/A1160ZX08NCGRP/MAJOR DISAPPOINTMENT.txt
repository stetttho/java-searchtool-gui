 I discovered J. A. Jance 4 years ago and have read every book she's written.  This one is definitely the worst.  The first hundred pages are spent introducing a myriad of characters and their histories (from her previous books).  Very confusing.  Very fragmented.  If I were a first time reader of Jance, I would have stopped reading this book - but I persevered and finished reading it.  I would not recommend this book to anyone -but I would definitely recommend anything else that Jance has written.  She fell on her face on this one.
