 Is James Patterson losing his ability to write a novel?  Is that why he had "help" on this one?  If so, the "help" didn't do him any favors.  This book was awful.  It was juvenile.  It jumped from character to character without much chohesiveness.  It was just a really bad book.  Save your money and get it from the library.
