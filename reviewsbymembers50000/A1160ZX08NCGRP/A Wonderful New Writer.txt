 Run - don't walk - to your nearest library or book store and read this book!!  I read so many books that it's hard for me to remember them - but this one is seared into my memory.  And I don't often recommend books to my friends - but I've recommended this one.  What a great story!  Very well written!  Great plot twists and an awesome ending!  I can't wait for her next book...........
