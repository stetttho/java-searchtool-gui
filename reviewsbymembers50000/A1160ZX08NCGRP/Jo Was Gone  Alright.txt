 This was a really good book - except it was one of the few books I've read where I didn't like the main character.  Jo has everything - a great husband, good sex, nice kids, beautiful home, great job.  But she is  selfish.  When she was much younger, she ran away from her first husband  and her mother and didn't tell them where she was - just that she was okay.   Then, in her usual selfish way, she decides to have an affair with a man  from her past who has really given her very little encouragement.  I wanted  to throttle her.  But, yet the book really drew me - probably because I  could completely relate to her "hippie" experiences.  A book that  stays with you long after you're done reading it.
