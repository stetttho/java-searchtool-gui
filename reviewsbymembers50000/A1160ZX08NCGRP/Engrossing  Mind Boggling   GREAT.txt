 This was one of the best books I've read in a long time.  I'm not referring to how the author wrote it, the plot development or characters - I'm talking about the book - the story - itself.  It was just a great book - I have recommended it to all my friends - and I will go back and read some of Picoult's other books.  Enjoy!
