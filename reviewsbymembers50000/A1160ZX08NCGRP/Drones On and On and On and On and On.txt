 Okay - I admit - I love most of John Irving's books and could NOT wait until Until I Find You was published.  I slogged through this book til the end, even though part of me didn't want to bother.  As someone else mentioned, the first 300 pages deal alot with Jack's molestation experiences with older girls and women - from age 4 to age 10.  I did not find this appalling so much as unbelievable (no, I'm not naive) and boring.  The entire book had references to someone "holding" his penis from age 4 on.  I really don't think it was something that was important to know - I just found it irritating.    I guess I was just disappointed in this book in general - it didn't pack any "punch."  There was no compelling reason to pick it up and continue reading it (except that it was due at the library in 2 weeks).  The meeting with his father didn't occur until the last few pages of the book and instead of it being a joyful reunion, it was simply anticlimactic and sad.    I read it, I finished it last night, and I e-mailed my friends this morning and advised them not to bother reading it.
