 As the title of this review says - this was the best book I've read in months.  And, this is a first time author, so I can't wait to see what else she writes!  I almost didn't read it - I kept reading the reviews and deciding that I wouldn't read it.....  but my librarian reserved it for me and am I ever glad that she did!!  I was up until 2:45 a.m. finishing this book.  It held my interest from the first page until the last.  Definitely put this on your Books I Want To Read list.
