 The story continues the tale of the bird children - beautiful children with super powers and the ability to fly.  They escape the School.  They are reunited with Frannie and Kit.  They are chased by the Bad Guys.  They uncover a lab deep in the bowels of Liberty Hospital where sci fi things are going on.  They get captured.  They escape.  All is well.  End of story.  Who cares? I love to read James Patterson and have read every one of his books.  That said, I have to say that this is the worst book he's ever written.  It was boring, juvenile (it could be a teen book), simple, poor, transparent plot - I came very close to not finishing it - something I rarely do.  I kept thinking that James Patterson had his teenager try his hand at writing....  Or, that he was tired and hired someone else to write the book.....  What I don't want to think is that this is the best we can expect from him in the future.
