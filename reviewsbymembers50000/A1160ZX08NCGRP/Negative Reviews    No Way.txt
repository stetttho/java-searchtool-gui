 Tom Wolfe has done it again - he's written a Big Book that held my interest from the first page.  Yeah - maybe Charlotte is a tad too simple and maybe it's quite a stretch for TW to write as an 18 yr old girl - but I give him alot of credit for writing so well as an 18 yr old female!  I enjoyed this book so much that I started reading it slower, picking it up less often - trying to make it last even longer - the true sign that I'm really enjoying a book.  And - I can't wait for his next one!!
