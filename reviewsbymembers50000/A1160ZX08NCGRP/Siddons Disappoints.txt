 I have read every one of Siddons' books and eagerly awaited the arrival of this book. This book is probably her worst. It starts off okay - Charleston, the beach house on Sullivan's Island - the places she's so good at writing about.  But the book was boring. The writing was uninspired and insipid.  The ending was so bad that I began to wonder if Siddons wrote it or if someone else finished it for her.  This book was supposed to come out in the fall of 2003 and finally came out in the spring of 2004.  Now I know why - she struggled with it.  Die hard fans (such as myself) will read it, but get it from the library - it's not worth buying.
