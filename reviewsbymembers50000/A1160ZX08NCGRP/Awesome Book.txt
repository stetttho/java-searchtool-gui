 This book was given to me by a friend and I put off reading it for a while - it wasn't "my kind of book."  Luckily for me, I  started reading it and couldn't put it down!  This is the story of Anne Boleyn and her sister, Mary Boleyn, and their drive to attain the King and the throne.  But, it's more than that - it's a very well written history of the people and events of the time and is fascinating to read.  There's nothing dry or boring about this book. Try it - you'll like it!
