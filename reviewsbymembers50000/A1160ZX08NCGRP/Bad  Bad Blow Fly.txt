 I have read every Cornwell book written and was looking forward to reading Blow Fly.  This book was a huge disappointment.  Thankfully I got it from my library and didn't waste any money on it.  It was written in the first person, which didn't work well.  Each chapter was a different character - so it jumped around constantly.  The plot was very weak.  And the ending was so anti-climactic that she wrapped it up in the last 15 pages.  It felt like she got sick of writing the book and just came up with whatever she could to end it.  Maybe she was too busy researching Princess Diana's death for her TV appearance to spend much time on this book.  It was definitely a half-hearted effort.  If you're a staunch Cornwell fan, you'll read it - but don't waste your money on buying it - go to your library.
