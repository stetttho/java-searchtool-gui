 Many have tried to musically capture the brilliance and the darkness of both Rock and Roll and modern adolescence. This milestone album succeeds as very few have. Written as the first true "Rock Opera,"  Quadrophenia is, on its face, a profile of an English teenager who bears  many of the same quirks and problems of his peers: insecurity, a fondness  for drug use, and a longing for physical beauty and companionship that is  never fulfilled. More deeply, the album is an intense personal investment  by the four men responsible for writing and playing most of the music that  it contains. Each of the four players represents, in song and in pictures,  one of the four main facets of the spirit of the young man who is the  subject of the album. The music itself is beyond remarkable; it is an epic,  emotional tapestry woven both from fine silks, dirty cotton shreds and  everything in between. Perhaps best of all, it represents a high water mark  for The Who: the quality of the performances, the quality of the recording,  the depth of the lyrics, and the true uniqueness of the concept all shine  with a combined, breathtaking excellence.
