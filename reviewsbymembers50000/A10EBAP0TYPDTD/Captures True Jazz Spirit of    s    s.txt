 Years after my dad died, I inherited his collection of jazz LPs. This album was one of the gems of the bunch. It features a Brubeck- and Desmond-led quartet appearing before an enthusiastic Oberlin College  audience and captures the spirit of the late 1950's-early 1960's jazz  community perfectly. As Desmond and Brubeck lilt their way through  alternating melodies, as the audience claps approvingly after each solo,  you may find yourself with closed eyes, bobbing your head side to side,  imagining yourself in a funky little coffee shop, sporting a small, black  beret, balancing a set of bongo drums between your knees.
