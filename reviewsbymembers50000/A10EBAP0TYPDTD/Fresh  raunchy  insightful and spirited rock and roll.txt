 How refreshing that someone is still making real rock and roll. Ms. Prankster has produced a heady mixture of caffeinated and intense musicianship with lyrics that tell the story straight from the view of the edgy bad girl. Her music has the pop appeal of the Go-go's and the urgency of the Violent Femmes. It also has an overt, frank sexuality all its own.  As you listen, you can picture Ms. Prankster thrusting her hips at you while pleading for an opportunity to go down to the beach to break out the tits and whisky. Moments later, you can also hear her unrestrained glee as she breaks your lustful little heart, and as the blue skies magically appear over Dundalk.
