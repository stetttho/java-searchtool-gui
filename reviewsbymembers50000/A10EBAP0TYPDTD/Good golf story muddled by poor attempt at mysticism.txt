 This book reminds me of my own golf swing: it starts out promising, straight and true. But as it progresses, it takes a wicked slice and ends up somewhere in the woods, leaving disappointment in its wake. It is the  story of an evening's encounter between a wise and experienced  doctor/golfer and his young protege. The protege is considering abandoning  both his medical career and his attempt to improve his very impressive golf  game. The older man, hoping to intervene, begins with a story about a  remarkable golf match long ago ... . The tale of the golf match is riveting  and fascinating. I won't spoil it for you. But at the end of the match, the  writer takes his reader on a detour of mystical proportions, applying golf  to life in an impossible way that stretches credulity. This part of the  story brings forth the mental image of a punctured balata: under pressure,  it doesn't hold up.
