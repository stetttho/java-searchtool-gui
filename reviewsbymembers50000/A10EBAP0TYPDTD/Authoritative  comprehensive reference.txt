 This is an excellent book for the serious student of submarine history. It is perhaps the most authoritative reference book on the subject of post WWII submarines. Not only is it detailed and fully illustrated, it contains  excellent tables comparing performance, size, etc. of various American  submarine classes. One of its most valuable features is its descriptions of  the performance characteristics of each generation of submarine and  descriptions of how the designers of each successive generation attempted  to improve performance. It explores, in depth, the characteristics of  various generations of submarine devices, most notably sonar. It is fully  footnoted and the footnotes often contain remarkable bits of info.
