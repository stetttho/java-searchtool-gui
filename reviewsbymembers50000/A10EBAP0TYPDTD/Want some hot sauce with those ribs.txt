 Robert Johnson's work has never sounded better than on this CD. Mr. Clapton and company enliven his work with zesty and spicy performances. The recording is as crisp and hot as a plate full of hush puppies. As a relative novice to the blues, I found this album very accessible and downright fun. Even my wife, who listens to freaking Shania Twain, likes it. My only complaint is that in aiming for a semblance of purity, Clapton engages in repetition. Many of Johnson's songs rely on the same little riffs and turnabouts so that by the end of the album, you're wondering if you've heard some songs two or three times. I figure that's a relatively small complaint for an album that is guaranteed to put you in the mood for a plate of extra spicy  ribs with some beans and slaw on the side. Now that's what I'm talkin' bout.
