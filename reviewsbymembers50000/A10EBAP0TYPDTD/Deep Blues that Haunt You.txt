 This is a stunning album, and not just because Ms. Tedeschi sings and plays guitar like Bonnie Raitt wished she could. There is something spiritual and sincere about Ms. Tedeschi's voice that haunts her listeners. When she reigns wide open on her cover of the Rolling Stones' "Silver and Gold," you hear new and unexpected depth from a song that has been played so many times on the radio that it seems cliche. When she hovers overhead like a divine spirit on "Lord Protect My Child," you feel that she's reaching her protective arms around you. And it don't hurt that when Derek Trucks slide guitar talks to you, it speaks with a pronounced southern accent.   This album is a rare gem that has quickly become one of the favorites from my very large collection.
