 When I first bought this CD, I gave it two spins and put it away, disgusted. It was dark, morose, depressing and anything but inspiring. Nothing in it really held my attention. Plus, it didn't have the kick that attracted me to so much of Bruce's other work.   Years later, I heard a couple of cuts from the album on an alternative radio station and enjoyed them. So I decided I would give the album another chance. Oh what a day that was.   This ain't your daddy's Springsteen. None of the characters that Bruce sings about are going out for a night of dancing or riding in a Cadillac, long and dark, shiny and black. No way and no how.   This album is full of stories and its truest value is in its lyrics. The people in the stories are the downest and most desperate you ever heard about. Many reach middle age and can't find work in the one thing they're any good at. Many stand convicted of crime. One even pleads with a judge to put him to death instead of forcing him to sit in jail for years on end. Still others are searching in vain and in the cold for the days when they were young and felt so capable.   So yes, the album is dark and morose. But it is also inspiring. Springsteen tells stories with words and melodies that grab at your guts and squeeze. When you are listening, you know you looking at life inside of those greasy little towns you've seen along the Jersey Turnpike -- the ones where everyone seems to have a junked car and a chained-up dog their barren back yard.  The album ends with a curious selection, titled "Reason to Believe." It's all about how some people have lost love and have lost loved ones and who still find a reason to believe. Is that a coincidence? I bet not.
