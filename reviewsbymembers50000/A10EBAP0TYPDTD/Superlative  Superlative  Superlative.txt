 I have admired Mr. Hendrix since I was a boy of about 12 and first heard "Purple Haze" on the radio and my mother screamed "Turn that goddam thing off!" Right then, I knew he was the man. I bet when your mother yelled at you for playing Hendrix, you knew, too.   Imagine my surprise when I was browsing through the discount bin at Tower Records and saw this unfamiliar multi-colored CD. I had never heard about it when it was released and thought it must be covers of Hendrix tunes by other bluesmen (or something like that). "Hendrix, eh?" I wondered. "It'll be worth a listen."   How often it is that great things come from trivial encounters. So it was here. This is the single best Hendrix album I have ever listened to. There may be a couple of individual Hendrix tunes that I like better than the best of this album. But as a whole, this is it. Hendrix rocks freely and enthusiastically on every single tune in the whole album the way that no other human -- living or dead -- can.   What a find. What an incredible find. What a superlative collection of loud, bluesy, funk-ridden, emphatic and edgy blues improvisation. I give it an unqualified five stars.
