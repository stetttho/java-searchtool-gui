 John Grisham and Scott Turow have inspired legions of writers to focus on lawyers and the law. Unfortunately, not all of them can write or have a decent story to tell. This is one such author. While the story line is somewhat interesting, it is all too reminiscent of a made-for-TV movie. (High-flying city lawyer gone wrong; flees to rural countryside to hide; stows away in home of love interest; sees the light and decides to make amends.) Much of the book focuses an internal debate within the mind of the main character, related to the nature of a lawyer's duty to present the truth. But the debate lacks strength; it just can't grab the reader. More importantly, the story's characters show no real depth or appeal and leave the reader feeling rather unconcerned. And the writing is straight out of the Mickey Spillane instruction manual: short, staccato sentences; clipped, predictable dialogue; bland and simple vocabulary. In this genre, there's so much better out there; I can't recommend spending the time or money on this book.
