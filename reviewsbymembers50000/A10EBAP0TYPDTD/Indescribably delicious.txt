 You will like this album, but only if you like rock and roll songs about laughing at dead dogs in drawers and about waking up hungover and newly married and about the old west and about gettin' even with the woman what  dumped ya. When anthropologists a thousand years from now point to this  album as the major turning point in western civilization, you'll want to be  able to them you understand why. Plus which, this will put "Green  Acres" in a whole new light.
