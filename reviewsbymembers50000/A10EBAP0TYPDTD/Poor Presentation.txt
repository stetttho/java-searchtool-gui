 I was terribly disappointed in this book. I teach construction law at a community college and was assigned to use this book my first semester. I'll not use it again. The organization of the information was questionable. Many statements contained in the book were flat wrong or presented only a misrepresentative portion of a bigger picture. Many key topics were completely unaddressed. I can say that where the book is correct, the information is presented in plain English and provides the student with useable information about the basics.
