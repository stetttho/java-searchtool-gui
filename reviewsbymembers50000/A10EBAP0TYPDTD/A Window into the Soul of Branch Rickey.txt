 This book proves why one's words are a window into one's soul. None of the several works I've read about Rickey show his personality so clearly as this, or make him appear as interesting. To read this is to know Rickey the  humorist, Rickey the parsimonious paternalist, Rickey the wise man, Rickey  the businessman and Rickey the talent. The quotes by him and about him show  why Rickey would have been an immense success in whatever field he chose.  Thank God it was baseball.
