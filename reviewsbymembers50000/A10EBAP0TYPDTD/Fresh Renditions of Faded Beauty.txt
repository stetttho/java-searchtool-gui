 As much as I love Bill Monroe's own work, I like these fresh, updated versions even better. With this collections of tunes that are at times touching and at others infectiously happy, Ricky Skaggs has made yet another stride in drawing the masses to an essential component of American music history. Every song on this CD (excepting for Mary Chapin Carpenter's version of Blue Night) rings with appeal both tangy and twangy. If you close your eyes as you listen, it's not too hard to imagine yourself on the front porch of a little shack somewhere down in an Appalachian hollow.
