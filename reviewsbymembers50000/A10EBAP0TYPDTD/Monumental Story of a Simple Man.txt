 When I opened this book, I could scarcely believe what waited for me inside: the true, fantastic and engrossing story of the most All-American President we may ever have had. The story is one that seems impossible today: it follows a boy born to the hardest working and poorest of families on a Missouri farm, through his amazing, harrowing days as an infantryman in the U.S. Army during WWI, to his entry into county politics, his rise to the U.S. Senate and his remarkable ascendancy to the White House. Any student of American History -- indeed anyone proud to be an American -- will enjoy this book. I finished this book with a heart-felt appreciation for the gifts Mr. Truman has bestowed upon us and a fresh respect for him. Never having set foot in a college classroom, he learned all of his lessons from the school of hard knocks and stood toe-to-toe with the roughest and toughest of the world's leaders.
