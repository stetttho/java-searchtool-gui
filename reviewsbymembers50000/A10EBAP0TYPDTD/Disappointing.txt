 I love the Beat Farmers. On my headstone, I will have it carved that I saw Country Dick and the boys in concert just a week before he died. They are the best bar band ever. Ever. But this album disappointed me greatly.  Uneven recording quality. Rushed tempo. Lackluster quality performance. Get  Tales of the New West instead. You'll be much happier with your purchase.
