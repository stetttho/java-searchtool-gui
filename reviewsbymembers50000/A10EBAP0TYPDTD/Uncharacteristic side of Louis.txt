 The traditional Louis Armstrong--the funky, dixieland influenced bandleader--is hard to spot on this album. Instead, you get a funky and eclectic collection of songs that works well together--not unlike a big pot  'o gumbo. This is one of my Armstrong favorites, partly because of the  remarkable and inspiring title tune.
