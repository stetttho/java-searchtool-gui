 Between the simplistic picture painted by WWII newsreels and the overwrought, angst-induced symbolism that drips from the Hemingways and Fitzgeralds, lies reality as it was known in the American Midwest in the  1940s. That reality, in terms touching, startling, and three-dimensional,  can be found in WLT: A Radio Romance. The book focuses primarily on two  brothers who found and operate a small radio station, and their efforts to  accommodate the unique sensibilities of their novice listeners. Keillor  deftly mixes and describes a collection of fallible and loveable  personalities so dear that when the book comes to its close, you'll feel as  if a group of close friends has left you.
