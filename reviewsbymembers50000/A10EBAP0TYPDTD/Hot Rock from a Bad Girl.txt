 Mary Prankster's enthusiasm for full-throated rock and roll may be exceeded only by her fondness for the f-word. The combination is one virtually any rock and roll fan will appreciate. Her sound is reminiscent of The Beat Farmers, with an eastern feel. Mary's work teems with references to her native Maryland, down to her Natty Bo cover art. The appeal of her stage personna, evident in her lyrics, is sure to cross gender lines. Her hurried entreaty for male company on the beach to share "tits and whiskey" sets the tone. Later, she pines for a boy who is not a violent sociopath. (So Mr. Beach has a few skeletons, does he?)  Later still, she delights in breaking a heart that instills the kind of pain that would prompt Cal Ripken to take a day off. (See ya, Mr. Beach.)  Who among us can't appreciate the humor in that? Best of all, Mary Prankster really, really rocks.
