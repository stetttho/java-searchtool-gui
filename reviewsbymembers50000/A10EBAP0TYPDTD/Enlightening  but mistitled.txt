 Anyone hungry for disclosure of super-secret details of cold war sub missions will be disappointed. The author acknowledges that he was a nuclear reactor operator and knew virtually nothing about the missions of  his sub, the mysterious, one-of-a-kind USS Halibut. However, Dunham  provides an insightful, human picture of what it's like to earn one's  dolphins, graduating from the "non-nuke puke" status of a  freshman submariner. He describes well the rituals, difficulties and  patterns of a life spent underwater, with no view of sunlight, for two  months at a time. For that, he deserves great credit.
