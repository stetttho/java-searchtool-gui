 Ever wondered why a curve ball curves? Why major leaguers stretching for third often take a wide turn between first and second? Why bats seem to break much more often than they used to? This wonderful book contains the  answers. Written by a Yale physicist, it contains well-documented but  sometimes densely worded explanations of why and how a baseball, a bat and  even the players behave as they do. Any serious fan of baseball will finish  this book with an enhanced appreciation for the game. Not to mention the  ability to speak intelligently about how grip and mechanics differ between  pitchers throwing curves and sliders. The author has wisely chosen to  address the questions posed most frequently by baseball lovers who aspire  to higher knowledge. His only failure is his heavy reliance on technical  academic language and somewhat mysterious graphs. It makes for a very  enlightening but slow read.
