 You'd be hard-pressed to tell a boring story about about a plucky country newspaper editor who had principles and stuck to 'em. But this author has done it. He says the book is an adaptation of his doctoral thesis. That  fits. The book reads like a well-done, fully footnoted college paper, not  like a dramatic novel. It strives to identify key historical facts at the  expense of the reader's interest. With a modest amount of effort, it could  have been reworked as a compelling autobiographical novel bolstered by its  remarkable display of features of midwestern life during the first half of  the 20th Century.
