 Mr. Skaggs blends just the right amounts of twang and tang in this delectable collection of spirited ditties. Some old and some new, all are infused with an old-timey Appalachian fast-pickin' thunder. If you enjoyed anything from the popular "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack, you will be certain to fall in love with this recording. It has all the hallmarks of a Scaggs-family recording: a generous bow to America's oldest  musical tradition; superlative musicianship; sound quality that is first-rate; and the ability to get you to toe-tapping and feeling especially proud that you're living on American soil.
