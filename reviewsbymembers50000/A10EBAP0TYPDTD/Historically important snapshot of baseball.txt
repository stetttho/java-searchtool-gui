 Were Charles Conlon still alive, I would track him down and kiss his feet for capturing in such vivid detail the historic giants of baseball. The book features remarkable photos of the greatest baseball players of most of  the first half of this century. Suitable for framing, the photos typically  depict individual players and small groups, often in game action. The well  preserved photographs provide an important window on a truly beautiful game  and its players in an era when outfield fences were optional, and a  "baseball club" was just that. My favorite of Conlon's gems shows  Hall of Fame shortstop Honus Wagner gripping his bat. Under his fingernails  is Pennsylvania coal dust. His chipped, oversized piece of lumber looks  unwieldy by today's standards. And his sinuous forearms are testament to  the power that we remember him by. Other photos are paired to show the  dramatic impact of age and the outfield sun on players of yesterday.  Picture Wes Chandler spunky at 25 and then battle weary at about 50 and  you'll understand why so many players strive so hard for a moment in the  sun: they want to enjoy it before it's all gone.
