 Behind the deceptively subdued exterior of the album cover, and the Reverend's Eddie Haskell grin that appears thereon, lies a world we all desperately yearn for. (Well, some of us, anyway.) It features fast women, fast cars, big, thick steaks, and rodeos with big dwarfs. Holy cow, what more could a guy ever want from life?   The Reverend rocks like a man who's been brought up properly in the Rockabilly tradition. He'll have you playing air guitar and before you know it, you're dancing around like a concert madman and then trying to explain to the wife that it was a pretend Stratocaster that she saw you holding and thrusting in front of your hips.  This is good old fashioned bang yer fingers on the dashboard, jam the accelerator, punkamunkahunkabilly rock and roll. I bet George Thorogood wishes he could play his riffs half as fast and with as much feeling.
