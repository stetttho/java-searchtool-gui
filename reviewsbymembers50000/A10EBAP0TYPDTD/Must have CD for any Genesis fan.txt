 This CD captures the true spirit and talent of Genesis, despite the absence of Peter Gabriel. Every track has on its sleeve the extraordinary musicianship of the band and the imagination of Phil Collins, who was just  settling into his role as front man. I enthusiastically recommend it. And I  recommend you play it loud on a quality sound system; there are many  important elements lurking behind the melodies that can easily be missed.
