 This album just doesn't work. The producers certainly were well intentioned, but not all jazz players were meant to work together. The southern-influenced Armstrong-led musicians are steeped in a musical  tradition that is incompatible with the more urbane material written by the  Duke. Both are champions of jazz. Just different types of jazz. Many of the  Ellington rythms that I had enjoyed at a lush, relaxed tempo became rushed  and choppy in the hands of Mr. Armstrong. Both men have produced awesome  material. None of it appears on this album.
