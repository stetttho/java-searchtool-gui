 Merriam Webster's may be the authority on the words we should use. This book offers the first and last word on those that we do use (and want to use). In a variety of chapters grouped by theme ("Curses," "British Words," "Acronyms" and so on), the author presents us with a special and funny collection of terms that are exotic, funny, quirky and ribald. Who knew that "Trigamy" involved having one more spouse than a bigamist? Who knew that there existed a person who cleans feathers for reuse in pillows? Or that his job title is "Feather Renovator"? Or that there were at least 2,231 words and phrases available to describe drunkenness? I am 20 years into a career of journalism and law and have had this book on my desk the entire time. It has proven invaluable many, many times -- on some occasions only for a pleasant diversion. On others to find just the right phrase for an argument or an article. It is a true treasure.
