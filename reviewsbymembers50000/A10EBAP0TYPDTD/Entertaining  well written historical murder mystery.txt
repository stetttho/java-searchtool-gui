 The most interesting mysteries are those of a different generation. After Bland Simpson learned this simple lesson, he applied it, turning out  an absorbing and true tale of murder, love and damning coincidence taken from  the Victorian Age.

It follows the footsteps of those closest  to the story and builds to a climax of uncertainty and mystery.
