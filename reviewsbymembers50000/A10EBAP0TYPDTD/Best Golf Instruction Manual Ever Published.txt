 The basics never go out of style, which is why this book will be a perennial favorite among golfers. No fancy swing theories du jour. No promise to fix your slice in an afternoon. Just the basics, simply explained. The book breaks down the golf swing into five discrete  components. For each component, ample pictures and descriptions are  provided. Several of Hogan's concepts, most importantly the concept of  keeping the club and arms beneath a plane, are essential teaching tools for  virtually all golf instructors. For novice and experienced golfers, you  should buy only one book of instruction. And this is the one.
