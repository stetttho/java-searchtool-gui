 Freddie Mercury said once that his two biggest influences were Jimi Hendrix and Liza Minelli. That says everything about this CD, which is a mix of styles that would have seemed impossibly different had Mr. Mercury and company not taught the rest of us just how well they go together. In "Death on Two Legs," the album opens with the rough-edged, loud rock and roll that made Queen a Top-40 favorite in the 70's and 80's. It is closely followed by "Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon," a lilting feminine romp that celebrates idleness. The combination produces a surprising flavor I've never tasted anywhere else. This band is one of a very special kind. And this CD is perhaps the best example of their talent.
