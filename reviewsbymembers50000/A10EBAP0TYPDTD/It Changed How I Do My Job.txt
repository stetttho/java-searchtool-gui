 This is a truly tremendous -- but not perfect -- product. I have become much more independent and productive on my job because of it. It stores way more information that I can put in it. (After 18 months, 500 contacts and loads of internet downloads, memory is only 20 percent full.) It is lightning quick -- pulling information up at a moment's notice. It is easy to operate -- learning to use the Graffiti alphabet system is simple. It is even handy: it fits in a pocket, it allows me to "beam" information to other Palm users, there are web services that allow me to down load news, sports, etc., so that I can read my Palm when I'm stuck on the bus, waiting in a line, etc. On the downside: the screen can be hard to read in middle-level light conditions or where there is too much light and reflection is a problem. Also, the screen scratches easily, but that can be solved with a disposable sheet you can attach to the screen. And it has a back-light function, which is really only helpful when you're in complete darkness. I highly recommend it.
