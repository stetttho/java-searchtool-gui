 This movie is no way as good as the first one, but don't let that put you off.  It has some very funny and witty moments throughout with some great one liners by Chevy.  Highlights include: - Chevy as Claude Henry Schmoot, a guest healer on a tv evangelist show - Chevy as a member of the KKK - Chevy confessing his sins to evangelist preacher "I parked in a handicapped zone.  Actually on a handicapped person - but I told him I'd be back in five minues so that's not such a big deal."  The film does run out of steam towards the end a little but is definitely worth a view.
