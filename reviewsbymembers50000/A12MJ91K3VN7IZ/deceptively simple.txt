 On first examination this book seems a little light weight and a bit pithy.    Nevertheless,over the next few days I found myself thinking about some of the things mentioned, like Zen Commute.  I started to reflect on what was the underlying force that was driving evrything everywhere.  Where are we all going and what is driving us?  There is some profound insight here if you are willing to put in the thought.  If you just read without thinking it would appear very light weight.  But isn't that Zen in itself, the very simple things around you can lead to the greatest insight if you can find a way in.  A beautiful waste of time.
