 This two volume set is beautifully presented with glossy colour and non- colour prints.  The book is similar in style to Yogananda's comments on the Bjagadavad Gita, where he takes a line or two of scripture and then reflects and expands upon it.  The result is a very interesting read into the life of Christ and a deeper esoteric study of what Christ was saying.  Obviously, given Yogananda's background, this interpretation is laced with eastern Mysticism and Christ is seen as a self-realised Yogi come to awaken mankind to their own cosmic consciousness.  If you have read much of Yoganana's other writings there won't be too much here content wise that you have not come across before.  However it is still a fascinating read.  Some of the many topics included are: - The law of Karma - Man's three bodies, spiritual, mental and physical - The nature of miracles and healings - Descriptions of the astral worlds - Mediatation, union with the Christ consciousness - The role of satan (Maya)  Well worth the price of admission but for the Yogananda beginner I would suggest "Man's eternal Quest" or "Autobiography of a Yogi".  For those inerested in a new take on Christ's teachings this is an interesting and at times revelatory read.
