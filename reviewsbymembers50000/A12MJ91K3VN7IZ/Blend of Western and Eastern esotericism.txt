 I don't think this book is so much a guide to advanced alchemy as it is a synthesis of Eastern and Western esoteric ideas.    There are a variety of visualisation exercises that may seem a little silly to some as they involve the visualisation of castles and round tables and temples.  This is what is commonly known as 'inner work'.   On the other hand, the author goes into explanations of some basic yogic principles around the rising of the Kundalini energies along the Ida and Pingala channels along the Sushumna.  To the crown chakra of enlightenment.  So the book is a strange, and somewhat novel, blend of Eastern and western esoteric techniques towards enlightenment.  However it's done in such a way that it ofetn comes off being very dense, and a little confusing.  However, it is an interesting read and is certainly unique in that it breaks the mold of the Western Mystery Tradition not concerning itself with the wisdom from the East.  From this stand point alone the book is a worthy addition to your collection.  As to whether it's an advanced guide to alchemy? Probably not, but still worth a read.
