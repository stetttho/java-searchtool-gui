 Whilst critics will always pan Rick Springfield as a light weight throwaway, what they may fail to realise is that he can write some of the most cleverly crafted pop/rock you are likely to hear.    This album is a testimony to Rick's song writing skills.  There are more hooks and catchy choruses here than your average starlet today could even dream of writing.  All the hits are here: -Jessie's Girl - Affair of the heart - Don't Talk to strangers etc.  My only beef is that they didn't include the excellent "Written in Rock" track.  Maybe next time.....  Buy it if you love great 80's pop/rock
