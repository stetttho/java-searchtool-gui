 I watched this after renting the Omega code 1 and this film is a prequel and a sequel to that movie at the same time.  It tells the story of how Stone got to become the Beast himself (generally a down hill slide since he was pissed off at the death of his mother giving birth to his younger brother- I guess you have the choice of going to therapy or becoming the Prince of Darkness - Stone chooses the second)  There is a love triangle thrown in for good measure between Stone and his brother David and Gabriella (as in the angel Gabriel, get it?)  To try and some up the dizzying plotline in a pragraph would be tough, but it's basically about the Devil wanting to take over the world through the construction of a world union that gives him all the power - all the nations go along with this except for America and China, - a big battle at the Biblically prophesized Megiddo ensues.  The special effects in the film are TV quality and it does let the film down in the end when the devil appears looking a little more fleshed out than a Teenage Ninja Mutant Turtle.  All that aside, the storyline is quite engaging and the film is eminently watchable and a worthy successor to the first film.  But does the President of the United States have to end up being God's representative to save the day?
