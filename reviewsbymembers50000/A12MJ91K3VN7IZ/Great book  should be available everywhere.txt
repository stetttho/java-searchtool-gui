 This book is fantastic.  It's written in an understandable format and has humour and warmth throughout.  The book exmaines the Shiva process of self-inquiry, which is to say it examines the inner processes that go on and looks at ways of managing them.  It is a fantastic way to examine your chakras, and any blocks within them and provides helpful hints about what to do about negative thoughts.  It looks like this book is not widely available, which is a shame, because it should be in book shops evrywhere.  Highly recommended.
