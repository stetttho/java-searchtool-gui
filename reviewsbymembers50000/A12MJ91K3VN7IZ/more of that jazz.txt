 This is a varied and interesting album.  I'm not sure there are many other bands that could mix up musical styles the way that Queen do here.  The album starts off with "Mustapha" with Freddie singing in some strange middle eastern spiritual kind of way, before Brian's guitar comes in about half way through to heavy it up.  A really distinct track.  Most people would have heard "Fat Bottomed Girls" so there's not much point going into detail here.  Great guitar and harmonies in the chorus.  Lot's of fun.  "Jealousy" is a Freddie piano ballad with some strange modal playing by Brian.  Haunting.  "Bicycle Race" - everybody knows this one.  Great use of ringing bells in the middle.  "Let Me Entertain You" - A good Queen rocker with fun lyrics..tongue in cheek.  "Dead on Time" - A really fast Brian May rocker..great guitar  The second half of the album slows down and we get a variety of ballads.. the Seventyish sounding 'Only Seven days"..the soulful and sad "Leaving home ain't Easy" and "Dreamer's Ball", a jazzy style ballad.  "Don't stop Me Now" is the only fast song on the second half and is a fantastic  piece with a sense of play in the lyrics.  "Fun It" is a Roger song and you can see from the disco type beat here that it was only a small step away from "Another One Bites the Dust"  The final song "More of that Jazz" is an adventurous piece with splices of the "highlights" of the album thrown in for good measure.  Whilst this offering isn't as solid as "A Night at the Opera" it is certainly an entertaining and varied piece of work.  More than worthy of a listen.
