 This book is a fantastic reference book for anyone who has an interest in the western esoteric tradition.  It covers a broad range of topics related to Western Esoterica, such as: - Alchemy - Qabbalah - Rosicrucianism - Mystery schools - Symbolism of plants and animals To name but a few.  If you are new to the field of esoterica and you want a very clear and concise introduction (with excellent pictures) then this really is the place to start. Manly Hall has done an excellent job of putting together this compendium of information, and it is unlikely you will find so much information about this subject in the one book anywhere else.  That being said, there are some people who might think this is some sort of Holy Grail on the search towards enlightenment.  I think it should be noted that on a PRACTICAL approach to enlightenment, this book has little to offer.  It is a reference book of academia pure and simple.    Take it for what it is, a nice introduction to the path and a good reference book for the journey but not something that will help you on the journey itself in any practical way.
