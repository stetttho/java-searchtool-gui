 THis album gets canned for not being up to scratch but I would disagree.  The songs on this album are nicely written and diverse in style which is a good thing.  "Hollywood" is a great rocker and "angel of death" is foreboding and ominous with great keys from Darren Wharton.  "Fats" is brilliant and jazzy - "check out fats, he's a real cool cat, he's got bright white spats......." .  The song "renegade" was dissed on the all music guide but I think it's a great song with a real dreamy quality to it.  Please don't overlook this album if you like Lizzy's more experimental side.
