 No doubt that this album is nothing short of brilliant, but be warned it's not an easy one to sit through, as it takes the listener on an emotional roller coster ride.  OK, so a lot of other people have explained that this is a concept album, and it is true, the album is loosely held together by the notion of the one man's journey behind his own emotional wall.  However, do not be put off by this, as their are many songs here that can, and do, stand on their own - Such as "Comfortably Numb", ":Another Brick in the Wall part 2", "Run Like Hell" "Young Lust" and "Hey You".    There are a lot of tracks on the album that are there to seque together the real meaty songs and as such they can be considered "filler" but when listening to the overall album you can see where they fit.  The album is a dark ride and could be considered depressing if the melodies and vocal harmonies weren't so beautiful.  "Goodbye Ble Sky" has a depressing Lyric but is held up by the Beach Boy like harmonies and Dave Gilmours airy accoustic guitar work.  "Comfortably Numb" has the beautiful contrast of the dark verses (sung by Waters) rising up to the ethereal/dreamy chorus sung by Gilmour, before his guitar takes you to another place in the outro.  You've gotta be in the mood to listen to some of this album's more theatrical points (like The Trial, which is a mind bender and something you would be more likely to find in an Oliver Twist like musical).  Still, there is much great music on this CD and it's well worth a listen, if you haven't already.
