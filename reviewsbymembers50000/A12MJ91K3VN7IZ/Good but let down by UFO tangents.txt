 This book is a strange brew of historical information about alchemy, combined with the, sometimes, fantastical experiences of the author.  When the author is explaining the alchemical symbols etc, he shows that he has a great command of knowledge.  The section on explaining the "Opus Medico-Chymicum" is great, as is the section dealing with the Azoth.  However, at times, the author starts to go off on tangents about UFOs - This it seems is a hang over from his previous job as an editor for a UFO magazine.  Ironically, the book could have benefitted from this material being edited out.  It would have given the whole thing more credibility.  Thath being said, this is a good book and does a very nice job of making clear the process of alchemy (at least mostly from a psychological point of view.    If you are looking for a book that fully expounds the spiritual aspects of alchemy, you might want to look elsewhere. But as an introduction, this is fine.
