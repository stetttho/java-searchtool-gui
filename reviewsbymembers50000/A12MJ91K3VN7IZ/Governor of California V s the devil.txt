 Arnie actually does a good job in this film of at least trying to act.  The plot is a little ludicrous, the devil returning every 1,000 years to mate with a human to have diabolical offspring.  But somehow it is still engaging.  The special effects are good, especially the church scene at the end of the movie.  Crucifixions abound and there is no shortage of blood splattered scenes for the more horror minded.  There are absolutely no subplots involving any characters other than Arnie.  Arnie's friensdhip with his co-worker is tokenistic and somewhat cliche.  It could have been a very good film but ends up being a good "b" grade film - not the the huge comeback "A" grade block buster it was designed to be.
