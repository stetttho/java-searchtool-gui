 This is one hell of a funky album from beginning to end.  It's different to 'Two against Nature' as it is more organic sounding with a very warm texture to it.  The songs hit a groove and stay there, but in a good way, with smooth guitar lines and organ riding over tight drum beats.  "Godwhacker" is a beautifully funky track - "things I miss the most" is playful and fun.  There simply isn't a dud track on the album.  The lyrics are sly and soulful.    If you like blues based funk with jazzy flourishes, you are more than likey gonna love it.
