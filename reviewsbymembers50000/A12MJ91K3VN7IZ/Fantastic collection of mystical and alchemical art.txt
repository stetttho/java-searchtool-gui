 If you love the esoteric symbolism and art associated with alchemy then you are going to love this book.  It is beautifully presented with a nice glossy finish to the pages and the colours are excellently reproduced.  There are brief bits of text that accompany the drawings/paintings and even though they are brief they can be quite illuminating.  This book has had pride of place in my collection and I have dipped into it on many occassions.  It can be almost meditative looking at these painings and drawings and can broaden your spiritual understanding.  It is a fine collection of alchemical and mystical paintings and drawings and it is unlikely that you will find such a beautifully presented and exhaustively comprehensive collection anywhere else.
