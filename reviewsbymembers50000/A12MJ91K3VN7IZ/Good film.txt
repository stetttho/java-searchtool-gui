 This is a good film.  The attention to detail in set design is excellent and the dialogue is witty.  Perhaps more could have been made of the relationship between Woody's character and that of Charlie Therzon.  They cerainly seem to have more of an onscreen electricity than Allen and Hunt.  Hunt looks like she was dissapointed she wasn't in a more introspective Allen movie with a bit more weight, rather than a funny, period piece.  Still the movie is very watchable and certainly deserving of more than the one and a half stars it was given in the all movie guiide.
