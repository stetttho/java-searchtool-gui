 Van Halen 3 is different from all the other Van Halen albums before it.  It's almost as if the band wanted to make an effort to grow up and tackle more mature issues, both lyrically and musically, which isn't a bad thing in itself.  What the album needed though is someone to have reigned some of the experimental stuff in and formed it into more accessible songs.    Instead what you get is a hit and miss affair, where Eddie's guitar is interesting as the same time as the song itself being quite boring - for instance "Once" and "Josephina".  This is something that Van Halen fans are just not used to as Eddie has always been a hell of a song writer as well as a guitar player.  A lot of the ideas here in prnciple are quite good, but most of them never really seem to take off or go anywhere that would leave you with a cohesive whole.  The tracks that do come in as being the most complete are "Without You" and "One I want"  "Neworld" and "Primary" are interesting instrumentals and prove that Eddie can still do interesting things with guitar and keyboard.  The rest of the songs are not really fully formed, or go on way too long for their own good (like Once - clocking in at over 8 minutes).  Cherone doesn't sound like he did with Extreme on this album and seems to have a lot of effects on his voice, with the end result being that he sounds like a cross between Cherone, but probably more like, Sammy Hagar.  The lyrical content is a break from the usual party hardy fare but is often at odds with the musical content of the song, meaninig that the songs are oddly formed.  So this album is a strange mixture of good bits and not so good bits.  It would have been interesting to see what they could have done with Cherone if they'd returned to more of their earlier sound rather than branch out into the more experimental.....but you gotta at least give them some credit for trying something different.
