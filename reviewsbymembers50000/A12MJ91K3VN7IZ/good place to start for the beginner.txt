 This is a great book for the beginner starting out on the path to self-realization.  It is written in a style that is very easy to understand and contains some simple and yet profound truths towards enlightenment.  I particularly liked the chapter on the mantra - om namah shivayah - and how the author recommends chanting it on the commute to work or when you have idle time.  It's certainly been working for me and this little book is now a permanent fixture, dipped into regularly, on the bookshelf.  Buy it and do your Self a favour
