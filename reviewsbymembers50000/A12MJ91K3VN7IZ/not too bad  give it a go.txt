 No doubt this album does stray into boy band territory at times, however there are some good songs here - Torn to shreds and Cry are good rockers and the ballad long long way to go is good.  I got the extra track on this CD -kiss the day- which is excellent.  Most of the other tracks are slick and melodic but don't really stay with you, they're pleasant enough when they're on, but don't really make you want to go back for a second helping.  I don't think the production helps too much either, it's polished to the point of stripping away the rough edges that made albums like Pyromania so addictive.  That's what made this band so great, the mixture of hard rock and melody.  I'm not sure why they can't have that rough edge, they've got two of the better hard rock guitarists going (I mean check out Vivian Campbell's playing on Holy Diver, it just totally rocks out).  I think the boys shouldn't bother about trying to have a hit anymore and go abck to what they do best.
