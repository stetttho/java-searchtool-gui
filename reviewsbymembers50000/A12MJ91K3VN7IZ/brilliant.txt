 If this body of work doesn't convince you that Prince is some kind of musical genius then nothing will.  Prince can do it all, from stripped down funk "Kiss", to driving rock :let's go crazy", "Peach" to heartfelt ballads "purple rain".  The man is a freak.  The 3rd disc contains the b-sides and I think perhaps more of the experimental side of Prince, but it is brilliant none the less.  My personal favourite is "Another lonely Christmas", with the bitter-sweet lyrics of a lover dying on Christmas day.  Oh yeah, and I forgot to add - the man is an awesome guitar player  Buy this and you won't be dissapointed.
