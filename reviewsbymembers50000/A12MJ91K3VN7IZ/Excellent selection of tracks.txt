 What you get with this album (that you don't get with 'Made in the shade") is not only a selection of music on already released music from the stones, but a few unreleased gems.  These gems are: - Everything is turning to gold - Mannish Boy (Live) -When the Whip Comes down (live) - If I was a Dancer (Dance part 2)  Of these gems, for my money, the best are evertything is turning to gold and If I was a Dancer.   Worth the price of admission for the unreleased stuff alone, however the stuff included is also great and the album really plays well as a whole.
