 This book gives a Jungian interpretation of the 22 Major Arcana (Tarot Trumps).  Each of the Major Arcana are expounded upon in some depth, with accompanying illustrations.  The book is a good introduction to the major arcana and Jungian psychology, however, it only seems to get to a certain level of meaning and then stops there, just when you were hoping it might go a little further.  Unfortunately if you are looking for an in depth esoteric study of the tarot, you have come to the wrong place.  I would suggest Mouni Sadhu's "Tarot" book as the most in depth study going, or "Meditations on Tarot" by unknown, as two of the better in depth books.  What you do get though is an interesting (if at times dry) journey through Jungian archetypes and mythology. If you know you're archetypes and basic greek mythology and old testament wisom, there won't be anything here that blows you away.    But it's still a worthy book to add to your collection as it's one of the few books that deals exclusively with Jung and Tarot.  The only other one I can think of is "tarot and Individuattion" which is a fabulous book.
