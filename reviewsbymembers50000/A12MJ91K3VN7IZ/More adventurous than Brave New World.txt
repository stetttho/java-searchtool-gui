 This album will always be compared to the one that came before it.  But it shouldn't be.  Maiden are in good form here and there is a freshness to their sound.  The best cuts are the title track and Paschendale.  The chorus on No More Lies kind of ruins the mood a little (comes in too heavy too soon) and Montsegur rams the point a home a little too many times.  At times they are teetering on becoming a little too Spinal Tappish (I could almost see the Leprachauns dancing around stonehenge on the title track)- But - and this is the importnat point - Iron Maiden are in on the little joke - there's some humour here about what they are doing - and dare I say - a lightness of touch, like they're not taking themselves too seriously.  And that's what makes this CD enjoyable. They sound like they're having fun.
