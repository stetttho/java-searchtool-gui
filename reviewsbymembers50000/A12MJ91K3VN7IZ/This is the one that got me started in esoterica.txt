 This is a great book.  It's full of information that will get you interested on the esoteric path.  But be warned on first read it may seem like some of it is gobbledy gook, but this is not the case.  I returned to it again and again as I discovered new things and found I was led, by the snippets provided in the book, to go and research things for myself.  There are copious amounts of interesting foot notes by David Ovason (almost a little mini-book itself), that are informative and revealing.  This book provides a great introduction into occult (secret) teachings.  It will get you started in the areas of:  - alchemy - different bodies of man - astrology - language of the birds - esoteric symbolism - mystery religions - fulcanelli - astrology  Definitely a great book to get you started on the esoteric path.  I would recommend it to anyone, along with Manly Palmer Hall's "Secret Teachings of All Ages".
