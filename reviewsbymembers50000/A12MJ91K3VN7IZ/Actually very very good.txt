 This film is very very good, regardless of what some people have said.  Speilberg has been criticised for scmalzing up everything he touches, but I don't think that is the case here.  This film has depth and imagination on a grand scale.  The last forty five minutes or so are amazing and the ending is fitting and satisfactory.
