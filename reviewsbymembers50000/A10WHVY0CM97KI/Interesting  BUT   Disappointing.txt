 This is a fascinating topic, a real detective story for one of history's mysteries.  (Though the mystery angle is not so great, just some minor twists and turns.)  There is much in this volume that has been covered  before---and done better (Trevor-Roper and O'Donnell, for example).  The  authors' arguments are poorly stated, disjointed, repetitive, and not  particularly convincing.  (Though they are probably---more or  less---correct.)  There's a rushed, let's-get-this-one-together-fast feel  to the book (it's typos are both numerous and inexcusable).  Essentially,  what we've got going here is a refresher course.  Interesting enough, but  the billing far exceeds what's delivered between the covers.
