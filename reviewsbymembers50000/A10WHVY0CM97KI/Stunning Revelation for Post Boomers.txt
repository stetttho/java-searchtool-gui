 I first saw the (very grainy and undoubtedly bootlegged) Zapruder film at a teach-in during my college days.  Finally, about thirty years later, it's possible to view it about as clearly as we're ever likely to see.  This is an essential historic document.  It certainly won't answer all the questions that still float around about JFK's assassination, but anyone with even a mild interest in history will be fascinated by (a) how the film came into being,  (b) how it was preserved and enhanced (probably thereby providing new grist for conspiracy theorists' mills?), and (c) the haunting images.  I found myself, while watching the various versions (close, closer still, etc.), quietly hoping that at least one of them would turn out differently than all of them had, ever did, and always will.  Absolutely essential for students of the JFK assassination.
