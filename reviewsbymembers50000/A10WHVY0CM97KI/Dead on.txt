 Having spent quite some time over the past 25 years or so visiting friends and relations in Northern Ireland, my reactions to films that deal with the place run along a continuum of "Dead Awful-Dead On."  This film takes a silly little idea and winds it up into a metaphor for all those people who attempted to carry on with their lives, surrounded by and in spite of The Troubles.  It's loaded with inside jokes that those who attempt to bridge the divide will recognize and respond to immediately.  I absolutely love this film, which tells us more about the people of Northern Ireland than all the useless politicians combined.  Besides, this is one very funny film.  Enjoy!
