 Richard Flores has produced a book that should give interested readers cause to pause and engage in some reflection.  The syntax is a bit dense, as seems the case with postmodernist writing in general.  But once you get past the jargon, he's put together a strong case for how the "sacred space" of the Alamo has been both created and reinforced.  As might be expected, the Hispanic population comes out on the short end of the stick.  There's a good deal more here than simply postmodernist political correctness.  Flores has done his homework, doesn't seek to hide his own biases under the misleading rubic "objective" (there's no such thing in history and anthropology anyway), and provides abundant references to material for interested readers to explore on their own.  A provocative and interesting piece of work.  It requires paying attention to the detail, but doing so is well worth the effort.  Readers who've bought the whole Anglos-wrested-Texas-from-them-Mexicans-in-the-name-of-freedom malarky should steer clear of Flores's book: it'll only get them het up.  But students of myth and memory will be amply rewarded.
