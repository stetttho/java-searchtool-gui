 Steele presents the reader with a masterful treatment of the events surrounding the "massacre" so familiar to viewers of the latest cinematic incarnation of Cooper's "The Last of the Mohicans."  As  a teacher, I can tell you it's a bit of a surprise for students to find out  that Colonel Munro survived Magua's knife.  Steele puts the events in  historical and cultural context.  A fine piece of work, one which should be  of interest to a broader audience than the book will probably get.
