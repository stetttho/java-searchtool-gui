 Not trying to sound too ponderous, but "Gimme Shelter" is an important document from a pivotal period in American (and international) social history.  A pair of bookends, this video and the one from Woodstock  (both festivals held the same year).  The music is absolutely up to snuff  (as you'd expect from the Stones, Jefferson Airplane, Ike and Tina Turner,  the Flying Burrito Brothers).  Yet of equal power, impact, and importance  are the crowd shots.  You go to Altamont with this one and see just how  screwed up things got.  And perhaps even come away with some sense of the  "why" of it.  Five big stars as a rating for this one.
