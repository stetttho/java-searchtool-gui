 I often use this book in one of my university history classes, "US History Since 1877."  It's biased.  All history writing it biased.  (George W. Bush's problems with "revisonist history" aside.)  I tell the students about Howard Zinn and his biases.  And I tell them to try and be as upfront and aware of biases as they are of Zinn's, and as Zinn is of his own.  People are bombarded with so much yahoo, rah-rah, raise-the-flag, my-coumntry-right-or-wrong (the next part of that toast is usually---and very conveniently---ignored; check it out some time) that Zinn is as refreshing as a tequila mojito on a hot summer day.  He may rant, but unlike many on the other sides he can be checked out for veracity and found to be correct.  You have to be when you're taking shots from folks who prefer using cant, rhetoric and arrant nonsense to propel their own agendas.  Highly recommended.  But, if you use this book in a class, watch out; the Thought Police are watching.
