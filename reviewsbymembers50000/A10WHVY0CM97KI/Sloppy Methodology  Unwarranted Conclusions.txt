 This book is a good example of what happens when people arrive at a conclusion---in this instance, most likely based on John Kerry's post-Vietnam experience as a critic of the war---and then set about creating a picture that's compatible with the already-reached conclusion.    The "evidence" doesn't appear to be able to hold up through even one news-cycle.  This isn't "history."  It isn't even "research."  It's political polemics at its best (and worst).
