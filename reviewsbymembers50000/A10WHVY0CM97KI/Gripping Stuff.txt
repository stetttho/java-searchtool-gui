 This film is a natural companion both for Miller's "The Crucible" and Boyer/Nissenbaum "Salm Possessed."  When Sarah hauls out her map, in an effort to explain what was going on in Salem  during the craze, it all comes together for the viewer.  I've used this in  university classes (with students running the gamut from undergrad to grad)  and it never fails to work its magic.  Vanessa Redgrave is, as you'd  expect, superb in this role.
