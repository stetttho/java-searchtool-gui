 Ben Hecht is a virtually forgotten figure today.  No matter.  This is one of the best autobiographies ever written...EVER.  You don't even have to be interested in the period or people he covers in order to be drawn into the story.  For aspring writers: read this, and then try and figure out how he puts it all together.  This is (a) a wonderful story; (b) a brilliant piece of writing; and (c) a marvelous read.  Why in god's (gods'?) name is it out of print??????
