 "Medicine River" is one of those "sleepers" that deserves the sort of awakening that comes from exposure to a large and appreciative audience.  There's none of the "Noble Savage"  stereotyping (except by tribal people making jokes).  Nor are we awash in  the tragedies of rez life.  Instead, there's this wonderfully serendipitous  journey of discovery.  Things don't always work out as the Grahame Greene  character initially thinks or hopes, but that's part and parcel of the  serendipity.  If you like films like "Local Hero" (another  sleeper), you'll go for this small but memorable gem.
