 Author Lovell clearly wants to refurbish Isabel Burton's image, and she has done so.  In doing so, Lovell does not appear to have let the desire to attain that goal outrun the evidence at hand.  Indeed, Lovell provides the reader with a considerable body of previously unknown and/or unused material which supports her contention that Isabel Burton---long branded as some sort of religion-filled and -frenzied lunatic---was of a piece with many other Victorian women who actually helped their husband's careers immeasurably.  (Consider, for example, Elizabeth Custer, wife of George Armstrong Custer.)  This book is not the end-all-be-all for those interested in Richard Burton, however, for there is actually very little in the way of detail about his travels and experiences.  This makes sense when the narrative hits areas Burton himself purposely left blank (his Indian years, forinstance).  But this approach makes for problems in areas Burton purposely highlighted.  I enjoyed the book as a book, and found Lovell a stylish writer who alerts her readers to her own biases (always welcome in a historian).  But for those who have read about Burton before this could---stress on "could"---be an oddly unsatisfying piece of work.  For those who come to the subject fresh, or wish to round out their understandings about this intriguing couple (hence the "could" caveat above), this is a wonderful book.  It is, after all, not all about Richard (although Richard might've thought so; yet even here, Lovell makes him a good deal more rounded in his sensibilities and sensitivities than many who've earlier given him a go ).  The book is about a couple, and within those parameters it is a solid and fascinating volume.
