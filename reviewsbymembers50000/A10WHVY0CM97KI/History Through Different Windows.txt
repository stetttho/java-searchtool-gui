 Weber has put together a selection of informative essays by different authors, all dealing with the famed Pueblo Revolt of 1680.  Given that the (for a time successful) uprising took place, the question for students of  history is the standard one:  Why?      As the essays in this book point  out, there is no one answer to that question.  There are, instead, many  answers, and additional questions.      In history, it's not so much a  case of arriving at the "truth."  Rather, it's the journey of  discovery that really counts.  The essays Weber has collected run the  gamut, from turgid academic writing and sniping to refreshingly  clearly-stated prose.  His introduction is masterly, the bibliographic  references invaluable, and the overall effect one of having learned just  how complex and diverse the causes of an effect can be.      Highly  recommended for readers interested in this area, especially for classroom  use at the college and university level.
