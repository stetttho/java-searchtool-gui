      It's not that all British writers write well; it's just that so many of them do.  The how's and why's of that are up for discussion.  I've often found that UK thriller/procedural writers in particular leave waaaaaaaay too many blank spots, e.g. the actual lives of the characters they parade across the pages.  Mark Billingham does not do this.  He's created a believable and interesting character in Mr. Thorne.  Yes, there are gaps.  But that's for the reader to fill in.  Reading needn't always be an entirely passive activity.  This book is a solid, interesting read.  Plenty of "ah ha" moments, pathways (both productive and of the dead-end variety) to explore.  Basically, Billingham is a subtle writer---but not so much as to be beyond the reader's understanding.  Excellent detective fiction with plenty of interesting character sketches.
