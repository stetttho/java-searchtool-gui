 As a long time BE fan, I find their latest work to be a logical and gorgeous epiphane in the progression of their sound. Starting out as an admittedly great guitar-drony band, they've gradually moved away from  guitar and into the electro-beat oriented material of "Lushlife".  If you aren't put off by the lack of guitar, you should love this album.  I'm one of the few who were bored by their 1996 album  "Beat"...this is what that album could have been. I'm just glad  they found it now. The sound may seem familiar if you are into similar  bands such as Laika or Hooverphonic, and if you are you can't go wrong  here.
