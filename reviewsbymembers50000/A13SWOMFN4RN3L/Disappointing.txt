 After the blaze of glory that was Adorable in the mid-nineties, frontman Pete Fijalkowski has returned with an uneven batch of new music. Along with his brother Krzys and a new backing band, Polak has created some rather  insipid tunes. A few do standout, such as "Storm Coming" and  "Shipwrecked", but most of the songs are dragged down by the  vanilla music.   Pete's wonderful voice can only do so much, but with  music as generally uninspired as this he doesn't have a lot to work with.    I'm as big an Adorable fan as anyone, but Polak's debut album has me  pretty disappointed. As promising as the first single "2 minutes  45" was, this lot has to be considered somewhat of a failure. Keep  your cash if you're looking to get the import.
