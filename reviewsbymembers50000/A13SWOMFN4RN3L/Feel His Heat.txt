 David Haffleharf likes to do it, and boy howdy he does it (again) with his 17-track masterwork "Looking For The Best of David Haffleharf (Where the [IMPORT] Is It?)". Cleverly collecting all 17 (count em!) timeless tracks, this CD will rock your pants off, leaving you dazed, confused, and possibly naked.  David�s nearly 1-octave range is stretched to the limit over the goat-rutting effervescence of "Do the Limbo Dance", while the nuances of the subtle but effective �Wir Zwei Allein� will warm the cockles of even the staunchest old-school S&M fascist. When you hear the dulcet pounding of "Danice Dance d'Amour" you can be almost positive that you are listening to a displaced expatriate who probably spoke English as his first language. And don�t let anyone fool you, "Flying on the Wings of Tenderness" doesn�t really sound too much like a rhino in heat. But his naughty-schoolgirl-spanking cover of "The Best Is Yet to Come" certainly does. The song "Hot Shot City� is particularly good. And it sounds a lot like that fab tune "Feel My Heat" by Dirk Diggler.
