 It's true that most of the material here is previously published, but how many people actually read these stories when they were printed? This is an invaluable collection of incredible journalistic integrity and fact-finding.  From the truth about the 2000 Election, to the story behind Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, to the deceit of the IMF and World Bank, this book is absolutely eye opening and jaw dropping. Few reporters would have the strength, interest, and know-how to conduct the sort of investigations that Palast has achieved. "The Best Democracy.." should be required reading for any even somewhat open-minded individuals. I assume that conservatives and the right-wing ilk would not believe the reports in this book anyway, so why bother? Finally, the criticisms of this book written by the "Editorial Review" leads one to believe that that writer may have had their own agenda to fulfill. Don't believe it..this is the real deal.  If there were more Greg Palasts in the world, it would be a better place.
