 Garbage's third album sounds almost nothing like their previous releases, and for me that's a huge disappointment. This time they've traded in the guitar grit and good tunes for a giant polished piece of studio tripe.  I can't really see Garbage converting anyone with this release, and they're certainly in danger of losing a lot of old-school fans. Really the only good songs on the album are "Shut Your Mouth", and, well, that's about it. I'm not sure who they're trying to appeal to, but I don't think it's going to work.  It's really too bad, because until now they were one of the best this country had to offer.  As far as I'm concerned, this album is a very large misstep.
