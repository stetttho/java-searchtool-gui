 This is my first exposure to RZ, and I have to say they've knocked my socks off. This album is a tour-de-force of slightly theatrical, glammy, melodic rock, featuring soaring choruses, clever dual-guitar parts, and a big star sheen. I'm not going to stoop to comparing them to Radiohead or U2, but they do remind me somewhat of other melody-rock UK bands, like Marion and early Travis. There are so many great songs here, such as "Over the Rails & Hollywood High", "Perfect Memory", "Glorious #1", and "Impossibility". The album is pretty dense and requires a number of sessions for it to sink in, but it's certainly more than worth the time. Overall I think it's one of the best releases this year. And I still can't believe they're American!
