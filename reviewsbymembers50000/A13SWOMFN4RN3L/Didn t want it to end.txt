 The real-life-like story of Sherman, Ed, Dorothy, Jane, et al, is an incredibly gripping journey that I didn't want to end. Despite it's length of over 600 pages, the compiled Box Office Poison was a joy to read, and, due to becoming immersed in the story, very quick to finish. The characters and situations in BOP should be familiar to nearly anyone, and provide more lifelike scenarios that any book or movie out there. If you're the least bit interested in "alternative" comics without superheros or far-fetched storylines, this is your chance to pick up something amazing. Highest recommendation!
