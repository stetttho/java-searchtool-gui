 Evoking the spirit of great UK bands like My Bloody Valentine, Radiohead, and Oasis, NYC's Longwave is one of the best of the new wave of noisepop bands. Their 2002 EP Day Sleeper is, well, a sleeper that needs to be discovered. Clocking in at 13 minutes, this is a brief but perfect introduction to an exciting band. The title track is 3 minutes of beautiful noise and melodic piano. Single "Pool Song" is very catchy and worthwhile; however, "Everywhere You Turn" is one of the best songs of the year, providing old and new school shoegazers alike with a reason for being. Can't wait for the major-label debut next year!
