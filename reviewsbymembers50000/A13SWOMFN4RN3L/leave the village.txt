 the scariest thing about The Village is that i wasted the time and money to watch it. this movie really does not have a plot..the movie itself is basically just an excuse to make a "twist", one which you can see coming from miles away. the whole endeavor is incredibly dull, plodding, and pointless. Bryce Dallas Howard's performance is the one bright spot in an otherwise terrible film. let's hope that producers can see past the rest of this garbage and get her a better vehicle next time.
