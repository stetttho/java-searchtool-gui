 100 Broken Windows is quite possibly the best release of 2000/2001. It's nearly impossible to pick out a favorite track, as this album is, top-to-bottom, full of perfect sorta-punky-but-melodic power-pop anthems. Just when you think you've finally reached a song without a hook, watch out because here it comes.  Like a young and driven Guided by Voices (minus the drugs and undercutting silliness) crossed with Manic Street Preachers (minus the pretension and politics), Idlewild have arrived. From the opening riff of "A Little Discourage" to the sparkle-fury of "Wooden Ideas" to the beautiful dynamics of the wonderfully-titled "Actually It's Darkness", Idlewild takes you on a joyride. Another standout, "Mistake Pageant", is the best song Robert Pollard never wrote.   Coming in at a tight 38 minutes, 100 Broken Windows doesn't overstay its welcome, but with songs like these i'm not sure it could anyway. And be sure to crank it up; the album tends to lose its energy at low volumes. Finally to be released in the US in March, and it's about time.
