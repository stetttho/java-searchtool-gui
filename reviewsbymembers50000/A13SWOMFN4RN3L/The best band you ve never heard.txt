 The Dent is one of the best American bands that you've never heard. This Connecticut-based power trio released 3 albums full of quintessential pop in the mid to late nineties.  But none were as highly accomplished and invigorating as their latest masterpiece, Farewell.  The band plays essential guitar pop as well as anyone out there. Vocalist (and former drummer) Mitchell Linker retains one of the best and purest voices on record. Structurally the band resembles the criminally underappreciated The Connells, as well as better known groups such as radio-friendly pop stalwarts Goo Goo Dolls.  Farewell is chock full of picture-perfect pop nuggets, almost any of which could be a radio hit in a better world. Album opener `Look Up' is as good as anything you'll hear this year. Should-be single `End of the World' is absolutely stunning; the song won a John Lennon Songwriting award in 2002, and rightly so. The title track presents a heavier guitar sound, but retains the soaring vocal melodies and harmonies that make this band so special. Like their previous releases, Farewell is produced by bass player D Rauh. I'm not sure who else he's working with, but he has a tremendous ear, and puts out as polished a product as any big name producer.   I honestly can't figure out why this band is still unknown. The big labels need to get on the ball and sign these guys already. Do yourself and the band a favor and pick up Farewell.
