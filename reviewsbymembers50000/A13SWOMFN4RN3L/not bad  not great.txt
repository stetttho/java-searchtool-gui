 I bought these for my iPod to replace the ones that came with the unit. I'd read that they're very dynamic for the price, and the bass response was supposed to be fantastic. I guess I'm missing something here..these are neither as clear, dynamic, or as bass-responsive as the iPod included buds. I've compared them, using all three of the included sizes, and none of them compares favorably.   On the plus size, they do come across with pretty good clarity, although I usually have a feeling that the music is "far away". Biggest plus is that they're extremely comfortable, much better than the included iPod buds. Plus with the three sizes you can expect to find one that matches your ear size, I suppose, not that it makes a ton of difference to me.  And yeah, the case is a joke. I think someone mentioned using an altoid box to hold them..I'm going to try that.
