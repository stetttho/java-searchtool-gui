 Having been a hardcore New Order fan since 1986 I looked forward to their reunion album with great enthusiam. It pains me to say this, but they probably shouldn't have bothered. Get Ready is an embarrassingly limp rehash of early New Order guitar rock that never should have seen the light of day. For me the main problem is the lyrics. Bernard Sumner has never exactly been a poet, but these belong in the "bad high school" category. Consider the chorus of "Turn My Way": "I don't wanna be like other people are/Don't wanna own a key, don't wanna wash my car". Uh, OK. Even worse is the closing ballad "Run Wild", which makes me cringe, not only for the uber-cheesy guitar balladry of it (which is bad enough), but consider this bold statement: "You're the kind of person/I always wanted to be with/Well you're really cool/And you always say the right things to me". Give me a break. And the song "Rock the Shack" seems to exist simply for guest Primal Scream vocalist Bobby Gillespie to shyell meekly behind Bernard in the goofy chorus. The best songs on the album are "Close Range" and "60 MPH", combining driving beats, lush keyboards, and N.O.'s requisite clanging guitars. Lead single "Crystal" isn't too bad, but it's certainly their weakest single ever. I can't fathom all of the positive reviews that this album is getting. Am I completely missing it somehow? I don't think so. By using lyrics that sound like they were written on the way to the studio, pointless guest appearances, too few hooks, and no apparent inspiration, New Order have succeeded in putting out a worse batch of tunes than I thought possible. OK maybe there does seem to be a bit more energy and fun being exhibited on this release, but it's far too little to save the record.
