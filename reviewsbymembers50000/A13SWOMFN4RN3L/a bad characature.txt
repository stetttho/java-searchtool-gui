 I was sorely disappointed with Hooverphonic's third release The Magnificent Tree. Not only is the title ridiculous, but the sound is like a bad characature of their first two albums. They tried to continue the previously wonderful trademark sound, but it just falls completely flat and derivative. This album is damn near unlistenable, except for the re-issued final track which capitalized on the TV commercial. I had to use mine as a frisbee because I couldn't stand the site of it anymore.
