 Welsh has finally dropped the ball. After putting out a seemingly endless string of amazing material, "Glue" is a fairly major disappointment. Basically a near-500 page character study, Welsh seems to have lost the plot, or at least forgotten to include one here.   The characters are fairly interesting, and there is plenty of memorable dialogue, but unless you're someone who is fascinated by endless descriptions of attempts at getting a shag, binge boozing, or silly football fights, you'll probably be disappointed with this one. It's all a bit too mundane.   If you're looking to get into Welsh, you would be better served with any of his other work (Trainspotting, Marabou Stork, Filth). Long time fans may be disappointed as well..at least, this one was.
