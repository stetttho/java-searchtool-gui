 Rick Steves is a terrific travel writer, and really knows how to make just about anything entertaining. He does the same with his language books, and this one is no exception. full of useful, though sometimes hilariously irreverant, phrases, this is a great pocket-sized language guide for Italy. you won't find everything you need in here (the Menu guide, for example, is particularly lacking), but it's a very good start and a fun read.   as noted by others, the odd organization of items in the book can make finding things a bit tricky at times, but it's usually in there if you know where to look. just familiarize yourself with where things are located and you'll be fine.  definitely recommended.
