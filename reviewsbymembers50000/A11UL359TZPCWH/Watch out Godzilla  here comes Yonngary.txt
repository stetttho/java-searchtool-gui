 The remains of a dinosaur named Yonngary and 50 times bigger than T. Rex is reanimated and controlled by evil aliens in an attempt to destroy the world.  It has what I'd consider some pretty darn good special effects, but the acting from some of the cast members was so so (maybe they spent all their moola on the special effects and had to skimp on the actors), but I still had a blast watching it and it more than satisfied my monster movie craving.  Big stomping lizardy fun!
