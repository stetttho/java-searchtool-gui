 I was given my original copy of this book when I was about 11, by an uncle with a "unusual" sense of humor.  I loved it!  Lots of illustrations and text jammed in an unusual comic book style layout made  this quite the fun book for me to read. You get to follow Fungus, a  bogeyman, on his daily duties as a Bogeyman and experience the complex  Bogeyman world.  Peek into his bathroom and see hygiene products like  "pepsomuck" and "eau de colon".  Some of his daily  duties include waking sleeping babies, making things go bump in the night,  and scaring vicars in cemeteries.  You also get to learn Bogey history,  anatomy, and more. It's quite complex and fun and provided me with hours of  entertainment as a child. I recently got hit by a wave of nostalgia, and  purchased it here at Amazon as I couldn't find my old copy.  My 13 year old  daughter who is a Harry Potter fan (which also has complex characters) has  promptly taken posession of this new copy and has trotted off with it. I  fear I wont get it back.  Fellow Fungus fiends will also want to check  out "Father Christmas" by Raymond Briggs, available here on  Amazon, which chronicles Santa's day to day life in a most hilarious way!
