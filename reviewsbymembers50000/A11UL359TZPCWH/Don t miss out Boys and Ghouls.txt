 This is not just a Halloween party compilation album. This is a must have for anyone who digs on surf, rockabilly, garage bands or just plain wacky music. Scary surf riffs, creepy rockabilly, hardcore punk, grim garage bands, and hellish hot rod tunes make for one killer album, regardless of the season. The whole CD is a strong comp from the folks at Musick. Deadbolt brings us the necrophiliac tinged "Billy's Dead," a deadpan riff which sets out to inform us that Billy might just be better off in a George Romero movie. Freddy Fortune & The Fore Gone Conclusions sing about hot rod hearses in "Dracula's Deuce," and Satan's Pilgrims bring to life "Frankenstomp".  Los Straitjackets, Boss Martians, Space Cossacks, The Bambi Molesters, the Hellbenders' and The Omega Men, among others, are also lurking on this killer comp. Since I've gotten this CD, it's laid in rest permanently in my CD player, rising from the dead to thrill me again and again.  It's got a nice blend of lighthearted creepy songs and darker spooky tunes that makes it a perfect candidate for the "repeat" button on my CD player. The jacket art has the same great feel as the music: Wacky, creepy, hot rod, kustom kulture fun!  As I've said, if you dig on surf, rockabilly, garage bands or just plain wacky music, do not miss out on adding this to your collection!
