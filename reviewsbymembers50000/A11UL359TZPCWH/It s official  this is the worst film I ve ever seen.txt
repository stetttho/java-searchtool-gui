 I got this film, as I love horror flicks.  I was never so disappointed in my life!  There's absolutely no continuity in it, it jumps randomly and without warning.  The script is terrible, the acting was horrid, and it  left me lost and confused and very irritated.  I think they made this as an  excuse to show some really badly done quasi-sex scenes, it was just the  worst.  Jane Longenecker looked embarassed to be in it, poor thing. Still  need to satisfy your longing to see a movie along the lines of a creepy  Coroner?  Try the film Phantasm instead.  Anything but this!
