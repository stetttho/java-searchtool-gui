 This little bat is great!  He's got light up red eyes, and he flaps his wings.  You attach him to the ceiling with an attached tether and mount, and turn the wings on.  Give him a push off, and he'll fly in circles, flapping his wings with his eyes glowing bright red.  At night he's marvelous, because folks hear the flapping, and then walk up, and jump when they see his red eyes glowing brightly! I've had one up, going non stop, for over a month, and the only time he stops is for new batteries!  I'm really impressed with the little guy!
