 A vast majority of Coop's art featured in Devil's Advocate are, in actuality, posters the artist was commissioned to create for various rock shows and punk concerts, with the challenging task of grabbing the attention of casual passers-by and hopefully get them to attend whatever concert or event they're promoting. In this task you'll discover that Coop's posters more than succeed in catching your eye, in fact, they demand you stop and look! Such posters include aliens wrestling with curvy female astronauts, a sleek Creature from the Black Lagoon, babes with hot rods, tiki temptresses and Betty page-esque hotties flirting at you from the poster in luscious color. From another artist, all of this could of come across as vulgar and cheap, but instead, it oozes raw sexuality and is just a heck of a lot of fun.  Don't miss out.
