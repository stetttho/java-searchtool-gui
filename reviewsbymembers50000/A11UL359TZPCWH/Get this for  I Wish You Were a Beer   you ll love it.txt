 "Hey there poseur, I wish you were a beer!", such infinitely wise words from the raunchy rock vixens Cycle Sluts From Hell.  Their own CD?  Sadly out of print.  I'm glad I found this comp that includes it, my  Cycle Sluts tape is on it's last legs.  The song is all about how they wish  that all the poseur guys in bars that hit on them were beers.  You wont  know whether to giggle madly or start a mosh pit.
