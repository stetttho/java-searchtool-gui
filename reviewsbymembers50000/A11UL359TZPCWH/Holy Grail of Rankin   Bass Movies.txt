 This film is fiendishly good fun!  For years, it was only available as a grainy poor quality bootleg, it's so killer it's out again!  Rankin & Bass, the folks who brought you such fun Xmas movies like "The Year  without a Santa Claus" (remember Heatmizer?) and "Rudolph's Shiny  New Year" did this fun Halloween special back in 1967.  Phyllis Diller  plays the monster's (Frankenstein) mate, Boris Karloff plays the Mad  Scientist, and Peter Lorre plays Yetch, an igor style assistant who is in  love with Franchesca, a va-va-va-voom redhead who will have nothing to do  with him. All the major monsters make an appearence in this fun flick.   Written by Forrest J. Ackerman of horror genre fame.  A must have for  Rankin & Bass fanatics.
