 If you reviewed this book on it's recipes alone, it's a winner, with tons of tropical treats sure to delight you and your friends at your next kitschy luau shindig.  Easy to follow instructions and ingredient lists make mixing tasty exotic drinks a snap. But what I truly dug about this book, is the artwork which illustrates the book by kulture kulture maven Shag.  Shag, also known as Josh Agle (the last two letters of his first name and the first two letters of his last name make up his swanky alias) is well known in the kustom kulture set for his retro styled artwork, which evokes the feel of 50's and 60's magazine ads, and record covers.  The vividly colored clean illustrations he's drawn that accompany the drink recipes are just marvelous.  A tall chic woman with a big red turban, brandishing a large bottle of Rum, super swanky cocktail bars with hipsters a plenty, this book is a real treat not only for the tastebuds, but for the eyes as well.. Since I've gotten it, I've noticed all my friends have grabby hands when placed in direct proximity of it.  They have to pour over it, examining and exclaiming in joy at Shag's ultra kitschy cool artwork. I personally feel that as Shag's artwork becomes more widely known, this book is going to become a real collectors item.  Take it from me, and treat yourself to a copy today!
