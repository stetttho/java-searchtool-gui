 This volume reprints the original illustrated Chaos Comics comic book series Evil Ernie: Revenge #1-4 in a trade paperback, in which you discover Evil Ernie's (an undead teenaged psychopath capable of reanimating and controlling the dead) origins and background info on Ernie; see the destruction of New York City; and meet a religious zealot who is not terribly fond of Ernie.  Definately not for younger readers.  Highly enjoyable for fans of the horror and misfit hero comic book genre.
