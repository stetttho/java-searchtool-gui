 I love this CD to death!  It's got surf, rockabilly, and even some macabre mambo music.  This is hauntingly hip halloween party music you'll want to play all year round. It also features a spoken intro by Zacherley, the  famous TV Horror Host from the fifties.  He also sits in with the crazy fun  Southern Culture on the Skids for some spoken word on the track, Sinister  Purpose. This is one of those CD's I put in the player and hit repeat all  tracks and start working at the computer, because I enjoy all of it.  I  just have to get up from working occassionally to dance around madly.  The  artwork inside and out on the CD is also very killer, very retro creature  feature-esque. Fun stuff!
