 I needed a new mouse, and picked this one up.  Worked great for two weeks, then it died.  Returned it, got a replacement one, it died even faster.  Have opened it, to clean it out, and it didn't need cleaning, something inside of it internally just decided to up and die I suppose.  Just a big waste of time and money as far as I'm concerned.  This mouse deserves to get stuck in a trap.
