 Thank you to whoever saw fit to re-release this film onto video!  I grew up watching it on TV every Christmas, and just love Heat Miser & Snow Miser!  For the longest time, you couldn't purchase this on video, and my  local video store's rental copy had mysteriously vanished.  I was overjoyed  to see it available again and snatched it up.  My young daughter now is  addicted to this wonderful stop motion animated classic, and watches it  frequently.  For those who enjoy the songs, you might want to check out the  CD, A Classic Cartoon Christmas Too by Nick at Nite records, as it features  both the Heat Miser and Snow Miser songs on it!  Too much fun!
