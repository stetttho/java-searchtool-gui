 I bought this film since I am a former mortician, and I'm always dying for funny funeral home comedies.  Brothers Sam Grimm (Christopher Atkins)& Max Grimm (Perry Lang), inherit a combination mortuary & mortuary  school from their recently deceased uncle which is worth millions.  Only  catch is, they have to graduate from the school before they can collect on  their inheritance, and there's many an obstacle on their way to graduation.   The film pokes fiendish fun at the funeral industry, touching on all the  major touchy subjects, i.e. necrophilia, price gouging, bad embalming, and  ambulance chasing, etc.  I dont want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen  it, but a highlight of the film involves Wolfman Jack, and the band Radio  Werewolf singing "1960 Cadillac Hearse", which is a killer song!   It also features the comedic team of Paul Bartel (playing Paul Truscott)  & Mary Woronov (playing Mary Purcell), whom you might remember from the  hilarious films, "Rock & Roll High School", and "Eating  Raoul" as Mortuary School employees.  If you like morbid comedy, I  think you'll like this flick.
