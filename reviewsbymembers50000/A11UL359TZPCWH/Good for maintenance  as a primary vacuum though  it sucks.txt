 I purchased this as I originally lived in a small apartment and was short on space to store a conventional vacuum.  I turned out to be disappointed with it and found myself running to borrow my neighbors traditionally sized vacuum.  Why?  It was ok picking up tiny pieces of stuff, but had issues on anything larger.  The problem may be in the suction; it simply may not have enough to be used as a primary vacuum.  It had problems when it tried to pick up anything that wasn't on the extreme top surface of the carpet.  I sew a lot, and it couldn't get thread out of my carpet unless it was on the very top of the carpeting.  Grass or any leaves you've dragged in from out front?  Forget about it, it struggled with them as well.  I found myself going over the same piece of thread or a leaf over and over 'till I finally got frustrated and just bent over and picked the darn thing up. I have since moved to a home, and purchased a bigger vacuum.  I now use this Eureka superbroom vacuum for maintenance on surface stuff.  If you keep your carpet spotlessly clean with a more traditonally sized vacuum, this little guy may do well for you for maintenance.  I do like that you can remove the vacuum from the stick and use it as a corded hand held.  I zoom it over my drapes and upholstery where it annihilates little dust bunnies. As a primary vacuum however, I feel it sucks.  I just wanted to point that out in case anyone needed a small vacuum as their primary one like I did.  Happy cleaning.
