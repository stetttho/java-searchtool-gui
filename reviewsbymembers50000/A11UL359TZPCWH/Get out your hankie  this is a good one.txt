 This film is absolutely charming.  Lionel Barrymore is Julian Northrup or Gramps, a likeable curmudgeon who dotes on his grandson, Pud (Bobs Watson), a precious little boy.  Miss Nellie (Beulah Bondi), Pud's gramma is always happily aghast at the trouble that Gramps and Pud gets themselves into.  Pud's parents die tragically in a car accident.  They've been taken by Mr. Brink, the living embodiment of death, played by the very dapper Cedric Hardwicke.  Mr. Brink isn't done with their family however, and visits Gramps home. Through a chain of events, they discover that anyone who goes up into an apple tree in the backyard cannot get down until gramps tells them they can.  They trap Mr. Brink in the tree, and the story only gets better from there. I left watching this movie with a wonderfully comforted feeling, that loves knows no bounds.  I recommend this film to all my friends and family, it's a charmer. Don't let the color picture of the box displayed fool you, it's in it's original glorious black and white. If you enjoy the "love conquers death" movie genre, check out "What Dreams May Come" and "Death Takes a Holiday" which inspired the film, "Meet Joe Black".
