 First, this is not for kids, the main character, super heroine Kekkko  Kamen fights evil stark naked except for a Bunny style mask which hides her  secret identity.   Second, if you're an adult who digs on silly naughty  fun, grab it.  From the same folks who brought you the anime Cutey Honey,  really silly fun abounds when our heroine attends a boarding school, run by  a very weird and wacky bad guy, whom if I remember correctly, is called  something like the Big Evil Toenail (don't quote me on that, I've only seen  it once).  Wacky weirdness ensues, I wouldn't call it hentai, but I'd  definately call it fun. All in all, it's a good film to crack out when  you wanna laugh yourself silly, check it out!
