 Starring Lillith Stabs, gothic sex symbol, and buxom babes Roxanne Michaels, Lisann Devaul, and Glori-Anne Gilbert.  Directed by Everette Hartsoe   A man is out on the town, looking for some action. He decides  to use an escort service, and unfortunately he picks one where the girls  think he's quite yummy, literally. Not alot to it other than the ladies,  the film is low budget, and underdeveloped, but if you are a fan of gothic,  bondage, or horror themed T&A flicks, try it out, it's a shame they  don't have the box art, Lillith is quite the hottie with her jet black hair  with a big white streak in it laying in a coffin suggestively.
