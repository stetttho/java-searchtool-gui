 I live in an old drafty icebox of a house built in the 1930's. Even when I run my gas heater, it doesn't do much good.  I  needed a space heater, and bad! I was wary of buying a space  heater as I figured it couldn't help, but I'm glad I got this  one!  I read the instructions, followed their recommendations for a large room and in about 15 minutes it took the chill off and made it so much more comfortable!  It even reached into the surrounding hallway and dining room.  I'm quite pleased.  As a pet owner, I also appreciate the smaller vents that keep curious kitty cat's out of the heater.  My cats all congregate by it and there's no way for  them to get inside of it.
