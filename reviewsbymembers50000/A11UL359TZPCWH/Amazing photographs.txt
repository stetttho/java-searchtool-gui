 When I was a teen in the early eighties, I went to see the exhibit of these photos in SF, CA with my mother.  From what I understand, Richard Avedon traveled the American West, photographing people that he came across  in his everyday travels.  They weren't beautiful supermodels, they weren't  made up actors, they were real live people.  I remember like it was  yesterday, the huge black and white photos included the tired and haggard  teen girl on the cover, a snake handler holding a disemboweled rattlesnake,  a grizzled and mean looking prisoner with jail tattoos, insane asylum  patients with wild eyed stares, scruffy drifters and many more.  After the  show, I talked my mom into buying the book for me, and took it home, where  it's been a prized posession ever since.  Every time anyone comes over to  my home and checks it out, it always opens up a discussion.  When it went  out of print, I know that I was disappointed as folks always wanted a copy  after seeing my own, and I think it's great that it's been re-issued.  If  you are a fan of photography that captures the stark realism of the human  spirit, don't miss out on this book.
