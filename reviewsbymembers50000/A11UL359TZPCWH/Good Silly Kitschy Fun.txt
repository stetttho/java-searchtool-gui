 I had heard about the song, "The Lurch", by Ted Cassidy, who played the tall solemn barely speaking butler Lurch on The Addams Family television show in the sixties.  Well, I had to have it, and went out  looking for it.  Guess what?  The original 45rpm record was way too much  money for me, because not only is it appealing to Addams Family fanatics,  but it turns out it is a Northern Soul Dance Classic in the UK and the US,  so I thought my chances of ever getting a copy of the song was slim.  I was  really stoked when it came out on this CD compilation, otherwise I probaly  couldn't of afforded it.  The rest of the CD is good silly fun too, all I  can say is they're lucky they had other jobs!  Lots of good silly kitschy  fun abounds on this CD.
