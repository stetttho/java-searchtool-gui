 In "Bubble Boy," Jake Gyllenhaal plays Jimmy, a teen who suffers from severe immune deficiency, and is forced to come of age in the confines of a plastic bubble, set up in his parents' suburbia home.  Jimmy is smothered by his obsessively religious mother (Swoozie Kurtz), and doesn't seem to mind till he meets Chloe, the beautiful girl who visits from next door, whom he becomes very close to, and falls in love with.  When Chloe goes off  to get married, Jimmy decides he must pursue her, so he fashions himself a "travel bubble" and goes off in search of his true love across the country. Along the way, he meets a wide range of nutty characters, including the performers of a freak circus, the members of a religious cult, a motorcycle gang, and assorted other oddballs.  Gyllenhall (who starred in Donnie Darko as as of late) brings a genuinely sweet and charming quality to his performance as the heroic Jimmy much like Johnny Depp in Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands. Some folks may find it offensive, some of the humor is pretty over the top, but if you take it for what it is, good silly fun, I think you'll find it charming.  To me, the film was totally appealing and very entertaining, in a Tim Burton Pee Wee Big Adventure kinda way.  I laughed myself silly!
