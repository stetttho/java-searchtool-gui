 I devoured this book in about two days.  The short stories are entertaining and fun to read.  By far, my favorite was Dracuson's Driver by Richard Laymon.  A creepy man works at a seedy motel as a desk clerk, when  one evening, a hearse pulls up with a drop dead gorgeous driver.  She's not  alone, she has a coffin in the back, and weirdness ensues.  Fun read for  lovers of horror & vamp stories!
