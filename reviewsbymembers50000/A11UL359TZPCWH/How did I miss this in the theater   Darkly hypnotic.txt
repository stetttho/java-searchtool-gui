 The original thriller Donnie Darko brilliantly tells a tale of psychosis, bravery and sacrifice, wrapped up in a story of a compelling sci-fi styled mystery. Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) is given a four week head's up of the impending doom for Earth. His imaginary friend Frank lets him know, he's the 6 feet tall terrifying monster bunny in the mirror that no one but Donnie can see.  Even though he's heavily medicated, in therapy, and risking the wrath of his family, Donnie takes Frank the Bunny's advice unconditionally.  He feels he owes it to Frank, he saved his life after all.  His first piece of advice proved dead on, to leave his home in the middle of the night, which prevents Donnie from of all things, being smooshed by a giant jet engine which falls mysteriously to earth and crashes into his bedroom.  Now the troubled Donnie must cope with his secret and very scary friend taking him on eerie and fateful sleepwalking adventures, his troubles with his family and school, and dealing with growing feelings for a girl with her own set of problems, Gretchen, (jena malone) whose Mom is in the witness protection program. The film is imaginative, intelligent, well acted, challenging and thoroughly original.  Gyllenhaal underplays Donnie's mental problems which makes it all the more unnerving and hypnotic to watch.  I can't believe I missed it in the theater, word of mouth now that it's out on DVD and Video is this film's best friend, I cannot recommend it enough!
