 My mom gave me this book, after a recent minor surgery, to keep me occupied while I recovered.  I loved it!  I didn't put it down unless I had to (that pesky thing called sleep).  I've heard folks who say that this  isn't King's usual fare.  I think it is, because it's a pleasure to read.   For the last few years, I haven't read many of his newer books, and I  missed the feeling I got out of books like Night Shift, Christine,  Different Seasons, etc.  This book is pure 100% Steven King at his best,  and anyone who perhaps may of not read his work for awhile as I did will  want to give him a second chance, and check this out.  I think you'll be  just as pleased as I was.
