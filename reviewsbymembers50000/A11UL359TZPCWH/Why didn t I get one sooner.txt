 I had an old Zip100, which was awesome, but it was a parallel port and I  could never could get it to work properly with my printer on my new  computer, a Compaq Presario. Reluctantly moving into the year 2000, I  retired the old one and bought this new model since my new computer has USB  ports.  I wish I had sooner!  I love it!  It was extremely easy to install,  after doing 6 quick steps which took five minutes of my time if that, I'm  downloading all kinds of stuff! My little brother and daughter are really  fond of downloading MP3's and other files which take up tons of my hard  drive, and it drove me crazy, but now I just gave them each a zip disk and  told 'em when it's full, they're out of luck.  The price of the disks did  seem overwhelming at first, but when you realize how many files they can  hold, it's well worth it opposed to having a zillion annoying little A  drive disks. As for annoying qualities, I have to agree with the other  reviewers, when you eject the disk, it shoots out like a bullet.  Be  prepared for that, it took me by surprise! It's a small price to pay for  something that makes your computer experience so darn pleasant!
