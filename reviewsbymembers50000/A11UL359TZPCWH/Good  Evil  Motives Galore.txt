 Ross MacDonald received the Mystery Writers of America Grand Master Award,  and it's easy to see why. Though this novel is over thirty years old, it is  a meticulous, finely written, moody, introspective novel which can be read  and enjoyed today easily. It is hardly dated at all, with the exception of  some minor details.  Full of interesting complex characters, this book is  full of the stuff which excellent detective novels are made of:  good,  evil, and motives galore. As with MacDonald's books, it is complicated  and moves to and fro to a degree that careful reading is necessary, but  definately well worth it. While you're reading, the pace increases, the  tension rises, the scenes are wonderfully interesting and the characters  are delightfully real. The clues are precisely set out and carefully  explained as the novel progresses.  An excellent read for detective novel  fans!
