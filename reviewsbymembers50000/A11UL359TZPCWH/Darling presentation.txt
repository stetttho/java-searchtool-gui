 I don't see it listed here at the time of this review, so I'll list the details on this item since I own it.  Complete and unagridged with all the original illustrations by Sir John Tenniel including 16 full-color plates.  2 small books about as big as my palm in a cardboard box / sleeve type case.  Charming.
