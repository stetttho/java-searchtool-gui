 I was stuck in the torment which is a really old small monitor.  When I would surf, most web sites didn't show up correctly because of it, and I decided to buy a new monitor.  I chose this one, for the price, and because  a friend recommended it to me, having purchased one himself. When I  plugged this one in, it was like the scene in Wizard of Oz, when it goes  from black in white to color.  Amazing.  The difference it made in viewing  web pages is awesome.   I primarily use mine for web surfing, word  processing and some graphics design, and I've been quite pleased. The  monitor works with both my current computer, a Pentium III, and my old one,  an AMD-K6.  It was very easy for me to hook up, and I didn't even have to  use the software which came with it, it already was compatible with my  computer, which was a plus.  I love just being able to plug things in and  go! I set out looking for a moderately priced monitor with a clear crisp  picture, and I got it.  I'm completely satisfied. The only thing negative  I can think to say is that it takes up alot of room on my computer desk!   It's quite big and bulky.  But for the price and picture quality, it's a  small price to pay.
