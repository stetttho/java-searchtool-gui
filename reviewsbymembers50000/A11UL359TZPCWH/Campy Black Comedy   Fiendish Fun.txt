 Burton plays Baron Kurt Von Sepper, a wealthy Austrian upper crust aristocrat with a dark blue beard. He marries Greta (Karin Schubert), but she dies in a tragic hunting "accident." He meets street smart American showgirl, Anne (Joey Heatherton, who has a semi nude scene) and marries her after a whirlwind romance. One night alone at the Baron's palace Anne makes the ghastly discovery of a secret freezer chock full of former wives.  Smart Anne tries to buy time before she becomes the newest addition to the freezer by convincing Bluebeard to tell her how all the women met their fates.  He starts to tell her the tale of how each former wife met her fate. Before I go any further, let me say that this film is overdone, campy, and sometimes, well, bad. But that is what makes it fun. The various ways that Bluebeard got rid of his other wives is absolutely hilarious. Virna Lisi, Nathalie Delon (along with her lesbian lover Sybil Danning), Raquel Welch, Marilu' Tolo, and Agostina Belli all die in some very interesting and campy ways.  This is fiendishly fun black comedy at it's over the top best. The color on this copy is gorgeous and rich, and the musical score is perfect for this macabre mischief. If you like campy black comedy, check it out!
