 While not as well known as some Rankin & Bass stop motion animated films such as "A Year Without a Santa Claus", this film is not anything less than what you'd expect from Rankin & Bass. Absolutely  charming. Very sweet & touching tale of Nestor, a donkey with  extremely long ears.  He's ridiculed and made fun of, and his only source  of comfort and love is his mother, who loves him unconditionally.  Nestor  and his mother end up lost in the snow, and unfortunately, his mother dies  protecting Nestor from the elements, which no matter how old I get sends me  into a crying jag. (I don't mean to ruin it for anyone, I just thought I'd  give parents the heads up to prepare the little ones for it). But it's  true what does not kill you makes you stronger, and Nestor goes on to  divine greatness.   A touching and sweet holiday film indeed.
