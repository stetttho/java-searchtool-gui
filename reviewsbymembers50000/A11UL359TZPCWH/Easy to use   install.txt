 I got this, not having installed a printer before, and I was terrified.  Thankfully, it was easy for me to install, and it has been very easy to use! The images print out clearly, and quite quickly.  I have run this on  both my old AMD K6, and my current computer, a Pentium III, and on both it  has performed quite well. My family has always purchased epson products,  and I see why, I'm very satisfied with my purchase!
