 I got this phone about four months ago, and I couldn't be more pleased!  The answering machine portion works great, the voices come out clear, not garbled like with some digital answering machines.  It's easy for me to skip through messages if I don't want to listen to the whole thing, I just hit erase, and it's instantly gone.  It's got great reception, very clear, even when I stray far from the base.  I am impressed at how durable it is, I'm very hard on phones.  My cat kicks it off the coffee table repeatedly, and I've dropped it a million times it seems, and it keeps on working.  Yes, you do have to hit the "off" button to end the call.  With all it's good points, I really don't mind having to turn it off when I'm done with a call.  As to the programming, yes, I had to use the manual, but it was fairly easy for me to figure it out, and I'm usually inept at that kind of stuff.  I could not be more pleased with it!
