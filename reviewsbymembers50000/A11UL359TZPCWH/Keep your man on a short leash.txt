 If you want a serious self help book to help you over a break up, this isn't it. If you want to seriously laugh your hiney off, nab this book! I got this book as a gift, after a particularly nasty break up had  left me quite down in the dumps.  I read it, and laughed myself silly!    With slick artwork, and smart and funny one liners, this book is a total  joy for anyone who's had man problems.  The comparisons of men to dogs is  so uncanny it's truly funny. My favorite?  The bit where it quips:  "if your dog runs away, do not chase after it, it will only make him  run faster, instead, dangle a colorful plaything in his face, he will come  running back".  The illustration to this one liner is a woman dangling  a colorful piece of lingerie in a man's face. As I said, serious self  help it's not, but you know what they say, laugher is the best medicine.   Read this book, especially with a best girlfriend, laugh yourself silly,  and cheer up. Men are like buses, another will be by in fifteen minutes.
