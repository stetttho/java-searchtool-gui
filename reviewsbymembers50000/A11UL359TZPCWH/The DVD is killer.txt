 The extras on this DVD are killer!  The commentary by director Don Coscarelli and actors Michael Baldwin, Reggie Bannister, and Bill Thornbury, and Angus Scrimm was entertaining, and gave me an insight on what went on during the filming. My only complaint about the commentary was that the parts with Angus seemed dubbed in, as if he wasn't there with the others.  After awhile, I didn't notice anymore, as I was enthralled with what they were discussing, it really delved into what Don Coscarelli vision for the whole film was.  They also went into all the actual locations the film was shot at, which was a real treat for me as a fan of this horror series. It features the original Theatrical trailers, and TV spots, which used to give me the shivers when I was a child. What was also a great addition was deleted scenes and behind the scenes footage shot by a crew member who brought a home movie camera on the set. The gallery of international promo materials such as lobby cards and newspaper ads were great.  Angus Scrimm and a very young Don Coscarelli are featured in a 1979 interview which was lots of fun.  Another rarity on the dvd was a UK disco version of the Phantasm theme, too much! I used my computer's DVD player (compaq presario pentium III) to view it, and I was concerned with all the extra features it'd freeze up on me, but it didn't.  This is a top notch DVD all the way. I'm thrilled to death I got it!
