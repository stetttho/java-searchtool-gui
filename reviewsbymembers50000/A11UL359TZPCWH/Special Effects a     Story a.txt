 I was very impressed by the Komodo Dragon special effects, which were done by the team that did the dinosaur effects for Jurassic Park. I was not  impressed by the story, which was disappointing. Some exotic animal  smugglers accidentally dump a bunch of komodo dragon eggs on an island in  South? Carolina, and 20 years later, starved and hungry, they attack a  family.  An evil oil company has been covering up the existance of the  komodo's, as they are an endangered species and their discovery would  interrupt their oil pumping.  To make a long story short, the komodo's  chase a bunch of people around the island, and try to eat them. Don't get  me wrong, I love horror movies.  But this one?  It wasn't horror as much as  it was just plain sad.  It just seemed so senseless.  In the film Cujo,  Cujo is violent and terrifying because he has rabies.  In the Birds, you  don't really know why they're attacking, which is part of the fun. But  this flick, the Komodos weren't meant to be there, they were just eating  folks because they were hungry, and I don't know, I guess I just felt sorry  for the big lizards.  I know, I'm a softy when it comes to critters. If  you are a fan of special effects, check this out.  In my opinion however,  just don't expect alot more than great special effects.
