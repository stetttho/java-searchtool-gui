 I like the scumbuster.  Key word being: Like.  It wasn't nearly as powerful as I thought, and I found myself going back to scrubbing tough stains out by hand.  If I pushed down hard with the scumbuster, it'd just either stop, or else strain and go slower.  I must admit though, I find it works well for maintenance.  I clean everything by hand really well when it needs it, and to maintain it, I zip over it with the scumbuster.  I don't regret getting it, but it definitely didn't do what I imagined.
