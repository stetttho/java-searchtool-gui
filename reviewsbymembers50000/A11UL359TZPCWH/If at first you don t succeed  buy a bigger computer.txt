 I received this scanner as a gift, and the salesman assured my mother that it would work on an AMD K6, which I owned at the time. It did not. In fact, it froze up my computer and sent it into safe mode, which terrified  me, and back it went in the box.  Later down the road, I purchased a new  Pentium III, installed it, and it has been fine (knock on wood!). My only  current complaints are this: The scanning surface is a bit small, not  much bigger than a standard piece of notebook paper, which can be  irritating when you have larger images or text to scan. Bundled with the  necessary drivers for the scanner, is a program called Oplimit LE, which is  an optical character recognition program, which I installed, only to find I  wasn't going to use it.  When I went to uninstall it, it had no automatic  uninstall feature, and removing it was a major pain in the butt.  My emails  to tech support took several days to get a reply.  It was a major hassle.
