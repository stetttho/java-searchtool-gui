 Curious horror anthology is loosely based on the works of horror novelist R. Chetwynd-Hayes, portrayed by John Carradine as an active partaker in his own tales. The author is invited by a smooth vampire (the fabulous Vincent Price) to go with him to The Monster Club, where he bears witness to the secret social customs of various monsters, which evidently include drinking, dancing, and watching undead stripping Go Go Ghouls. He is also educated to the mating patterns of these creatures, whose tendency to inter-breed creates such new strains of monsters.  All of this is interjected by short stories featuring campy yet fun monsters running amok.  A fun side note is that the movie features music by pop-reggae band UB40.  Have no sense of humor?  Avoid this film.  Love campy fun?  Don't miss out.
