 This is a great CD, but are you looking for the song that plays in episode 122, in the scene for "Brian's private party" with the scarf, the dance version of Happy Feet by Jack Hylton & His Orchestra?  Check out the CD Something For Everybody: Baz Luhrmann by Baz Luhrmann (also on Amazon), and you'll find Happy Feet (High Heels Mix by BLAM, remixed by PAUL MAC).
