 A group of aspiring horror movie filmmakers are making a low budget horror  flick in an old hospital, when they come across what seems to be the  ultimate prop in the basement.  A giant coffin like device, complete with  the dead body of Dr. Eibon (who suspiciously looks like Rob Zombie)  inside! They are of course, thrilled to death, and decide to put it in  their film.  To their horror, the device calls forth what I only can  describe as a paralell world of the undead.  From there on out, it's a  fight for their lives against an undead world. I found the film is very  entertaining, and is chock full with in-jokes and tributes to some of the  famous horror filmmakers, most notably, the dearly departed horror king,  Lucio Fulci. The film has a killer soundtrack, which the highlights of is  music from the deathrock band Penis Flytrap (fronted by Dinah Cancer, of 45  Grave fame).  The music adds to the creepy frenzied quality of the film,  it's a winner. All in all, a good flick for Zombie fanatics!
