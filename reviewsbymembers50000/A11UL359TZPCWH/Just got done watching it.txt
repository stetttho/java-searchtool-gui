 and I loved it every minute!  It was great!  I was so drawn into it, I didn't want it to end.  Nicholas Cage plays an ambulance driver at the end of his rope in New York City in the early 90's.  Haunted by the guilt of a  patient he couldn't save, he wanders the film as if in a daze, trying to  make his wrongs right, and I felt like I was along for the ride.  The  camera work is incredible, and I found myself rewinding it just to check it  out again!  (I dont want to ruin it for those who haven't seen it, or I'd  give specific examples) In addition, the soundtrack works great with the  film, Nicholas Cage racing down the street in an ambulance with The Clash  blaring in the background just works.  Check it out, I think you'll dig it!
