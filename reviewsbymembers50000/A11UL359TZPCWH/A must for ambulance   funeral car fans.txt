 This book is a must have for funeral car & ambulance fans!  120 Black & White approx 8 X 10 sized photos of American built Ambulances & Ambulance combinations in all their glory before in the 1970's, tighter  fuel economy standards downsized the US automobile, and Federal Ambulance  design regulations became more and more stringent.  All of this led to the  demise of the passenger car based ambulance. Coachworks include Superior,  Miller, Meteor, Sayers & Scovill, Hess & Eisenhardt, Flxible,  Eureka, Henney, National, Barnette, Memphian, Comet, Siebert, and  Cotner-Bevington.  All built on luxury car chassis such as Cadillac, La  Salle, Packard.  Also includes pics of ambulances built on Chrysler, Buick,  Pontiac, Studebaker, Lincoln, Chevrolet, Ford, and Oldsmobile chassis.    Also contains useful info on some of the cars, but I have to say the  emphasis in this book is on the photos.  All in all, I love having this  book in my collection!
