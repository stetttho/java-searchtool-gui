 I own this, and it's not actually gingham as described, it's pink and white stripes on the bust, skirt and hat.  The bodice and trim are solid pink.  The whole thing is made of a stretchy material, with the solid pink looking almost like spandex, it's shiny with the striped portion non-shiny.  It's got red crosses and a faux lace up effect also in red.  It's not easy to get the petticoat I got separately like in the picture to line up with the skirt, but it's still cute.
