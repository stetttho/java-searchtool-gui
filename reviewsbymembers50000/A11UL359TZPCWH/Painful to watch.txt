 I got this, expecting a horror movie, instead, I got a really badly done softcore porn film hiding behind some badly written wanna be horror stories.  There are about 4 short stories, all with intros by Terence Stamp  (who recently starred in the film, The Limey).  The stories are poorly  done, and seem like they're just excuses to show badly shot softcore sex  scenes.  If you're looking for a horror video with lots of short stories,  check out the fiendishly fun Creepshow (1982).  Heck, if you're looking for  Softcore sex with a horror theme, try Vampire Call Girls or even the  T&A flick Nudist Colony of the Dead!  Anything but this!  I hated it!
