 My young daughter adores the Ranma anime series, and I've found it cheaper to bite the bullet and buy the box set instead of purchasing them separately. I save money overall, and in the case of the Ranma box sets, we  always get some free goody.  On this box set, the goody is a free bonus  opening and ending theme CD. The box contains all twelve volumes of the  Hard Battle series of Ranma 1/2. Here's the names of the tapes, as I dont  see them listed on this amazon page. Ranma 1/2: Hard Battle Vol. 1 - Ukyo  Can Cook,  Vol. 2 - Dim Sum Darling, Vol. 3 - Dharma Chameleon, Vol. 4 -  Once Upon a Time in Jusenkyo, Vol. 5 - Pretty Womanhood, Vol. 6 - Suddenly  Sasuke, Vol. 7 - Meloncholy Baby, Vol. 8 - Back to the Happosai, Vol. 9 -  Da Doo Ling-Ling, Lung-LungVol. 10 - Smells Like Evil Spirit, Vol. 11 -  Soap Gets in Your Eyes, Vol. 12 - Mirror, Mirror The twelve tapes in  total run about 600 minutes, and she's never grown tired of watching them  again and again.  Fun stuff for the Ranma fan!  If you've never seen Ranma  before, I'd recommend getting one of the full length movies first, to see  if you like it.  Try Big Trouble in Nekonron China, that's what got my  daughter into Ranma.  Enjoy!
