 I bought this as a gift for my 13 year old daughter, who is an anime addict.  As I do with all her tapes, I previewed it first, and I really enjoyed it.  My daughter, was hesitant to watch it, she usually watches  stuff along the lines of Sailor Moon, Saber Marionettes, etc.  But when she  did, she loved it too!  Intriguing story line and lovely animation, I think  it's a great film!  Very age appropriate for a young teen.
