 The product sounds just fine.  I had the same opinion as many of the 1-star reviews, the sound was rather bad...then I figured out how to fit the plugs into the ears properly, then everything sounded fantastic.  I do have to adjust the plug once in a while, but overall, the small caps provide a good fit.  The only thing I wish for was a cap made from a more "sticky" substance, like ear plug foam (like the ones that comes with shure's).  I'll probably fashon one by modifying a foam earplug and gluing it onto a pair of unused caps.
