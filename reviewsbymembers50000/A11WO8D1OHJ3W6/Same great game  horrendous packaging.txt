 I've rediscovered scrabble to become one of my favorite games.  I have owned the standard edition for some time, and I was pleased with it's very reasonable price, simplicity, and durability of the pieces.  And I don't think I need to repeat the glowing praise of other posts about the ingenuity of the game itself. This is why I am very, very disappointed with the recent decline in the quality of these scrabble series by Milton-Bradley.  I have purchased a second set for my friend and a travel version for myself, only to discover that the board on the standard edition is not evenly glued, along with tacky background.  And the true horror struck me as I opened the travel edition, hopeful that the increased price would bring me a better quality package. I was completely appalled by the horrible craftsmanship of this set.  Cheap plastic is used throughout the case, and (as mentioned by the other posts) the cardboard was found dislodged from the clear plastic case.  It would have been somewhat reasonable if that occurred during the shipment, but upon further inspection, I found that both hinges had cracks in it, as well as the ruddy-brown, untextured plastic cover had a large scratch across it.  Furthermore, one of the pin which holds the hinge together was missing, and other was loose, and could not be put back because it was bent. I find this product to be an insult to the users.  While I would pay triple this price to get a more well crafted, elegantly designed set (why not a leather box travel edition?  I would buy that in a second!), it either does not exist or not well distributed. Anyway, I have seen the older pocket edition, and I am going to search for a seller soon.  Do not buy this product, it is not even worth the price of the standard edition.
