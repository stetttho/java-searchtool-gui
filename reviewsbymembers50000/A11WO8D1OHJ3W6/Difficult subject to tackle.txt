 This book is the first book that tries to specifically address some of the most common tasks when programming a script, which is to convert data from one format to another.  Programming for this task is not difficult, but it is time-consuming, hence the author tries to impart as much time-saving wisdom for the process as possible.    The book properly uses platform independent codes and examples (with one exception of modification of .ini file), which correctly identifies the audience that will have to work with multiple platforms.    Unfortunately, many parts are written in case-by-case fashion, and each case takes three to four pages, so the reader will have to devote some time following his story of the format in question to gain some knowledge.  Thus, it is more of a tutorial than a reference.   My wish is that the book covered more conversion cases using the same principles, instead of covering many principles by only a handful of conversion cases.  The great point about this book is that it does cover the relevant techniques for the majority of the conversions.    The book leaves out the case of scientific data conversions, which the author deems too deep, broad, and merits a separate volume.  Although this omission is disappointing, the book is general enough to be applied to my specialized field (bioinformatics).    Hopefully, more books will address this important topic of *practical* data conversion.
