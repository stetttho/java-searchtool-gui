 Imagine how you would feel if someone released a film with some other racist caricatures - a blackface dancer, perhaps, and it so happens that the director happens to be black! Does that make the caricature more acceptable? More authentic?  I think not. In my opinion, Tan had produced something very, very ugly. Amy Tan had become famous for her book that this film was based on. The film popularized the story to the movie-watching community. She is now considered to be a leading figure in the Asian American literature. But my impression so far was of Tan's tortured and distorted view of her original culture - it makes me sad to think that for many people, Tan's misguided work was their first exposure to Asian culture. It is difficult to imagine that the author could have been unaware of the Hollywood stereotypes of Asian culture. I've recently read an interview where Tan states that her fiction should not be regarded as an instrument that breaks these stereotypes.  But if that is the case, why would she, who is an Asian herself, work to perpetuate the misconception of her own culture? So, I was particularly disturbed when I watched this film.  I was angered not because it did not promote some positive image about Asians - to be fair, I don't think this was intended to be considered a political statement.  And my basic assumption about watching a film is only to be entertained.  However, Tan's work simply insults the viewer's intelligence by capitalizing on her ethnicity to place authenticity to the stereotype that she kowtows to in the film.  And that itself makes this movie worthless to watch, in my opinion. I just wanted you to be aware of this before you purchase this DVD.
