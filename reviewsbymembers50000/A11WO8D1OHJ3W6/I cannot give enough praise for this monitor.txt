 I have been using this monitor for aobut three months now.  The picture is exceptionally bright, even, colorful, and balanced.  I was concerned about the glare off the acrylic screen protector, but it turns out it is easier to avoid glare than the "naked" models (they simply diffuse the glare).  It is extremely easy to clean, I wonder why other manufacturers won't do this.  The quality control is very good: absolutely no defects.  The monitor has a futuristic "Star-Trek control panel" looks to it, but it it is done in such a tasteful manner that it does not get old at all.  Movies are great on this monitor, but it is absolutely perfect for text and gives me no eyestrain for those 8-hour coding/writing/analysis sessions.  I have not seen a better monitor, especially at this price.  Highly recommended.
