 For those of you who hoped that Uriel's Machine was one of the several items discovered in the basement of RosslynChapel......it isn't. (It isn't even a machine.) Except for a short update in the appendix about the progress of the Rosslyn Chapel dig, this book has little or nothing to do with the intriguing theme of the authors' previous two books, The Hiram Key, and The Second Messiah.  However, once over that disappointment, you will find that this book has great stature on its own. Knight and Lomas have a talent for interpreting history in such a fresh and convincing manner that you can never view traditional history the same way again. Among other things in this book, the authors give us new information about 1) "The Flood", 2) the development of pre-historical civilization, 3) the Book of Enoch, 4) the importance of the megalithic structures in Great Britain, 5) the prominence of Venus, and 6) a possible pre-historic universal unit of measure. They tie much of this to Freemasonic doctrine and rituals as only they can do.  This is another solid entry into an area I call "New History", that is, the recent surge of works by Hancock, Baigent, Leigh, Lincoln, Knight, Lomas, Gardner, Thiering, et.al. which are regaling us with fascinating new insights into many significant areas of history, theology, technology, and culture. Given all the recent discoveries and revelations about ancient civilizations. It won't be long before the concept of "prehistory" will be "a thing of the past".
