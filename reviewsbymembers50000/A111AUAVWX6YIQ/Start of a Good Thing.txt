 I actually read this book several years ago, and still hold it in high regard as an historical study. Its substantial value to all of us, though,is that it was the progenitor of a flood of works by many other authors who, emboldened by this daring,controversial book, stormed the traditional halls of history with fresh insights and vigorous research, opening up fascinating new vistas into our ancient past. Gardner, Hancock, Thiering, Bauval, Knight, Lomas, Lockhart, Sinclair, Picknett, Prince, and others all owe a debt of gratitude to the courage of Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln for being the first to show the world that the "history" which we all learned in school and in church has serious flaws, many of which are related to sensitive, fundamental religious belief and doctrine.  If you haven't read the book yet, get the paperback edition, which has in its introduction a section that summarizes all the backlash the authors endured in the years between the publication of the hardcover edition and the paperback edition.  As far as the book itself goes, it is a fun read; almost like a mystery novel, except that it is non-fiction with real historical figures and events. The sequel, The Messianic Legacy, picks up where the first book ends, and carries its theme right up to the present day.  Do yourself a favor, and read these two works. They are rewarding in their own right, and lay the groundwork for many related and significant works to follow.
