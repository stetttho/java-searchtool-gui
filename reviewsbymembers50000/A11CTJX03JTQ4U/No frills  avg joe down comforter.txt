 from the reviews on this site, i bought this when it was on sale for $79.  I was expecting a near-luxury bedding comforter, but it is not.  It is a little noisy, but tolerable.  The thread count is just sufficient.  i have another one that's 300+ thread count and is much smoother.  Also, I'm returning my because it is leaking feathers already.  Could be an anomoly, but I've decided to choke up some cash and get a premium comforter to keep for years.  This one is a sufficient shortterm solution.
