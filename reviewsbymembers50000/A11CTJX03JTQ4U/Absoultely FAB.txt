 The best set of pots and pans you can get, for this price, to get ANYONE started!  I cook more than the average joe, and I'm thoroughly impressed by this set.   The lid on the pot is awesome!  I use it all the time, to drain the water out, from cooking crabs to washing fruit, this is a great set. Worth every penny.
