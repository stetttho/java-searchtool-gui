 I'm not an axe guru by any means, but I needed to chop down some trees, and saw this axe and it's great reviews when it was on sale.  I bought it, and it is simply amazing.  It takes down branches, stomps so easily.  My friend loved it too.  We got a kick out of using it and chopped down the ugly trees in my front yard.  A great tool for the gardener/firewood splitter.
