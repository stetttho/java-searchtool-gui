 I have seen the original Japanese uncut version, which, since it's from Japan, contains much more sexual and gore content.   But don't be confused.  This is not some cheap porno cartoon.  The movie itself has a very twisted, but deep and many sad parts.  The creator here has a movie that will really intrigue you as you watch this movie.  It's much deeper than an action movie.  Tons of human emotions are involved.   Highly recommended for Anime Fans who are Adults.  It's not appropriate for children.
