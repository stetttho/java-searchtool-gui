 I have been contemplating whether to buy a decked-out 19-20" LCD or the Samsung LCD TVs that the XBOX booths are using for the last 2-3 months.    Came across this Ferrari monitor, and since I have been looking at the Samsung  23 and 26 inch TVs, my price sensitivity has been inflated and felt dropping ~$550-600 for a 20inch LCD was acceptable.  Given that I wanted a dual functioning LCD and TV, the Ferrari really appealed to me.  I was about to order it, but I'm glad I poked around on A9 for more reviews.  - This monitor, according to many review sites, (and many from other continents), HAS a TV tuner built in.  This is great since I would've been able to plug in my DVD player, etc, and living in a 400 sq ft apt, it's ideal for me.    - But the REALITY = North America models DOES NOT have the TV inputs built in.  Why the reason Acer removed them, I do not know.  It's a shame, because I was this close to buying it.  Looks very attractive, regardless, but without the TV functionality, $570-$600 is too much to drop just for a nice chassis, paint job, and the Ferrari emblem.    I'm going for the Samsung instead sometime soon.  Acer America - you should do more market R&D first before deciding to pull the TV tuner/input feature.
