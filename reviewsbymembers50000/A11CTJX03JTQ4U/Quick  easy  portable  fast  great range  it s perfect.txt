 Though only a 802.11b, this little USB wireless adapter is the best out there.  I spend about $35 for it 1/2 year ago, and basically bought it without any prior reviews information.  Lucky me, this lightweight, portable USB adapter works like a charm.  Install the drivers in XP after it's plugged in, and you're up and running.  Even has Linux drivers and support!  (I haven't tried this yet though).    This is the best thing you can buy for under $50.  Great for laptops too!
