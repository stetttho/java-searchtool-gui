 This is an amazing book.  I heard about it from my ex-girlfriend's mom.  Having seen the rave reviews, and appreciating good self-guide books, I bought all 4 of D. Ruiz's books.    Mastery of Love is the one I found most useful.  Don Miguel's book is easy to read, large print, <200 pages or so.  Every page is fully utilized with some of the best, deep, applicable information you can get and apply to your daily relationships, to both your partner and everyone else.    The book teaches you how to love - yourself, others, how to appriate things in life, how to give, and how to live.  Everyone goes through life and need to soul search one time or another.  This is a great book to help guide those, interested in improving their relationship, with themselves and also others.  A must read.  It has made me aware of many things I did not notice before in terms of key points in a relationship.  You will not be dissappointed and this will be the best book under $15 you will have ever read.
