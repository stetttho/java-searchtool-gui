 This chainsaw is great.  It cuts fast and smooth, even for small trees the diameter of a baseball bat head.  Convenient for reaching up or down to trim bushes and branches.   5 stars and 1/2 if not for the terrible / basically nonexistent asembly instruction.  It's easy to assemble this unit, but they have NO diagrams, but only words.  I wasted about 45 min trying to figure it out.   Another advice:  Make sure you adjust the chain tension slowly and correctly.  It makes a world of difference when cutting.  Careful with the chains when adjusting too.  I cut my finger when I was in a rush.   A great saw regardless.
