 I don't udnerstand what the other reviewer was complaining about.  This is a great functional microwave.  For $30 shipped, no complaints.  No digital input buttons for time, but a dial instead, but no big deal.  Rotating dish, power level, all you need is there.   My only complaint is that it doesn't light up when you open the door, only when it's actually cooking does the light go on.  Not a good design there.
