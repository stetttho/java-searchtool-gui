 I love this Pfaltzgraff dinnerware set.  I had purchased another 16-piece design set from another site, and I was very pleased with the quality of them.  I bought these when Amazon had an amazing sale on them, and they are just really stunning.  Worth every single penny I paid for them.  If you can get this for under fifty bucks, buy it, you won't regret it!
