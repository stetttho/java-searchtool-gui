 The Bluetooth GPS Receiver from Belkin offers a high-performance, easy-to-use link to the global positioning system in a compact, mobile design. The Receiver shows your position in real time on street-level maps and moves with you as you travel, so you can view your current location in relation to your destination. The included software indicates your speed, direction of travel, elevation, latitude, and longitude within 10 meters. Install our navigation software on your Pocket PC, Tablet PC, or Bluetooth notebook to find your way through any city in the US or Canada, and quickly identify your current position as well as a destination or point of interest. Routes can be calculated and viewed immediately, and automated voice prompts instruct when and where to turn. Should you by chance venture "off-route," the Software issues a warning alert and the system redirects you to your destination from your current position.  The Receiver extends your operating range with a built-in, high-sensitivity mode. It acquires and continues to track satellite signals at much lower signal levels than other GPS solutions and will work in previously inaccessible environments, such as severe urban canyons, parking garages, through dense foliage, multilevel freeways and, in many cases, indoors.  *	Features complete nationwide coverage for the US and Canada* *	Supports both laptops and Pocket PCs *	Comes with a Belkin 2-Year Warranty *	Provides real-time routing with turn-by-turn voice and visual prompts *	Provides a mobile solution with a light and compact design *	Tracks GPS signals at far lower levels in high-sensitivity mode than other GPS models *	Uses removable, rechargeable lithium-polymer battery to provide up to 10 hours of continuous operation *	Helps you plan trips easily with pinpoint accuracy, using included Belkin software *	Tracks position using data from 12 satellites, within 10m of destination *	Lets you choose destinations by address, intersection, point of interest, or contacts *	Offers dynamic reroute and detour options *	Provides 4 types of map views *	Alerts user to speed level *	Records your trip for future playback *	Supports Windows XP, 2000, Me, and Pocket PC *	Please Note:The Bluetooth GPS Receiver from Belkin will work with Palm T1, T2, T3, Sony Clie PEG-NC90, PEG-TG50 and Mac OSX (Software not included).
