 I was given this book by a friend to read, and I find since receiving it I can't put it down. I've always been somewhat interested in this sort of true adventure genre, as well as history and 'occult history' (for lack of  a better term). So far, at half way through, I find myself throughly  enjoying the theories put out, as well as the historical background  presented about pre-Columbus explorers and the Americas. I would think that  this book has definatly opened my eyes to a new genre of literature I've  previously avoided.
