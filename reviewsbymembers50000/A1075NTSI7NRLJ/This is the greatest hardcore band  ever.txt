 No, seriously.  I haven't paid attention to this music in 14 years or so, but I recently unearthed a tape with a few songs from Born Against on it and I forgot just how incredible it all was, all that time passed and chrous for "Mary and Child" still sets my blood to boiling. I guess the only people who'll ever see this are other 30-something dinosaurs like myself, so I'm likely just preaching to the choir, but on the rare chance you're someone who wishes they could find some of the best tunes of true oldschool hardcore, you could do alot worse than starting off with Born Against.
