  Awful. Truly awful. Completely, totally, and utterly awful. Awful beyond any shade of terrible.  Maybe I'm being too nice about it?  I wish I could not only have my money back, but be able to sit down and politely request that the producers, performers, label, and anyone else involved in this could possibly recall each and every copy of it and then bury it deep beneath the Earth...Wait, someday a future archelogist would find it and wonder if we were all stupid. Although, looking at the average 4.5 star review, doesn't make me wonder if they're right.  See, the Gorillaz, it was this clever idea. A synthetic rock band. No rock egos. No banner names. Just good music and a clever front, right? Right! Invented a neat little history, and interesting biographies for the members and built up an entire world around it, with what amounted to very good ensemble music at its core, and some really cool promos to go with them that play off the whole thing.   But, then this atrocity comes along. The cuteness is gone. The rock music is gone, replaced by computer farts. The backstory is gone, in the name releasing singles. The ensemble is broken, replaced by incessant Alburn-whining and the aforementioned beeping nonsense.  I listened to this album once. It was hard, but I made myself do it. I haven't touched it once, since. I still enjoy the previous two Gorillaz albums (the debut and Spacemonkeyz), either one of which would be a FAR SUPERIOR purchase than this.
