 Wanna be a Joe Strummer fan? Buy this record.  I never cared really for the Clash or Joe Strummer. Sure, I liked the token Clash songs, but that's about it. Until a friend played this for me one night. The first half of this record is simply amazing. Every song is a winner. The second half isn't quite as good, but is still great. From "Global A Go-Go" I found myself purchasing the rest of the Joe Strummer catalogue. Repeated listening pushes me to start looking into some of the bands mentioned in the actual song "Global A Go-Go," and from there I've since discovered an entire world of quality, classic, Jamaican rocksteady, ska, and roots. This record changed my life. No, really. Well, alright, just my record-buying life. What, you've never heard of hyperbole? It really is that good, though.
