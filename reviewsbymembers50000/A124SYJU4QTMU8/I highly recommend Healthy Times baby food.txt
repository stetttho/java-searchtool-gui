 I generally make my own baby food, but I buy jars to supplement for when I am short on time or am traveling with the baby. I first tried Gerber's food. While at the health store, I saw Healthy times brand and decided to try it. There is no competition as far as I am concerned. Healthy times smells and more importantly, TASTES like food I would eat. Gerber's, especially their meat products, smell and taste like typical processed food. Their meat products taste like potted meat or spam...blech! This stuff is so tasty, my baby would eat it all, despite the flavors (she didn't like Gerber peaches, but loves HT's peaches). It's good stuff! This particular flavor is her favorite.
