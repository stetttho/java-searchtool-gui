 This is a cute book with a new way of presenting the story - it uses clear window panes for the illustrations. The only fault I have with it is that it doesn't have enough pictures of the cast. The one of Ned, for example, is facing backward. My daughter is too young to understand that it is indeed Ned.  All told though, it's a nice board book.
