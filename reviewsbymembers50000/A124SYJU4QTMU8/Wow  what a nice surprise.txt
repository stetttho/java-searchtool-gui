 I am used to ordering things from catalogs and they are nice...but nowhere near as nice as the catalog makes them out to be. I'm sure you know what I mean. I ordered three dresses and all three were simply beautiful - more pretty than the pictures!  This dress is especially pretty - it is a little girl's dream dress. It has a fluffy skirt and pretty sparkles on the top - but not so many as to make it a tacky outfit.   I will definately buy from this seller again!
