 I am used to ordering things from catalogs and they are nice...but nowhere near as nice as the catalog makes them out to be. I'm sure you know what I mean. I ordered three dresses and all three were simply beautiful - more pretty than the pictures!  The dress is perfect for a little girl - it's not over the top as some outfits can be. With the hat, the outfit is beyond cute!  I will definately buy from this seller again!
