 I purchased this for my daughter when she was 5.5 months old. It said it recommended the saucer for ages up to 1 year. Well, that's swell and all, but the instructions specifically say to not use the saucer if your child is over 30" tall. By the time I got this, I had to use the 3rd notch. I'll probably just get a couple month's use out of it.  I'm sure you could 'risk' it, but it's not worth the chance to me. I would hate to not pay attention because I was making dinner to find out that she could get out ot get hurt.  She seems to enjoy it, but not as much as her jumperoo. Nevertheless, it does keep her amused for small stretches of time and for that alone, it was worth it.
