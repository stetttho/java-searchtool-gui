 As others have mentioned, there is only about 2% Spanish in this DVD. 1.5% of this spanish is spoken by non-native speakers.  I also don't recommend this dvd for those who want their children to learn the culture - this dvd just about uses every stereotype of the Hispanic culture.  The two positives of the dvd are Celia Cruz and Linda Ronstad.
