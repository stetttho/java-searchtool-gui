 This will be my second bag. I find it easier to keep one in each of our cars. I compared it to the Buggy Bagg and found this one to be nicer - it's more padded for one thing, and seems to cover a wider varity of cart sizes.  Two things I have seen people do incorrectly, so keep these in mind:  Not attaching the bag's loops through the back of the cart in order to secure it directly to the cart. I've seen some people use the straps as is, which is NOT a safe thing to do.  and  Using the bag backwards or upside down, causing the handles to be in front.
