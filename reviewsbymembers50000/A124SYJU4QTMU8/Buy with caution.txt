 I love this toy. So much so, that I bought one for my baby to play with once she gets older. I have only used it a few times and one of the block things is not working well. I like the toy too much to return, so we will try to have it fixed instead of returning it. In contacting the company, I have discovered they are no longer in business. So, if you do buy this, buy all the accessories while you can.
