 I am used to ordering things from catalogs and they are nice...but nowhere near as nice as the catalog makes them out to be. I'm sure you know what I mean. I ordered three dresses and all three were simply beautiful - more pretty than the pictures!  We don't do pagents - I purchased this dress as an Easter dress. I am very pleased with the quality - the trim, the fabric are very nice. The dresses at the mall are much more expensive and not as pretty.   I will definately buy from this seller again!
