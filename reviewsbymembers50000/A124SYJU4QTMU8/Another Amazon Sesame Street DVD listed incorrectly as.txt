 This is a really fun DVD. My daughter enjoys it a lot. The only problem is that Amazon lists these Sesame Street DVDs as from 1969. I purchased a few of them to discover that only portions, such as the pinball count video, are from the original Sesame Street. The majority of the scenes are not from my generation at all!  Otherwise, it's a swell DVD!
