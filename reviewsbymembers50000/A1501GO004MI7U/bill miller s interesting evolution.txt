 "spirit rain" is a very good album but not the best from bill miller. for me, "the red road", "reservation road live" and "ghostdance" are better. nevertheless this new cd sounds much nicer and is much more original than "hear our prayer".  For the first time we can hear on a bill's album some SPANISH GUITAR and some PIANO and that's the an interesting evolution in a native american cd...  spanish guitars on tracks 3 and 13 are awesome and really deserve to be heard by any guitar fans.  Like all miller's work, "spirit rain" is very well recorded even though the voice is sometimes recorded with to much reverb and doesn't sound as natural as usually.
