 I'm a huge fan of the PINK FLOYD and I still don't understand why "Animals" is not considered as good as "Dark Side of the moon" or "the Wall".     "ANIMALS" is an amazing album !!! A MASTERPIECE !!!  "Dogs" is, for me, the best song the Pink Floyd have ever played, Gilmour's solo is incredible !!!  An absolute MUST HAVE !!!
