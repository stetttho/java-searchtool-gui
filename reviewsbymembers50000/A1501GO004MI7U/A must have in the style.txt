 First advice, if you don't know MASSIVE ATTACK, you should try to listen one or two of their songs to check if you like this style of music. If you know that it's the case, you can buy that CD with your eyes closed ! All the tracks are awesome, "BLUE LINES" is always original but never annoying... "unfinished sympathy" and "Hymn of the big wheel" are, for me, among the best songs ever in the style... Second advice, you should pay attention to another great CD in the style of that one : AFTERLIFE "SIMPLICITY". you won't be desappointed...
