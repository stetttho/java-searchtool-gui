 This cd is awesome. Tesla recorded this live acoustic before the beginning of the show "MTV unplugged" but it's in the same spirit. "five man acoustic jam" is for me the best of Tesla. the versions of "the way it is", "before my eyes", "paradise", "love song" and "modern day cowboy" are among the best acoustic-rock songs ever. Frank Hanon plays the kind of guitar-solos you want to listen 5 times in a row (at least!!!)... conclusion, if you like rock and acoustic guitar, you can't go wrong with that album...
