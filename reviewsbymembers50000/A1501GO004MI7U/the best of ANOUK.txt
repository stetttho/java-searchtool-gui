 I bought this CD in France and it's one of my favorite among my almost 500 CDs !!! the reggae version of "nobody's wife" is awesome and the acoustic songs ("I alone", "Don't" and "Love") sound good. I love the live-acoustic "lovin'whiskey" as well. They forget on the list two very good songs which are "in the sand" and "are you kiddin' me" (tracks 14 & 15 on the CD1) recorded acoustic in Anouk's kitchen !!! DON'T BELIEVE what is written in the presentation of the CD, the tracks 13 to 22 are in fact on a DVD and are videos. VERY IMPORTANT : The DVD doesn't work on american DVD players!!!
