 This CD is for the people who liked, for example, Alanis Morissette and especially her "Unplugged". It's a very good acoustic pop-rock album from a very talented artist that only few people know. Personally, "Plumb" is the only Jonatha brooke's CD that I really enjoy but it's nevertheless nearly a must have in my opinion...
