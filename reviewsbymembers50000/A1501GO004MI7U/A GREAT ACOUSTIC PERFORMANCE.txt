 This "unplugged" from Alice in chains is without a doubt one of the finest moments in the MTV show. For me, it sounds even better than the Nirvana "unplugged in N.Y" which was already awesome. Staley's voice is powerfull, all the guys are really good musicians . Some songs like "down in a hole", "Sludge factory" and "would ?" are masterpieces of acoustic-rock. If you like grunge-rock and acoustic guitars, this CD is for you...
