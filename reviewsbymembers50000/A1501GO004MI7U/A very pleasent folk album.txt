 "Living with ghost" is the kind of album that you listen during the cold winter nights near the fireplace with your girlfriend.  I heard of Patty griffin because she's a friend of Ben Harper, what rang a bell in my mind !!! It's an entire acoustic recording with beautiful lyrics and good guitars. however, I regret sometimes that there are no percussions and no bass, it's the only reason why I didn't rate this CD with 5 stars...  Last thing, if you like this kind of music, you should look for Janis Ian's "Breaking silence" and "hunger" which sound even better for me...
