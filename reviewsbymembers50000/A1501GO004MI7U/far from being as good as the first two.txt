 I loved "marc cohn" and "the rainy season" witch are two strong and powerful cd's but "burning the daze" is really two steps under... I was desapointed when I realised that electronic drums were used on almost all songs, that marc's voice was not as warm as on the other cd's. Only few songs can remind you the good old days of marc cohn : the tracks 2, 6 and 11.  conclusion: get it only if you are addicted to marc cohn's music and you look for everything from him. if you don't know his music get the others... is that clear ???
