 "tumbleweed connection" is for me one of the greatest album ever in the history of rock. I can't understand why no one of its songs appears on elton's best of : it's a shame !!!  All the songs are beautiful and the sound of the remastered version is great. the bonus track on that remastered edition "madman across the water" is INCREDIBLE, a 8.40 mn version with a fantastic guitar solo in it. Forget all the horrible albums Elton John recorded since 1990 and get the ones recorded in the early 70's, especially "tumbleweed" and "Elton john" you won't be desapointed...
