 BEAUTIFUL !!! After he personally produced his first CDs, David Gray is working now with a big Company and the result is great !!! Catchy (almost all acoustic) songs, good lyrics : this guy is a poet... you can't go wrong with that CD !!! You should also look at the DVD "live at the point", it's amazing !!!
