 "Welcome to the cruel world" was Ben's first release in 1994 and is still, for me, his best recording. More than a very talented musician, Harper is an incridible songwriter. The lyrics are amazingly rich like on "like a king" or "walk away" for example. "welcome to the cruel world" is totally acoustic, no electric guitars like on "burn to shine", and the only instruments used are acoustic guitars, slide guitars, bass, drums and percussions. At least The style of music on this album is more blues/folk than rock...  A MASTERPIECE !!!!
