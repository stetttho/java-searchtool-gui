 Counting crows is definitely a good band but I'm afraid that they will never make another masterpiece like "August and everything after". If you already like the Crows, you will like this album which is, for me, maybe better than "Desert Life". Anyway, "Up all night"(track 12) is one very VERY good song and deserves to be heard...
