 "simplicity" is simply good. The mixes between SPANISH GUITAR and chillout beats on "never before" and "cry" sound AWESOME !!! Afterlife's music is sometimes TRIP-HOP, sometimes DRUMS&BASS but always good. I love (and you will love too) the 11th track "blue bar" with the piano intro, the beautiful trompet solo after and all that with a slow trip-hop beat...  GET IT !!!
