 I usually don't listen to christian music... the reason is simple: I don't believe in GOD !!! BUT this album sounds very very good. I bought for "love song" which is beautiful but it's far from being the only one in that case. All the "live" tracks are full of emotions, the "studio" are very well recorded and are all "acoustic". Every one who like good music should like it... these guys are talented.  GOD bless them !!!
