 I ordered the cd because of the reviews... people saying that dispatch was the best jammin' band ever!!!!!  DISPATCH IS FAR (VERY VERY FAR) FROM BEING THE BEST BAND EVER. This live is completely overrated. The lyrics and music are OK, no more... THE SOUND RECORDING IS VERY BAD. Some lives from the 70's sound much better !!!!
