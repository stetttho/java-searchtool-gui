 "Endangered species" is incredibly good. The acoustic versions of the songs are almost better than the studio ones. "sweet home Alabama" will not desappoint you and some other songs sound will blow you away!!! I speak about "Devil in a bottle" with its awesome slide guitar solo, "Good Luck, Bad Luck"(that rocks!!!), and my favorite on the album : "the Last Rebel"...  A MUST HAVE if you like acoustic-rock !!!
