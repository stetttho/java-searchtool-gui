 If, like me, you liked "Who can u trust ?" and "Big calm", and you're expecting something as good as those two CDs, you will be very desappointed. I was waiting "Charango", hoping that I could listen a good TRIP-HOP album from the group who made me fly with their two first CDs but... Where is the real inspiration ??? "Charango" is only a common POP album without any originality. I really have the impression that they recorded that album only to make money... What a shame ...  FORGET IT ... There are so many good CDs you have to buy before that one ...
