 If you don't have that CD, that means that you don't know Pearl Jam or You hate rock or You were on Mars the last 12 years !   Nothing more to say: "TEN" is a MASTERPIECE ! A must have for whoever like "good" ROCK  (Led-Zep, Hendrix, Tesla etc...) If you don't have it, get it in medical emergency! If you own it already, get another one... just in case!
