 This album won 5 Native American music awards in 2000, includind artist of the year and song of the year for "ghostdance",and deserved them. GHOSTDANCE is exactly the kind of cd that you can expect from Mill Miller: an acoustic work, very well recorded, with catchy tunes and stong lyrics.  The track 8 "The last stand" is powerful and is for me the best instrumental piece since "dreams of wounded knee" on "The Red Road". This album is, without a doubt, one of the best from Bill Miller...  YOU CAN GET IT !!!
