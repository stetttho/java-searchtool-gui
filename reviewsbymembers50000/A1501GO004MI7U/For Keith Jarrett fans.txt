 Bruce Stark explains in the notes inside the front cover how much he loves Keith Jarrett's music and decided to become a professional pianist after listening the Lausane/Bremen concerts at 2 A.M in his campus room in Berkeley... Stark's music sounds a lot like his idol's performances in Cologne (Koln), Bremen, Lausane or Bregenz... Good news!!!
