 "breaking silence" is without any doubt janis's best album... so good from the first song to the last. "some people lives" will make u cry and "breaking silence" is probably one of the most well recorded songs i've ever heard (so if u have a good HI-FI system, it's a pure joy !!!). conclusion : get it !!!
