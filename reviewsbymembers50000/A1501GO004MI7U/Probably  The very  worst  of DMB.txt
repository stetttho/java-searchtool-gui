 From the moment I own "live at luther college" and found there maybe my favorite album ever, I thought DMB was great. It's not on this terrible album. There are only two good songs (maybe !) "If I had it all" and "The space between" and I can't listen the others (so annoying, so bad !). FORGET THAT ONE !
