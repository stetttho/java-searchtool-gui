 Jack Johnson's "brushfire Fairytales" is probably not the greatest album ever but it's ALWAYS a pleasure to listen to it. All the songs are good and Ben Harper, who is produced by the same guy, appears on "flake" playing slide guitar. Be carefull ! "brushfire fairytales" is produced by the same guy who produces Ben harper but it does not sound really like ben harper's albums ! Nevertheless, if you want to compare with Harper's music, that cd sounds much more like "welcome to the cruel world" than "burn to shine". all the songs are acoustic, the instruments used are especially guitars-drums-bass (the magic trio !). So If you like acoustic music, buy it!
