 "Everyday" is, in my opinion, DMB's worst album and this live reflects this album.  In fact, most of the songs played by the band on this "live at Folsom Field" were on "everyday". If you look for a very good D.M "live" album you should buy the amazing acoustic "live at luther college" recorded with Tim Reynolds. It is  10 000 times better than this live in Boulder!!! On the other way, if you want a "live" with all the band, the "live at Red Rocks 8.15.95" sounds better (for me) than this one as well.
