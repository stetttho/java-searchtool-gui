 "Tea for the Tillerman" is one of the most powerful album of the last century !!!!! Cat Stevens's MASTERPIECE !!!! The sound on this remastered version is perfect and emphasizes the quality of the songs. Songs like "Sad lisa", "Hard Headed woman", "Father and son" and "where do the children play?" are among the best songs I've ever heard (and I've heard a lot of songs !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!).   More than a must-have, an ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
