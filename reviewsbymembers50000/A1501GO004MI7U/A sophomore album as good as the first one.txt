 "The rainy season", marc cohn's second album is terrific, when his first cd was built around piano, this one is more about acoustic guitar; And it's good !!! for me, "things we've handed done" is marc's best song... wonderful, very slow with the piano !!! "don't talk to her at night", "paper walls", "medicine man" and "she's becoming gold" are also very good. you have to notice also that bonnie Raitt plays the slide guitar and sings with marc on track 3 "the rainy season"...  This cd deserves his 5 stars !!!
