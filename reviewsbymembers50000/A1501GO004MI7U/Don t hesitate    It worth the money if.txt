 Like me, you think that the best solo stuff from Keith Jarrett can be found in the "Koln Concert", in the double CD "Solo Bremen-Lausane", in the Part I  and the "untitled" of the "Bregenz concert" or in the song "in front" on the "facing you" album...  The sun bear concerts are AS GOOD as those mentioned !!!! Jarrett playing is amazing, He is grooving with a lot with repetitive left hands (what people seem to call "gospel" kind of playing) and improvises beautifully with the right one... Moreover he is equally inspired in every concerts and the "encore" CD is just as "magic" as the rest, if not even more... Do your ears a favor and let them listen to the magician doing his tricks...
