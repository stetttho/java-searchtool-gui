 This live at luther college is INCREDIBLE !... It's without any doubt the very best of Dave Matthews, all the concert is magic, the acoustic versions of the songs are 100 times better than usually. Sometimes, in the studio albums, Dave's songs are not "clear" because there are too many instruments at the same time but here... Only 2 guitars with Tim Reynolds the magician who plays the solos with so much feelings !... I read in some reviews that Tim plays too fast : it's true sometimes but don't forget that it's a live, the guy improvise on every songs.  #41(a masterpiece), dancing nancies (what a solo at the end !...), seek up and two steps are among the best live acoutic songs I've ever heard !... If, like me , you're in love with acoutic guitars you MUST have that CD, you won't regret it... trust me !...
