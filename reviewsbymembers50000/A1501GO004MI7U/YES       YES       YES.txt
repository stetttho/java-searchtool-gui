 INCREDIBLE ALBUM !!! Tuck is probably one of the best (the best ???) jazz guitarist in the business !!!  the version of "time after time" is 100 000 times better than the original one (it's even hard to compare).  The tributes to JIMI HENDRIX "castles made of sand/little wing" is one of the best song I've ever heard. And "Europa" played by Tuck will make you put your Santana CD in the garbage !!!   GET IT NOW !!!
