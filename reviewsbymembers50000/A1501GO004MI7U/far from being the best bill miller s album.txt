 I'm a great fan of bill Miller's music and I was a little bit disappointed by "hear our prayer" that is for me not as good as "the red road" for example. You can buy this cd if you've got all the others and you want to hear more from this extraordinary songwritter and guitarist. like allways, the songs are very well recorded even though there are too much instruments that remove a part of the magic that we expect in a bill miller's work...  conclusion: if you want to buy your first miller's cd, you'd rather take "The red road", the "live" album or the most famous but nevertheless excellent "ghostdance".
