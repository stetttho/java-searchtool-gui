 "On a desert island, you could have only one CD. which ONE ?"  I still don't know my definitive choice but Counting Crows' "August and everything after" could be THE ONE...  Awesome lyrics (Round here, Anna begins), very good music (all songs) but most of all EMOTION. It's hard to explain the feelings you can have listening that album but it's MAGIC !
