 This "live" is incredible ! so pure and beautiful... if you like acoustic guitar and Folk music, you must have this cd , it is as good as "the red road", the best studio album from bill miller.  bill sings on all tracks and plays the flute only on the first one "reservation road" before singing a magic simple version of that song (but all the songs are awesome!)... I bought it and I don't regret !  Just notice that the two last songs are recorded in studio.
