 I bought the CD three hours ago in a shop because I couldn't wait for more... and it was much more expensive than here !!!  Anyway the new David Gray is good. the songs are not as catchy as on "white ladder" but are about the same quality... Gray's musical evolution is interesting even though, for me, he uses a little bit too much the computers on "A new day at midnight". The last song "the other side" is, for the moment, my favorite. It begins with david alone on the piano and reminds me the atmosphere of the precedent album....  Nevertheless, I like (and I will love for sure) this album but I don't really understand why Clune (the incredible drummer !!!) doesn't play real drums on the studio versions of the songs, it could be even better. Anyway, If you like David's "white ladder", you will like "a new day at midnight" for sure. I advice you to get the DVD "live at the Point". David Gray and his mates are amazing on stage, they don't dance, there are no fireworks, but it sounds good !!!!!!!!!!
