 Crosby-Stills-Nash is one of the best band ever in the history of Rock. This compilation is a MUST HAVE. At last a compilation where you can find what you were expecting...  The choice of the song is almost perfect (I wish they also put "Delta", for example) and the unknown extented version of "Almost cut my hair" is awesome. All the classics are here. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG !!!
