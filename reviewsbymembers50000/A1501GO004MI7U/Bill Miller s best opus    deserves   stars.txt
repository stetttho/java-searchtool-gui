 "the red road" is the kind of cd that you can listen for ever without never getting bored... "reservation road","tumbleweed", "faith of a child" are probably the three best songs ever written by Bill miller... the arrangements are simple but beautiful, the sound is incredible (especially on the instrumental track 1). if you like folk music and acoustic guitar, this cd is for you, it's worth it !
