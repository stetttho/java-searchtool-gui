 I bought "live from mars" the first day it came out and I was a little bit desappointed. This live album deserves his 4 stars because the second cd (the acoustic one) allows us to hear some excellent acoustic versions of "please bleed" and "the drugs don't work" (written by Richard Ashcroft from the verve). "like a king" sounds a little bit flat in this one guitar's version and "power of gospel" is much more exciting on the "jah work" single. The electric concert is good but could had been better, once again "ex me Mr" is so much better when Ben sings BOB's "burnin and lootin" at the end of the song on the "jah work" single. Hopefully "forgiven" and "woman in you" sound great but where are, for example, "whipping boy", "jah work" and "two hands of a prayer" ???
