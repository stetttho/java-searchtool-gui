 Most of people know only "walking in Menphis" but it's not the best song on this sublime album : "silver thunderbird" and especially "perfect love" with james taylor singing the background vocals sound even more better for me. Anyway, "Marc Cohn" is a (really) great cd from the beginning to the end for whoever who likes piano, acoutic guitar and beautiful lyrics. If you can have only one marc cohn's album, you must take that one...
