 This novel, written by perhaps my favorite living author, meets the high expectations I had for it. It is reminiscent of Stone's "Flag for Sunrise" in terms of its scope, but surpasses that novel in depth of feeling.  I thought "Outerbridge Reach" was the best novel of that year, this one is even better.  Its unfortunate that we have to wait so long between this author's works, but thats the price we pay for such strongly crafted work.
