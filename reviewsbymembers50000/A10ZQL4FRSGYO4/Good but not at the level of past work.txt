 Bay of Souls is reminiscent of previous Stone novels such as A Flag For Sunrise and Outerbridge Reach.  The writing here is effective but the whole thing seems a bit rushed.  Themes and characterizations are not fleshed out as much as in his other novels.  This book would make for a good introduction to the author's prose style (like the short story collection Bear and His Daughter) but overall it isn't as satisfying as his earlier work.
