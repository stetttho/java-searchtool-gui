 This movie operates on so many levels one can watch it over and over again and always find something new.  Eastwood does an amazing job of dealing with the myths of the west, making this the most realistic western I've  ever seen, and one of my five favorite films of all time.  It should have  won an award for screenplay too..I think it is as well written as  "Chinatown."  Definitly worth getting on DVD as the crisp  photography adds a lot to the overall film.
