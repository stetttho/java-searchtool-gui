 This is a good introduction to Eliade's fiction.  Eliade is more known as a scholar than a fiction writer, but he produced some wonderful stories, of which this is one.  This is one of the few fictional works currently  available, but any reader who enjoys this as much as I did will no doubt  embark upon a quest to discover more Eliade books.  I esp. recommend  "Mystic Tales".
