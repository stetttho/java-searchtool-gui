 If there was such thing as a Nobel Prize for music, it would have to go to Peter Gabriel. Though I love everything he has ever done, this album brings it to a whole new level.  Listening to it gives one a chance to truly  experience the sublime...This is the most amazing piece of music I've ever  heard, period.  I've had this album for years, and just looked it up here  to see what others think, and I'm pleased to see how much others prize this  recording.
