 This new edition is useful in that it makes some parts of the narrative closer to the original.  In other parts, thoughit seems to muddle things.  Its hard to acsertain which is better, this is a complex issue which always comes into play when a complex author is translated into another language.  I would suggest that people read both editions together, as this novel is rich enough to be rewarding each time.
