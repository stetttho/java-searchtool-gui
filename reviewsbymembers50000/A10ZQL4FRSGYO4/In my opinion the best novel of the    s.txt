 I found this to be Pynchon's most entertaining novel, as well as the most accessible.  Though it may take readers a couple pages to get used to the narrative style, it soon becomes very smooth.  What really amazes is that  despite the historical setting everything here seems so modern.  Its hows  that people are much the same despite the era in which they live.  And  though the events chronicled  are not always based on literal fact, they  have a Kafkaesque ability to convey a higher truth.
