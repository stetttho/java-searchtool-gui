 This is an amazing book...the density of the plot is incredible, and the text has a velocity to it that makes the book very difficult to put down.  I can't recall encountering such well developed characters in a "thriller" of this sort...they truly come alive.  And the structure and details of the plot are brilliant.  Much more than I would normaly expect of a book of this kind.  Technically I would place it in the company of Henry James' "Turn of the Screw".  I cant wait to see what he comes up with next..
