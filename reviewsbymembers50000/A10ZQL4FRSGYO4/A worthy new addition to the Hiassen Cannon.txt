 It was great to visit Skink, Jim Tile, et all. I missed them...Carl is a national treasure. I can think of no other author as consistantly entertaining.  We've seen these types of characters before, but they are so  much fun it doesn't matter.  There is a Kafkaesque reality to these  people...no matter how absurd things get you can't help but believe it  could really happen.
