 I am in agreement with Bibliophile, below, who found the brief but lurid sexual references throughout this novel distracting and detracting from the potentially delightful premise of exploring the lives of five ladies and a gentleman brought together by the beloved novels of Jane Austen.   Praiseworthy items:  I enjoyed the subtle humor in some of Fowler's characters' off-beat observations, most definitely enjoyed the references to Ms. Austen's books, was, in fact, delighted, even, when I read an excerpt from Anne Radcliffe's Udolpho's Mysteries (quoted often in Austen's Northanger Abby).  Obviously Fowler knows her Austen.  Disappointing factors:  I spent some time trying to figure out just how Fowler's characters counterparted those created by Austen (as promised in some of the editorial reviews on the book cover), but failed to make any satisfactory connections beyond some very vague similarities (Jocelyn was apparently the "Emma" of the novel;" Bernadette, perhaps, the Elizabeth, though that was a stretch.  The others characters were lost on me.  Unforgivable elements:  It seems explicit, often degrading sexual episodes were thrown in here and there to possibly spice up the novel.  Austen engendered a genuine admiration in her literary fans without resorting to any such devices.  Need I say more?  My recommendation?  Skip it.
