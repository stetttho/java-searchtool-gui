 Another wonderful American Indian novel by Kathleen Eagle which co-mingles two stories, past and present, into one unforgettable book. Cecily, a kind, young and guileless young woman becomes inextricably drawn into the American Indian movement of the '70's when she befriends a courageous young Indian woman and her world-weary but oh-so-irresistable brother, Kiah.  Cecily acquires a 100-year-old traveling trunk at an auction which contains some artifacts and writings of Priscilla Twiss, daughter of a White Indian Agent sent to educate the "savage" Sioux. Priscilla, drawn to the Sioux, comes to visit her father in the rugged, untamed west, and there she meets and falls in love with the proud warrier, Whirlwind Rider. Both couples, though a century apart, share similar obstacles of restrictive social mores, racial hatred, and tumultuous circumstances in American Indian history, not to mention a suprising revelation which ties past to present. Highly recommended reading for unforgettable romance, gripping storytelling, and fascinating American Indian History.
