 Sheridan Drake is a tortured military hero, idolized by the young and terribly innocent Olympia, the rightful princess of Oriens who seeks her hero's assistance in saving her kingdom from a bloody revolution. Though Kinsale's writing skill and style is always above average, the story takes so many twists and turns, it left my head spinning, and I was certain the original plot was completely forgotten until it resurfaces, rather unsatisfactorily, at the end. There are a series of Misunderstandings (Olympia thinks Sheridan has betrayed her by stealing her jewels and disappearing; Sheridan spirals into black depression when Olympia becomes engaged to a forgettable secondary character whom she doesn't really care for, etc.) The "spark" between hero and heroine just didn't seem to burn as brightly as the flames which fairly leapt between Maddy and Jervaulx in "Flowers From The Storm" or Samuel and Leda in "The Shadow and The Star."  I still highly recommend the book, as Kinsale, I believe, is one of the most talented and gifted writers of our time, and though it's not my favorite, this book is still far better than the standard fare offered in this genre.  As a side note, I didn't overmuch care for the constant references to Olympia's "chubbiness" and "plumpness," and I especially didn't appreciate the occasions in which Sheridan pointed these things out to her.
