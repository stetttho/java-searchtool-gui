 Lily and Devon find love against all odds. In spite of the personal secrets and tragedies that would keep them apart, not to mention misjudgments, mistrust, mistakes, and human flaw, their impossible but obsessive love won't let them be apart. Devon is a passionate and impulsive man, much like his younger brother, but, where the latter's youthful impulsivity leads him into a reckless, happy-go-lucky existence, Devon's painful past colors his personality with a dark, brooding and almost self-loathing quality, creating a hero with great capacity for love, but in much need of redemption. Devon's propensity to mistrust and believe the worst of Lily almost destroys both of their lives, but he reforms and his soul is (suitably) tortured by his near-obsessive love of Lily and the knowledge that he, himself, drove her away and nearly ruined her life. The passion which ignites between Devon and Lily is all the more powerful for the fact that they, very humanly, make mistakes and face enormous obstacles, much of their own making, but overcome all for the sake of love, which makes their love richer, stronger, much more poignant, and more deeply satisfying in the end. I found this novel gripping, wonderfully written, with very real characters. Though the sub-plot of the nefarious housekeeper and her lecherous son seemed to dangle, and in spite of a cheesey skinny-dipping scene in the beginning, I rated this book based solely on my enjoyment of it, and enjoy it I did.
