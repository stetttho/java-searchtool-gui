 This film truly transports the viewer into Jane Austen's world.  We are swept away into the breathtakingly beautiful 19th century English countryside, to a time where one's "breeding" is above all else in importance, where a woman's every fiber is bent and effort spent on a shrewd marital match, and genteel propriety (or at least the appearance of such) is a characteristic highly regarded and fiercely protected.   The scenery is fantastic, as well as the costuming, and it seems that great attention was paid to even the minutest of details. The actors play their roles superbly, and I believe the casting director must be a genious (although I found Mrs. Bennett almost too annoying altogether.)  Austen's fans will be pleased, I think, at the production's faithfulness to the novel.  Very well-done and enjoyable.
