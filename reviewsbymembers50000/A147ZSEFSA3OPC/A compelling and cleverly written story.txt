 A fan of Hitchcock's adaptation of "Marnie," I decided to get the book from the library, and I was very pleasantly surprised.  George writes in the first person, and it is extremely insightful to be able to delve into the workings of Marnie's mind; her extreme emotional detachment, which has served to protect her from dealing with a long-buried, horrible memory and an imbalanced, mysterious mother; her ability to create different personalities to accompany her various aliases as a way of dealing with the moral dilemma engendered by her penchant for kleptomania; her deep-rooted, seemingly inexplicable fear of intimacy.   Winston's writing style was quite clever: The story is gripping and tumultuous, yet presented in a cool and practical manner through Marnie's voice, just as Marnie, herself, seems cool and methodical but brims with overwhelming pain and confusion beneath the surface. Though there are some marked differences between the book and movie, they are quite similar in what I believe are the most important and interesting aspects of the story; namely, a woman rendered incapable (by suppression) of "natural" feelings due to a traumatic childhood event is able to meet and conquer her demons through the love of a patient and caring man.   I do heartily recommend the book as well as the movie.
