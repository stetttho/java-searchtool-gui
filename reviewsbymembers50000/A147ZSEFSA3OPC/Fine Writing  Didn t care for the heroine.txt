 This was the first book I've read from Ms. Brockoven. First, I must preface this review by stating that I do think she possesses a fine style of writing - flowing, sensible. I also liked the premise of the book very much: Adam rescues Miranda after she attempts to kill herself, due to a devastating secret she harbors from the past.  I understood that Miranda, given what she'd been through, would be, at times, stand-offish, would find difficulty in trusting others, and would be reluctant in forging relationships. Still, I couldn't embrace her character. She seemed almost too bristly, often snobbish, and, in her "former life," someone I found to be rather unsympathetic. I wanted to sympathize with her - really, I did - but I just couldn't muster up a suitable amount. I couldn't figure out what Adam saw in her, besides a ... attraction and his own kind nature and desire to help others.  I also found the characters of Matt and Susan (esp. Susan) annoying, whiny, and immature, and, again, couldn't understand what Adam saw in them. Sorry to Brockoven fans, just a matter of preference.
