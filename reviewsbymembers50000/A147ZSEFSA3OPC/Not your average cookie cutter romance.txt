 I found "This Time Forever" to be a very satisfying and refreshing romantic read.  The characters of Susan and Cleve are three-dimensional - very real, very human, and, in ordinary circumstances, perhaps even unremarkable.  It's the extraordinary circumstance which bring these two together -- Susan, a white woman, serving on a jury that convicts Cleve Black Horse, a half-breed Indian and former rodeo champion, of murder -- which sets the stage for a remarkable and touching story that will stay with you long after you've read it.   Susan tries to cope with the knowledge that she may have helped send an innocent man to prison; Cleve, wrongly accused, has to pick up the pieces of his shattered life and learn to forgive and trust.   Another extraordinary circumstance brings Susan and Cleve together again, and the seed of bitterness slowly and sweetly blossoms into friendship and then love in a most natural way.  A beautifully touching and unforgettable story.
