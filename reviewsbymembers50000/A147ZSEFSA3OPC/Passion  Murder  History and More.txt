 Daniel Severin is a mercenary sent to the Hospice of Saint Bernard in Switzerland to "eliminate" the beheaded King Louis' little-known bastard daughter, Lorelei. Lorelei unknowingly holds the fate of nations in her hands, not to mention Daniel's life when she and the clerics of the hospice rescue him, unconscious and badly wounded, from a deadly avalanche. Daniel finds himself in an unfamiliar helpless state, forced to depend on the very object of his deadly mission to heal his body, and he reluctantly finds his heart and his resolve softening by Lorelei's uncomplicated trust, friendship, and innocent charm. Soon Daniel learns that someone else wants Lorelei dead, and, to his own amazement, he finds himself desperate to protect the one he was sent to kill. The blossoming love between the tortured, jaded mercenary and the sheltered healer is a joy to read, a gentle love story that will touch your heart. This seemingly impossible and improbable love buds and then flourishes to all-consuming passion, but all the while Daniel knows that eventually Lorelei's innocence will be irrevocably shattered when she discovers the secrets he harbors. The Raven and the Rose is one of Ms. Wiggs' best novels. Don't let the reference to Napolean lull you into a sense of "been there, read that." The story is historically fascinating, powerfully yet tenderly romantic, and full of intrigue and mystery that will keep you turning the pages.  In the glorious Swiss mountains, The Hospice of Saint Bernard and its inhabitants will intrigue you. Could one of the priests who raised Lorelei from infancy be a murderer? The mystery deepens as circumstances lead the couple to France where they become inexorably interwoven into the politically tumultuous times and their love is challenged by deception and danger. Wonderfully written and more than worth a read!
