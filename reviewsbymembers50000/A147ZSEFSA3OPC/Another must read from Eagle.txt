 I haven't been disappointed in an Eagle book yet, and "Sunrise Song" lived up to my 5-star expectations again.  Eagle weaves together past and present to create an unforgettable and poignant story of courage and love in the face of insurmountable obstacles.  The descriptions of the events which take place in the Assylum for Insane Indians, though fascinating and educational, is profoundly sad, which may be unsettling to some readers.  I turn the last page of an Eagle book with regret (that the story is over) but also with the deep satisfaction of a thoroughly good read and the feeling that I have learned a great deal about American Indian History.  The fluidity of Eagle's writing is a pleasure to read, and no detail seems forced or extraneous - never a dull moment.
