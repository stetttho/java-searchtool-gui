 Emmaline is a wealthy investor, cold and untouchable. Larence, a bookish professor, is a dreamer in search of a lost city. Emmaline becomes Larence's financier, the fulfillment of a promise to an old friend. When Emmaline, who had worked hard to overcome the humiliating and degrading poverty of her childhood, loses everything, she decides to accompany Larence on his quest in order to protect her investment and, hopefully, make a fortune. Larence is a compelling character unlike most romance novel heros. He's a fairly optimistic fellow, in spite of a rather sad childhood, and in spite of what he calls his "deformity;" a malformed ankle which causes a pronounced and painful limp. It is only when he's with the cold and beautiful Emmaline that he becomes acutely self-conscious of his physical deformity and his complete (I do mean complete) lack of experience with women. He was aware of these things, of course, but, in keeping with his good nature, had grown to accept them. Trust, friendship and, eventually, love blossom during their quest together. I was somewhat surprised at some of the negative reviews because I really felt a true abiding loving connection developed between these two, who taught each other so much; Emmaline gave Larence the confidence and self-worth he'd been lacking and Larence, in return, taught Emmaline how to trust and to love. There are some mystical scenes which require a brief suspension of reality, and one's appreciation, or lack thereof, of fantasy fiction will determine one's appreciation for these scenes. I was pleased that, though Larence's deformity sort of magically disappeared while in the lost city, it returned again back in the "real world," (and made no difference to the lovely Emmaline.)
