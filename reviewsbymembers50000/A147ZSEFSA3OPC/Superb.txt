 I truly enjoyed "Secrecy" and plan, now, to get my hands on every Belva Plain novel that I can. Maeve Binchy and Rosamund Pilcher lovers should find "Secrecy" immensely satisfying. Plain's writing style is flowing and enjoyable, and I found Charlotte to be a very brave but humanly likable character, and loved the sensitive Roger. The story took a very interesting twist near the end, when Charlotte and Roger's plans for Dawes Square were mysteriously vehemently opposed by Charlotte's father, himself hiding a shocking secret. The "mob" aspect of the story was a very minimal, peripheral part of the book.
