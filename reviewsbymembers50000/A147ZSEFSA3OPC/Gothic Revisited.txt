 Fans of gothic romantic literature will immediately recognize the Love Knot's premise; a sheltered but practical young governess travels to the desolate moors of Cornwall to teach the dark, brooding lord's grieving children. Lord Aubyn's wife's death is shrouded in mystery, and the book is chock-full of hints of spectre-like visions and mysterious, hair-raising whispers in the dark. Reference is made in "The Love Knot" to Anne Radcliffe's classic "Mysteries of Udolpho," which seems to have inspired Ms. Brandewyne (Radcliffe predates the marvelous Charlotte Bronte, and reference is made to "Mysteries" in Jane Austen's "Northanger Abbey.") Many of the elements of "The Love Knot" were also remniscent of Victoria Holt's early novels. The book had all the right gothic elements, (including the omission of descriptive sexual situations), but the author becomes almost entirely too carried away with her descriptives. There is also a bit of annoying redundancy (I lost count of all the "serpentine" roadways and the misty "mizzle"). Some situations seemed too contrived and poorly worded, and many paragraphs were comprised of strings of overflowing, superfluous, (often bordering on ridiculous) descriptions. Having proffered this criticism, however, I do recall that Radcliffe's "Mysteries of Udolpho" was quite wordy as well; she could rhapsodize on the form and feature of, say, a mossy rock for several paragraphs. Bearing in mind that Radcliffe was the source of some inspiration, perhaps, for Ms. Brandewyne, I was able to overlook the extensive purple prose to a degree. In sum, though it doesn't hold a candle to Holt or Bronte, it still might be worth a read for those who, like myself, love and miss the old gothics, as you will recognize many gothic elements.
