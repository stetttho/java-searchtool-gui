 I liked the premise of the story - jaded, world-weary Sebastian, practiced seducer and charmer of women, rescuing troubled Rachel Wade from a life of despair (i.e. prison) and employing her as his "housekeeper" for his own amusement; however, I found the so-called "forced seduction" scenes quite upsetting.  It was rape, pure and simple, as Rachel was an unwilling participant throughout. Of course, Sebastian changes his ways midway through the book and is chagrined (though not nearly enough) over his behavior, now desperate to win Rachel's acceptance, but I could not forget that he was capable of such dastardly deeds.  He even teased her later a few times about "tying her up," etc., which I found revolting, given their past history.  I was also disappointed that, though Sebastian was aware that the townspeople were calling Rachel his "whore," he did nothing about it. I still must give Gaffney some points for her skill as an author, but I don't recommend "To Have And To Hold" very highly.
