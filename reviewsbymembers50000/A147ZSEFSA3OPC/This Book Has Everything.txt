 A saucy heroine, a mouthwatering hero, a charming community, fun and wit and passion, this one has it all.  Letty and Elliot are both immediately likable and delightfully original.  Letty, raised as music hall performer, seeks to escape her increasingly nefarious boyfriend and finds a ticket to a tiny town called Little Bidewell, where she is mistaken for the eccentric Lady Agatha, duke's daughter-cum-wedding planner extraordinaire.  Letty, whose luck had just run out, can't resist such an Opportunity and gets swept up in what begins as a rather benign deception.  Soon, however, she becomes entangled in the lives of the charming Little Bidewell residents, including the sexy, chivalrous Sir Elliot. Elliot is neither rogue nor rake, but a true gentleman; however, don't be put off if you thought only bad boys could be sexy!  He's one of Brockwell's most irresistable creations! The story is chock full of Brockway's delightfully witty dialogue, and there are many humorous moments, but what begins as an undeniable, potent attraction between Letty and Elliot becomes a heart-wrenching and most romantic unrequited (almost) love. If you're open to something a little different but still demand great, passionate romance, try this one!  I doubt you'll be disappointed!
