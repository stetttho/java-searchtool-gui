 I found this book to be rather droll and slow-paced.  Moira is a serf who is given her freedom on her lord's deathbed; (Moira's mother was his mistress.)  Addis, a knight captured during the Crusades and held prisoner for several years, apparently a sex slave to a pagan priestess, returns home after his father's death in search of his son, with whom Moira has been entrusted.  The boy is whisked away for his "protection" early on and seldom mentioned again.  Meanwhile, Addis is apparently obsessed with Moira and refuses to acknowledge his father's wish of releasing her from her obligations as a serf.  Moira attempts several escapes only to find herself in danger and rescued/captured by Addis.  The two share an unrequited love, as both know Addis can never marry the lowly-born Moira. This novel lacks an interesting plot and doesn't give the reader any reason to believe Addis and Moira are destined for one another, other than the boorish "ownership" Addis holds over Moira's head. In short, I'd skip this forgettable novel.
