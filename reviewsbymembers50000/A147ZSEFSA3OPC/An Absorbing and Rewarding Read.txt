 "Far From The Madding Crowd" is the story of Gabriel Oak who lives a simple life as a lowly shepherd on the farm of the woman he once, unsuccessfully, proposed to, back when he was a man of some substance, having his own prosperous farm until tragic events lost it to him. The main elements of the story are the unfortunate, often tragic ramifications of Bathsheba Everdene's thoughtless, vanity-driven actions, and the steadfast, selfless love she has engendered in Oak, who undergoes much anonymous, behind-the-scenes labor in order to make smooth the rocky path Bathsheba has embarked upon. As one reviewer already mentioned, I do believe Hardy chose the unusual name of "Bathsheba" for his heroine because of her likeness to Bathsheba of the Bible; a beautiful, sought-after woman who unwittingly causes catastrophe for the men who love her. I will go further to suggest that Gabriel Oak's name was deliberate; he is a "guardian angel" of sorts who works on behalf of Bathsheba, and his character is strong, solid and dependable as a stalwart oak. Bathsheba's vanity, poor judgment and thoughtless behavior bring about the destruction of two men she becomes entangled with, and the once vital and carefree girl grows into a grave and repentant woman who finally begins to realize the wisdom and worth of her long-ago suitor, now servant, Oak. The novel is rich with pathos, romance, tragedy, and even absurdity (Oak's fellow laborers on the farm are a comical lot, and their hilarious conversations are a pleasant occasional reprieve from the dark world of Bathsheba and her lovers.) A great Hardy novel with an unusually happy ending.
