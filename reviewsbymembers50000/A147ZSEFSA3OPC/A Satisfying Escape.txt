 Angela Prescott, fleeing an unhappy past, finds herself in a big and often frightening new city trying to create a new life.  A charmingly impish Indian child of the street named "Tommy T" takes her under his wing. One night, when Angela meets trouble, Tommy enlists the help of his idol, the darkly mysterious, troubled Jesse Brown Wolf who lives in the night shadows and who finds himself, (reluctantly, at first) taking on the role of Angela's guardian angel.  These three misfits, drawn together by circumstance and raw need, find refuge in one another and, eventually, trust, love, and the makings of a modern-day family. Ms. Eagle writes an intriguing and touching story with just the right mix of Indian folklore and magic.  The relationship between Angela and Jesse is exciting and romantic, and young "Tommy T" will pull your heartstrings and make you long for these people to come together as a family.
