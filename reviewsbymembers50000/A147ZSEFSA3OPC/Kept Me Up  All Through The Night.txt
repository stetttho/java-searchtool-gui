 Since I believe the basics of the plot of this story are amply and efficiently covered by the reader reviews that precede this one, I won't attempt to go into another re-cap. What I do wish to contribute, however, is what struck me most about this darkly compelling and riveting tale; namely, that Ms. Brockway displays a writing style superior to anything else offered in this genre, something fine enough to withstand the power of time and "trends" in romantic literature. There is an artistic finesse and subtlety in the dialogue, which would indicate that the author credits her readers with a certain amount of sensibility and intelligence.  Brockway writes a true period piece - no machismo "Fabio" lords, no saucy-but-virginal maidens. Nobody is a street scamp who discovers he/she is a bluebooded, wealthy aristocrat by the end of the book. Jack and Anne are far more complex and multi-faceted. Jack is dark, driven, and sexy, yet always very controlled; meanwhile, he's in complete turmoil inside. Anne is quite likable, yet human, with an aching emotional void which she seeks to fill by her reckless behavior. The story is equal parts tenderly romantic and darkly sensual. The "scene" in which Jack requests to hear his Christian name on Anne's lips gave me goosebumps! The secondary characters are refreshing, unique, and fascinating, rather than mere foils for hero and heroine.  In sum, a fine, full-bodied read which has probably ruined me against any others that will follow!
