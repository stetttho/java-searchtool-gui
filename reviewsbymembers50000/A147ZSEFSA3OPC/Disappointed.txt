 Kathleen Eagle is one of my all-time favorite authors, but "The Last True Cowboy" just didn't deliver.  Much as I hate to admit it, I agree with the reviewer who found the plot weak and the swaggering, beer-drinkin', boot-stompin' cowboy bit a little too cliche and overdone. Though K.C. Houston mentions on two or three occasions that he's got some Indian heritage, American Indian life, itself, plays no part in this novel.  Of course, I don't mean to put Ms. Eagle in a box, but her vast knowledge and love of American Indian heritage gives her storytelling a very rich, almost spell-binding appeal that I found I sorely missed in "The Last True Cowboy."   I did enjoy the descriptions of the wild mustangs, but the characters of K.C., Julia, Dawn, Sally, Vern, etc., just didn't pull me in the way Ms. Eagle's novels usually do.  I couldn't wait to finish it so I could get started on the other Eagle novel I recently purchased.
