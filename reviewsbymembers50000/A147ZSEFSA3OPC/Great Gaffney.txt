 Another beautiful love story by Gaffney - one of her very best and most poignant, I believe.  Carrie is impoverished and lonely, a lovely mute whose silence harbors a dark secret. Tyler is the new town doctor, sensitive and kind, lively and intelligent.  Carrie responds to Tyler's kindness with shy, yet unabashed adoration, but Tyler fights his growing attraction for this young innocent.  Of course she doesn't belong to his social class, but the scruples Tyler struggles with are more complicated than mere social convention; Carrie is fragile, innocent, damaged, and mute, and it would be morally reprehensible of him, he believes, to succumb to the passionate feelings she sparks within him and take advantage of her seemingly uncomplicated trust.  What Tyler isn't aware of, however, is that Carrie's heart is strong enough for the both of them.  A very tender and memorable story.
