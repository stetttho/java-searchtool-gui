 A (surprisingly) believable and downright fascinating story of a man found in the wild, thought to be a sort of "missing link," forced to endure the loss of his freedom as well as his dignity. He is rapidly losing his will to live, until he meets Sydney, the woman who clearly sees what the others refuse to admit, that "Ontario Man" is an intelligent human male, like any other, with very real thoughts and feelings, made all the more real and honest by his lack of human contact. A simple, sweet gesture from Sydney's young brother can render him near tears, and his naked desire and affection for Sydney makes him touchingly vulnerable, yet somewhat dangerous, given his difficulty in grasping the social etiquette of the day (1890's). A grown-up Tarzan-and-Jane story, which is surprisingly quite touching. I read this book in a little over a day!
