 Nicholas, Anna's husband of only a few hours, is murdered on the night of their honeymoon, and, as it turns out, was apparently involved in some shady dealings involving Anna's family's ship-building business and illegal transactions with the Confederate Army during America's Civil War (this story taking place in England). Anna is urged to pretend John Brodie (Nicholas's twin brother, a prisoner awaiting death for a murder he, of course, did not commit) is really her new husband, until Nicholas's murderer is found. Brodie finds himself beguiled by his twin's bride, but Anna resents his hints that Nicholas was not as perfect as she'd like to believe.  Soon, however, the attraction between Anna and Brodie becomes undeniable. Anna is a likable heroine; smart, kind, and average-looking.  Brodie is darkly handsome and very sensual, bitter and hardened, but with a more refined persona lurking within, needing only Anna's feminine touch and loving encouragement to surface.  The problem I had with him, however, was that he exuded just a little too much machismo for my taste.  There are a couple of attempted seduction scenes that were rather aggressive, and I was left to wonder why Anna didn't clock him! The sub-plot of the mystery of Nicholas's nefarious dealings is interesting, though not quite up to snuff compared to some of Gaffney's other books.
