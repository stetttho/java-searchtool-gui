 Quist and Lily meet under the worst of circumstances. Lily, fleeing her old life in her car, with her young baby in tow, panics when she finds herself lost in a snowstorm. At wit's end, she finds Quist thumbing a ride, his car in a ditch. Knowing she and her baby can't survive being stranded in this awful storm, she makes a rash decision to trust this stranger, give him a ride, and pray that he can help. Quist is, at first, prickly and sullen, but soon finds himself in the role of reluctant protector of Lily and her baby. Safety is found in a (miraculously well-furnished) cabin, but the three of them are stuck there until they can get help. The rest is romantic history. Very enjoyable and satisfying read.
