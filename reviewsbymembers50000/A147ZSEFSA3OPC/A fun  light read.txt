 Justin is a master spy posing as an avid birdwatcher. Evie is the niece of Agatha, (the wedding planner in "Bridal Season" who eloped with a Frenchman) and is trying to keep her aunt's business afloat while Agatha and her new husband enjoy an extended, seemingly endless honeymoom. Evie hasn't had a single thing go right in her wedding planning attempts, and when she's asked by a wealthy American lady to plan a wedding extravaganza at North Cross Abbey, owned by Justin/master spy/birdwatcher, Evie determines to make it work and convinces Justin to allow her to refurbish and use his abbey for the wedding, cashing in on a favor he owes her from a brief but memorable encounter ten years prior. It just so happens that Evie's plans coincide beautifully with Justin's latest assignment - to receive a top-secret delivery at North Cross Abbey - and Justin believes the pre-wedding activity will help avert suspicion from him as he awaits the shipment. He agrees to Evie's proposal, and the two of them pack their bags and head to the old abbey...but they are being watched. This is probably Ms. Brockway's frothiest and lightest literary creation, a witty and humorous novel that, while enjoyable, does not quite capture the essence of passionate romance that her other novels do. A pleasant and enjoyable read.
