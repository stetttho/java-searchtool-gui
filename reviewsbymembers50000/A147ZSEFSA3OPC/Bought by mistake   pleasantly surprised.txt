 Yes - I found this book amidst a group of Barbara Delinsky novels and mistook it for one in a hurried trip to the bookstore! Now I'm only disappointed that Delaney doesn't have any other novels to her credit yet! I've always steered clear from time travel books (they seem to breach a level of believability at which I typically draw the line) but this was one of those rare don't-want-to-put-downs for me! A gentle, unhurried, sweet romance - and refreshing! Owen, a lovable, shy and utterly bewildered man from the past is easy to embrace as a character. No macho-man persona here; Owen is...sweet; comfortable yet intriguing. The book is done well and realistically (at least as far as rather unrealistic storylines go!) Yes, a bit too much dwelling on her past with the perfect Peter, but not too wordy for me - a professed lover of detail. Overall, a refreshing departure from the typical romance genre, and a heart-warming gentle romance.
