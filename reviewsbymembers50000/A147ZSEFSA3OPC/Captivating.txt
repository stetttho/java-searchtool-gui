 Cassandra Merlin has an unsavory reputation, no money, no "connections," and no family to speak of, save an estranged father who has been accused of treason against his country. Needless to say, her prospects for a happy, comfortable future are, predictably, dim.  Such are the circumstances that lead Cassandra to agree to become a spy.  Riordan, a man of wealth and station, is Cassandra's "contact" in this spy game, and, of course, believes the worst of her in the beginning, which makes for a somewhat antagonistic relationship between the two, though a growing passion looms beneath the surface.   Cassandra and Riordan take on spy personas of unscrupulous jades, which serves to compound the sexual tension between them. The romance is exciting and the spy intrigue interesting, but the continuous misunderstandings between Riordan and Cassandra become just a tad overdone, as in one too many.  This is my only criticism of an otherwise very satisfying read from, in my opinion, a gifted writer.
