 Ok, there are so many things about this movie to like. I originally took my 10 yr old daughter to see the movie about some boys flying rockets because i used to do it. WOW, not only does that bring memories back but  the movie is so wonderful that it keeps you watching from beginning to end.   Its a good story based on the book "The Rocket boys"and without  a doubt, the best movie of 1999 for me. Dreams can come true!
