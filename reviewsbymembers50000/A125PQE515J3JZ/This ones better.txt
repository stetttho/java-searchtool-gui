 This one is better than the recent remake because the 1963 version pulls you into the movie. I felt as though i were there. You get caught up in the movie. It scared me as a kid and it still holds up well. It may not have  the effects that the modern movie has but who cares. This one is better.  The new one is good but this one is the master!  Thats it!
