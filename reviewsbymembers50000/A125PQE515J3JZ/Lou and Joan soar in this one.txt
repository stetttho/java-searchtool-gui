 I love the Abbott and Costello movies but this is my personal favorite of thier movies. If you like haunted house comedies then this is the one for you. Actually the best part is that Joan Davis and Lou Costello are perfect  together in this movie. Its timeless and great fun for the whole family.  The rooms change,candles move,screams, and goofy dancing. Get it!  You  won't be sorry.
