 I believe this one was overlooked when it came out.  The only thing is Uncle Porter (Paul Hogan)has gotta get some other food besides all those cans of Spagetti-O's.  If you are a Paul Hogan fan then you will enjoy this  film.  I am ready to visit Uncle Porter just so i can enjoy the beach and  ocean.  LOL   Good Movie!
