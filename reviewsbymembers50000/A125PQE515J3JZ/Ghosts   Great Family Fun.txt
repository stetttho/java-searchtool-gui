 This is my 3rd favorite Abbott and Costello film. Actually, Abbott is much better in this one as compared to other films. Costello of course is always great! Its fun watching Horatio and Melody as Ghosts in this film  especially when Horatio (Costello) Haunts the place. Plenty of laughs so  just get in on the fun and enjoy this one.   P.S.  If you like this one,  get  "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein " and "Hold That  Ghost" which are the other two best A&C films besides this movie.
