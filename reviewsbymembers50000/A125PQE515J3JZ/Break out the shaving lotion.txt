 Ok, it may not be the best classic but i still think that it's one of Bela Lugosi's better films. I like this one more than many of his films. This movie stands out as a good low budget film with Bela in great form. If you  are a Bela fan, this one has to be in your collection!  As for the so  called sequel to The Devil Bat being "Devil Bats Daughter"  it in  my opinion is not very good but this movie The Devil Bat is one worth  watching . If you haven't been exposed to Lugosi, then get it and just  enjoy!
