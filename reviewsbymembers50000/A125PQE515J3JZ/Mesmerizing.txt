 This movie is still a gem to watch. I remember seeing it as a kid and it still holds up today. The atmosphere in this film is very good. The only thing i noticed was when Lugosi was killed as the wolf and had no clothes  seen, when found after he transformed back into a man he had his clothes  and of course Lon Chaney has a scene when he first changes and takes his  shirt off only to have his under shirt on and pants but when you see him as  the Wolfman he is wearing dark pants and a dark shirt. I guess the wolfman  had a change in clothes tastes. Anyway, if you forget about that, the movie  is still one of the best!
