 Ok, i was a fan of the original and i am also a great fan of this version. I don't know why it took so long for me to buy the video.  I saw it when it 1st came out, but as i say, YOU gotta get this one!   Also, my wife and I  note that Kevin Dillon in this version looks like my brother did at the the  time the movie was made. Its funnny, we always joke about it. Get the  Movie!
