 If you like Fay Wray then you will like these. The 1st film "Most  dangerous game" is not bad. A madman hunts people down like animals on  his Island and Fay Wray becomes one of the hunted. The only bad thing is  that the picture quality is not the best but probobly due to the orig  print.   Also, the madman (hunter) character is a little campy.  The 2nd  movie i actually enjoyed more.  The story is not as strong but the actors  are good. The Vampire Bat!!  This movie is complete with decent atmosphere  and the townsfolk running scared of so called Vampires or something.     It  turns out its Lionel Atwill playing a mad doctor taking the blood of the  people for his experiments. Fay Wray is in typical good form as always.   The picture quality is clearer in this movie but it has some junk in the  picture but that was expected since these are 1930's films. Enjoy!
