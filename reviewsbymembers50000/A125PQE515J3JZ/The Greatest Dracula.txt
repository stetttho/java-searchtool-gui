 This is a must for your DVD collection. It is Dracula. Ok, we all know the story so here is the rest. This DVD has the version directed by Tod Browning with Bela Lugosi in it as Dracula. There isn't much to say other than its fantastic. If only the production company hadn't cut some of Browning's other erie scenes. This DVD also contains the spanish version which is around 20 minutes longer and almost as equally good but it lacks the charisma of Lugosi. Get it and compare for yourself!! I enjoyed many of the actors better in the spanish version with the exception of Lugosi, Dwight Frye, and the american version of Martin's character.  Those are better in the american version than in the spanish version.
