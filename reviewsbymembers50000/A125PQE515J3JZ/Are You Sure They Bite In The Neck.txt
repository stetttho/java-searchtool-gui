 I give it 4 stars because this movie is neatly done. I saw it several years ago at the Starlite Drive In located in Priceton, In. It was a refreshing different view! If you enjoy comedy and vampire flicks and if you don't mind the other themes in this film then i think you will like it.  Bumbling vampire killers, lookout!! While Bela would have put the bite to your neck, thse might have bit you somewhere else!
