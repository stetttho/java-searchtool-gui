 I enjoyed this movie but it could have been better. My daughters and i like horror comedies and the like and this movie would be better without the cursing in it. Also it was a bit slow at times but other than that, it  is still a funny film and deserves good recognition. Igor was great!  My  favorite character!  If you like films such as this one or even spoofs of  the old horror classics, then watch this movie as it will be good  entertainment for about 106 minutes. I rate it 4 stars but feel it is only  about 3.6 of 5 stars.
