 Bop Hope and Paulette Goddard end up together in an old Cuban Mansion with a ghost or two. This is the 2nd film of this type with Hope and Goddard in together. The previous was the Cat and The Canary which I like even better. In Ghost Breakers they even meet a Zombie and the scene is actually spooky. Willie Best adds a little comedy to this film too while Hope does his usual great funny bits too. If you love spooky comedies this one is for you. There are not to many films of this type better than this one. Get it for your collection and you will want more!! My fav line: "It ain't Fried Chicken"
