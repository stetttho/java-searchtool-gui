 I bought this DVD in hopes it would be great but instead I find it to be just an average film. This story has been done different times and I can tell you that the absolute best version is the Bob Hope version (Cat and The Canary 1939). That film unfortunately isn't available. Another good version which is available is the silent one from around 1927 and it does a good job too.  If I were you, I would try to locate those versions before ever getting this version. Don't get me wrong, this film isn't bad but it just doesn't stand up to the other 2 versions.  The premise is as follows on this 1978 version: Glencliff Manor, 1934. A dark/stormy night. The family of a deceased millionaire has been summoned for the reading of his final will and testiment.  An unexpected visitor arrives, the chief psychologist from the local mental hospital who is searching for a dangerous criminal escapee. Turn off the lights and you can enjoy this one but I am spoiled by the 2 far better versions so please if you can, see the 1939 Cat and The Canary with Bob Hope and or see the silent 1927 version. Those I promise will make you forget this one.
