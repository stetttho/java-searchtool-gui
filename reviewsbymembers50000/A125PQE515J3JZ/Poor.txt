 The DVD is not very good quality print. Even the serial isn't that good. I got it because it was rare and had Bela Lugosi in it but I am sorry to say that it's not worth getting. Some of the actors are supposed to be of Oriental caucasion but it is obvious they were not in some cases. They could have called  the serial "The Death"  I am a fan of Bela lugosi but this DVD isn't worth it.
