 I must say that this is just amazing. The sets, dialog, atmosphere, and more... This movie is just about the best i have ever seen. Lionel Atwill and the others are fabulous. I love old horror and murder mysteries and  this movie does it all. The only thing is, please try to get your copy of  this movie in its orig technicolor as it is much better to see than in  black and white. It makes the sets and feel of the movie much better.  Thanks Norm, it was your review that led me to this movie !    P.S.  I  agree, Night Monster is another great movie!    I love it!
