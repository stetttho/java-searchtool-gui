 The old Munsters series is great and this movie is supreme!  If you loved the old show then you got to get this one. This movie still contains the magic of the show and the times unlike the later movie made "Musters  Revenge" which is also in my collection but not nearly as good as this  one. If only there were more to get on the Munsters!  I have the DVD  version of Munster Go Home and the quality is excellent! Buy it!
