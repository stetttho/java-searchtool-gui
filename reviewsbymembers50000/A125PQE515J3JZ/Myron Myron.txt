 This is a fine piece of entertainment. The family loved this film. Martin and Lewis put their spin on the Bob Hope Ghost Breakers remake called Scared Stiff. It is a pretty good remake but with some differences. Jerry is a hoot as always! The only comparisons I found not to be as good as Ghost Breakers is the zombie, he was not as spooky in Scared Stiff but still it was good! I also preferred Paulette Goddard from Ghost Breakers over Lizabeth Scott (Scared Stiff). Both films are great. Scared Stiff has some things I liked better and so does Ghost Breakers. Get em both, you'll go Bonkers!!  My daughter just laughs and laughs at Jerry Lewis playing Myron Myron as he does all his antics and silly voice. I highly recommend this film (Scared Stiff) as another great Spooky Comedy!! My favorite parts are:  Jerry Lewis shows you how a zombie acts and then when Jerry gets scared it's fun to see his expression on his face. When Jerry does the Carmen Miranda imitation is a Hoot!!     Ah and don't forget the surprise at the end!!
