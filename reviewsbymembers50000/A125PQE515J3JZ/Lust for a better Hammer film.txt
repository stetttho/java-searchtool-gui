 I am a Hammer Film fan, but this one lacks the style and content that other Hammer films contain. The pop music song in the film ruins it. The poor use of Ralph Bates is evident and he could have been used much better as he is an excellent actor. I still enjoyed watching it but like I said, it lacks some.... The DVD quality is good though I am looking for Twins of Evil to be released on DVD. That is a better film!!
