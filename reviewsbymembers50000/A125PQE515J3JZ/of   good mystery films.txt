 I have all 4 of Margaret Rutherford Miss Marple videos. If you have never seen Murder Ahoy and you like murder mysteries, then you will be hooked.  You will want to get the other 3 videos. The 1st is "Murder She  Said" and then "Murder at the Gallop".  After that is  "Murder Ahoy" and then "Murder most Foul"   You will  enjoy seeing Miss Marple solving the crimes and of interest is Mr. Stringer  who is her Librarian friend that assists her at times.  Mr. Stringer  (Stringer Davis) was actually Margaret Rutherford's real life husband.    Enjoy!    P.S.  My favorite of the 4 is "Murder She Said" but all  are good.
