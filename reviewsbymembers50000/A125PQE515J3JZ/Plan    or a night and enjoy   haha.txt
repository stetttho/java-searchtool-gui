 Ok, so we all know that there are several things done kinda poorly but this film is so bad that its a fun fest! I enjoyed it. Yes, it is sad that  this was Bela Lugosi's last film as i really am a huge fan of Bela but this  movie is a good one to have fun with and just look at it that way.  I  especially enjoyed the bonus interviews of Vampira, Bela himself and son,  and the rest. This is a must for all cult film fans and even for those who  like goofy spooky films and the like.
