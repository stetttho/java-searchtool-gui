 This is a very good one to see from the Blondie series. If you like Spooky Comedies as I do then you should enjoy this one. It's not the quality of Ghost Breakers (another great spooky comedy) but still a fun night complete with Daisy the family dog who gets scared and shakes, Dagwood getting the flashlight stuck in his mouth, the funny man who has to spend the night in the Haunted house as part of an initiation, and of course the Servants who turn out to be trouble...ha ha   Enjoy!
