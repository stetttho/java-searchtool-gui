 This is a classic old film from the 30's  1936 i think. It follows up after the end of the 1931 classic  Dracula. Gloria Holden plays Dracula's daughter and disposes of the body of Dracula (which was killed off in the 31 film)by burning the body. She seeks the advise of a London doctor for help in her affliction but of course follows the same path as her father! She never drinks wine!! This is a good film and if you like the old style films then you will enjoy it. Now, it would have been much better if only James Whale would have been allowed to do this film but the movie company I understand did not like his scandelous ideas and so we never got to see what would have been. James Whale of course directed Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and the Invisible Man and even the Old Dark House!
