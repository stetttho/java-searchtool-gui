 Ok, here it is. I am a huge fan of Abbott and Costello movies. Africa  Screams is a decent one and has many funny moments but its not their best.  Jack and The Beanstalk is ok but thats about it. You won't go wrong  watching these movies though. So, on this DVD double feature i went Ape and  Not Giant if you get my drift. Ape for Africa Screams and throw out the  magic beans for Jack and the Beanstalk. 3 stars is all i could give!
