 I saw this as a kid and loved it. Years later i saw pics and read an article on this movie in a sci fi magazine in the late 70's. After that, I wanted to once again see this low budget classic but never got the  opportunity until i saw it a couple years ago on AMC. Buy this video and  enjoy!   I can still remember the face of the Man From Planet X looking  through the spaceship window!
