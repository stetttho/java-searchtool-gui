 I can recommend this film if you really love the old horror films from the 30'3 and 40's but it doesn't meet the standard as the classics like The Wolfman or Dracula but it's still worth seeing. In this film, June Lockhart is talked into thinking she is a werewolf or She Wolf of London. Is she really? Watch and see what happens and enjoy a nice evening at home.
