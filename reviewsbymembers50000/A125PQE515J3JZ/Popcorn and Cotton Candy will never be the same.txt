 I love this movie! It is a cult classic! It has similarities to the Blob and yet this movie stands all on its own. The Klowns are scary in an odd way. Killer Klowns from Space land on earth and use their spaceship and  more to pose as part of a circus and appear to have stopped off for a snack  or supplies. Human snacks!  Enjoy this one, I think its worth it.
