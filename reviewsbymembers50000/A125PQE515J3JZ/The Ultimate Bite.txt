 This is my favorite movie from Hammer! The Film bites so well that i still have the marks on my neck! If you like vampire films then this is one you cannot miss. Peter Cushing is brilliant as always and Christopher Lee does an great job as Dracula. This film is complete with good atmosphere, color, direction and so much more. Get it!!
