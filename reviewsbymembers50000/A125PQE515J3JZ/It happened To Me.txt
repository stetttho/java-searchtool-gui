 I can't believe it. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The DVD is superb and the acting is great. The characters are extremely interesting and the movie will amaze you. The extras the DVD has is great  especially Frank Capra Jr. talking.  I am sorry but there are very few  movies today as good as the ones of yesteryear and this one is supreme!
