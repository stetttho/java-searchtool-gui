 This film was done at the same time as the one with Bela Lugosi and by the same company and this film is about 20 minutes longer.  It is every bit as good as the Lugosi version as far as the story,sets, etc.., because they used the same sets. The film has a little different feel because of a german director's mark made on this film. The only thing it needs is the charisma that Bela Lugosi has because Carlos Villarias is ok as Dracula but it's just not the same. I highly recommend this film for your collection. I enjoyed the characters better in this version a little more with the exception of Bela lugosi and Dwight Fry. I had never seen this movie until i saw it on AMC's Monsterfest in October of 2000. It's a blast so enjoy!!
