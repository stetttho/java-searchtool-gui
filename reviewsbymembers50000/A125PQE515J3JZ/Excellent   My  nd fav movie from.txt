 This is a very good movie. Tom Hanks is great as always and Michael Clark Duncan is just as good!  The movie is a bit long but it's so good it keeps you into the movie thus you don't really mind the time length of the film.  Hanks supervises Death Row in the 30's and meets John Coffey (Duncan), a  Death Row inmate who seems to have the gift of seeing people how they  really are and the gift of being able to heal and more. Thats all i will  say as you need to see the movie.
