 This 3rd movie is indeed a very good one but in a different way. The creepy and odd atmosphere of the movie makes it much more enjoyable. Ygor was top notch as well as Basil Rathbone playing the son of Frankenstein.   Karloff is always great but his role this time out is not as good as the  previous 2 movies.  This is still a good movie and highly recommended.
