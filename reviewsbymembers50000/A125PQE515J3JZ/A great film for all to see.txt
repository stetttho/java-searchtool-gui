 I loved the Universal Monsters and even in this movie as it is good to see them again at the end of a great period and also with the comedy mix of Abbott and Costello. This is my second favorite Abbott and Costello film  next to Hold That Ghost! The kids will also love this one as Costello  punches the wolfman in the nose!  Enjoy!
