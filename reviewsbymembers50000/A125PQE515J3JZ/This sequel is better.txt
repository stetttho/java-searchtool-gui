 Buck Privates was very good but i think you will find this movie even better because its faster paced, good action, plenty of funny moments, and i believe it has better direction. I highly recommend this one. This is  another Abbott and Costello film well worth watching. Not all of thier  films are great but this one is so just enjoy it.
