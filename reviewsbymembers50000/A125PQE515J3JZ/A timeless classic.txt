 I saw this movie over 20 yrs ago. My wife recently purchased the video from Amazon.com and this movie was loved by my whole family. It doesn't get much better than this and the movie reminds me some of the old Walt Disney  shows several years ago on sunday nights when i was a kid. Of course, i  still think movies are no comparison to Books, but if you just look at  movies then this movie can't be beat. The boy goes to the mountains to live  off the land, learn about nature and conduct his experiments and learn  about himself. It's wonderful!
