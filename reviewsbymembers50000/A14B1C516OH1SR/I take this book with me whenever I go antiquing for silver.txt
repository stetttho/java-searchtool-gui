 Although not the most comprehensive book on the subject, this book has more than paid for itself in helping me to decide whether or not to purchase pieces of antique silver that I might encounter while shopping the flea markets and antique shops or surfing on eBay. The small size makes it convenient to stick in your pocket or purse. There is an emphasis on Georgian silver and it is jam packed with important facts and clear color photos to give you a lot of pertinent information. I do have one major complaint. It does not contain a guide to English hallmarks in order to date silver. I suppose they left this out because they sell a similar pocket book containing that information. Other than that major goof this is probably the best little take with book on silver you can find.
