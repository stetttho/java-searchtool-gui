 If you collect English Victorian silver plate this book is a must. It has the most comprehensive directory of English silver plate makers marks I have ever seen. There are also Sheffield Plate marks which could come in handy if you can not decide if your piece might be electroplate or Sheffield Plate.  If you collect American plate this book is not for you as there is little info on American marks.
