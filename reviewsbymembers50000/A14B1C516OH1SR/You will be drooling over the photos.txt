 It is not likely you will ever encounter any of the glass shown in this book but the book is worth buying anyway for anyone who enjoys collecting depression glass. The photos in this book will have you drooling for hours. And who knows? You might actually find one of these beauties one day and buy it because you remember seeing it in the book and knowing that the $50 asking price was well worth it since Gene says its worth $2000!
