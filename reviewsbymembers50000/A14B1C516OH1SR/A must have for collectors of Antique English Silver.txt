 This book is a must have for anyone who collects antique English silver. Not as comprehensive as a lot of others I have seen which is actually a plus since it fits comfortably in your pocket when you go antiquing. I keep my copy next to my computer so I have it handy while surfing the silver listings on eBay. Well worth the price.
