 The book is  a lot of fun to look through. If you have already purchased several books on Victorian sterling and plate this would be an interesting addition to your library. If this is the only book you will be buying on the subject your needs would be better served by another book. This book conisists of turn of the century catalog reprints. The reprints are sharp and they are interesting to look at but there is not a whole lot of information.
