 For the money you can't do better than this if you collect Blue Ridge Pottery. Although there are many patterns of Blue Ridge  dinnerware not pictured the majority of the most collectible patterns are. The color photos are great and the history of the company is very informative. I have been  able to identify more than 90% of the Blue Ridge dinnerware I have picked up at flea markets and estate sales with this book.
