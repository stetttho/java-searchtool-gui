 This book is the greatest. If you haunt  flea markets and garage sales like I do you need this book. It will more than pay for itself the first month you have it by allowing you to identify the mystery stemware you pick up. I take it along with me every time I go to the flea market or a garage sale. Once you know the name of your stemware you can always sell it to Replacements or on eBay and pick up a little extra cash for more junk :)
