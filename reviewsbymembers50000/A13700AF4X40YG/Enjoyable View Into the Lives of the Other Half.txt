 I found this an enjoyable book with insights into how the other half live.  What I found nearly shocking is that the author used real names of recognizable people.     There are a number of books of this type out and I've read several and found this one to have less of the victim syndrome.  Her perspective comes from someone who was introduced to the Hollywood environment of the rich and famous as an employee.  As a result, her audience can probably relate to her viewpoint since she's giving us a peek into a place most of us will know about only secondhand through books like this.    The author wrote the story in a way that made me be able to relate to and sympathize with her situation without seeming to distort it or make her employers seem like monsters - and making some of them look good.  Her admission of mistakes and even misdeeds (eating Rhea Perlman's cookies and lying about it) prevented her from seeming righteous or blameless and ultimately more believable.  I particularly enjoyed her thought of what her first employers would do if they had real problems (after sweating profusely over the very small stuff).     Bottom line, it was a fun and entertaining book and provided some insider opinions of people most of us read about in People Magazine.  It just goes to show you that what our mothers told us is true - money doesn't buy happiness.
