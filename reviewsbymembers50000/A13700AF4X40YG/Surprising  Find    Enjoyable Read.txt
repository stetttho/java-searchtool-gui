 I consider this book a "find".  The title was intriguing enough that I picked it up and hoped for the best.  We've all probably read a number of "roommate" books - some better than others and some downright bad - this one was a departure from the norm - really good and enjoyable.    The characters are a rather refreshingly odd combination of personalities and backgrounds.  Each is different enough that it provides a nice variety of storylines, situations and perspectives.     Overall, I thought the book was charmingly different and a totally enjoyable read.  I was rather sorry to see the end of the book, as I felt as if I knew the characters and wanted to see what happened next in their lives.  What better can you say about a book?
