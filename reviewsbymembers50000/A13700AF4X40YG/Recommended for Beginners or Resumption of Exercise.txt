 I recommend this video for people who are new to exercise or are resuming exercise after a period of inactivity.  You'll need either the tall box/fanny lifter or something you can sit on that is approximately 14 inches in height, as the tape uses it for hover squats and lateral rows, as well as leg exercises and some arm work.  Also needed is a dowel or mop (I use a piece of PVC pipe I found in my basement) a set of light weights, one heavy weight (lateral rows) and a set of medium weights.    I returned to consistent exercise about a year ago and slowly worked up to resuming use of The Firm videos (I was one of the original Firm Believers who pre-ordered and pre-paid for the videos before they were produced).  Two of my favorites are The Firm #4 - Time Crunch with the divine Susan Harris and Kai S. and The Firm Maximum Body Shaping with Tracie Long (who lives up to all the hype).    I bought The Firm Fat Burning Video thinking it might be a good workout for a light day, but didn't feel like I got much of a workout - didn't break a sweat. However, I liked the routine -and found it fairly easy and fun to follow and felt the instructors were pleasant and gave good cues.  Like most Firm workouts, they alternated aerobic activity (in this case, low impact) with (very light) weight work (the least weight work of any Firm video I've done to date) and lunges/dips with the dowel.  The abs routine was fairly brief - I think the box said 3.5 minutes.    If you want to start using The Firm videos, I'd recommend you begin with this one before tackling some of the others, as I find most of the other Firm workouts to be some of the toughest and most intense of those I've encountered.
