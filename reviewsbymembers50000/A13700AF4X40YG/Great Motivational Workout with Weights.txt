 I bought this DVD even though I already had Sweat and Tone and thought it might be more of the same - but it's not.  You use two sets of weights in this routine - a lighter set for endurance and a heavier one for strength, then there's an Ab floor routine and cool down.    I started out liking the routine, but the more I do it, the better I like it.  This is one of his more recent tapes and features a more muscular Richard.  As usual, he has an assortment of shapes, sizes and ages of people doing the routine with him and they all look so happy and seem to be having a lot of fun - and you find you do too.  The music is great and between the motivational things Richard says and the words in the songs, you really feel good when you get done.  I've seen some definite improvement in tone and attribute it all to this tape and Sweat and Tone that uses toning bands.   Richard Simmon's queuing on this tape is very good.  I enjoy doing this tape and that says a lot from someone who doesn't enjoy exercising!!
