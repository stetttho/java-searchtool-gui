 I usually dislike learning new tapes/routines, as I feel like I spend my work-out time flailing around and having to stop and watch.  This one seemed easy to learn and was so much fun that the time flew by and I felt like I got a decent workout the first time.  If you've done any of the Blast Off series, many of the moves will be familiar enough that the variation will be easy to master.  The music was great and Richard and everyone on the DVD/video were having such a great time, I found myself smiling with them.    Richard's cueing is better on this one than many of his tapes, but that's relative, as cueing isn't his strong point.  If you pay attention and/or do his tapes often enough, you'll come to recognize the patterns and will anticipate most - and not having to hear the same instructions over and over again becomes a bit of a blessing.     I felt as if the moves in this routine were especially enjoyable to do and some made a klutz like me feel almost elegant or pretty doing them, if that makes any sense.    My only criticism is that there was something off with the last song before the cool down and I just couldn't get the beat or the moves until about halfway through the song.  Maybe the idea is that it's more free-form and I just don't get it, but it's surprising since the rest of the routine is so well choreographed and almost easy to follow and learn the footwork.    I totally enjoy doing this tape and like the 50 minute length.  The flaws were minor in comparison to the strengths and the time went by quickly.  As always, Richard's usual encouragement, motivation and joy were there to help make this a positive experience that leaves you feeling good you made the time to exercise.
