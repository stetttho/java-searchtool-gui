 I read this book a few months ago and it's still fresh in my mind, which I consider the sign of a truly good read.  Overall, the book was a good story, told in an utterly charming and fresh way.  The characters and setting are so well/vividly written that you feel as if you could picture it and almost believe such a place and people exist (and wish that you could visit them).  Enjoyable read and one I've been recommending to friends.
