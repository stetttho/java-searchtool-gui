 I almost didn't read this book because the title led me to think it would be the chronicles or diaries of a woman getting botox treatments.  In actuality, the book is a fairly typical story with central characters in their 40's.    I found the book was enjoyable and light reading - certainly not great literature, but it was entertaining and held my interest.  I won't spoil the story, so suffice to say it has a little of everything in the mix. I think the author was trying to have a regular person we could all identify with as the main character - but who dealt with the rich and glitzy to give us a little glamour.  The best way I can describe it is that most Chick Lit books are written about 20-somethings - and these characters seemed to be 20-somethings with a chronicle age of 40.  Chick-Lit for the Middle Age market.
