 I just finished this book and my only regret is that the author has no previous books that I can read.  There was nothing I didn't enjoy about the book - from the cover art to the conclusion.    The story draws you in immediately and then holds your interest with a plot both unusual and unpredictable.  I won't spoil the book for others by outlining the plot, but the characters were well defined and you felt like you knew them by the end of the book and are sorry to see your association with them - and the book - over. You'll wish you knew these people.    If you're looking for a light book that isn't vapid, for an entertaining read with a plot and characters you'll think about during breaks in reading (the sign of a good read to me), then I recommend this book to you.  The author has a fresh voice, resulting in a warm book that many people can relate to and enjoy.  I sure hope she can write quickly, as I'll be waiting for her next book!
