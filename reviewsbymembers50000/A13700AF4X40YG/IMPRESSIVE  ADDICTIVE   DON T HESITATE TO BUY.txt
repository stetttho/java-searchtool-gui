 Bought this CD not knowing what to expect and have been totally mesmerized and captivated.  Like the lyrics to "Drag", this CD "won't  release me", nor do I want to be.  This is a CD with many different  sounds and moods and the melodies stay with you long after the CD has  stopped playing.  The lyrics are that of universal situations and emotions,  but expressed and phrased in fresh and original ways. As for the guitars,  well, I wish I had the written ability or musical knowledge to adequately  describe the sound, which both enhances and sometimes drives the songs.   The album gets more impressive and addictive with every listen - I've  played it every day in the two weeks I've had it, to the exclusion of  nearly everything else.  My favorites are Collide, Drag, You Sink Me, and  Slide.  Bottom line, Justin Clayton has a sound unlike any other I've heard  before and am thrilled to have discovered.  I think he's an incredibly  talented songwriter and musician and hope this, his debut album, is the  first in a long and successful solo career (after hearing this, I think  he's been the talent behind the talent way too long).  BUY THE ALBUM, GET  HOOKED, AND SPREAD THE WORD!!
