 I wanted to like this book and I did to a certain extent, but in my opinion, it fell short of it's promise.  I won't go into the storyline and ruin the plot, but even though I'm looking for entertainment and can suspend reality, this one went over the line of believability.     However, Charlotte Clapp/Blossom McNeal was a simply unbelieveable character - too good to be true.  On the other hand, she did some surprisingly questionnable things for someone otherwise so wonderful.  Even so, I would have probably enjoyed the book a lot more if three of the main characters didn't do what was supposed to be so much profound thinking and speaking to one another - they turned into sermons.  It just got to be too much and too often and turned tiresome - started to seem like a self-help/positive thinking book posing as a novel.    In many ways, it tried too hard, with writing that was intended to be lyrical and magical but started to seem contrived and surgary.   Yes, I enjoyed it, but not as I would have if it had been a little less preachy.
