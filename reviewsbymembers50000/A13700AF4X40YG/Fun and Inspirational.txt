 I love this tape!  I'll be the first to tell you exercising can be a bore and a chore, but this one is so much fun that I actually WANT to do it!  None of the movements are difficult or strenuous, but it gets you moving to really catchy music with motivational messages.  Best yet, you feel great when you're done!  How can you go wrong?    I bought it to augment days when I do a weights work out and feel like I need some cardio or just to move around a little bit.  At only 20 minutes, it's also a great routine to use when you don't have a lot of time but want to get some exercise in.  It would probably be a great start for someone who hasn't exercised in a long while and wants to get moving.  The steps are relatively easy to follow, although getting the moves down on any new routine is always a little challenging for grace-impaired me.  Nothing is terribly strenuous and you can pick it up in terms of how much you move as you get more fit.    Bottom line, this is just a "feel good" tape with Richard Simmons at his best.  It's fun and you feel good and uplifted when you get done.  I went from dubious to an ardent Richard Simmons fan after buying a few of his videos and credit him for keeping me interested and motivated for the past 5-1/2 months.
