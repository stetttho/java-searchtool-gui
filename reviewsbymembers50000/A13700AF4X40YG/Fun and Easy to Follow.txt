 Not to contradict the prior reviewer, but after fumbling through the typical first run-through of any new exercise video, I found this one fairly easy to follow.     As with all the other Richard Simmons videos I've done, this one is fun, set to contagious great music that makes you want to move, the exercisers all appear to be having a genuinely good time and Richard Simmons is his usual energetic, motivational and funny self.  In typical fashion, Richard uses names for the moves that are both descriptive and make me laugh - one sequence in particular from this one is a scream - "dance" (as if you're being lead in a tango), "hug" (arms wrapped around yourself) and "hair" (arm bent at elbow and moved from front of head to back) - who else but Richard Simmons?   The 40 minutes is comprised of a warm up/workout/cool down that runs about 30 minutes, followed by a toning portion using wrist weights that lasts about 10 minutes.  The moves are easy to do and can be performed at whatever amount of intensity or energy that fits your level of fitness - you can turn it up or down to meet your needs.    After years of being an inconsistent exerciser, I decided to give it one more try and started using a Richard Simmons tape (Sweat & Tone, which I highly recommend for toning) and got hooked.  For the first time in my life, I actually look forward to exercising, have lost weight (am dieting too), and feel so much better and more energetic!  I'm in the process of buying every Simmons video/DVD I can get.  In all honesty, I never took him seriously until I did one of his tapes and my only regret is that I didn't wise up sooner.
