 I really enjoyed this book, much to my surprise.  I've worked as an assistant myself, not for celebrities, but for powerful and locally prominent people, and the sorry fact is that the depictions of the seriousness in which the people take themselves and their needs and the attitude and devotion expected of their staff is not exaggerated.  While the happily ever outcome may not be realistic, I thought the stories of each character had an air of authenticity and believability.       Somehow Robin Lynn Williams manages to keep the story from being depressing and makes the assistants likeable.  If you're looking to be entertained and amused, this is a good pick, as I really enjoyed the book.
