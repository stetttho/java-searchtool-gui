 This was a light book that was an entertaining and a fun read.  The plot wasn't immediately obvious and it was very current in that it dealt with internet/e-mail relationships and reality TV.    The portions of the book that dealt with the central character's weight issues were done well enough that if the author has never struggled with her weight, she's done a fabulous job of identifying with those who have.    Chick Lit done on a topic not often addressed in books (how refreshing)and with humor - fun and entertaining.  Highly recommended as a beach book or if you're looking to be entertained.
