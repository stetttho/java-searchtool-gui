 I've been using this tape for about 5 months and think it's not only a great toning workout, but fun to use.  My husband bought it a few years ago and when I wanted to lose weight and get toned up, I decided to give it a try - with great skepticism.  I'll admit I was wrong - this is a great tape and Richard Simmons is inspirational, motivational and just funny.    This tape uses toning cords and is about 40 minutes in length.  While people criticize his lack of queuing, this particular routine is fairly simple and moves slowly enough through the exercises that when you use it the first time or two, you don't miss but maybe one repetition while watching to see what to do.  After you've done it a few times, you don't need the advance queuing and it's almost a relief not to have a lot of queuing.    I'm now in the process of buying other Richard Simmons tapes/DVD's because his routines are fun and he's inspirational and motivational.    Since using his tape - in addition to a treadmill, I've lost weight and am seeing results in toning in areas of my body that I've never been able to reach - like my back and shoulders and have more upper body strength.  I've had the worst arms in the world my entire life, but have watched them get tighter and now begin to get some defintion - this is major!  I'm also using his Blast and Tone DVD, which uses weights, and recommend that as well.    I really recommend this for anyone who wants to start an exercise program but may be a little reluctant to start out with weights - or anyone who wants to tone.  I'm a Simmons convert - and I was a tough sell.  It's fun, the time goes by quickly and you'll feel and see the results if you stick with it!!
