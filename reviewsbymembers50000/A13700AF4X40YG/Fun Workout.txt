 This is such a fun workout that once you get the moves down, you'll hardly know you're working out until you're done and realize how sweaty you've gotten.  This was one of the first Simmons aerobic routines I'd done, so it took a few tries for me to get the routine down - but don't give up because you WILL get it.       As with most of Richard Simmon's workouts, you start out with a warm up and each song is progressively a litle more energetic until the cool-down - this one is 30 minutes in total length.  Also featured in every Simmons routine I've done so far, and this is no exception, are his motivational and encouraging comments.    If you doubt you're really getting a workout, take a look at some of the other (less fun) tapes and you'll see many of the same motions, exercises and stretches.  The difference is the fun and pure joy Richard Simmons brings to his videos.  Why do plain old exercises when you can dance and have fun with Richard?  I've never hurt myself with any of his routines, as I have with others (particularly my knees).  If you're looking for a safe but effective toning workout, I recommend Blast and Tone, as well as Tone and Sweat.    One word of caution - Richard Simmons IS addictive.
