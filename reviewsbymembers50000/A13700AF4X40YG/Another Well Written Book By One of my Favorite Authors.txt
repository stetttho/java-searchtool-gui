 Diane Chamberlain never fails to deliver an interesting story with well defined characters and The Bay At Midnight is no exception.    In trying to describe her writing, I can't possibly do her justice.  I never fail to recommend her books to people who want a well written and unique story.  The characters are all believable with flaws and virtues that make them seem real (and realistic), as well as likeable.  This writing ability adds to the reading enjoyment, as the people in the stories aren't clearly divided by "the good" or "the bad", adding to the suspense as the plot reveals unexpected twists and turns.      I won't go into the story line, but anyone who has ever visited or stayed at a beach community will find much to recognize here, with that bit of familiarity making it possible to almost envision it all, so well does Diane Chamberlain write.  I happened to read this while on vacation at the beach, making it all the more enjoyable.  I highly recommend not only this book, but all the books written by this author.
