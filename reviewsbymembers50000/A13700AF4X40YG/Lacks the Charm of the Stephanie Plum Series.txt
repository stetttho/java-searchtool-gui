 I hope Janet Evanovich has a lot of Stephanie Plum material left because the Barney series has run out of gas.  I can't explain why I like the Stephanie Plum series so much because the situations are utterly unbelievable, but perhaps that's the point.  While the plot lines and situations she encounters are unrealistic, the characters (in every sense of the word) all seem like people you know or are related to.      Even read on it's on terms without comparison to the Stephanie Plum series, this book lacked charm and ran the same lame jokes throughout the whole book until they got tiresome.  The characters just weren't well defined enough to really make you like them.  I will admit Barney has one positive - at least she has to rein in the appetite for SOME meals, while Stephanie eats like a horse and somehow never gains enough weight to be unable to get in her jeans (though maybe I like the fantasy - maybe we all like the thought there's SOMEONE out there that can eat like that and get away with it).    All that said, I've read worse and I did read the entire book, although shallow me got bored with all the political cuban intrigue plot.  It's like Evanovich got confused and suddenly thought the same people reading her books for comic relief and entertainment wanted something more intellectual to be happening.   Lastly, I have to raise the point of location.  Barney came from the Canton area of Baltimore, where her father has a garage.  However, she later refers to Barney as the Queen of something I can't remember of Baltimore COUNTY.  Sorry, but Canton is in Baltimore CITY, not Baltimore County.  Having lived in the Baltimore area all my life, I have to say that Barney and her family better fit the description of a Dundalk location, which IS in Baltimore County.  Bottom line, don't read this book expecting it to be as entertaining, charming or funny as the Stephanie Plum series.
