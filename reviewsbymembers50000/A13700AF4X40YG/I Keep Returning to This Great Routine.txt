 I've had this video since it first came out in the days when you paid in advance and waited for them to be done.  I'd like to tell you I've used it consistently since then, but I'm afraid I've spent nearly as many years on the sofa as I have in consistent exercise.    However, when I am exercising, this is one of my favorite exercise routines.  It's tough enough that I usually work my way up to having the stamina and strength to use it when I resume exercising and I always get a good sweat from it.  I'll be honest and admit that I've recently decided that the first three original Firm videos - Volumes 1, 2 and 3, may be excellent work-outs, but they're too much for me, especially now that I'm getting close to hitting 50.   The sets of working out with weights are broken up by sections of quick, relatively low impact cardio routines.  The tape moves by quickly, with good cueing from both instructors and fun music that I often find myself humming later.  While I sometimes dread the tough tapes, I find myself looking forward to using this one.  I used to think the 42 minute length was the reason I used it so frequently, but I really believe it's because the routine is such a good one.  When you're done, you feel worked out, but not ready to be laid out.   Others that I like are Maximum Body Shaping (with Tracie Long) and Super Body Sculpt.  Buying and trying most of The Firm "videos" produced after the initial 6 and finding many are great.
