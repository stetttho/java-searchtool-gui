 I'll admit it - I chose this book because I thought it would be something light.  A plot that involves the central character committed to attending 17 weddings in a few months couldn't be anything else, right?  It came as a surprise, albeit a pleasant one, that the central character wasn't a 20-something, but a 30-something successful career woman.  This seemed like a grown-up version of "Always a Bridesmaid".  Somehow these books always seem to have larger than life characters that few of us encounter in real life - at least in mine.  I won't ruin the plot or the ending by going into all that here - I figure most people read reviews to decide if they want to read the book and aren't looking for a Reader's Digest Condensed version.     Bottom line, I thought the book was an intelligent version of the genre of Chick Lit.  The characters are interesting and colorful, even if they aren't realistic ... but most of us read to be entertained, not to get another slice of our own lives, right?  The book was entertaining, witty and funny and enjoyable - although I wound up finding the central character tiresome (wanted to slap her) and ultimately had to wonder if she was self-destructive or merely stupid after all?
