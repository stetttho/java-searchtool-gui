 We got this as part of the 3-pack Body Sculpting System and it's my favorite DVD of the three.  Unlike most of The Firm routines, it uses no weights and there is no impact cardio in it - just very mild warm-up.  An emphasis on breathing and a lot of stretching in between various sets of exercises makes it an ab routine that is easy on the body and prevents the neck strain you often feel with long sets of ab exercises.   I found the focus on proper breathing technique to enhance form to be very instructive and beneficial.  The instructor is Lisa Kay and her cueing is excellent and her manner so calming that I actually find the routine soothing to do.  I've done this routine on my rest day if I'm feeling muscle soreness in my back or shoulders that a little stretching might help.  Besides, I'm waging war on abs that were so far gone they were declared a disaster area by the President and it's gonna take a lot of work and maybe a miracle.    I use The Firm's 5 Day abs on my cardio days or after weight training tapes that don't have an Abs section - but only if I don't have time for Ab Sculpt, which is 25 minutes.  I think the routine is excellent, but it seems deceptively easy because of the way the exercises are broken up and because of the stretching in between the sets.  I've felt muscle soreness the day after the tape, which tells me it's effective.
