 I have to admit I nearly didn't read this book - the title just seemed like more of so many others.  I'm so glad I did, as I really enjoyed the book.    I found the story to be an easy, charming and fun read - with the type of characters you wish you knew or could meet.  A story with a youthful central character, but with roots in a loving family of "barmy women" make it an engaging book.    The author thinks Jennifer Crusie really rocks - and I agree - and perhaps she'll be flattered to know her book inspired the same kind of upbeat happy feelings as I read HER book.  Like Jennifer Crusie, her story is filled with friendships and family and interesting people with occasionally wacky behavior ... adults who may not always want to act grown up.    I'll be looking forward to reading her already published books and have put her on my "author list" to watch for new publications.
