 I was surprised and disappointed at how much I disliked this book.  I valiantly tried to make myself read the whole book, but couldn't.  I've read and enjoyed other Judith Michaels books and looked forward to reading this one.  It had the makings of a good story, but the characters were one dimensional and flat.    Somehow I didn't have strong feelings of like or dislike toward the characters - the way they were depicted just didn't get me emotionally involved or invested in caring enough about what happened to them.  I found the extremes irritating - Sara was SO good she made my teeth hurt and became annoying and I never did understand Mack's issues - but then that will happen when you can't make yourself finish a book.    Another issue that is not unique to this book is how struggling families or people always seem to be surrounded by cashmere throws and other luxuries.  I suppose the readers are supposed to enjoy the description of such beautiful homes and things, but I've never figured out how they afford them.  Bottom line, this book just doesn't seem like one written by Judith Michael and it was so irritating I couldn't bring myself to waste the time reading it and did something I almost NEVER do - I read the last 3 chapters to see how it turned out.  From what I read, I made a good decision, as it doesn't look like it got any better - if anything, it got more unbelievable.    I'm sorry, as I hate to write really negative things, but skip this one.
