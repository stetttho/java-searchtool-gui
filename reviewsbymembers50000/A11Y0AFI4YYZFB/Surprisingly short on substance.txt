 There is some interesting information here, but ultimately much of this book is simply a history of African-American athletics, which is not exactly obvious from the book's title.  Hey, I'm as interested in the story of Jack Johnson as the next guy, but does the treatment he received really belong in this book?  Given that the book weighs in at 400 pages, you've got to wonder what his editor was thinking about some of these anecdotes.  On another note, I'm tired of seeing Tiger Woods be referred to as a "black golfer."  For the record, Tiger is 1/2 Asian, 1/4 black, 1/8 white and 1/8 Native American.  Why does his black ancestry somehow trump the other 75% of his heritage?
