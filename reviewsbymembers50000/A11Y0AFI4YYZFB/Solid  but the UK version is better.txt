 Frankly, I'd advise buying the UK version over this (just go to amazon.co.uk), because it has many more tracks and is hardly any more expensive.    One little gripe I have with both versions: where's Anya's song "Mrs.," from the episode "Selfless?"  I love that song and I'm sorry it's not included.  I hope we can someday get an album devoted to "Buffy" score music, as we now have from "Angel."  This show has had some fabulous score music and I wish we could have it released on one CD.
