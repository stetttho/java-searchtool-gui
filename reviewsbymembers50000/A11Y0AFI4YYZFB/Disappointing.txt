 Mr. Diamond seems to have written this book as a means of refuting the old theories about non-Europeans being backward, and in a classic case of political correctness, he actually argues that the inhabitants of New Guinea are more intelligent than their European counterparts.  (Yes, New Guinea--the same country in which cannibalism is believed to still go on in some areas.)  Here's the gist of the author's argument: Europe's dominance of the world was almost solely an accident of geography; Europe had more natural resources (both plant and animal) than any other continent, and even people stupider than New Guineans couldn't have screwed it up.    While there is no doubt that Europe has been blessed with a favorable climate, good soils and plentiful wildlife, the same can be said for many other regions (such as North America, Australia and even West Africa), and Diamond's attempt to explain the difference between them left me unconvinced.  Diamond's theory also completely fails to explain the success of Japan--a country that possesses few natural resources.  In short, this is a classic case of a guy using selective data to prove a questionable point.  Probably not worth your money.
