 This is a very interesting book than grants us great insight into the personality and religious beliefs of our current president.  I recommend it to anyone, regardless of political or religious views, who wishes to better understand George W. Bush and his goals.    I presume that most of the people giving this book a low rating have a political bias.  Disregard those reviews.  This is an excellent read for anyone who wishes to learn more about President Bush.
