 This series, originally produced for Showtime, is far and away the best and most faithful adaptation of Raymond Chandler's writing.  Powers Boothe shines as the cynical, world-weary Philip Marlowe, with excellent support from the rest of the cast.  If you are a fan of Chandler or hard-boiled detective stories, you owe it to yourself to see these shows.  My only complaint is that they aren't also offered on DVD!
