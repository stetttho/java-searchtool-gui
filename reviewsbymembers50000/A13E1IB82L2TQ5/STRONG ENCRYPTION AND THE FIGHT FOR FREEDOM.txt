 An excellent new near-future SF novel, dealing with the current inroads on liberty and how strong encryption might reverse the trend.  The novel focuses on a computer programer whose life is wrecked because a Federal Prosecutor decides to "make an example" of him for unwittingly writing code to be used by a company involved in drug dealing.  After losing everything he owns due to asset forfeiture and doing time in prison, the sadder but wiser hero begins to write an encryption program which will allow individuals to "opt out" and live invisible to government.  The novel raises many good philososphical points and tells a gripping story.  If you're interested in encryption or the future of liberty, READ THIS BOOK!
