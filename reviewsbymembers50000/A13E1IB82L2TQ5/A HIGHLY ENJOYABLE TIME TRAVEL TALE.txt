 1632 was a true joy to read.  While not as wildly inventive as some tales, such as LORD KALVAN, it was still quite fun.  The author displays a fine knowledge of the chaotic period of the 30YRs War and presents wonderful  character studies of some of the historical figures.  The novel also  celebrates the value and applicability of good old fashioned American  values.  Flint rightly shows that IDEAS have a much greater and long  lasting impact than technology.  Thus the most powerful tool the Americans  weild in the 17th Century is the American ideal of freedom and justice for  all people.  A fun and thoughtful book.
