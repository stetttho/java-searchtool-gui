 I decide to purchase this book based on a recommendation from the SFWA webpage, and I found it to be well worth its cover price.  I particularly liked that it did not skimp on discussing the more mundane aspects of writing professionally, e.g. taxes, standard formatting, contracts, dealing with agents, etc.  Along with this, the sections discussing the actual act of writing were also good, but I have read several works about that.  This is the first book to give me a good feel for the nuts and bolts of actually submitting stories and getting paid for them.  Highly recommended!
