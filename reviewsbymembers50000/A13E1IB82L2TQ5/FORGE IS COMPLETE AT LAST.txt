 Finally!  After years of waiting, we get to learn how this story turns out.  Originally to be published as a trilogy, the fianl book was cancelled by the publisher for being too radical!  L. Neil Smith does his usual fine job of blending outlandish aliens, humor and political philosophy to  produce a cracking good read.  A fun adventure story which takes a few  well-aimed shots at some of the sacred cows of today.  This one is pure  pleasure!
