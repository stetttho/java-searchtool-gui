 Well, it's been a long time coming, but the DVD set we've been waiting for is finally here.  The first season of Babylon 5 has been released and it is definitely worth the wait.  From the viewpoint of a B5 fan, the DVD set is exquisite, with beautiful widescreen transfers and bone-shaking Dolby 5.1 sound.  Even the case for the 6 DVD set is great looking.  If you're a B5 fan, this is set will only whet your appetite for the rest of the series. But what if you're not already a B5 fan?  In that case, I envy you.  You have yet to discover what a fantastic show you have been missing.  B5 is about as far above and beyond your typical TV SF (think Star Trek in any incarnation) as the original Star Trek was beyond the original Lost in Space.  It's a show about humanity and the human condition, in spite of its alien characters.  If you want to see what TV can be at its absolute best, this is your chance.
