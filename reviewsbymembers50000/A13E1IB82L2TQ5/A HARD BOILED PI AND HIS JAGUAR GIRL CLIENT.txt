 A great new SF detective story!  Our detective hero follows in the tradition of Phillip Marlowe and Sam Spade, as he finds himself with a beautiful client who is also a murder suspect.  His client also happens to  be part jaguar; in the future,genetic technology has permitted the creation  of "critters", mixtures of human and animal genes.  These  critters have become the new underclass, used as sex slaves and worse.   Shetterly presents a very interesting society, an attempt to present a  Libertarian dystopia, where respect for private property has permitted the  enslavement of sentient beings and machines.  In addition to these  interesting societal ideas, Shetterly has dreamed up one of the coolest  gadgets in recent memory, the Infinite Pocket.  I sure wish I had one!  A  fine, fun novel, with plenty of action and lots of good ideas.  You'll  enjoy it!
