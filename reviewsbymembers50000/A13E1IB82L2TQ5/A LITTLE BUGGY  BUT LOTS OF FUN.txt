 Growing up, most people dream of being a pirate.  After watching CAPTAIN BLOOD, most think what fun it would be to sail the Spanish Main and pillage the Dons.  CUTTHROATS satisfies that desire.  Lots of territory to cover,  numerous towns to sack, much treasure to bury and dig up, not to mention  the "Drinkin' and Whorin'".  Not the most reliable game, but  Eidos continues to put out patches to fix problems (Patch 5 due out this  week).  In spite of the bugs, well worth playing.
