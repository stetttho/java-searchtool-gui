 Matz creates a truly fascinating and original protagonist, while placing him in a believable future world.  I especially liked the way the character's background and the facts about the society he lives in emerged  bit by bit in the course of the story; no long bouts of dull exposition  here!  I sincerely hope to see a lot more, both of the character Robie and  from his creator, Matz.  This guy is someone to watch.
