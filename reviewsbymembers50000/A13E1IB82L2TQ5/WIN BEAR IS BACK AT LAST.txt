 A new North American Confederacy novel at last.  After a hiatus following THE GALLATIN DIVERGENCE, L. Neil Smith has finally returned to his most popular creation, the alternate world first visited over twenty years ago in his classic novel THE PROBABILITY BROACH.  As fate would have it, THE AMERICAN ZONE deals specifically with how a truly free society would handle a spate of terrorist attacks.  In the wake on 9-11, the issues LNS deals with are incredibly relevant for Americans today.  All our favorite characters return, including Lucy Kropotkin and Will Sanders, plus numerous figures from our own world (or similiar realities) appear under different names.  Half the fun is realizing which real-world public figure LNS is skewering under another name.  As always, there's plenty of action, lots of laughs, and a fine mystery along with the libertarian philosophy.  If you can stand to take your freedoms straight, with no chaser, this is the novel for you! Read and enjoy.
