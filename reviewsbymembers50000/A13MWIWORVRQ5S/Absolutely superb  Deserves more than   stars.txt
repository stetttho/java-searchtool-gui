 I am sometimes sorry I cannot give less than one star to some books I have read (I read hundreds of books professionally). On this occasion I am sorry  I cannot give more than five stars. It is absolutely superb, a perfect  jewel of a book which I had never heard of and discovered only by chance.  The heroic scale and width of concept, and I say this with all seriousness,  can be called Shakespearean. Splendid descriptive writing, action and  characters, with resonances at the very centre of great mytho-poetry. I  knew Poul Anderson was a great writer, but this took my breath away! The  best novel I have discovered in years!
