 This is one of those odd movies that have, quite nexpectedly, the quality of masterpieces. It was the best surprise I have ever had in a cinema. Full of images (the smashed lifeboats, the rats, the final storm) and a  situation that lingers in the mind. It is a somehow "special"  film and a perfect  but unconventional sea adventure. Perhaps because of  its unconventional plot and narrative it manages to be quite unforgettable.  One of John Wayne's best. Some brilliant camera-work.
