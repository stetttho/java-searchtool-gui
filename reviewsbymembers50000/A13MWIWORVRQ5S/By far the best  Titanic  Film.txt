 So much better than James Cameron's slick hokum that the latter isn't even in the race.This is the definitive account of the disaster (I'm not anti-Cameron. I like a lot of his other films). This is stark,  unforgettable, true to historical fact as was known at the time and doesn't  patronise the audience. It is argueably a little hard on Captain Lord of  the Californian but that is periferal. This is the film to see to get the  feel and the atmosphere of what really happened. Kenneth More (an ex-Naval  officer)is excellent as Lightoller, the central character. Does not neglect  the drama of the engineers, the baker, etc.
