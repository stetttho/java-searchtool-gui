 I picked this Cd up in a store that had a clever display linked to an interview with Emmy Lou Harris.  In the interview, she talked about her most admired artists; Gillian Welch is one of them.  I had also heard Gillian Welch in "O Brother Where Are Thou" (my other favorite CD right now), and was eager to hear more of her.  I was not disappointed.  There is a purity to her voice and her songs that sounds like something from 70 years ago.  It's American music at its best, I think: incorporating traditional sounds and themes with modern ones, in a way that still honors the past. Buy this CD.  You will love it.
