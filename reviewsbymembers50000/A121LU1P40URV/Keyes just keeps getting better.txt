 I loved this book! I like all of Marian Keyes' books, but the characters in this one really reached out of the book and pulled me in.  We watch three friends as they make their way - together - through a difficult year; we also get to revisit the 80s when they were adolescents in dull West Ireland, before they escaped to London. These people are so real, so imperfect and lovable, that I had to keep reading to find out what would happen to them. The end was not predictable -- well not really, and I enjoyed every minute of the book.
