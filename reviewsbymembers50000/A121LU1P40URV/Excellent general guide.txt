 I resisted buying this book, thinking it would be an old-fashioned fuddy-duddy sort of thing.  It's not!  I checked it out from the library recently to look up some invitation questions we had - and found that it has a wealth of information about every step of planning a wedding.  It has solid, well-organized advice, and is up-to-date. It includes a chapter on using technology, for example, and when traditions have changed a bit, she mentions that both the established way of doing something, and also how practices are changing. Lists of questions to ask potential caterers, photographers, etc. are included.  I would list it as one of the two best books for wedding planning (the other one is "Bridal Bargains").
