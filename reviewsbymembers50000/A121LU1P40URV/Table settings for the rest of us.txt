 I checked this out from the library, looking for inspiration for an upcoming party.  I have been disappointing by over-the-top books that purport to tell us how to decorate for a party... IF that party is at our country home in Connecticut, or at our Manhattan loft!  Well, I have neither, just a VERY small condo in Seattle.  This book has lots of clever ideas for making use of small spaces, mismatched tableware, and other things that "normal" people have in their homes, or can borrow from friends.  For example, there are some great ideas for using the wooden "TV trays" that many people have.  Also good ideas for using inexpensive color overlays, mini lights, and different levels on tables to liven things up.  I didn't find this book a bore at all.  I loved it!
