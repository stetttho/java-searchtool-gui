 I love the intensely personal lyrics of this album.  It's interesting:  the title track is my favorite, and the previous reviewer didn't like it at all.  "Talk to Me While I'm Listening" can bring tears to your  eyes at times.  But don't worry, the album is a nice mix of upbeat and  introspective.  This is one of those albums that stays in my CD changer  permanently.
