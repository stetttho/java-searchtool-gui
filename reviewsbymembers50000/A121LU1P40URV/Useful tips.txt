 I bought this book for my daughter, who is planning an October wedding.  I may buy myself a copy too.  This book has good ideas for saving money and even comes with a guarantee that you will save at least $500 using advice in the book.  One example: tell caterers you are planning a family reunion, rather than a wedding -- prices automatically go up when "wedding" is mentioned.  Another tip: get all charges in writing from the bridal shop, so you aren't stuck with "extra" charges like garment bag, additional alterations, etc.  They give lots of phone numbers and web addresses.  It's practical advice in an easy-to-read format.
