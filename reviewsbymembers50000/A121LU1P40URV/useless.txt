 This book has no useful information in it.  The pictures are pretty, but I don't spend good money on a book just to look at the pictures.  Even the ideas aren't all that creative. If I had cupboards full of antiques and drawers full of beautiful linens, I wouldn't need a book to tell me how to use them. Other, better books show the same techniques and ideas, and show them with materials more easily available to us mere mortals.   The example that really did me in was the little girl's birthday party... with crocheted lace doilies on the drinks glasses, and all the little girls in Edwardian-style lace dresses.  PLEASE!  You want an example of a pretty child's birthday party, get the Shabby Chic entertaining book.
