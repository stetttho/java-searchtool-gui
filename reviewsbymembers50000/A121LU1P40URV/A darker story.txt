 I have been eagerly following the adventures of Catherine and Edgar.  This book takes them to Scotland, where Edgar has been summoned to avenge the death of his two older brothers.  This is a more complex story than the others, with lots of clerical and political wrangling.  And yes, I did find the ending a little weak.  But the characterizations, and the surprise ending compensate a bit, I think. Catherine and Edgar both continue to change and to mature as they struggle to meet the challenges life presents them.  No, this story isn't as humorous as the first one, for example, but it allows us another glimpse into the relationships between the main characters, and also into life in 12th century Scotland.
