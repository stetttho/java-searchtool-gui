 I checked this out from my local library to see if I could find ideas for helping my daughter with her wedding.  I had NO IDEA you could get so many bridal bargains on eBay.  For example, we were going to make her veil, to save the $150 a veil usually costs.  On eBay, we can get the same veil for about $25.  There are also great ideas for saving money in other ways -- inexpensive ways to decorate your reception, ideas for bridal party gifts, and more.  This is the best wedding planning book I have read.  Well worth the price of the book.  In fact, my daughter just ordered one off Amazon for herself.
