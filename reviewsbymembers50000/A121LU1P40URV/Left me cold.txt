 Maybe I'm just out of touch with modern society. Maybe I'm too much in touch, and our heroine's credit problems strike too close to home. At any rate, I just could not get interested in this book, in Becky Bloomwood and her problems, or in any of the other characters in the story. Conspicuous consumption is not funny. Going hopelessly into debt so that you can buy more stuff you don't need is not funny.
