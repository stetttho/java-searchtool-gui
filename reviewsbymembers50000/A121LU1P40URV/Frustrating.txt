 I "upgraded" to this phone from a perfectly good Nokia because I wanted a flip phone.  I have been very unhappy with it.  The menus are not intuitive, and I have found it difficult to find features without consulting the users manual.  Most irritating, the phone just SHUTS OFF randomly.  I did like the dynamic light feature, with different light schemes for different functions -- but that is just fluff.  I need the phone to stay on, and I need to be able to use it easily. It did neither.
