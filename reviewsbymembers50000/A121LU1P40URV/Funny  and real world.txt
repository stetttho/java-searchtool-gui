 I see a lot of negative reviews here, but I think this book is hilarious and very real.  It may seem to some like it has a feminist agenda, but if you have ever worked in a high-pressure business (as the heroine does) you will have experienced some of the frustrations of trying to compete with men who have stay-at-home wives, or have tried to ignore sexual jokes during meetings, or rushed from work to school to home.  I loved reading about a woman a little like me, who is over 20 and is trying to DO IT ALL.  It is not preachy, just very funny and very true - and the revenge she exacts on a particularly vile coworker at the end of the novel is WONDERFUL.  Does she make the right decision at the end of the story?  You read it and decide for yourself.
