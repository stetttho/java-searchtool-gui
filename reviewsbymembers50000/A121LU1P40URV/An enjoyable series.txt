 I picked this up in a Canadian bookstore (it can be hard to find in the U.S.) and eagerly ordered each subsequent volume from Amazon.  This is historical fiction at its best.  Perhaps the characterizations are not as deep as another type of novel, but the plots zip along as Harrod Eagles plunges the reader into historical England. I enjoyed the details, such as the description of the road from Yorkshire to London in the winter.  And for the most part, I really cared about the characters.  Even if one volume in this series is not quite as good as the others, the series as a whole makes for fascinating and entertaining reading.
