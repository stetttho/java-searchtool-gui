 With two such fine performers as Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton, and with Charlotte Bronte's masterful story, I could not believe that this version of Jane Eyre would be anything but enjoyable.  Sadly, I was disappointed.  I think the problem lies with the screenplay. A complex story was reduced to 2 hours, which meant that key plot and character development had to be sacrificed.  Hinds and Morton just did not have enough to work with.  Stick with the Timothy Dalton version, it is far better.
