 I really enjoy this series.  The historical detail is interesting, the plots intricate enough to keep me reading, and the characters remain interesting, volume after volume.  This book involves more royal intrigue, a refugee in disguise, and Isaac's apprentice gets to solve some mysteries, and cure some people, on his own.
