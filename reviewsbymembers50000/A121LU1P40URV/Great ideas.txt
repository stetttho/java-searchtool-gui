 I look at a LOT of knit and crochet books.  This is one I am willing to buy.  It has wonderful ideas that are a step above the standard baby crochet style.  I found the instructions easy to follow, and the results rewarding.  Even the book itself is a compact square shape, which fits easily in a project bag.  I am an intermediate crocheter; it is possible that this book is a little beyound total beginners.  But buy it anyway to get inspired!
