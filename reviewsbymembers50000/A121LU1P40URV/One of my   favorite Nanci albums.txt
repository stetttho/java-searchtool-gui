 I love this album!  I think it's a brilliant compilation of tunes that have influenced so many musicians (and so many listeners too) over the years.  Having the original artists/writers perform with Nanci is lovely  touch which adds depth to the album.  I can listen to it over and over  again, and keep hearing new things.
