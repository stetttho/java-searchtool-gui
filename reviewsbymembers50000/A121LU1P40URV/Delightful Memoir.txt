 This is a delightful memoir of Sachs' early years, and his early passion for chemistry.  If you are totally uninterested in the sciences, you may not be able to relate to his boyhood passions.  But if, like me, you spent your childhood looking through microscopes and blowing stuff up in the basement, you will resonate with Sach's story of his youth.  It is fascinating to watch the development of such a brilliant mind.  I only wish that Sachs had shared more about his family and what happened to them.  For example, I never got to find out what happened to a mentally ill brother.
