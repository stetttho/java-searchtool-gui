 I just finished this book, and found it to be immensely helpful in developing my meditation discipline. I found the discussion of the stages of contemplation fascinating and helpful to my current stage on the  journey.  Some of these kind of books tend to be hard to read.  I find this  one to be straightforward, easy to understand and to apply.
