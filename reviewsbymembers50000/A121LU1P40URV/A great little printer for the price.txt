 I got this printer packaged with a new Dell system.  I usually always go with HPs, but this little printer is a jewel.  It's not the fastest in the world, but resolution and print quality are excellent, and it just prints away with no problems.  Small footprint means it fits on even crowded desks.  Replacement cartridges are reasonably priced.  My daughter is going away to college, and I think I am going to buy another one for her laptop.
