 I have read quite a few mushroom books in my course of book reviewing, but I would have to say this is one of the best. This book has great coverage on propagation, cultivation, identification and collecting. I like the decision to leave out mushrooms of unknown edibility because  it makes the book much more manageable. The photography is excellent. I liked the addition of habitat shots of where certain mushrooms grow. This would surely help anyone who is a collector.  This book stayed on track and didn't try to be all things to all people. For instance, in the cultivation section, they tell you what to read for more information depending on the type of mushroom.  This book has great information on all levels and is helpful guide for the novice to expert gardener.
