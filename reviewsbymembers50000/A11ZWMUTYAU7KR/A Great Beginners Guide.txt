 Wow, I wish they had a book like this when I started fish keeping. I think there would be fewer fish in heaven if I had a book this informative. From tank choice to maintenance, the 12 weeks this book covers is jam packed with practical information. This book includes helpful information on plants, filters, fish choice, fish diseases and much more. The step-by-step photos are great and extremely easy to follow. The information is timeless and very well done.  This is a great gift for anyone who has or wants to get a fish tank.
