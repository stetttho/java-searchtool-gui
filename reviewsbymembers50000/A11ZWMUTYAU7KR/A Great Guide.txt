 This book is a must have book for any botanic garden library. The amount of information is unbelievable and very easy to follow. There are sections on growing, propagating, hardiness and more. Everything you need to know to grow these plants.  The Gusman's describe each plant wonderfully, although I wish a hint of hardiness was included in the descriptions so I could start making a list of some for my garden. There are tons of photos that are so beautiful and so well taken that it will make you want to dive right into this strange group of plants.
