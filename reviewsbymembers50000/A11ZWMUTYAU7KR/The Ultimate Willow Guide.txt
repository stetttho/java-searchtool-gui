 Chris Newsholme really knows his stuff. This is the ultimate willow book including great information on propagation, planting and maintenance. This book has so many great species and varieties, I want to start collecting now. Although I don't produce my own compost to pot up my plants, I am sure a no-soil mix from the garden center will work.  This book has it all, from the background and history of willows, to the characteristics and the many different types of willows. I would have liked a hint as to the hardiness of the plants listed, but you can't have everything all in one great book.
