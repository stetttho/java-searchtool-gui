 This book is a very interesting reader. The essays on the important founders of Midwest landscape, spoke of a greater view of the American Civil Condition and how landscape can promote civilization and community in a diverse group of people. This is a strong undertone of the book.  Not all the architects were enamored with. The wild Midwest landscape sought to build upon it to create a more varied and interesting landscape. It is interesting to note that what most of us regard as the Midwest look, is artificial and created by these progenitors of our current landscape. This is not a book for everyone, but is very insightful
