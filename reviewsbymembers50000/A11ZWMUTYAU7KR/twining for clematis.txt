 This is a great book for the beginner and the experienced I couldn't put it down the information was practical. You can tell this is written by someone that actually grows these. The photos are great I longed for more of them. The chapters are nice you don't have to wade through the text to find what you are looking for. I liked the chapters on pairing the clematis with other plants that act as the support. This was inspired I get really tired of clematis on  the trellis routine.  I think every gardener that has grown or wants to grow clematis would benifit from this book. I sure did.
