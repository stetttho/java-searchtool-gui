 I really want to try to grow more bromeliads after reading this book. From Earthstars to Spanishmoss, this book cover all you would want to landscape with.   Andrew Steens did a great job of conveying his love for these plants. The descriptions, hints on where to plant and photography are all excellent. Steens explains everything from what bromelids are, their history, and the types of genera.  I would have liked to see a few more how-to photos, just because it might have helped the novice gardener. This is a great book for someone into tropical gardening or houseplants.
