 This book is a great read for anyone wanting to know where the names of plants evolved from. Linda Copeland and Allan Armitage skillfully put this book together by sharing the stories of the people plants were named after.  Learn the stories behind `Baths Pink', Calycanthus `Michael Lindsey,' or Heuchera `Montrose Ruby,' just to name a few.  I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of getting to know these great people behind the plant. This book is a great read on a rainy cold day.
