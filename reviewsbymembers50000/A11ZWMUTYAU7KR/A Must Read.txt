 This is a great book for someone wanting to read about how and where different plants come from. Ward takes you on a journey of exploration making each of the entries in this book an adventure. I really enjoyed reading about the Sargents and Wilsons of our time and the great plants they have contributed to. I have already found some plants that I can't live without.  The photography is first rate making each plant stand out at you with its vibrant colors.  This book may not be for everyone, but is well worth a look from master gardeners and those curious about the evolution of plants.
