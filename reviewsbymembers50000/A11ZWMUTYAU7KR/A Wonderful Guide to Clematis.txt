 The first thing that stands out when you read this book is the great photography and excellent illustrations. Raymond J. Evison guides you through the wonderful world of Clematis by teaching you all there is to know about this beautiful plant. You will learn the history, classification, the different species, and much more.  As Evison states, this book isn't a monograph of the species, but a guide for the gardener. So, it has just enough background information so that the gardener has a good foundation. Even I got a bit lost in the groups section, but it becomes clearer as you get more into the book.  I would have liked to see some shots about propagation, planting, training, and pruning, especially in a growing guide, but overall the descriptions and the book as a whole is great.  This is not a book for the complete novice, but for the intermediate to advanced gardener.
