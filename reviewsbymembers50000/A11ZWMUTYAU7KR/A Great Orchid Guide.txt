 Robert Friend has inspired me to look at orchids in a whole new way. Friend covers everything there is to know about orchids. From the different types of orchids and which type of garden to grow them in, to growing orchids in pots and containers and which pests to look out for.  I may not be able to leave my orchids outside year round, but his chapter on growing orchids indoors is very helpful in keeping mine alive and beautiful no matter what the weather is outside. This book is really for someone who already had the orchid basics down. But for anyone who grows orchids already, this is a book that might inspire you to look at your plants in a new light.
