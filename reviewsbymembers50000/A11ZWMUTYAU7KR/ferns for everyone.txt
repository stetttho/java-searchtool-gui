 I love ferns and this is a great book full of usful info on where the plant comes from and how to grow them. The intro sections of the ferns are great, giving general info on the genus. The Photos are just fantastic and not just few but tons of them. Most of the entries have a little cheat sheet that gives the basics on every plant before the description. I especially liked the availability entry. It was all good and it felt easy to read. If I saw a fern in a book or store I could look it up and see if I should get it. A great job.
