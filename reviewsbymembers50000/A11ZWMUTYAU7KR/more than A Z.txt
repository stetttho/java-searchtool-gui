 ferns are some of my favorite plants. This is a great book and I have had it a while I use it every time I teach a class on ferns. I really like the comarison shots of the different selection. THose really help to Identify labeless plants. I would have like some of the info in a bullit points at the beging or end of each enrty. for height hardiness and the like the stuff that every entry should have  this would have made the book easier to use. BUt that doesn't  mean I wouldn't get it I love this book. It is a must have.
