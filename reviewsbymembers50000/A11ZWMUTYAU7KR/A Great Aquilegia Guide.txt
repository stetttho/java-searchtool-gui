 Both botanical and gardener friendly, this book is every bit as good as Robert Nold's last. Although Paraquilegia and Semiaquilegia are mentioned, this book is mainly on Aquilegia. His coverage of Aquilegia is great as he goes in depth about the history, species, diseases and much more. The chapters on pest, propagation and cultivation are great and speak of his experience with these plants. So, if you are looking to learn more about these unique plants, this is the book to check out.  Nold's descriptions of these plants will definitely make you want to try more of this genus in your garden.
