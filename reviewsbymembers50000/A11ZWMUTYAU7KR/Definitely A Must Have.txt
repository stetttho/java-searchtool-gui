 When I first got my review copy of this book, I thought, not another coffee table book full of pretty pictures and drivel. But was I in for a surprise. Very few garden books have the incredible photography of this book. Combine that with great articles on the plants, seasoned plants and people and I was very happy.  I am glad to have a beautiful book with equally insightful information on the plants. As Beth Chatto speaks about Sarracenias in the introduction, I may not be able to or want to grow the plant, but the pictures and information let me dream.  This book was very well done and is a great gift for any gardener, even the arm chair kind.
