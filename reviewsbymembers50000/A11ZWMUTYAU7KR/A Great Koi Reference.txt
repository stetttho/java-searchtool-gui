 This is a fantastic book for anyone needing tips on keeping the environment their koi live in heathy and free of disease. This book is very easy to understand and has many photos to help you better understand what you are reading. Everything is well photographed with excellent instruction on identifying, prevention and the treatment of diseases. When the photography was not good enough, then wonderful and highly detailed illustrations were used.  The text is straight forward with little jargon so that it is easy to understand for even a non-fish person like me. This is a great book for anyone interested in going to the next level with their pond.
