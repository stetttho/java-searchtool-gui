 This cd is about as straight forward as alternative rock gets.  Hard driving, melodic, well produced.  This isn't the most original cd I've heard, but the combination of styles is done, very, very well.  The influences here are obvious, but no one band shines through in the fighting jack's style.  You can hear bits and pieces of the foo fighters, rival schools, a tiny bit of sunny day real estate, embodyment, and a surprising inclusion of a bit of a much underated band once known as puller.  This cd is done quite well.  It starts to lag a bit around track 9 when the customary slow songs kick in, but the overall length of the cd makes up for it.  If you like alternative rock, I doubt you will be disappointed by this cd.
