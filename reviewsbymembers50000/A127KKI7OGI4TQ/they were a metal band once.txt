 Well......I have mixed reactions to this cd.  It's blindside without a doubt.  Christian's vocals are still the passionate masterpiece that they ever were.  But what I see with each new album from blindside is that they are less metal and more alternative rock.  That's a good and a bad thing.  The only track on this album that is really metal is the title track.  But that's ok.  This album is far more diverse than any of their old works.  Weird little slow parts, lots of melody, an odd techno beat here and there.  Don't get me wrong.....this album is as passionate and loud as ever, but with each release, blindside just becomes less and less metal.  If you're ok with that, than this album is good.  Worth the money overall.
