 I got this album based on the guest vocals done on a delerium album.  This album never approaches the darkness or quality of arrangement of that song, but it is very worthy of your purchase if you enjoy her voice.  She has a very catchy voice that will be stuck in your head for weeks after listening to this album.  The band is not as talented as delerium, but the music is very catchy.  However, the level of "pop" here never quite approaches other Swedish counterparts such as Ace of Base or Abba.  Overall, this album is fairly original.  Well worth your purchase simply for the beautiful vocals.
