 Scott has crafted an all time rock masterpiece with this album.  After the release of pack up the cats, I laughed at the thought of Local H putting out good music ever again(hey, that album was pretty bad....somehow I think Joe's departure was related closely).  When I heard this album, I was shocked.  Every track is solid.  There isn't a bad song on it.  This album may actually be better than As Good As Dead(although that remains as my favorite....it was the soundtrack to my teenage years).  I feel bad about the loss of popularity of Local H.  They once had videos on MTV that I saw during daylight hours even!  Now, they hardly draw a crowd at their concerts.  I almost feel bad for Scott, being that talented and getting no recognition.  But on the other hand, his brash display of bitter, angry drunkeness when I saw them in concert took away my sympathy.  Regardless, buy this cd....and As Good As dead, if you don't already have it.
