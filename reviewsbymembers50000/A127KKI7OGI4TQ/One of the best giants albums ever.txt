 NO is one of the best albums ever made by They Might Be Giants, despite the fact that it is a themed album.  The album was designed to be a kids album.  Giants are usually safe for all ages anyways, but this album was made for kids.  It is one of the strangest cds they have made in years.  However, it also happens to be one of the best.  The cd is fun and wacky.  I highly recommend NO for fans of giants, and suggest this cd for anybody who enjoys fun, lighthearted music.
