 I first found out about Klank when I started trying to get all the related projects to Klay Scott(Circle of Dust, Celldweller, etc...) as he used to be Circle's guitarist.  Little was I prepared for the incredible music he made on his own.  Still Suffering showed that Darren had the ability to come out of Klay's massive shadow and make his own powerful music.  Although on the surface, it may sound like typical industrial/death metal, it is far different than the product that most of today's artists put out.  Klank deals with issues such as abuse by others, neglect, loneliness, and a deep desire for peace inside.  He is striving to really find God, and his lyrics relect it in a deep and meaningful way.  This cd is an emotional Journey.  Klank addresses issues that every Christian deals with, but nobody wishes to face in today's shallow music industry.  For this reason, his cd is worth buying even if you are not a fan of industrial music.  With production credits going to Klay Scott(and with a bit of help from AP2 cohort Buka as well), the cd is excellent.
