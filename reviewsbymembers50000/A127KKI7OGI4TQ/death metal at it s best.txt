 I didn't actually like Living Sacrifice the first time I heard them.  I heard them on a compilation album of christian hardcore bands.  That was when they had their first lead singer.  I immediately wrote them off as more obnoxious death metal.  Upon discovering that they were touring with Project 86, I decided to listen to their new material just to be familiar with it at the concert.  After one listening to The Hammering Process, I was hooked.  Their new vocalist brings them up to a more modern sound, but yet they still do not fall into the current Rapcore fad.  With dark, angry vocals reminiscent of Mudvayne, Soulfly, Pantera, or Slipknot, they are very likeable by metal fans.  They also sometimes manage to fit in a harmony in the background.  The guitar is heavy and "crunchy", yet it doesn't fall into the typical heavy metal power chords fad either.  Usually, christian bands are brushed off and not taken seriously, but Living Sacrifice is a noteworthy band, christian or not.  Living Sacrifice is as good(or better) than their secular counterparts, yet doesn't sing about the negative, angry, violent things that the others do.  The Hammering Process is an excellent album that any metal fan should get.
