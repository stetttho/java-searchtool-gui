 If you are reading this review, you probably already know who Stephen Brodsky is.  His solo project is definately NOT Cave In, but in similar fashion to his mainstay project, this IS very original.  With Ole Sunday, Brodsky expands out of his previous shell on his solo debut.  His first cd was badly produced and focused more on Steve and his guitar.  This time around, the songs follow a more traditional song structure.  We see Brodsky writing songs that draw on a huge range of influences from the past 50 years of music.  You may hear stuff that borders on Rolling Stones, Beach Boys, or The Beatles for mere moments on this cd.  However, it is not a clone of old rock and roll.  This is a very original modern alternative rock album.  The fact the Brodsky plays all the instruments himself shows his extreme talent as a musician.  The fact that he can maintain a full time band(cave in), a side project(New Idea Society), and write his own solo albums shows that he is overflowing with creative talent.  Most bands take 2 years to write an album that is hardly original at all.  Here, we see Brodsky explore the roots of all rock and roll to find inspiration to make his own music.  Ole Sunday is absolutely great.  This album gets better with a few listens, just like every other project Brodsky is in.  My only complaint is that this album is a bit short on overall play time for a full length.
