 Havalina has done it again.  They never cease to amaze me with their originality in their themed albums.  They have managed to capture yet another theme and show their musical diversity.  The title is very appropriate.  The album ranges from trippy space rock to a song sung completely in Spanish.  They capture the feeling of bullfighting and space rock on their album, yet manage to maintain their trademark Havalina sound.  Not as diverse or original as their masterpiece, America.  However, this is one of those albums that you need in your collection that transcends time.  You will be listening to it and your other Havalina albums(well, maybe not Diamond in the Fish) for years to come.  I was not disappointed.  Matt Wignall and company have managed to pull off yet another brilliant, completely original album.  The only comparison I could make to anybody else is They Might Be Giants when they are trying to sound serious.  Even then, I'm stretching to make a comparison.  Good job and two thumbs up to Havalina for another masterpiece.
