 I've grown tired of modern worship bands that are geared to the 30+ crowd.  Finally, a good band has come to save the youth of America!  Telecast is extremely catchy brit rock along the lines of coldplay, travis, etc.  But it also is 100% pure praise music that goes straight up to glorify God.  Every last moment of this cd is praise, unlike most other contemporary christian rock geared to youth which is lacking a real message and is really just modern rock without sex and profanity.  A must own cd for the young, or young at heart christian.
