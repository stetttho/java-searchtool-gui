 I recently discovered murder by death opening for poison the well.  I was expecting another drab metalcore band based on the name.....but was I ever surprised to hear actual music coming from the stage!  Other reviewers have given their spin on them, some of which is acurate, some not.  I will give you the fact that their live show completely destroys the recordings in intensity, pace, and skill.  This particular album, contrary to what others have said, is not a disappointment at all.  It is much faster than "exorcist", and a different production entirely.  It is a themed album, which can sometimes work or fail.  In this case, it works quite well.  Other's have compared them to cursive, who I have never heard....so can't comment on that.  My take on the band is that they are a dark american ballad band.  They write songs in the style of Nick Cave with the dark, ironic folk stylings of Voltaire thrown in underneath.  This cd is not Goth, as previously stated.  It is the farthest cry from Marilyn Manson, the Virgin Black, or Christian Death that you could think of.  It is very dark with a sarcastic horror movie them underlying it(and a bit of haunted western movie theme as well).  Strange indeed.  Strange and good.  The cello parts are exceptional(and played by the most un-conceited musician I think I have met to date).  The piano is also quite good.  The other instruments add to the mix well, but are not anything remarkable though.  I believe the term "art rock" is appropriate, as this cd does take a bit of dark, sarcastic humor and a few brain cells to truly appreciate.  Overall, I have to say this is one of the most original bands I've heard in a while.  A great cd made by nice people who put on an awesome live show.
