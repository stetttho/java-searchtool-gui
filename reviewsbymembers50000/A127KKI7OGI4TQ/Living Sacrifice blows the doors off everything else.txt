 Conceived in fire is by far the best cd that Living Sacrifice has released to date.  Considering that the sound of the band changed with every cd that they released due to the ever changing lineup, it was hard to judge each cd as an individual work.  This time around, they have hit the mark.  This is the same lineup as the "Hammering Process", but they sound much more mature.  The production quality blows hammering process away.  Every single last note of the album is right on.  My favorite track is Ignite.  It is so incredibly precise and heavy.  This band still knows how to mix a bit of melody in with their crunching drop tuned guitars and screaming solos, but they do it so much better than on hammering process.  Rocky has perfected his solos to some of the best I've ever heard in metal.  Bruce sings stronger than ever.  Matt and Lance hold down the percussion well, now being more straight up heavy metal and less of the tribal sound of hammering process.  After seeing Living Sacrifice in concert, I didn't think they could possibly get any better.  This album proved me wrong.  Easily one of the heaviest albums to date, but they managed to pull it off with a flair that sets them apart from everybody else in heavy music.  This is a must buy for fans of mosh worthy music.
