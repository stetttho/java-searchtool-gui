 I was expecting this cd to be awful based on the reviews that are already out there by big sites.  However, it's not THAT bad.  Engage is just another SAS album that sounds pretty much the same as their previous releases.  This one has quite a few guest vocal spots though.  Compared to their previous releases, this one is more straightforward hardcore.  There are a few mellow punk sounding spots.  This is pretty similar to Revolution Transmission, but not nearly as good.  If you are a Stretch fan, buy it because it really isn't that bad.  I will complain about them recycling Express Yourself.  I hate it when bands put songs from a compilation cd on their own cd.  It makes you wonder why you bought the compilation.  The version on Too Legit for the Pit is much better than the album version(same thing with throwdown's Baby Got Back).  Overall, I will call this a mediocre release.  SAS hasn't really evolved musically.  However, it seems the hardcore kids get mad when somebody tries to change based on how mad they got about the latest Poison the Well release anyway.  This is the first album in the past year from Solid State that is actually less than perfect.
