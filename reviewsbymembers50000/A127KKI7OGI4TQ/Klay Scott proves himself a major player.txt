 I first ran into Scott Albert(aka, Klay Scott, the Celdweller, Dread/Deathwish....etc) with his previous project, Circle of Dust.  Upon first hearing it in the mid 90's, I knew a talented industrial star was to come with the passing years.  After refining his style into something all his own with his final Circle release, which he did solo, he proved himself to be a major creative force.  Klay had numerous side projects, including Argyle Park, Ap2, producing for Klank, and writing the score for the World of Illusion show with Kriss Angel.  Following years of getting screwed by record labels, Klay has finally finished his album....and it shows years of pent up creativity and frustration released in one of the most beautiful, diverse, powerful cds to date.  The Celldweller debut has enough of the Klay Scott influences to keep former fans happy, but covers so much musical ground that it can keep fans of many genres happy.  He covers the usual industrial/techno vibe flawlessly, and adds in his own blend of screaming metal, beautiful choruses, and even a tiny bit of rap(switchback).  The years of waiting were all worth it as this album is very, very well developed.  It leaves nothing to desire.  The album is loaded with tons of songs that could be radio singles on a number of styles of stations.  This album has a tiny bit of filler, but at 18 tracks, some filler is allowed.  Klay has proved himself to be a powerful force in electronic music.  Trent Reznor has finally found himself a creative equivalent.  If you don't own this cd, but it now!
