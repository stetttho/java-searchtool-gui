 I wasn't sure sure what to expect of Anberlin with their debut album.  Tooth and nail has been hyping this album almost as hard as their other major mainstream act, Further Seems Forever.  Like fsf, this album was worth all the hype the label gave it.  I've yet to figure out how it is "emo"...since emo is usually annoying kids with stuffy noses.  However, this cd is as good as the hype.  If you like the song ready fuels(my personal favorite), you will love this cd.  Most of the other songs are stylistically similar.  This cd is a masterpiece of energetic modern alternative rock.  There aren't any filler songs on this cd.  The only song I hated was one formerly know as "driving" when it was a demo.  They fixed most of what was wrong with it and retitled the song autobahn.  The only complaint I have with the cd is the "do do do do" lyric as filler in autobahn and foreign language(listen to the clips...you'll understand).  I find that lyric uninspired and actually annoying.  Other than those 2 songs, this cd is a heavy, melodic, passionate, and brilliant album.  If you enjoy modern alternative rock at all, this cd is for you.  Next to Further Seems Forever "how to start a fire", this cd is probably the most passionate and powerful album to come out in a long time.  By all means, buy this cd.
