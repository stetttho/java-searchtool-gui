 Therapy? has hit the mark with this album.  I was expecting them to be going downhill in their careers and probably giving up soon.  However, this is probably one of the strongest comeback albums I have seen in years.  As a diehard Therapy? fan, I have to say this album has all of the elements to it that made Troublegum a hit.  There are a few pop-punk-metal balads(Voodoo Doll, Watch You Go, and Never Ending), an angry political/religious statement(Not In Any Name), and some hard rocking radio friendly hits(Last Blast, If It Kills Me).  This is almost exactly the same format that made Troublegum the instant rock and roll classic that it is.  There is something small missing here that keeps this from being T?s best album...I can't quite define what it is.  However, this album is about as good as you can buy from the angry irish hard rock boys being that Troublegum and Semi-Detached cannot be purchased anymore unless you luckily find them at a yard sale.  This is far better than Shameless and Suicide Pact.  I suggest it to any fan of T?, or for that matter, anybody who likes good hard-rock.
