 With the Semi-Detached project, Therapy? takes a brief break from their usual hard rocking style.  Out of all of the Therapy? albums, this is the most melodic.  Andy finally got married right before this album, and it  reflects his new found love.  Gone are the depressed, angry lyrics.  The  entire album is a welcome change.  The style of the album is similar to  that of the songs Nowhere and Die Laughing off their masterpiece,  Troublegum.  The bonus tracks included on the Japanese release are a  welcome addition.  Whereas Troublegum had 100% awesome songs, this album  does have a few lame tunes.  The good songs are so good that they make up  for the bad.  If you don't have Semi-Detached, import it today.
