 I discovered Paw on the first Road Rash for Playstation.  Ever since, they have grown on me day by day.  Mark Hennesey is one of the most unique sounding vocalists on earth.  At first, I did not like Paw.  After hearing  them a few times, I was hooked.  Dragline is the hardest rocking album that  paw released.  It has a few ballads mixed in with the southern grunge rock  to make for an incredible album.  My personal favorite is Veronica.  Paw  mellowed out with time on their second album, Death to Traitors.  It is sad  to say that Paw no longer exists except in the form of the Fitch brothers  together on their project Palomar.  If you do not own Dragline, you should  get it before it no longer exists.
