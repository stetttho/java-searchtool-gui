 I randomly stumbled upon this cd by means of a friend who is a long term fan of blind melon.  After a few listens, it quickly dawned on me that this is one of the best inde rock albums released in recent years.  The vocalist sounds a little like Shannon at times, but not so much that you would think they are trying to recreate blind melon.  This cd ranges along the lines of the formerly stated band, but adds so much more depth of inde rock influences.  The other strong influence that I hear through the cd is that of sunny day real estate.  Considering that inde/alternative rock today usually implies "emo"(aka, crap), this cd is a much needed relief to the fan of real, true rock.  Well produced, dynamic, solid, and all around just good music.
