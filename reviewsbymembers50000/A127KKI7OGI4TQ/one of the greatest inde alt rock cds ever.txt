 Driver Eight is one of the greatest bands to ever exist, despite the fact that you've probably never heard of them.  This cd is pure and simple catchy inde rock.  They are one of the best bands to come out of the 90's alternative independent music scene.  Too bad they only released one cd and have since disappeared from music.  This cd bears a strong likeness to a little known band named Polaris.  Those are the guys that did the theme song to Pete and Pete from nickelodean.  Get this cd before it goes out of print!  Like all other true great music, it grows on you with time.
