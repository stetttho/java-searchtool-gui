 Virgin Black created some stir with their first album, which was a mix of goth, opera, and a touch of black metal.  This time around, the format is similar.  The difference is the growth in the ability of arrangement and the overall dynamic feel of the cd.  This cd is similar in style to the first cd.  What makes it that much better is the fact that it feels like one giant musical piece instead of 9 individual songs.  This is not to say that the cd runs together or is repetitious.  The cd feels like a gothic rock symphony with a number of individual movements, ranging from mellow and slow gothic, to heavy and frantic distorted guitar with screamed vocals, to fast piano parts with operatic vocal arrangements.  This cd changes pace frequently.  It does indeed feel like a symphony, or if Danny Elfman did an epic gothic movie soundtrack with vocals(ok, I guess he did do Nightmare Before Christmas).  It's sad to see Evanescence be classified as gothic.  This is true, powerful gothic darkness.
