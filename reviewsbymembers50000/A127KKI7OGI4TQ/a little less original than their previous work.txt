 With Antenna, Cave In finds a commercially competitive album.  However, with commercialism comes a lack of creativity.  Cave In has become an underground icon along with other's such as Hum and Swervedriver to create a small genre of music called space rock.  With their previous releases, Cave In took the liberty to be very experimental.  It paid off by gaining them a huge new fanbase.  With Antenna, Cave In has obviously been guided by major label production ethics.  This album has a few very radio friendly singles.  These songs also happen to be the least original made by Cave In so far.  Fans of their space rock sound may be a bit disappointed as Seafrost is the only song on the album that compares to the previous space ballads.  However, this album is far, far better than any of that awful washed up modern rock that all sounds the same being played on the radio these days(cough cough..creed...cough cough).  For that reason, this album is worth buying.  Although it sounds more like Stone Temple Pilots or Foo Fighters than the Cave In I'm used to, it is an incredibly good album that will be stuck in your head and cd player for years to come.  Yes, Cave In has abandoned their metal roots.  No, they did not sell out.  It was a waste for such a talented vocalist to sing stuff that sounded identical to every other metalcore band.  Brodsky's vocals were typical to say the least.  With Antenna, we see Brodsky becoming the best vocalist alive today.  Hopefully he gains rock icon status someday.  Buy this album if you don't have it....and while you're at it, pick up Brodsky's solo albums and his Side Project, New Idea Society to experience something different.  Come on, you know you're tired of mainstream radio.  Do yourself a favor and buy Brodsky's cds.
