 I had high expectations from the boys from Ireland when I heard this album was coming out.  I was not let down.  This is the most solid album they have released in years.  Suicide Pact had some [poor] songs on it, and lets face it, tramline and the boy's asleep are downright awful songs that keep semi-detached from being perfect.  Not since troublegum has an album this good been released.  It has no [lousy] songs on it.  Every song is solid, although there are a few that are just run of the mill therapy? and don't really impress me much.  Andy and company have given up trying to please the mainstream, and are making whatever they want to.  Considering most of their fans are diehard(aka people like me), we are no longer surprised by anything they do.  Everything is a new and original work.  This album impresses me for it's diversity.  Overall, this is the best album from the best band nobody has ever heard in years, and will be hard to top.
