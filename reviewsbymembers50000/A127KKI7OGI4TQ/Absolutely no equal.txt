 Swervedriver is one of the most incredible bands ever to make a record.  With their driving guitars and drums, they are ideal to jam to.  The vocals are not like any other you have heard before.  This band rocks, but they  are mellow enough not to scare your mom and dad.  Mezcal head is one of the  best albums that you could add to your record collection.  My personal  favorites are Last Train to Satansville and Blowin Cool.  Although this  album is not quite as good as 99th Dream, it is still an incredible album.   If you have never heard Swervedriver, you should treat yourself and buy  this incredible album.
