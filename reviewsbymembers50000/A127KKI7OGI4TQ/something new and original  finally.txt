 It is very seldom that anything ever comes along in the music scene that can be described as completely original and groundbreaking.  When it does, it causes a pretty big stir.  Here we have a perfect example of an incredible case of something completely different than what is standard for a musical genre.  Radiation 4 are breaking all the boundaries of what is considered to be traditional for the hardcore genre.  Most hardcore bands today are either a copy of the early zao style or of the early poison the well style.  Almost nobody today in hardcore has a sound that is entirely original and not a copy of somebody else.  Wonderland is quite possibly the most original and diverse cd I have heard in years.  It is doubtful that everyone will copy this style either, as it is quite complex.  This cd has frantic guitars with quick tempo changes, strange distorted vocals that range from a shrill scream to a strange spoken word style, bizzare samples of circus, fairy tale, and music box parts, and some strange slow tempo parts to throw you off.  This cd is so diverse and complex that I can hardly begin to explain it.  This is quite possibly one of the most brilliant metal cds released ever.  The only comparison I can make is that it sounds a bit like the ep that the Dillinger Escape Plan did with Mike Patton(which is also awesome) at a few short instances.  My only complaint is the length of this cd.  It comes in at a total play time under 40 minutes, and this is including the last track that is 15 minutes long.  It is also a waste of cd space.  They should've cut the end of that song off and put on another 3-4 tracks in it's place.  That's my only problem with this cd.  If abacus recordings keeps putting out incredible bands like radiation 4 and narcissus, they will quickly become the best existing hardcore label.
