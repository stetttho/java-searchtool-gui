 As one of the most diehard Therapy? fans in the United States, I recommend this album to the new listener who hasn't previously heard them.  As a greatest hits album of sorts, it covers most of the diverse sound of Therapy?.  Although Semi-Detached and Troublegum are the best albums(and the hardest to get in the U.S.), this album is a good idea of what Therapy? sounds like for the new fan.  For the Diehard fan like myself(who collects as much Therapy? stuff as I can get), this is not really worth picking up.  But being that Therapy? isn't the most popular band in the world, this album is likely a worthwhile buy for most music fans.
