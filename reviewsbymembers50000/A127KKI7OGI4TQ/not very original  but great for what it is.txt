 In today's hardcore/emo market, there are alot of copycat bands.  There are quite a few "screamo", or Florida style hardcore bands on the market today.  It's almost difficult to wade through them all.  Beloved is yet another entry in the all too standard modern screamo market.  This cd is not an original entity by any means.  However, the cd has what is probably the best production quality I've ever heard from the genre so far.  All of the songs sound relatively alike, but that's ok since they are all good.  This cd is different than the ep they released a while back.  The current Beloved sound, if you haven't heard it yet, is best equated to a mix of further seems forever and poison the well.  Being that I like both of these bands, I consider that to be a bonus.  The melodic parts are very melodic and catchy.  The breakdowns are very heavy.  Beloved may not be all that original, but they are very talented.  If you ever get the chance to see them in concert, take it.  I was impressed.  Their live show lives up to their recordings well.  If you are into screamo, buy this cd as you likely won't be disappointed.
