 I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw the label touting "with Dallas, formerly of Underoath."  I thought maybe I was in for another hardcore band or something of the like.  I was wrong, and boy, what a shift of direction he made!  Now mind you, this cd does have a few moments here and there that marginally border on hardcore for a second, but all in all, this is one of the best dirty south hard rock cds to come out in years.  I thought the genre was almost extinct.  The fact that corrosion of conformity put out a new cd recently gave me a sliver of hope.  And these guys came along and blew me away with one of the best dirty south releases to come out in years.  Groove oriented hard rock that borders on metal is the best description.  Comparisons would be corrosion of conformity, down, clutch, or even a few marginal pantera moments.  Fantastic songwriting that tells a bit of a story.  If you like southern rock, make sure to put this on your list as a must buy.
