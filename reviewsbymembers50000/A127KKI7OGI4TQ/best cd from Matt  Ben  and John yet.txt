 After "the scroll", I wasn't sure what to expect from Wellwater Conspiracy.  I must say that I am pleasantly surprised with this album.  Despite the official status of side project for this band, this is some of the most inventive, original music I've heard in years.  Similar to their previous albums, this cd is very experimental.  It is all over the place musically.  I guess you would expect that coming from these guys.  The 60's vibe is very much still there.  However, they have begun to touch on a more powerful alternative rock style with this album.  The experimentation has become a little more interesting as well.  Some of the tracks almost start to border on Radiohead's strange electronic style of Kid A.  This album can be summed up as a combo of inde/60's style, a bit of The Doors, some strange groove style that borders on Clutch briefly, a touch of Swervedriver, and the few brief ventures into Radiohead.  This could quite possibly be the most diverse collection of musical styles blended together that I have heard in years.  This album is a bit more comercially friendly than their previous releases, but that's not a bad thing.  So far this year, this is probably the most original and interesting album I have heard.
