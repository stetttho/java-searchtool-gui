 Lullacry has managed to make an almost perfect sound that other less talented bands who receive radio airtime can't quite hit.  Be My God is a masterpiece.  This cd is a perfect combination of the foreign metal/hard rock style of great bands such as Helloween and Lacuna Coil with beautiful female vocals.  What sets Tanya apart from those pansy lillith fair girls who you hear on the radio is her ability to do metal worthy singing.  Her vocal style would make Dio and Bruce Dickinson proud.  I'm shocked, considering the popularity of Evanescence or growing popularity of Lacuna Coil, that Century Media hasn't marketed these guys(and girl) better.  An absolute must own for fans of metal.
