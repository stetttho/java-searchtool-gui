 How to start a fire was the most hyped album of the year due to the popularity of Dashboard Confessional.  Nobody knew how well Jason could fill Chris's shoes, but he more than took the job.  Chris doesn't even compare to Jason.  This cd is the most passionate, powerful cd released this year.  If you liked "Moon is Down" for the music, you won't be let down.  Musically, this album is similar.  However, it is so much better.  Jason has a much more dynamic and powerful voice than Chris.  His vocal range is better than Chris.  The only problem I have with old fsf albums is that Chris has the textbook awful whining emo voice.  In other words, I hate Dashboard.  Jason doesn't whine at all.  His vocals soar.  Incredible music and incredible vocals add up to possibly the best and most original cd to come out in 2003. 6 stars out of 5 if I could do it.
