 Despite the complaints of old fans of Jon Spencer that he sold out, I find this album to be excellent.  It is less eclectic and a little bit more sensible than his previous releases.  This album is probably the most commercially acceptable of the Blues Explosion releases.  If you aren't a diehard anti-commercialist punk, you will probably like this album.  It is solid.  The guitar work is straightforward and catchy.  Other's have complained that this cd doesn't capture the fury of their live show.  However, at their live show, they played most of this cd, and I felt it was pretty accurate live compared to the album.  Personal favorite track is "She Said."  This song has a very catchy guitar/vocal part for the chorus.  Prepare to have this album get stuck in your head after a few listens.  A recommended purchase for people who like good old fashioned rock and roll.
