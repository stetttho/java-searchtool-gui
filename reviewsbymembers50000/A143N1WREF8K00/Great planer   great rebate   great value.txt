 After trying to decide between the Delta 2-speed planer and this DeWalt planer, I chose the DeWalt. It's starting price is significantly less than the Delta. But when you factor in the included dust hood, extra set of knives, and the free tool rebate, the deal becomes too sweet to pass up. I didn't need any of the tools included with the rebate, so when I got mine, I immediately sold it on eBay, effectively reducing the price of this excellent planer even further! The planer's performance is excellent, as is the dust collection when using the dust hood. I don't have a central dust collection system, but I find that my little 3.5 HP shop vac has no problems keeping up. And I've had no problems with clogging, as some folks have mentioned. One point regarding the dust hood: when it's installed, you can't fold up the outfeed table. Solution: don't permanently screw the dust hood to the planer! The dust hood has two hooks on top that hold it in position, so the screws aren't really necessary. When you're done planing, simply unhook and remove the dust hood, fold up your tables, and put everything away. There are a lot of fine benchtop planers on the market, but none of them are as good of an overall value as this one!
