 I needed to cut a 9 1/2" circle in a woodworking project I was building out of 3/4" thick red oak. I don't own a bandsaw yet, so I can't make circle cuts like Norm does on New Yankee Workshop. So I decided to buy one of these to use with my Rotozip. A lot of people are complaining that the Rotozip can't go through plywood. I don't know if that's true, but it sure did a nice job cutting though oak. It didn't leave a perfectly smooth circle, since it's hard to keep the Rotozip perfectly verticle while making  the cut. But it did a better job than I could have done by drawing a circle on the lumber then making a cut with a jigsaw. I was able to easily sand smooth any irregularities. So if you have a Rotozip and you need to make **almost** perfect circles, this is a good way to go.
