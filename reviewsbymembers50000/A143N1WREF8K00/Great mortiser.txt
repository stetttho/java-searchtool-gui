 This is an excellent mortiser. I decided to buy it over the slightly less expensive competing mortisers (e.g., Delta MM300) because I read complaints regarding fence and hold-down inadequacies. I've never used one of these other machines, so I can't confirm that their fences are bad. But I can tell you that the fence on this model is excellent. Solid, accurate, and easy to position and lock into position. Assembling the mortiser was pretty easy, with one exception. There is a hydraulic cylinder (kind of like what keeps storm doors from slamming closed) that connects to the power head and the base, which helps to raise the power head. The documentation says to raise the head all the way up so that you can install the hydraulic cylinder. Well, with the head all the way up, the cylinder arm is still approx. 1/2" too long to install. I ended up compressing the cylinder with a Quick Grip bar clamp in order to install the cylinder (it has too much internal pressure to compress by hand). Other than this annoyance, set-up was simple. Great mortiser. Pay the extra...and buy this machine. You won't be sorry!
