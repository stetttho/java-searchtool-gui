 Allan Gurganus' short story, "He's at the Office", in the 2000 Best American Short Stories Anthology encouraged me. I bought this and a novella called "Plays Well With Others", which after the opening I had to put down because of the complexity of the writing style, a lesser version of Gravity's Rainbow, that would require extensive reads. Confederate Widow was a joy from the start with a rich texture of characters. But like all rich things, you can only take so much of it. Three-quarters of the way through the book I realized neither Lucy or the Captain were going to offer any denounement, just a serial view of their lives together (and apart). He's an excellent writer, but I could not, at the time, endure another colorful characterization or another folksy aside by Lucy to the narrator. It is the kind of book that might do well as a screenplay in the vien of narrated history, such as Little Big Man. I might even go back and finish reading it one day.
