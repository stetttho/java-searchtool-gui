 You wont read a better piece of fiction in as slim a volume as this one. JL Carr captures and enthralls the reader from the minute Tom Birkin steps off the train until he leaves Oxgodby. I have read most of the NYR Classics like A High Wind in Jamica and Hindoo Holiday, but this work is unique. A wonderful read!
