 I picked up a reference to this book from the current issue of NYRB in a story about the Enron debacle.  It seems the practice of "off balance sheet" derivative speculation is alive and well and that fund managers for pensions are still as inept as Mr Citron was for Orange County California. What is amazing is the continued hoodwinking of investors by rating agencies such as Moodys and Standard & Poor and the unregulated nature of these securities after the 20 billion dollar bailout of Mexico (or should we say the bailout of investment bank exposure) by the Clinton Administration during the Mid 90s Peso crisis. And yet it continues today, in effect a license to gamble with other people's money by "aggresive" fund managers, a conveniently legal fraud perpetuated by a lack of campaign finance reform and the sinister omnipotence of the televison medium. Who said the medium is the message? Mcluhan must feel justified wherever he is.
