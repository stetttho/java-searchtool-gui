 Go over to the review on The Complete Dragon/Edward Gufeld by the reader  from LA and you have an exact review of this book also. I bought both based  on the reviews. Lev Psakhis' advice in the opening of The Complete Benoni  is that Black has the Sicilian Defense against PK4 openings, but little  defense against PQ4, other than the lines of this system. With that out of  the way, he proceeds with rare moves for white after 1 D4 Nf6, 2 C4 C5, 3  D5 E6, labeling them as other than Nc3. The variations are many and  exquisitely detailed. His commentary is brief and cryptic, letting the  variations (and the reader's understanding of positional play) speak for  themselves in terms of analysis, as it should be for a complete  understanding of the aesthetic of chess. The book was initially frustrating  for me as an intermediate level player, but the more time I spend with it  the more I learn.
