 I bought the book thinking it would be a more average tale of high school. Reading it, you immediately understand the BHS is a unique school and although the problem of disadvantage by class, race and economics resonate throughout the country; BHS deals with them in an innovative way that would probably not resonate throughout the country due to social stratification. The lack of a forward looking approach to issues such as sexuality and race in other areas of this country create a different set of "rules" for administrators, staff and teachers to tackle these problems. Many of the programs at BHS are light years ahead of the rest of the country and that makes the book a more localized event. The problems may be the same for all but the tools to fix them differ greatly by geography. You have to agree that the author's proposed abolishment of private schools is reflective of the  Berkley enviroment. I thought there would be more of a practical method gained from studying these kids for a year. I went into the book looking for common problems and found them. The solutions were too few. I think the book would be something my high school kids would enjoy reading as "year in the life" type of thing. No tools here for educators.
