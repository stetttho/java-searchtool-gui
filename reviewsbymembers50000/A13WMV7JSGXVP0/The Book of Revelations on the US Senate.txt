 Aside from the story of Lyndon Johnson, which takes the reader through a range of emotions from admiration to repugnance, this is an eye opening look at the history and the internal machinations of America's only insular legislative body, insular in its unique protection from American majority opinion. From introduction to last page Mr. Caro crafts a highly readable and fascinating study of not only LBJ, but the American institution Johnson reshaped. The cast of characters all come to life on these pages. Bravo!
