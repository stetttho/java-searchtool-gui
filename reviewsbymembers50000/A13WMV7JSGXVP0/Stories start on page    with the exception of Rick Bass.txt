 So I read the Hermit's Story as the lead off and skipped the next four stories because they just couldn't hold my interest through the first few sentences. The rest of the selections are decent reading some are up to the  level of Rick Bass' piece and Annie Proulx's The Bunchgrass Edge of the  World, some are not. Lorrie Moore's two pages of HA HA's nearly put me off  what is really a pretty good story, although she makes it tough to buy into  the second thread with the abrupt change.I thought Jhumpa Lahiri's  Interpreter of Maladies one of the best stories in this edition. Even  without those lost sixty-two pages, the rest is worth the price of the  tradepaper edition.
