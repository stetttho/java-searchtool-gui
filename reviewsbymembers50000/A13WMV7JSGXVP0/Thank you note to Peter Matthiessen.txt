 Peter Matthiessen, for those unfamiliar with his writing, is a keen observer; the natural talent for a writer. His difference, and as far as I know it if a fairly uncommon one, is his ability to make little of what one would suppose to be the difficult borders between fiction and non-fiction. You can read Far Tortuga or Killing Mr Watson as easily as Snow Leopard, often losing any sense of balance between what is real and what is spirited from the real. In both he writes highly evocative prose that twists, often in a surreal fashion, from the everyday into careful conclusions of what is the higher ground for the protagonist, in the case of fiction, and for the observer in the naturalist elegies. I have found the same dialectic in both. When I read the review of Birds of Heaven in the NYRB I was excited with the prospect of another journey with Mr Matthieseen, even though I had extant ones still to make with The Spirit of Crazy Horse, Wildlife in North America (which the NYR reviewer called the "classic" study) and others. ... this book will also merit classic status, as a definitive study of current crane populations in Asia and Japan that is approachable by the general reader. I had little knowledge of cranes as a species, but nearing the end of the book, thanks in part to the wonderful color illustrations and drawings, I feel enriched just for the cursory knowledge I have gained of these magnificent birds. And I have been able to travel as part of Mr. Matthiessen's party, taken in by the detail of each landform and each river, the anecdotal descriptions of the people which, with his pen, rise to something more akin to actually being there and finally, to the heart of those who seek preservation of the little bit of wildness that is left to us as a planet. ...
