 The current issue of NYRB contains an essay by Samantha Power distilled from the book. The book is mentioned about half-way through the text and based on the quality of the essay I was convinced to buy the book. Now, half-way through the book, which is excellent, I am on the hunt for more information about the hero of the Problem from Hell, Raphael Lemkin. His story is the conscience of the little we have done as a nation to sustain international human rights and prevent the state from destroying its own or those of another state. This part of the book that describes Lemkin and his relentless effort is one of the most moving and uplifting statements I have ever read. It sets an unparalled example of committment to an idea that is the best part of human nature. The commentary on the United States failure to accept the idea and make it an integral part of foreign policy applies to all of us: citizens and leaders alike. I have reason to doubt my own moral fortitude, but not that of the author who has laid before us a legal brief that documents a deliberate policy of inaction by our country.  The arguement of political reality or political expediency is a dark cloak spread to cover greed, indifference and lack of political will. Hopefully, we can correct this course and not be a future accomplice to genocide.
