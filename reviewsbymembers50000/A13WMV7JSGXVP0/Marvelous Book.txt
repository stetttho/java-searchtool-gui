 Hurrah for McCullough! This is an immensely readable biography of a man who serves as a model for public service, independent thinking and high moral character. This book should be required reading for everyone who enters into politics as a guide for proper conduct in the service of their country. The sacrifice and the risks taken by men such as Adams in the early days of this country's evolution are an inspiration. McCullough has brought this man, his family and his contemporaries to life. Delving deep into the life of John Adams he has revealed another early patriot without whom Mr Adams would surely not have accomplished all that he did. That person is his wife, Abigal, who is the mirror of John Adams' values and his most trusted adviser. As a bonus the reader gets a marvelous portrait of Thomas Jefferson in Mr McCullough's narrative description of his relationship with both John and Abigal Adams. Mr McCullough often lets the personal correspondence of these three speak volumes, without any coloring by the author. The last chapters are poignant and so well done that I was literally left in tears for the passing of all of these people. Bravo, Mr McCullough!
