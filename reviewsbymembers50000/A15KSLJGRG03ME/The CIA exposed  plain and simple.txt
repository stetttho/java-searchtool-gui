 Lane was the first to open up criticism of the Warren Report with his "Rush to Judgment".  Almost three decades later, he once again brings President Kennedy's assassination cover-up in full view, and this time he reveals the culprit behind the killing. After reading this, there was no doubt in my mind that the CIA had masterminded the killing of JFK, and then carried out the cover-up.  They lied under oath, pressured the media, encouraged censorship, presented false evidence, threatened and killed witnesses and potential stool pigeons--it's all right here. While Lane's work is without question some of the best detective work in the 20th century, he was personally involved with much of the cover-up and experienced persecution as a result of his views.  Unlike in his "Rush to Judgment", he has a tendancy to take much of this personal, and it shows.  Throughout the book, Lane blows his own horn and vehemently attacks Earl Warren, Howard Hunt, and the like.  The evidence might speak for itself, but I can see people being put off by Lane's unproffessional attacks. Perhaps the most chilling conclusion one gets out of "Plausible Denile" and "Rush to Judgment" are not that the CIA conspired to kill a President, but that they conspired to frame and innocent, unsuspecting citizen for the crime.
