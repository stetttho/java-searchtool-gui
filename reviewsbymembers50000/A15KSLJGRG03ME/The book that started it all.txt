 The facts were obvious, the absurdity of the Warren Report were flaglanty flaunted, yet many people still never got the truth of JFK's murder.  Mark Lane does not offer any final conclusions.  He only offers more than enough evidence for two claims; 1.) that if Oswald killed JFK, he couldn't have done so alone, and 2.) the Warren Commission was a scam, dedicated to finding only Oswald's guilt, more concerned with "healing an ailing nation" than with presenting the facts. As a lawyer, Lane is well-versed in the procedures of court.  He presents Oswald's case and the Commission's case with more evidence than you can shake a stick at.  It would be difficult to fault Lane for telling it like it is, and it would be even harder to refute his claims.  Lane was the man who busted the conspiracy wide open, and while making no deffinite judgments on exactly who perpetrated the conspiracy, he does make a solid case that there was one. LAne was personally involved with the case, and this works to his advantage in that he had access to a lot of facts.  Unfortunately, he has also suffered the attacks of the media, and thus at times becomes a tad defensive.  However, this bias is hardly noticeable and in no way detracts from the evidence. So I guess Oswald was innocent and the Warren Commission either lied or didn't look hard enough.  Oh, and if you're going to read this be sure to check out other books on the Kennedy assassination.  Lane's a good start, though.
