 This is actually a pretty interesting read despite the lack of, say, the complete testimony of Oliver North.  I agree with the below reviewer's assessment, except for one thing, the Tower Commission was created by REAGAN to investigate IRAN-CONTRA.  The ERVIN Commission investigated Watergate fifteen years before.
