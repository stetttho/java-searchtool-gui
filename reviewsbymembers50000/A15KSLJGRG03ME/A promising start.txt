 'Take the Money and Run' is the first film directed, written by, and starring Woody Allen.  While nowhere near the debute of Orson Welles, Allen shows considerable comic promise as he attempts to translate his wierd and wild though shyly neurotic stage act onto the silver screen. First of all, this movie is hilarious.  No doubt about it, Allen's mockumentary about a looser con is top-notch comedy.  Allen's use of gags are endless (re. glasses, rabbis, soap gun, etc).  They are well-deployed and brilliant.  Allen's dialogue is equally funny, the best line in the film being, "After twenty minutes, I had decided I wanted to spend my entire life with her.  And after a half hour, I'd given up the idea of takin her purse". Yet, in his first film our schlemiel of a director is bound to run into difficulties.  At times it appears he is trying to hard to be funny.  Forced humor never works, and it works even less in Allen's case.  Some jokes just seem overdone.  Then the movie itself goes on for about a half hour too long. Nevertheless, despite its flaws, this is a great movie of good comedic quality, and should not be dismissed merely because it lacks the artistic brilliance of Allen's later works.
