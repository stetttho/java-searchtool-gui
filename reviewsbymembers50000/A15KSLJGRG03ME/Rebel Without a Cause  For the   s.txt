 1999 was the best year for movies in a long time.  We had 'The Sixth Sense', 'The Matrix', 'Being John Malkovich', and the best of them all, 'Fight Club'.  'Fight Club' is 'Rebel Without a Cause' for the 90s.  It's a warning, as 'Rebel' was, about the coming dangers in our increasingly mass-produced, commercial society.  It's brutal, hard, violent, and excrutiatingly enjoyable to watch.  Norton and Pitt make a great team, bouncing dialogue off each other as the situation progresses from depressing to outright absurd and dangerous.  The cinematography is dark and moody with odd flashes of neon creating a mood that still has gone from my mind.  The sets, subtle computer animation, and brilliant editing combine to create a masterfully produced picture. Unfortunately, it appears as though a majority of the public will not get the inherent warning.  Some will view it as a cool tribute to violence, and others as a vulgar celebration of male aggression.  Either way, it has gotten notice. The DVD includes some rather interesting extras.  I especially enjoyed the special effects documentaries. And another thing, as fitting to the great movies of 99, 'Fight Club' has an ending that is so bizarre, so random, that I found it wholely inspiring as well as unnerving.  Thank you, Freud.
