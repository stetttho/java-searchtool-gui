 Chaim Potok is more than just a writer--he's a scholar.  From the ancient Sumerian villages just out of the Stone Age to upper class dwellings in 5th century BCE Babylon Potok has sucessfully combined scholarly research with the masterful prose of a storyteller.  These ancient worlds come alive.  Even more important than that, Potok has captured part of that elusive thing called the Jewish spirit--part survival, part identity, part learning.  It's a feeling difficult to describe but Potok seems to have done this as few others could. In addition, he seems to have done his research.  Unfortunately he fails to use footnotes and his facts are difficult, impossible at times, to check.  Potok is at heart a storyteller, and while this doesn't detract from the usefulness and power of this book, it certainly lessens its value as a research tool. I have very few complaints with this book.  They aren't minor, and to many they won't matter.  For one thing; Zoroasterianism exerted a major influence not only on the Middle East, but Jewish and later Christian and Western thinking.  Yet, Potok merely dismisses it as an "ancient fire-worshipping religion" and doesn't even mention its impact on Judaism.  Second, his opinions seem forcefully felt as he tells of the disintegration of the Rabbinic Judaism, as he takes out his anger not only on anti-Semites and the Catholic Church as can be expected, but also on the Enlightenment, Hasidism, and to some extent Kabbalists.  Third, the closing is rushed.  The Holocaust and creation of Isreal are brushed past with wonderful passages but lack the intensive research found earlier. Nevertheless, Chaim Potok will surely be remembered for his history if for nothing else.  He has combined intelligent history with moving prose, creating an informative, inspiring narrative telling the history of a great people.
