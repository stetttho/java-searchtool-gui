 Perhaps the most amusingly intelligent Frenchman in history, Voltaire's masterpiece satirizes everything from politics to Liebniz to the Pope.  Short, bitter, and hilarious, 'Candide' may not sound as controversial as it once did.  Surprisingly, however, it holds up quite well after over two centuries.  Intolerance and ignorance are still widespread, and the first step to solving the problem is to see it.  Perhaps more people would realize our condition if Voltaire were as publicized as during his lifetime. Even if you where to ignore the social statement, some might get a kick out of the wacky storyline and idiotic characters.  Plus, its length makes it a quick read (which is fortunate, as one may want to go over it a few times after laughing hysterically to get the full point).
