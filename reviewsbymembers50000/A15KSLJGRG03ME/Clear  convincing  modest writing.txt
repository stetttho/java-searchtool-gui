 Everyone is aware of the importance of Darwin's 1959 classic science text.  Yet, few of the many defenders and detractors of evolution have read it.  While certainly out of date and lacking in the loads of modern evidence to back him up, Darwin nevertheless provides the best introduction to evolution by means of natural selection. Darwin goes through nearly every point imaginable, providing the results of years of tests, observations, and study.  Each chapter goes on an exhaustive analisys of different topics.  I had already read much evolution literature, but I was even more convinced after reading Darwin's well-written thesis.  He is unpretentious and modest.  Even when the subject gets tedious (he goes into rather extensive details on raising pigions and floating various seeds over water), his good humor is always evident and you know you only have to wait until his next big find is revealed. "The Origin of Species" should be read by anyone claiming to know the origin of mankind.  Though often tedious and lacking in modern evidence, this is still science writing at its best.  Any layman can understand the principle concepts of evolution through Charles Darwin.
