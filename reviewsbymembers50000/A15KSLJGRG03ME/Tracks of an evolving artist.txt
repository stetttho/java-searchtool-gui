 Wierd Al himself based his continual success in the last twenty years on his ability to change with the times.  Because he paradies modern music, it never gets old.  And thanks to his own unique comedic talents, he won't be going out of style for some time. 'Running With Scissors' is not Al's best album-but it's darn close.  The opening theme to Star Wars I, while probably not remembered by the mainstream, is a classic parody.  While I was disappointed by the lack of mocking boy bands, Al does wonders with Bare Naked Ladies in 'Jerry Springer' and his neo-funk comedy hit 'All About the Pentiums.'  His original tracts are equally entertaining and, to be redundant, original.  Just listen to 'My Baby's In Love With Eddie Vedder' and 'Truck Driver's Song' if you don't believe me.  And, of course, the best of the best, and my personal favorite Wierd Al song, would have to be 'Pretty Fly (For a Rabbi)', but then again I'm a bit biased. Wierd Al has done it again.  He's evolved--or mutated, more accurately--with the flow of pop culture, and in doing so has continued to keep our pathetic, meaningless lives filled with hilarity.
