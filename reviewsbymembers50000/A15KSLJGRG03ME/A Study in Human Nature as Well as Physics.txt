 Alan Lightman writes as if he is monotonously droning on quietly to himself, and this method works.  His images are so sublte, despite their definition, that I was not struck by the bizarre worlds he created until I had taken "Einstein's Dreams" in as a whole.  However, reading this book on the surface as a collection of Einstein's hypothetical dreams while he came up with Relativity might leave you bored and disappointed.  Lightman goes deeper than that, using each scenerio to not only exagerate different aspects of physical time, but also to shine light on disturbing aspects of human behavior.  We see people who live only for the present, or who's lives are entirely predestined, and how they react to the situation.  There is some truth in all Lightman's surreal vignettes. "Einstein's Dreams" is rather short and does not take long to read, so I recommend giving it a try if you have nothing to do one afternoon.  You might be pleasantly surprised.
