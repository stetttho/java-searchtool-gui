 It has become somewhat of a cliche among filmmaker's and Woody Allen buffs to portray 'Annie Hall' as the quintessential "Woody Allen film".  Although while tired, that discription is accurate.  With this 1977 picture, Allen perfectly combined his earlier goofball antics with his later more introspective philosophical style. First, the wacky hijinks--Allen plays a New York comedian, and is of course his usual neurotic self.  We are treated to an array of bizarre scenerios that blend his not uncommon relationship with the 'reality' only found in movies.  While being annoyed by a loud film critic in a line, Allen brings out the particular filmmaker he's criticizing; Allen is taken on a flashbacks to his childhood and insane parents; and need I mention the lobster scene? These occurences mixed in with everything else is what prevents this movie from recieving the label 'romanti comedy'.  While relationship movies are quite common, few have the philosophical tone set by Woody Allen.  He looks at man-woman interactions as if it were a puzzle he tries to solve but knows he'll never get it.  While countless have tried this approach, it has never been as flawlessly executed as Allen.  And perhaps in 'Annie Hall', he succeeded in a playing his message most clearly.
