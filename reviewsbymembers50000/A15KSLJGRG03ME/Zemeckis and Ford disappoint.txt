 Now let me say that I am a big fan of Robert Zemeckis.  'Back to the Future', 'Contact', 'Cast Away', and 'Forrest Gump' are among my favorite movies.  Harrison Ford is also an actor who I admire.  Remember 'Star Wars'?  Enough said.  Nevertheless, I was surprisingly disappointed by their recent teamwork in 'What Lies Beneath'. The plot is rather simple, althoug the storyline takes so many turns one can get confused.  What could have been great Hitchcockian suspence was turned into annoying twists by obsessive direction and irritating sound.  But the plot wasn't the full problem.  The last half hour could have been cut in half without loosing any of the suspence (and, in effect, keeping the audience's attention), but Zemeckis instead opted for a long, drawn-out string of "oh, it's not over!" scenes.  While rather mundane by suspence/thriller standards, the storyline might have worked out. ... But no matter how good the movie could have been, the fact is that any cinematic credibility was ruined the minute Zemeckis cast Harrison Ford as ....  I know I'm typcasting, but I cannot picture Han Solo, Indiana Jones, and Jack Ryan.... That said, the only things stopping this movie from being any good are the obnoxious use of suspence, and the horrible miscasting of Harrison Ford.  Zemeckis, you're a good director, don't waste your time on anything like this again.
