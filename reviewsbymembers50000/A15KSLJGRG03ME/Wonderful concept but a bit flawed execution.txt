 Spong's arguments make sense, his belief that fundamentalism has led to the decline in Christianity in recent years is well-founded, and his interpretations are interesting.  However, by vehemently attacking the fundamentalists themselves, and his tedious psychoanalyzing of the fundamentalist mind, will certainly turn off the very people he should be targeting.  Spong seems to preaching to the converted, presenting brilliant ideas and the latest in historical Christianity at a pace so rapid, he's unable to provide the actual evidence.  As with his brief section on the scientifically inaccuracies of the Bible, the truth of his argument is there, but he goes by it so fast only the converted and sympathetic will listen. But, otherwise, Spong has written a pretty good introduction to his modernized Christianity, with a focus on the eternal truths of the  Bible rather than the literalized dogma.  The chapters on Paul are perhaps the most interesting, touching on the most important distinguishing feature of Christianity--forgiveness.  At times the Bishop's writing seems forced and blocky, but there are passages where he really does convey the power of his faith, based on the ethical truths found in the symbolism of the Bible.  If only Spong could show this level of emotion throughout his book. Overall, a fine piece of post-modern Christian literature.  While Spong is unlikely to become a C. S. Lewish except among liberal Christians, or even win many converts from the fundamentalist camp, he has collected in his own words what many people are thinking these days.  Hopefully, an organized form of these beliefs may eventually come into being.
