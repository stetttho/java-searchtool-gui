 After reading 'The Will to Power', I understood Nietzsche better than ever before.  Don't get me wrong, I disagree with him on most points, but he has such a lovely system.  No philosopher save Spinoza and Lao-Tzu has successfully allowed metaphysics to flow into ethics as beautifully as Nietzsche.  Even if you disagree, I would reccomend reading his work if only to gain a little insight into the universe and human condition.  Be warned, though, that this is certainly not Nietzsche's best work.  Compared with his thoughtfully written essays and aphorisms, this arragne selection of first-draft paragraphs seems most unartistic.  Nevertheless, it is great work of philosophy and will leave you wondering about your own morality Thus Spake Zarathustra and Beyond Good and Evil provide more focused, complete descriptions of Nietzsche's philosophy.  I wouldn't pass up his notebooks, though.
