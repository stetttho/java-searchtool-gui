 I got turned on to Soilwork via some testimonials on an Opeth message board, so I purchased FNF song unheard from a local record shop. Serves me right...  For the life of me, I don't understand why someone who appreciates the incredibly talented band Opeth would be interested in this paint-by-numbers Pantera clone.  The two bands are nothing alike, other than they both originate out of Sweden.  There are absolutely a ton of great Swedish bands out there (Flower Kings, Opeth, Anekdoten...), but this isn't one of them.  In short, if you like Pantera and want to hear another band pretend they're Pantera, they you'll like this.  If you want advanced musicianship, songwriting, and head banging goodness, go buy Opeth's Deliverance.
