 The front of the disc said that Brazil's CD is a mixture of Yes and Sunny Day Real Estate.  In reality, it's more of a mixture of 80's Rush and Green Day.  The band references the former in their spare use of odd time signatures and bad keyboards, and the latter in their lack of virtuousity and the singer's voice.  This is by no means a BAD album, but it's nothing that special either.  If you're looking for some new prog you won't find it here.  Check out Coheed and Cambria instead, they're far superior in just about every aspect from songwriting to instrumentation.
