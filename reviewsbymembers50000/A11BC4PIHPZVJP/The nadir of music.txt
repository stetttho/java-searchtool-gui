 Look... I don't have a problem with a bunch of big-haired dudes trying to "get some" in the 80's with their big hair and makeup.  But, for Chrissakes, don't subject us to the type of "music" that is on this CD.  Poison was good for one thing... VH1's "Behind the Music".  Other than that, this band is the absolute worst example of the absolute worst musical genre (80's hair metal) in history.  This CD is complete payback for all the music critics whose small, Bruce Springsteen-loving cerebreums couldn't process more advanced forms of rock such as like Yes and King Crimson. Those critics should be ashamed of bringing the blight of Poison over us...
