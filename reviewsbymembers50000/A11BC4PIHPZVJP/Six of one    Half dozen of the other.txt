 Jeff Buckley's only official studio album is really a two-faced album.  One the one hand, the original songs are amazing and point towards an unfortunately unrealized bright future as a singer/songwriter.  "Mojo Pin", "Dream Brother", and especially "Grace" are three of the finest examples of their genre.  On the other hand, the remakes such as "Lilac Wine" and "Hallelujah" will make you think of Sam Harris singing "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" on Star Search.  With such obvious talent for writing his own songs, one wonders why he wasted time reamking these embarassing numbers.  As a whole, however, the album left me wondering what could've been if Jeff would've lived to complete his second solo album - one that was going to contain ALL originals.  I have listened to "Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk", and I think it would've been a magnificent album had it been properly completed.  In the end, for the ultimate Buckley CD, simply take tracks 1, 2, 3, 9, & 10 from "Grace" and augment it with some of the better tracks from "Sweetheart".  Avoid the other releases, as it seems Buckley's mom is determined to turn her deceased son into the "White Tupac"...  I would've probably gone with three stars on *Grace*, but the title track is so mindbogglingly amazing that it's worth a whole star by itself.  A solid effort - at times nearing spiritual - but the "cheese factor" knocks it down a notch.
