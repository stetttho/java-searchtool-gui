 Very rarely would I suggest picking up a live CD before any studio CDs,  but here I will make an exception.  "Alive..." really captures  the emotion of the Flower Kings music, and will most definitely get you  hooked enough to seek out the rest of the bands catalog.  The first two  songs of the CD "More of This World" and "Church of Your  Heart" are songs of the goosebump variety... I honestly didn't know  there was still music like this available. I'm the standard prog-head -  grew up on Yes, Genesis, KC, etc. I GUARANTEE that if you come from a  similar background, you will be blown away by this CD.  Roine Stolt has  quickly become - for my money - the finest guitarist/composer of today.   His guitar playing is not so much fast as it is straight from his heart -  it's a very emotional style, much like Steve Rothery of  Marillion. Anyway, please do yourself a favor and give these guys a try.   It's the best new music available in the world.  Period.  Thank goodness  for Roine and the Kings.
