 Sid Smith has done a wonderful job in pieces together the story of King Crimson - a band that was as disjointed and frayed as perhaps any other in rock history.  He does some nice track by track commentary of all King Crimson's studio songs, albeit he does seem to be trying a little hard to sound like Robert Fripp in the process...  The other thing you'll take away from this book is amazement that Robert Fripp didn't get punched in the face more often than he did.  He is rock's malcontent - an ageless talent with a five-year old's emotional level.  But, as long as he keeps playing his guitar, we can overlook the rest!  There are lots of great quotes from all the major players, great stories from the road, and everything else you'd expect in a top-notch rock biography.  A good purchase!
