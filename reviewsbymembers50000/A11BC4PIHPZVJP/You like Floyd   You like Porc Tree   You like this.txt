 Subject line says it all... not much of the standard "noodling" that you generally get from Portnoy and Matheos.  This is pretty much an "original tribute" album to Floyd.  Some of the songs sound so similar to Porcupine Tree (a very Floyd-ian outfit themselves), that you'd swear is was the Tree themselves. Very cool change of pace for Portnoy/Matheos, and the perfect album to just kick back and chill to on a cloudy Sunday.
