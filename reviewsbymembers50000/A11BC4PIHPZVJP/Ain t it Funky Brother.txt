 This is the only rap album that I've heard that I would label as "brilliant".  I'm terminally "white", but "Shake Your Rump" puts me in a dance-a-holic trance.  Side B is the rap  version of Abbey Road... simply genius.  The B-Boys are the kings of rap -  their music is fun without sinking into the depths of violence and  ignorance.  Party music at its finest.
