 THIS is the Buckley CD that really makes me sad that his life was ended so early.  "Grace" was a wonderful album, but with all the great originals on that CD, it was negatively counterbalanced by schmaltzy remakes like "Lilac Wine" and "Hallelujah" that bordered on Star Search-esque karaoke...  "Sketches" on the other hand is almost all original Buckley penned material, and almost every track shows the listener just what could've been.  The music is more upbeat, there's less emphasis on vocal gymnastics and more attention paid to guitar sounds and just plain ol' singing.  It's more Thom Yorke than Whitney Houston this time around.  The second disc is filled with interesting four-track outtakes and sketches, the most interesting of which is "Back in NYC" - a cover of uber-prog band Genesis' excellent song off of The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. I would've liked to hear a more finished version of this, but as it stands it's a pretty cool little homage by Jeff to the old 70's music he loved.  The songs and vocals will remind you of so many different artists - Radiohead, Roxy Music, Led Zeppelin, The Smiths, King Crimson... the list goes on.  Heck, on the fantastic R&B track "Everybody Here Wants You" he even invokes a little Prince-style groove.  This guy is versatile!  On "Sketches", Jeff Buckley manages to take all these influences and combine them with his unique talent for what I believe is THE MUST HAVE album in the Buckley collection.
