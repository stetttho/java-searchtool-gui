 In trying to broaden my prog horizons beyond Yes, Genesis, and KC I decided to pick up a Dream Theater CD since I've heard that they're sort of a "metal/prog" type band.  I like some metal and I like prog, so  I figured that I was in for a real treat. Boy, was I wrong...  Ladies and  gentlemen... Dream Theater is HAIR METAL!   Sure, it's well-played hair  metal - but this sure ain't prog.  The singer is just awful (everytime his  voice appears, I hear Beavis and Butthead yelling "Change It! ")  - I kept waiting for him to break into "Somewhere Over the  Rainbow".  And while there are some interesting instrumental bits with  the guitar, bass and drums, rest assured that a really obnoxious keyboard  riff will destroy any musical momentum.  If you like Dokken, Poison, or  Winger you probably will love this stuff; but if you're a Yes/KC/ELP fan  stay far away.  If you're looking for new prog, check out "Flower  Kings," "Transatlantic," or "Porcupine Tree."
