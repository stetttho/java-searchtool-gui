 OK, Here's the rundown - LTiA1 is pretty cool, although it runs a bit too long in my opinion.  Book of Saturday is an agreeable little tune with very nice vocals.  Exiles will remind you of the first couple o' KC  albums. Easy Money is similar to "Cat Food" and "Ladies of  the Road,"  The Talking Drum is pretty much a complete waste of space,  and finally LTiA2 is one of the best rock and roll tunes in exsitence and  is pretty much worth the price of the CD alone. "Red",  "Discipline", and "The ConstruKction of Light" are all  better KC CD's, but if you're a fan this is definitely worth the purchase.
