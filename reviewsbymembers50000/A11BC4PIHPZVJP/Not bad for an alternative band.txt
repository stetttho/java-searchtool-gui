 The opening cut "Anything" is a fantastic way to kick off 3EB's "Blue," however it's unfortunately the best cut on the album.  "Wounded" and "An Ode to Maybe" are two other  standouts, but to be honest the rest of the CD sounded like the rest of the  vanilla "alternative" bands out there.  Alternative just ain't  "alternative" any more - it's now pop music.  That being said,  3EB is a pretty good pop band.
