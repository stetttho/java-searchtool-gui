 I loved Dogma, Clerks and even dug Mallrats.  Unfortunately, Chasing Amy didn't live up to my expectations. The rapid fire dialogue is similar to that in Smith's other films, but here most of the verbal exchanges fall flat - or go on far too long. The only decent scene was the one with Jay and Silent Bob in it.
