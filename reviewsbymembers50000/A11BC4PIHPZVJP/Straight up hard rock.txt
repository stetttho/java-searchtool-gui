 This is the Zeppelin album that Zep never made.  If you're a big fan of Extreme's other work, this may be too "straight ahead" for you, but I think it's their best work BY FAR. The musicianship is incredible (Nuno's work is his best), the rythym section sets up some wicked grooves... it really reminds me a lot of Zep's Physical Graffiti (which is my fav hard rock album). I see there's some used copies available for a couple of bucks... that is an absolute steal.  This one, IMHO, is a classic that slipped under the radar. BTW, the best track on the disc is the hidden title track.  Wait 'til you hear the bass work on that one!
