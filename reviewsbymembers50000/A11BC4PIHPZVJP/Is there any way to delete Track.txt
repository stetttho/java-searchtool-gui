 A new KC album is not so much a "release" as a "happening"... TCoL is sure to please fans of THRAK and the ProjeKts.  Larks IV and the title track are both brilliant cuts, and are  sure to be enjoyed over and over again as new nuances are discovered with  each listen.  The only problem I have with this disc is the ABYSMAL opening  track "ProzaKc Blues" - what the heck were they thinking?    However, aside from this apparent momentary lapse of reason, TLoC is  another winner from a band that is truly far ahead of its time.  It's a  shame these guys can't stop aging...
