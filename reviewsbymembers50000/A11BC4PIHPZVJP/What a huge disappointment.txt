 I LOVED the first 30STM album... thought it was one of the best hard rock debuts to come around in ages.  It had depth, uniqueness, slick melodies, and interesting concepts both muciscally and lyrically.  In other words, it has everything that A Beautiful Lie DOES NOT.  Apparently, the guys in the band weren't happy with the lack of airplay their debut received, so they've obviously dumbed their music completely down as to appeal to the Warped Tour kids.  It's a shame that a band with such potential to make meaningful art has decided to churn out cookie cutter dredge such as this.  The only song worth listening to is the title cut (which has a great chorus), but all the other songs seem to blend together and just sound like every other talentless post-punk/emo band like Used, etc.  Jared Leto is far too old (and judging from the first CD, too talented) to be writing this type of paint-by-numbers music. I'm still looking forward to their third album, but as the saying goes, fool me once...
