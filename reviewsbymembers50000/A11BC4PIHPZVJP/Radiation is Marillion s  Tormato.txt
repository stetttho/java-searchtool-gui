 And I liked Tormato... Radiation contains some incredibly catchy tunes such as "Under the Sun," "3 Minute Boy," and "These Chains" - they'll stick in your mind when you're not  listening.  Another plus for this CD is the notably different styles that  Steve R. and Mark K. take with the guitars and keys respectively.  The keys  have a more "computerized" sound to them, and Steve's guitar  licks are MUCH more raw and straight-forward then in other Marillion  works. Oh yeah, and the bluesy track "Born to Run" is one of my  favorite Marillion tunes of all time.  This song just oozes atmosphere - I  actually feel like I've been transported to a half-filled smoky bar every  time I hear it.  It's simply brilliant. The only reason that I didn't  give Radiation a higher rating is because of the last track on the CD,  "A Few Words for the Dead".  This song is over 10 minutes of the  most boring music ever to come of Marillion... it just DRAGS!  Also, the  production value of the disc ain't that great - there are a lot of spots  where you'll have to strain to hear the vocals. Bottom line, a very good  change of pace for Marillion with just a couple of flaws.  Definitely a  "should-have".
