 I was a huge fan of Californication, and supportive of RHCP's turning away from white funk towards California-style rock.  By the Way definitely continues this trend, but unfortunately the quality of songwriting is nowhere near as strong as it was on Californication.  The first few times you hear the songs on By The Way, you'll note how catchy they are.  However, they do not stick in your head and "catchy" turns to "boring" after a few listens.  This CD is already collecting dust on my shelf...
