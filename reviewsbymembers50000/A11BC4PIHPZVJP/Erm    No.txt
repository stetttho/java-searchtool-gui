 I'm a big Gilmour fan - love his solo output... think Pink Floyd without Waters was just fine... think his vocals and guitar was what made classic Pink Floyd "classic"...  But, this DVD was sort of sad to watch.  The acoustic setting makes it all to easy to see that Gilmour has gone way past his prime.  He can no longer sing, and his guitar playing - without effects - is mediocre at best.  I was absoutely certain that I would love this DVD when I bought it, but by the 6th song or so I was ready to turn if off.  I don't understand all the 5-star reviews... search out some of the lower reviews and you'll see they echo(es) my sentiment.  BTW, for a better taste of Floyd from the 21st century, check out Roger Waters' "In the Flesh".  Even though I generally side with Gilmour in the Gilmour/Waters feuds, Water's DVD is infinitely more polished and entertaining than this one...
