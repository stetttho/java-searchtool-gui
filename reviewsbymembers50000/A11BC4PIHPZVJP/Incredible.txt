 I'm a wrestling fan, and have also been a gaming journalist for a few years, and I must say that SD! SYM is one of the most amazimgly detailed games I've played on ANY platform for the past couple of years.  You literally could spend the better part of several months trying to unlock all the secrets, and the create-a-wrestler mode is the most incredible custom builders of any console game I've seen. If you're a wrestling fan, this is an absolute no brainer.  The season mode is classic - it's as if you get the chance to step into the boots of your favorite superstar as you go through a full year of TV shows, pay-per-views, storylines, swerves, and wrestling action.  Even non-wrestling fans may appreciate the depth of this title. This is the type of detail and care that I wish more developers would show with their work.  Major kudos to Yuke's and THQ for putting out a totally top-shelf product, when they probably could've just cashed in on the license alone.  Buy it.
