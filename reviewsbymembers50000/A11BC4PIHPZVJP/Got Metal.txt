 I didn't think I'd like ToT based on what I'd heard... I don't like Metallica much, and preferred the more symphonic side of DT (6DOIT... Scenes...) than their more metallic releases (Images and Words, Awake).  But, despite all preconceived notions, this CD just freakin' RAWKS!  It's harder than they've done in a while, but just because it's metal doesn't mean it's simple - the songwriting's still there, you just have to listen to it. This is a deep record that demands attention to fully be appreciated.  I still prefer Scenes and Disc 2 of 6DOIT, but ToT is by no means a throwaway. Oh, and note to guitar players... be prepared to throw away your axes after the aural demoralization you'll receive from John Petrucci.  That guy is just unbelievable!
