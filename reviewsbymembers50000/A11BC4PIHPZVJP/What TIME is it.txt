 When Prince decided to embrace R&B and eschew rock and roll in his original compositions, he became just another act, IMHO.  His work from 1999 up through Sign O' the Times was nothing short of genius, but for some reason he decided to turn his attention away from groundbreaking, genre-busting work and concentrate more on being a run-of-the-mill R&B and funk revue - complete with dance troupe and annoying horn section.  This is Prince Vegas-afied. He's become a caricature of his former self.  Listen to his older stuff like "Ballad of Dorothy Parker" or "Lady Cab Driver" and compare it to the dreck he's come out in the 90's.  It's like night and day.  Prince dances, sings, plays guitar (underwhelmingly) all over this DVD, but it just feels like Prince has become a cheap, glitzy version of himself. And the "Jeebus" stuff gets real ridiculous real quick as well.  I'd love to see Prince just strip it down to a four or five piece band (sans horns) and get back to being about the music and not the spectacle.  He could have been one of the great music stars in history, but he's decided instead to just be another R&B revue... shame, really.  That said, The Time comes to DELIVER THE GOODS, and kicks His Royal Badness to the curb with great performances of "Jungle Love" and "The Bird".  I'd have rather seen them headline the DVD!
