 OK, this is simple - if you like 70's progressive rock, then you will most definitely like Transatlantic.  The first cut on the CD - a 30 minute piece titled "All of the Above" - is simply the finest piece of  progressive music released in probably twenty years.  The rest of the CD is  strong also, but you'll spend the bulk of your listening time on the  opener. Thank goodness there's still folks making music like this!
