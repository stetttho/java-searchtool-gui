 Plain and simple... if you like classic prog, and dig bands like The Flower Kings and Spock's Beard, you'll DEFINITELY love Kaipa's Notes from the Edge.  Featuring TFK's Roine Stolt on guitar (and some of his best work is found here), just about every song is well composed and memorable.  The interplay between Stolt's guitars and Lundin's keys is incredible, and pushes this disc to the top of the prog heap.  Especially good are "Second Journey Inside the Green Glass" which contains some GREAT guitar/keyboard runs, and "A Road in My Mind" which features beautiful female vocals that will send chills down your spine. The only misstep is the questionable use of an ersatz horn section on the jazzy "Morganism", but the drum work on the rest of the tune makes up for its other shortcomings. An excellent record from excellent musicians, and not a release that should be missed by prog fans.
