 I swear that in 30 years, people will look back on Dave Grohl as one of rock's driving forces.  From incredible drumming to emotional guitar playing with Nirvana, Queens of the Stone Age and Foo Fighers, Dave has put out one of the most impressive bodies of work in the modern rock era. Probot is no exception.  I'm going to make this review quick... do you like kick a$$ metal?  Do you wanna bang your head like they did back in the good ol' days of Black Sabbath and pre-Black album Metallica? Then buy this. Period.
