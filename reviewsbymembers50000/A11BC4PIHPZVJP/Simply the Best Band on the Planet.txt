 When you hear CDs like "The Rainmaker", it REALLY makes you upset that so many young folks are getting forced to listen to Limp Bizkit, boy bands, talentless rap acts, and other simililar examples of today's nihilistic youth culture.  Thank God (or whoever) that there is a band like the Flower Kings to give music lovers something worthwhile to listen to.  These guys, IMHO, are the best band out there at the moment, and after seeing them live it's amazing how tight they are. For long time FK fans, "Rainmaker" will take some time to get used to (much like their previous outing "Space Revolver").  However, once it gets a hold on you, it simply does not let go.  The opening track "Last Minute on Earth" features Hasse Froeberg's powerful and inhuman singing, along with some killer keyboard chops from Tomas.  Throughout the rest of the CD, The Flower Kings hop around from standard prog (Road to Sanctuary) to R&B (Serious Dreamers) to heavy metal (Sword of God) to classical (The Rainmaker) - and they mix and match these style seamlessly. While all the musicians are of course phenomenal (especially bassist Jonas - to see him live is nothing short of incredible), special mention must be made of drummer Jaime Salazar, who makes his final appearance as a Flower King on this CD.  His drumming is wonderful throughout the album, and he will definitely be missed. This one is simple - if you love good music with musician that can play the hell out of their instruments, but still focus on songwriting and melody, then you should buy this CD.  And, if you're one of those who thinks the music world starts and ends with MTV, come check out what people with actual talent can do when they set their minds to it.
