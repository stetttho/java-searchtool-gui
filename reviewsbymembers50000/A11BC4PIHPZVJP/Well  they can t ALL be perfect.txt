 The fact that Roine & Co. can continue to churn out such quality music  at the rate they do is nothing short of mind-boggling.  The Flower King's  latest, "Space Revolver," is full of Flower King-ish moments, but  it's also a little jazzier than its predecessor.  The guitar is great as  usual, but for my taste the new bass player is a little too  "flashy"... I much prefer Michael Stolt for Flower King music.   I'm sure the new bass player is supposed to be technically better than M.  Stolt, but he just doesn't "feel" right to me. The other  problem with this CD is that alto sax player.  Everytime I hear that sax,  it reminds me of Kenny G... I just can't help it.  In my opinion it's  annoying, and destroys any chance of "Space Revolver" being a  five-star effort. Other than the bass and sax, everything else is up to  the standards expected of the Flower Kings.  Stolt's guitar playing, as a  matter of fact, seems even more inspired than usual and his songwriting is  just as excellent as ever. Compared to the other FK efforts that I've heard  (Alive, Flower Power, and Stardust), I would have to say that this is their  weakest CD.  It is, however, light years better than any of the dreck that  other bands are releasing nowadays.
