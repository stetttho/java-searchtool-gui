 While Colisseum's single player element is mildly entertaining, it's the multiplayer battle mode that has really disappointed me. Not only do you need the Colisseum game, but ALL human opponents will need to own a Game Boy Advance, a copy of Ruby or Sapphire with a saved game on it, and a link cable.  There is no other way to play multiplayer. I can't believe the greed Nintendo is showing by forcing their customers to purchase all this unecessary hardware.  A stand-alone multiplayer mode such as the one in Stadium for the N64 should've been included.  I like GBA connectivity as an *option*, but not when it's forced down the consumers' throat.  This is a spit in the face of their customer base, IMHO.
