 I'm a huge Matthew Sweet fan, and I was thrilled to hear about The Thorns and rushed out to pick it up.  On the plus side the vocal harmonies are absolutely incredible, and there are some clever hooks in the choruses.  However, there seems to be some problems with verse melodies in addition to some bizarre production decisions regarding secondary instruments and such.  There are parts that remind me a LOT of Crosby, Still and Nash... and those are the bits I like best.  Unfortunately, there are also bits that remind me of the Traveling Wilburys, and those I do not like at all. I hope The Thorns will try again with an album made up of nothing but acoustic guitars and harmonies.  I feel they'd be better if they left their string arrangements and electric instruments at home. Still, this album is worth having if for nothing else but the harmonies.  Not a bad effort, but not as good as is should've been
