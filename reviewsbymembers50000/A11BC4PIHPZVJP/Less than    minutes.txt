 My kids and I love Spongebob, and most of the songs on the CD are great (my favorite is F.U.N. - Plankton kills me!).  However, the CD clocks in a 9 minutes and 13 seconds making it a complete rip-off considering there were other songs they could have included. I also question the inclusion of a Pantera tune in the middle of a kid's CD... if this is a kid's CD, that is.
