 What do you get when you mix a almost non-existent plot with boring characters and mind-numbing dialog?  You get "Equal Rites" - the third Discworld novel.  I thought "Colour of Magic" was decent and absolutely LOVED "Light Fantastic," so I was very much looking forward to diving in to "Equal Rites".  Unfortunately, the book includes none of the characters from the first two books - instead focusing on a "coming-of-age" tale of an 8-year-old female wizard.  I've read a bunch of humor/fantasy novels, and this one is right at the bottom of the barrel.  Skip it.
