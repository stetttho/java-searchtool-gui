 "Lies" is a moderately entertaining book from a over-achieving Al Franken.  If the book is taken at base level - a political commentary written by a comedy writer - it can be a fun read.  But when Franken at times begins to suppose he is an expert in politics, his naivete undermines his ability to make his arguments. Regarding his arguments... he makes no more impressive arguments regarding the "political enemy" then do opposite numbers Coulter & Co. "Lies" is good for a few good laughs and enjoyable anecdotes.  But if you look deeper, you'll come up a little empty.  And you'll realize what a scary situation it is that a large majority of the voting public get their political ideologies from comedy writers and disc jockeys.
