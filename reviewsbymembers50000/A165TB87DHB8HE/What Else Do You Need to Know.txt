 Clapton, Jagger, Sir Paul, The Who, Billy Joel, Elton and on and on. Great music for a good cause.Everyone involved in this concert must have been determined to give 110% effort, because the quality of the performances is uniformly high. Because of the diversity of the music, few people will love every song, but you will appreciate even those performers that don't regularly top you list.I'll just mention a few of the many highlights: Clapton, who I do love, does a great "Hoochie Coochie Man" with Buddy Guy helping out. I don't listen to a lot of Melissa Etheridge, but her acoustic solo of "Born to Run"is huge. Hard to believe it is only 1 guitar. The entire Who set maintains a top energy level, and John Melloncamp's "Pink Houses" (with help from Kid Rock) may be the best cut on both CDs.  Five for Fighting's "Superman" will probably make you cry, but shortly thereafter, Sir Paul's 4 song set will make you smile. Good music for a good cause. What else do you need to know?
