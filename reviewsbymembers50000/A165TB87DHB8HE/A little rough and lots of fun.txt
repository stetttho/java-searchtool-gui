 Unlike Hot Tuna's early live acoustic album or the more recent (and wonderful) Furthermore CD, Live in Japan is a little rough around the edges. And that makes it fun. When you listen, you feel like you are hearing the band in a noisy saloon, and they have enjoyed the party as much as everyone else. Many of the songs are the same as on other CDs, but in this atmosphere, classics like True Religion get a whole new personality. Keep On Truckin' has a sexy earthy tone to it not heard elsewhere. As with any Tuna CD, the musicianship is exceptional, and combined with the informal tone of the whole set, Live in Japan is one you will enjoy having in your collection.
