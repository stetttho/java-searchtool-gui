 I bought this CD after seeing Paxton open for Stephen Stills at the Fillmore in San Fran. These guys are the real deal, writing catchy tunes  with great lyrics. Songs like "I'm Not Like Anybody Else" address  the pressure to conform in the world, while "Fatherless Sons"  combines a tug-at-the-heart story with  hard hitting musical backing. There  are a few gender twister songs thrown in as well. Paxton's unique rasp may  not please everyone, but I find myself coming back to the cd more often  than I expected to. Buy the CD and catch the show if you get the chance.
