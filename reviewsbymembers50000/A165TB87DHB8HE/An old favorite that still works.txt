 Of all the Dead's live music, this cd,recorded during a tricky time in their history, has the most bare-bones line-up of the band. One drummer,very little Pig (due to illnes), and a few sit-ins by Merl Saunders. More than ever, the guitars had to carry the day. On the Not Fade Away/GDTR medly, Bob Weir rose to the challange, playing some his best live work,particulary on the change-over. It is the best stuff on the CD, with each musician contributing  a very clear role.I sometimes pull out the CD just to hear these two songs. There are many recorded Wharf Rat versions, but this is one of the best due to Merl's haunting organ work and the great chemistry he has with Jerry. Jerry's guitar screams on a strong opening Bertha and again on a hot Big Railroad Blues. The lengthy "Other One" is not one of the best out there, costing this CD a star. Including vinyl,8-trach, cassette and CD, I've had this album for 30 years, and it still gets plenty of listening time.
