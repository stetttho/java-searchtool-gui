 From vinyl to cassette to CD, I have owned this album for nearly 30 years, and it still stands up as one of the best ever made. In addition to songs that became classic, such as Love The One Your With, there are numerous soulful gems such as Do Unto Others and the monumental We Are Not Helpless. Wonderful songwriting. Stills has fun with the cajun-inspired  Black Queen, and shows tremendouse arranging ability with the sophisticated Cherokee. All of the top musicians and singers from the early 70's L.A. scene lend their talents throughout the album.There are very few perfect pieces of work out there, but Stephen Stills scored big time on this one.
