 If you don't have a bootleg tape collection, how often do you get to hear a hopping version of Pigpen's Aint't It Crazy? Or an electric Dark Hollow (yes.. it works!)? Or Cold Rain and Snow brought to a new level as part of a second set grouping? Like never, except in this exceptional 4 cd set. True, not everything works (Truckin' should NOT open a first set!) but most does. And with only 1 drummer and Pigpen on part-time duty, Bobby steps up and plays some of his tightest and clearest guitar ever.His singing is in top form as well, sounding young and smooth. The mood of the whole set is very unrushed, so all of Jerry's rifts stand out clearly. All your favorites are here somewhere, so no need to list all the songs. Buy the set, and enjoy one of the more uniques Grateful Dead recordings out there.
