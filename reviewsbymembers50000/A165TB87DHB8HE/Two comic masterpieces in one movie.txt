 Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin both turn in amazing physical comic performances in this film. I'm talking Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin type skill. This was also a gender bender before they becane fashionable and eventually overdone. Is the plot silly? Sure. So what? The unrealistic is handled smoothly, making it easy to buy in to the story. Have some fun with Steve and Lily at their best.
