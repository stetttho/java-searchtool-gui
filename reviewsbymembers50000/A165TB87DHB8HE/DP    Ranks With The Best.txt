 The Dead were clearly happy to be home for New Year's Eve. The opening tune, Jack Straw is sharp as a tack, with Jerry's guitar craking and the drums snapping. Disc 2, with a great Bertha/Good Lovin'  an awesome  China/Rider and a pounding Not FadeAway, is one of the best discs in the  whole DP series. If you are just starting your DP colletion, number 10,  along with 3 and 12, are the places to begin.
