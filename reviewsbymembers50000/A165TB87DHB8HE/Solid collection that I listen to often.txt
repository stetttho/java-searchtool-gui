 I have all 19 Dick's Picks. Most of them have a few songs I consider the "best version available", and some I usually skip. DP 7 has neither! It's just a real good show, with fun song selection, sharp playing and no rough patches. Some of the high lights include a great Scarlett Begonias, and a Not Fade Away that really moves. There are several good versions of "first set" tunes, like Mexicalli Blues, Half Step Miss. Uptown and Brown Eyed Women. Big River and Wharf Rat are also here. The band was tight, their voices were clear, and even with Dark Star, the mood was not very spacey. When I want some solid, easy listening Dead in the background, either in my office, in the car or at home, I often reach for DP 7, and I'm always happy I did.
