 First of all, when you see a title "Down The Road", does that not imply a "live " recording? It's not. It is a weak follow up to the brilliant Manassas first recording. I love Stephen Stills, and there is simply nothing special here.I never listen to it. I wish there was a live Manassas cd available.For now, I'll have to settle for "Stephen Stills Live", which is outstanding.
