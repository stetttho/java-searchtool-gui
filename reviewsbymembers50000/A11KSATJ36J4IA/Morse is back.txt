 They don't call him the most controversial commentator in America for nothing. Morse covers everything the number of socialists (and who they are) in Congress, issues involving Israel, Islam, to the connection between white supremacists and the political left or whether the public education system is in fact a communist construct. While I don't agree with everything that Morse writes I have to admit he does it in a compelling manner.
