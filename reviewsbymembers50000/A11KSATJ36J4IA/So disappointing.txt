 I've been a Phair fan since Exile in Guyville and I have to admit that I couldn't have been more disappointed with this latest album. I know a lot of people disliked whitechocolatespaceegg but I thought it was okay and could lead to new directions for Phair. If I had known it would have led to Avril Lavigne (which is unfair to Phair, the lyrics are more complex than anything sk8ter queen Lavigne could imagine) I would have slammed it more. The best way to describe this new album as is the female equivalent of having a midlife crisis and buying a sports car or getting hair replacement surgery. It's ugly and sad in men and it's ugly and sad in women. The song "Rock Me" was okay though.
