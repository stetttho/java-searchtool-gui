 It's disappointing that Larry Elder has been tagged as one of the voices of black conservatives given that he is, as he will happily tell you, a libertarian. With that important distinction out of the way, there are no libertarian voices as compelling as Elder's which either says something about the sad state of libertarian thought today or how dynamic he is. I vote for the later and Showdown certainly proves it. It's a wakeup call not only to black America, as some have taken it, but Americans in general. Either be a victim or get up, dust yourself off and go in for round two.
