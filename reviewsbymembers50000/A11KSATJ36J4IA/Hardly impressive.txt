 Only a leftist could have a book published in 2002 asking why no one knew of the horrific events which took place during the Russian Communist era. Apparently for such a literary person Amis never bothered to pick up even one book by Alexander Solzhenitsyn or other critics of the Soviet Union. Plenty of people were quite aware of the atrocities occurring in the Soviet Union *as they were occurring* and it was common knowledge in the 1950s in the West of the pogroms, jailings and killings. Read some Solzhenitsyn if you want a true study of the mindset that created the horrors of Russian communism.
