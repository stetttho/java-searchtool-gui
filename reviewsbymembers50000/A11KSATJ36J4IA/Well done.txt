 Sparta tends to be a jumble of images (a heroic stand at Thermopylae) or words (Molon labe!) for most people so it's nice to see a survey of the Spartan world. Cartledge surveys not only Sparta's impressive martial record but also peers at its unique society. While he's an expert on the subject, Cartledge doesn't communicate his knowledge ponderously, rather The Spartans is written with an impressive clarity and inciveness. Outside of his bizarre little attack on English fox hunting in the appendix (in which he explores Spartan hunting  -- animal and human), Cartledge's The Spartans is an absolute winner.
