 While reading this I have to admit that I wish D'Souza had written it ten years ago when I was just starting university. It would have saved me reinventing the wheel as a campus activist and learning the hard way some of the lessons he teaches in Letters to a Young Conservative. It's almost a given that the higher the amount of vitriol leveled at a conservative the more spot on they are about the issues and D'Souza takes a lot of flack over what he writes. This book shows you why. His essential points: use the truth, be fearless and never stop fighting. A worthy guide for campus conservatives.
