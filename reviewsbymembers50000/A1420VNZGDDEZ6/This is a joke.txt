 I must admit I was teased by the reviews. 5 stars! Must be good... NOT! What a disappointment. I've read two thirds of the book and I've yet to find something about either "analysis" or "reporting". Most of the content is a rehash of well-known facts or factoids, poorly exposed. Most of the text is made up of bullet lists, maybe the authors aren't able to put together more than two paragraphs in a row. The subject matter is treated superficially, they give you just some hints about languages and tools and a list of URLs. If I wanted a list of URLs, I'd have used Google and saved $45. I don't know what the other reviewers found good about this book. There are many books on creating effective commerce sites that are much better than this one. Sure, some of the reviews look highly suspicious. 5 stars from everyone? Aw, come on!
