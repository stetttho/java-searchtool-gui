 OK, so the story of "A Christmas Carol" has been told again and again, but this musical adaptation is simply the best. Albert Finney's Scrooge is a dastardly and loveable character, and the performances by all of the cast, set this movie apart from other renditions. But what makes this movie so special is the original music by Leslie Bricusse. The same talent that brought us the music to "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" as well as "Victor, Victoria". The music is catchy, beautiful and poignant, and so much within the holiday spirit, that I am surprised a few of the songs haven't become holiday traditions. Beautifully filmed, wonderfully directed and now in widescreen format!! I highly recommend this movie. Anyone I have ever shown it to, LOVES it instantly. A true classic that every home DVD library should have.
