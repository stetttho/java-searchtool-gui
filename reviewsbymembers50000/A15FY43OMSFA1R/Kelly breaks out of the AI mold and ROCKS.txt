 Wow! I have loved Kelly since the first episode of AI, and she was my pick to win. Her debut CD was great, but this one really shows us what a stellar talent she is. The songs are great, her vocals are amazing (as usual) and she even penned a few of the songs. I'm in love with this girl next door who can rock the house off any joint. Don't pay attention to any of the bitter reviewers out there. They are just jealous of her talent, and Kelly could run circles around Avril any day. The BIG difference here between Kelly and all those other rocksters, is that Kelly can actually sing!
