 22 minutes of footage from the aftermath of Sept. 11th. 22 minutes of dust, broken windows and debris. 22 minutes with NO narration. 22 minutes of wasted time, in my opinion. The only people who would appreciate this dull and repetative documentary, are the people of New York. I say this only because they know the city well, and this DVD is simply 22 minutes of images of their shattered streets. No human drama or personal stories. No images of the attack. Again, just 22 minutes of the streets of New York in ruins. BORING! Save your money, or better yet, get CNN's DVD on the events of Sept. 11th. A much better choice.
