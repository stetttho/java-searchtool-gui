 I've been a cosmetologist for over 22 years, and in those years I've shaved many a face and neck, including my own heavy beard!! These Schick Slim Twin Razors are simply the best made for us men. Easy grip, clean, super close shave, no nics (use HOT water men, and really lather that balm or shaving cream up) and good for 2-3 shaves before you have to toss them out. Hygiene is important too, so toss out that reusable handle (germs cause acne men), and get with this disposable.
