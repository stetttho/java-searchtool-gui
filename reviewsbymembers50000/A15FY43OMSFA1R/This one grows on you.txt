 Tamyra's debut CD is exceptional. Not only due to her amazing voice, but she penned most of the songs on this CD. That in my opinion shows real talent. While her first single release "Raindrops Will Fall" is a beautiful melody, the lyrics are a bit cheese-ball, but this is the only song on the CD I can say that about. Whoever chose to make that song her first release was a moron, and I fear it could hamper sales. My favorites; "God Bless the Dreamer" and "Legend", but honestly, I love the whole thing. If you are a fan of Tamyra's you will be very pleased. Those not familiar with this stellar talent should take a chance and buy her CD. Tamyra is here to stay....move on over Whitney!!
