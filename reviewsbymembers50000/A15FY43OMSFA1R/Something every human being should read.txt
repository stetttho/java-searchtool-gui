 Whether you agree with Spong or hatefully discount his words, this book has extreme merit. If only to challenge the mind to open itself. I've read through many reviews on Amazon and they are as polarized as our nations people are today. One even called Jesus a Republican, which clearly indicates this reviewer is severely out of touch with the Bible's teachings.   The nay-sayers to Spong's work merely suffer from fear of a deeper truth, which is, none of us knows for certain what the truth is. No matter what you believe, it is all based on faith, not fact. And no matter how strongly you believe in your position, it is unlikely you will sway the other side. So why bother? You are responsable for your own soul, not mine.  This book challenges the reader to look beyond the conditioning of traditional views. Some will grow from it, others will detest it. If only because they cannot tolerate the question this book forces them to ask...."who am I without these old beliefs?"
