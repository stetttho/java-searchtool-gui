 Although I have'nt yet had the opportunity to play this add-on, I imagine  it will be just as great as the 2nd, Corkscrew Follies. I wanted to write  this review prior to playing the game, to talk to those of you disgruntled  about the inclusion of Corkscrew Follies. Hasbro is offering a $10 rebate  to Corkscrew Follies owners. If you send them your old CD-Rom, they will  send you $10 back to help compensate for the price. You can find the info  on this at Rollercoaster Tycoons' offical  website.....www.rollercoastertycoon.com...Those of you who don't care, buy  this....the new themeing and entrance and exit features will be worth it  alone!!
