 After playing the original for 6 months, I was hoping for a bit more flexability and freedom in designing the park grounds. The designers did pack it with more visuals and rides, but what I would like to see if a new  (hopefully) add-on pack comes out, is the ability to design a park from the  ground up. Literally. Where is the ultimate scenario? A huge plot of land  to manipulate, access to every ride and themeing there is, and a big bank  roll to get you off to designing the ultimate park. Buy this one, but lets  hope Chris Sawyer gives us more.
