Clearly the best series of the Star Trek franchise, due in large part to an outstanding cast, led by the great Kate Mulgrew as Captain Kathryn Janeway. In Season One, we meet the crew as they are thrust into the Delta Quadrant, 70,000 light years from Earth, and watch two ships of enemies, Star Fleet and Marquis, band together to begin thier perilous journey home.
