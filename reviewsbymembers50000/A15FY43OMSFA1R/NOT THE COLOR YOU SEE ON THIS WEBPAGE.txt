 I love Fiestware and have been collecting for years. But I bought this Periwinkle set from Amazon and was very unhappy when it arrived. On the website Periwinkle appears to be a bright, light retro 60's blue, but in person, the color is dull, gray-blue and unappetizing. My set is going back, because I quite frankly hate the color, and it doesn't go with the other colors I have.
