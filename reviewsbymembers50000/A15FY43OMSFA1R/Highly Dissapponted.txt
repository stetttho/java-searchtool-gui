 I received this griddle/grill for Christmas and was so excited....at first. My old grill was made of steel and aluminum and was a total pain to clean. So, I thought this TFAL, with non-stick surface would be the answer to my prayers. I was wrong. Not only did the chicken breasts I was grilling stick to the grill, but the marinade literally burnt onto the surface. After soaking the grill for hours, and with A LOT of elbow grease, I was able to get the darn thing clean. I called TFAL's consumer help line, and they told me that grilling with marinades was not recommmended, and that I should soak the grill in vinegar for a couple of hours to remove the burnt on mess. What is the point of having a non-stick grill if things stick to it? And whoever heard of grilling chicken without some kind of marinade? Save your money and pass up this loser. Mine is going back to Amazon and I will stick (pun intended) to my old grill!
