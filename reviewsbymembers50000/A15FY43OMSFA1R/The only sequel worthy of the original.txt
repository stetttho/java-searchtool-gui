 Superman is back in this first (and only quality) sequel to the one that started it all. The man of steel is up against 3 villains from his home world who have been trapped in the "phantom zone", and all heck breaks loose here on Earth! This movie is packed with great special effects, and one of my most favorite scenes ever in a movie....when the villain Ursul cries out "Superman" and proceeds to throw a bus full of people at him. Great camp, a great cast and a true successor to the original. Buy Superman and Superman II, but don't waste your money on the other 3!
