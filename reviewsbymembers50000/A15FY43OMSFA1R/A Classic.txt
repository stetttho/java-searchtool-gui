 Tim Burton's timeless classic story of Edward, the forgotten  child/creation of a mad cookie-maker. (played wonderfully by Vincent  Price). The cast is amazing, the scenery unforgetable, and who can resist  Danny Elfmans haunting score. A must see for any fan of the interesting,  bizarre and original. This movie will make you smile.
