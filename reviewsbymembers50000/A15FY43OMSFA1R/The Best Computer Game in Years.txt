 If your looking for a non-violent (except for the puking), visually stunning, addictive, extremely fun and satisfying game, you have to buy RollerCoaster Tycoon. From the moment my friends and I took it out of the  box, it has literally been played everyday since. Everyone that I introduce  it too instantly loves it and gets so mad when someone else is on the  computer and they can't play it! It really is alot like SimCity in it's  approach, but then it has so much to offer, it makes SimCity quite boring.  The graphics are great, the sound effects are very life-like and you really  do get excited when you first open your custom-made park! To watch the  guests arrive and have fun on the rides you've designed, adds more to the  pleasure and excitement. For beginners it is a bit difficult and designing  a roller-coaster from scratch is HARD, but once you get the hang of it, the  fun is to see just how thrilling and scary a ride you can make. The game is  packed with all sorts of extras, i.e. scenery, water fountains, shops and  stalls, even a huge assortment of landscaping to make it picture perfect.  You can't go wrong buying this. It is a blast! My friends and I thank Chris  Sawyer for creating such a great game.
