 Confessions kicks arse! Once again, Madonna proves her exceptional talent and her incredible grip on the pulse of what is hot in music. Confessions may be a "throw back to disco days", as some reviewers will say, but I just don't agree. Confessions gives us all a taste of the now and future of dance music. Dig in and enjoy!
