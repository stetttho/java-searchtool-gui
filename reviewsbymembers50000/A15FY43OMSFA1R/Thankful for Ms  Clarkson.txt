 Wow - I am impressed. Kelly's debut album is soulful and intelligent. She proves why she won the title of American Idol....this girl can SING!! Her first release, "Ms. Independant" is co-penned by Christina Aquilera, and it rocks. The rest of the tracks seem more Kelly's style, with true r&b flavor at the core. Fans of Kelly are sure to be impressed. And for those not priviledged yet to hear her amazing vocal cords, buy this CD. You will be happy you did. Thank you Kelly!
