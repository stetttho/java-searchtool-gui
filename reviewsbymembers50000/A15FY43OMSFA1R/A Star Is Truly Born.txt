 OK, I admit it. I was addicted to Fox's summer hit "American Idol". I watched every episode, from beginning to end. The release of this CD single proves that happy endings are possible. Kelly Clarkson, at just 20 years old, stole the show. She is the all-american, girl next door, with the voice of a Diva. With over 15 million phone-in votes at the shows finale, Kelly won the title of "American Idol", and no one could be more deserving. She truly is exceptional, and such a cutie! This CD of her first two songs is an excellent pre-cursor to her debut CD, due out on November 26th, 2002. The first track "Before Your Love" was co-penned and produced by 80's pop star Cathy Dennis, and is definately more intelligent and emotional then the second track of "Moment Like This". However, given the competition, the second track is well suited for the occassion....
