 This unit is incredible. Every feature one could want in a DVDplayer and/or Digital Receiver. I love it!  Easy hook-up, simple tooperate, and loaded with features. The picture is sharp and the sound is impressive (be sure to select a set of good quality speakers). This is literally an all-in-one home theater, just plug in the speakers, hook it to your TV, and you are ready for a real pleasant home viewing experience. My only complaint would be the remote control. Its fully functional, but all the buttons are the same size, it's sometimes hard to distinquish which button does what. Overall, a great electronics item and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an entry-level player/receiver.
