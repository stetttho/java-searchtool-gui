 Kimberley Locke's debut album is nothing short of fantastic. Honestly, I like it a lot more the I was expecting to. Kim was my favorite contestant on AI Season 2, and I was bummed that she didn't win. But this album proves she is doing just fine for herself. Her vocals are amazing, and the eclectic mix of genres on the album, show her amazing range. She can sing anything and it sounds fantastic. The first track "8th World Wonder" is the breakout hit of the CD, but it is truly the most commercial and simplistic. My favorites are "I Could" and "Coulda Been", but the whole thing is great. Get this CD people and help ensure we get a whole lot more from Kimberley Locke!
