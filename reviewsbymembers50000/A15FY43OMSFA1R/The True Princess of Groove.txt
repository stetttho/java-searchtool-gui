 Christina rocks! I buy a lot of CD's, and this one is by far the best I've heard in many years, by ANY artist out there. Christina has the voice of an angel, and unlike her last CD, which was pop flavored throughout, the music on "Stripped" is intelligent, thoughtful and deep. Great grooves, great melodies, amazing harmonies and probably one of the best produced CD's I've ever heard. I often find myself stopping in my tracks just to really listen to what she is doing with her amazing voice. Christina captivates me, not only by her unique beauty, but by her incredible control of what makes great music.
