 After many hours of playing, I really enjoyed this game. It's a very cool game. Lots of fun, and really cool graphics.   I would highly recommend this game, as it's really cool. It's so much fun to play I went without sleep for 14 days, and spent 2 nights in the hospital because I stopped eating because there was no time as I was playing this totally cool game.   Thanks for reading my review. I am #1!
