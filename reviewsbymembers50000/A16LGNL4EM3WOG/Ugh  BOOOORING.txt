 This movie was an insult to society...  We are led into believing the "po black folk" have such a hard time getting ahead when they show Kenya, the main character being looked down upon by the "evil white businessman"- you see, we are led to believe as fact, that the "black tax" is actually viable... they talk about this with a straight face, I don't get it, it's filth.  I was trying to watch an interesting love story, but instead was bombarded by stupidity and boring "i'm black" and "your white" crap.  YAWN...  Although there were some nice moments, the movie spent to much time portraying stereotypes like Kenya's brother, the "black playa" with a new girl everytime you see him, lying about his money and what not trying to be "hot stuff" ... At the same time, you see Bryan, the "white guy" who of COURSE is poor, drives a crappy big wheel truck, and has his dog with him everywhere he goes.  It's just a stupid movie, it's a waste of time, and an insult to common sense and an insult to all that we have accomplished as Americans in the last 50 years... DONT WATCH IT.
