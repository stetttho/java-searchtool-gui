 I'm pretty open to most games... in fact, I don't find too many shooters that I don't enjoy, and to top that off, I really enjoy more "realistic" games. Unfortunately, Ghost Recon fails in nearly all environments excluding online play. You see, in single player, you run around, mostly in forest type terrain (you can't actually SEE any enemies because there are too many trees and the graphics are so poor that you can't barely distinguish a bush and an enemy). Now here is the HUGE problem, you have 5 other teammates all controlled by AI (unless you switch to them specifically)... they 3 of them run through the level on a predetermined path and easily kill all their enemies without stopping.  The 2 guys that run with you, are gauranteed to see the enemy and kill the enemy before you ever even realize they are there (remember you can't see anything). This game has a superb concept, but just completely lacks in its actually gameplay, its annoying and boring. If you are an intense online player, this game will provide tons of action packed fun on xbox live... but by all means, avoid it for the single player missions. If you are looking for realistic-semi-realistic shooters, try out conflict desert storm I and II.... both very fun squad play in first person.. stealth, action, great weapons, great squad dynamics, etc.
