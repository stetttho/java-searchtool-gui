 I really enjoy the show, and have since the VERY beginning, before all the Spongebob hype. Anyways, I was given this game as a pure surprise for christmas, didn't expect it. So after a couple hours of playing, I would have to say, the game is a bit monotonous, there just isn't enough dynamic and different content.  It is very similar to a "Super Mario Bros" game but lacks nearly ALL the elements that made those games great... lots of different enemies for one, this one you just fight the SAME silly robots over, and over, and over. But on the plus side, there are some neat elements, like bungie jumping, sliding down slides on Spongebobs tongue, etc. What REALLY holds this game together is how true the developers stayed to the Spongebob title, his little quirks, runins with other Spongebob stars, and really being able to see Spongebobs house and neighborhood were a blast.  If you love the show, you'll enjoy the game a lot. This title is developed for Spongebob fans, other game players will definately enjoy different games in this genre a lot more.
