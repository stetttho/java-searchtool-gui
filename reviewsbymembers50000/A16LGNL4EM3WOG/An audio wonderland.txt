 303 Infinity is dubbed by many as one of the top internet producers EVER.  His first "real world" realease continues the success of this original, great atist.  This is a rhythmic audio wonderland for the soul, flowing pads and smooth melodies, hard edged chords, flowing together with such precision and beauty, I can't get enough.  The song list is specifically organized to provide the greatest experience when listening- each song has it's own flavor and one builds upon the next in a superb fashion.  My favorite song off the album would be Up Til Dawn, a hard edged track that pulls together with softer melodies, really exciting to listen to.  Winter Rain is the flagship 303 Infinity song, and I can see why, this song is what music production is all about, it takes you through so many different emotions, different sounds and melodies, all in a sequenced harmony unlike ANYTHING you've ever heard, I would buy the album for this song alone.  Dream World is a breath of fresh air from the same old boring trance you hear on the dance radio stations.  And to the reviewers that gave this album low marks.... seems to me you are looking for the wrong music.   Why are you reviewing this CD as it is obviously not the type of music you enjoy.
