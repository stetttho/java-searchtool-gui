 I purchased this as a safe to lock things in, very inexpensive to say the least.  Be aware, you get what you pay for.  I think it's important to understand that this unit is designed to protect against FIRES... it is NOT a safe.  I found this out one day when I picked it up to open and put something in, accidently dropped it, and it just opened up easily...  If you own one, hold the handle, then lift the unit up lengthwise, then tap it on the floor with a slight force angled a little on the smaller/top side of the unit, it will open easily everytime... this scares me... also, every unit uses the same key...  So if you need to protect against fires, this is probably a good device, for security, buy something better.
