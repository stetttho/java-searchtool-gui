 I'm reading that a lot of people are having saving problems with this card.  I've had it for a couple weeks, and this thing has been pretty abused. I've dropped the controller MANY times from my chair (my hands are probably about 3 feet up) on tile, the card still works fine.  All my games are still in tact. For the people that say it doesn't work with all their games, you need to put the card in slot 1 of your controller for most games.  Sega was smart, and put 2 slots on the controller for memory cards, yet stupid game designers are only making games that recognize slot 1.  Only a couple games like Sonic Adventure 2 recognize slot 2. So basically, I've had the card 2 weeks without any problems, dropped it many times, still works great.  Many people are complaining about problems after a month or so, so if I do have problems, then you'll see a negative comment from me.  As of right now, I recommend this card.
