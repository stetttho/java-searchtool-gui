 The LCD screen QUICKLY turns off using the "LCD SCREEN OFF" button right under the screen... this same button will also disable/enable the helpful on-screen information (how many pictures you have, what size, etc.). The battery is NOT hard to install, not sure what you are talking about, I had it in and running immediately. If you would learn how to use the camera, a light press of the shutter button focuses the camera on the object, you can hold it here all day, then, when you decide to take the picture, a full press of the button takes the picture INSTANTLY. It's a shame people give negative reviews about such a great product. If you are looking for a wonderful camera at a budget, this IS the camera you need, does EXCELLENT video and picture quality. TONS of features, nighttime pictures, etc.. but also a simple setting for normal use... you can even EASILY edit pictures right on the camera. I got the case and rechargeable battery set which works great, never need to worry about batteries. I did a print of 8x10 with the 2 megapixels and the picture looked just fine, unless you are directly comparing the SAME picture side by side with a higher megapixel camera, you won't notice ANY difference, it looks awesome, this will do 4x6 and 5x7 prints nice and clearly. The camera is small and is a blast, I LOVE it and would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for a digital camera who isn't looking for "super awesome professional sharp clear pictures". This will do prints wonderfully.
