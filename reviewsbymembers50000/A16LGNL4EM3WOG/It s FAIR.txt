 I found this joystick to be about average... The cons--- The spring loaded centering doesn't always seem to react the way you need it too.... when flying simulators precision and feedback are everything--- especially when flying against live players. The joystick has tons of easily accessible buttons, which is great, and the refinement of the buttons is phenominal and comfortable, feels wonderful... and is a bit "exciting" to say the least. The throttle in the middle is downright annoying and you have to "cross" your hands just to use it, when in the fully throttle position, you tend to move the throttle with your joystick hand when pulling back on the stick... annoying. With a little getting used to though, I got the feel for this stick and it works great.... BUT.... in comparison, I highly recommend the microsoft sidewinder joystick, as the sidewinder is much better responsive to flying, it just feels better, reacts better, and never does anything unexpected, you get a better feel for the aircraft, period. Don't let this hold you back though, both are fantastic, but you will never know the difference by going to best buy and playing around, you need to play YOUR game with them, sorry to say it.
