 What do you get when you cross Phone Booth with Heat?  Collateral, an intelligent action drama. So what can you say about such a movie?  Well, Michael Mann, who directed Heat, OBVIOUSLY directed this movie as well, its clear as day, BUT, thats the good, and the bad. WARNING ENDING GIVEAWAY! You see, anyone who has seen Heat (and Collateral for that matter) has noticed that Mann likes to turn the bad guy into a lovable, respected, and great character, then kills him.  But who kills him?  The loser good guy.  Mann gets kicks out of developing a great bad guy who everyone likes, but also develops a complete loser good guy, whats up with that!  Mann does such a fantastic job with his movies except for this one fact, which is troubling- as this is what stay's in your head at the end of the movie, it bothers me, and it keeps bothering me everytime I think about the movie. But anyways - I gave this movie 3 stars, heck, the movie was absolutely incredible.  Tom Cruise does a phenominal job, completely believable, and so does Jamie Foxx... wow! I won't go into the details of the movie - theres 150 other reviews that do this.  But if that type of ending bothers you (did the ending to Heat bother you?) then you may be disappointed with this one too, just a fair warning. I highly recommend seeing this movie though, as the only disappointment will be the ending.
