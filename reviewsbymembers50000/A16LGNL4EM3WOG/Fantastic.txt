 I have been nothing but thrilled with Nero 6 Ultra.  I had the previous 5.5 and HATED it, but with Nero's new StartSmart - I'm a believer again.  Just about anything you wish to do with CD-R/DVD-R's and RW's can be accomplished, I use Nero's Vision Express (comes with Nero 6 Ultra) to make DVD movies from my favorite TV shows - I put 4 shows on a DVD with chapters, menu's and everything and it only takes a few minutes, the encoding and everything is so fast.  I read a few other reviews that claimed the data wasn't written properly - to answer that - Nero has a box that says "verify data when burn completes", I select this everytime I backup anything to a disc, it verifies everything is fine, and I've never had a corrupt disc since using Nero 6 Ultra, EVER.  In fact, nearly all corrupt discs are because of bad media, not your burning software- Nero fixes this issue.  The inteface is intuitive and works great, and the tools included are fantastic also, test your CD/DVD drives, get the speeds correctly and refined properly, make case covers, and just about anything else you want to accomplish.  Also, with the new Start Smart - Nero did away with their old hard to use interface (Nero 5.5 anyone!) - Now with the click of a single button, you can click between "express" and "advanced" - unless you are making a bootable cd, burning an image, etc... You will just use express - to make a data disc, you would simply drag the files (or select them) - and click "next" select the speed to burn at, select "verify data when burn completes" and click "burn".. hmm... doesn't get any easier!  The entire Nero software works much like this, including the DVD authoring, you can make awesome DVD's with all the features, just this easily.  Nero has absolutely done it with this program, I literally uninstalled Pinnacle and Roxio after using Nero, I for once have NO other CD/DVD software on my computer anymore, and thats a great thing!
