 I was and still am a HUGE fan of Hitman 2 - freaking awesome game.  I'm also not all that big on trying to complete missions with a silent assasin rating...  Nor do I run n' gun... I'm kinda in-between, shoot a couple guys, but remain stealthy, no close encounters, etc.  This game is fairly absurd.  Without a strategy guide, it's nearly impossible to figure out the small things like poisoning food, etc... For instance, Beldingford Manor, you have to poison and kill the horses with gas so they don't smell you, but first kill the stable guy to get his key, then find a water heater and turn it off so some lady in a shower won't be there when you go through the hidden door... the only problem is, there are no real clues and these kind of things are nearly impossible to figure out on your own, the game just gets daunting, and simply "that didn't work, reload and try a different approach" - it gets old FAST - this is the FIRST game I've had to get a strategy guide for in YEARS.... it's just that silly.  Yet I was able to work my way through Hitman 2 with a few drawbacks and reloads, but it was reasonable.  I honestly don't recommend this game all that much, the plot is non-existent... and there is no real mission briefing, you aren't "traveling" around as a hitman like in H2 - you simply are just "there" in the levels... rather stupid.. and kills the whole "point" of playing the mission... just seems pointless...  The game is not that much fun compared to hitman 2, to hard to play silent without strategy guide and completely lacking a plot or "point" to even play the game...  It's still an OK game regardless, but many players will not enjoy it.
