 I can't believe that I actually pay this amount for shampoo - but it really does work! (I use the conditioner and finishing cream, too) I have naturally wavy hair. The shampoo is rich, rich, rich and you don't have to wash twice. Once gets the job done. My only complaint: for the price, why can't B&B make this stuff WITHOUT sodium laurel sulfate? Because of this, I only use this shampoo for special occasions and give it only 3 stars. I think something that costs this much should be safe to use, too. Memo to B&B: wise up!
