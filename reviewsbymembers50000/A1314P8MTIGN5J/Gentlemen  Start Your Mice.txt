 This is such a great way to learn Illustrator basics! Don't be intimidated by the size! It is written in plain English and uses humor to help you become familiar with many non-familiar and intimidating terms. There are  illustrations (!) for almost every step in the process, which are very  helpful. It is not organized as lessons but instead, begins with the  description of each tool and its use and then tells you how to implement  the tool and shows you illustrations of what the result should look like.  It then tells you, in successive chapters, the various ways to combine the  basics and enhance them with devices like color, gradients and type to make  an illustration. It demystifies such esoterica as "masking",  "paths", "layers" and "Bezier curves"and  explains what they do. Then it explains why you should master them and how  to implement them. I haven't even gotten to the included CD yet, I'm saving  it for when I finish the book! It contains a sampling of effects and fonts  and some utilities that you can use with Illustrator. An excellent  beginner's book and an encouraging way to get started in Illustrator.
