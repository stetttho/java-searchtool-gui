 This is the comprehensive, huge, heavy, expensive book that used to scare me to death at the bookstore when I was just contemplating getting a computer 2 years ago and abandoning my life as a Ludite. These books are actually pussycats and just big and heavy because they contain every single particle of information about Quark that you could ever want to know. It is written in plain English and begins at the beginning. Follow it through and you will come out the other side a Quark Guru. It is a fabulous resource when you get stuck and just can't remember how to do something or what this or that tool does. It really does answer any question you might have about how to Quark. Essential for Quark freaks and geeks and wannabes.
