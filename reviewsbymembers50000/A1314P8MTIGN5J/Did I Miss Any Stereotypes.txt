 This is one of the most boring and poorly constructed books I have ever read and a good reason NOT to buy hardbacks and to wait for the paperback version! This aspires to be a lawyer-winning-a-hopeless-case novel replete with tired and hackneyed characters: a female sex-bomb computer analyst and tycoon vs. the evil U.S. government, it's evil Army General who plots to track info on every US citizen with his supercomputer, and  finally the scapegoat, a member of the supposedly non-existent Delta Force, wrongly accused of the tycoon's murder. I'll spare you the storyline for others have laid it out in their reviews; suffice it to say that few books have characters who are more clichd! But wait...add to this mix a feisty, arrogant, bombastic, opposing People's council who just happens to be a dwarf who rants and raves to the court from a board placed over milk crates to form a plank and sits in a booster-seat! This story wanders around all over the place for far, far too long but never goes anywhere and our surly defendant's attorney and protagonist, Paul Madriani and his sidekick, Harry made me root for the dwarf. Martini's editor must have said: "Wrap this stinker up somehow!" on the 50th rewrite because everything grinds to a screeching and predictable halt and in the last 10 pages we are led by the hand like helpless kindergarteners to an already wretchedly obvious explanation of the previous 380 pages we have gnashed our teeth through! Don't be prejudiced against the legal thriller genre because of this book - read the masters like John Lescroart, Scott Turow and the prolific but still great John Grisham.
