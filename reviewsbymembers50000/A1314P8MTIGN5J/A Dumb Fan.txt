 This series of books is the best value for the money and this one is no different. I am a graphic designer of 2 years and most of the useful knowledge I have obtained in order to use Photoshop, Illustrator, Pagemaker and now, Quark, has been gleaned from the Dummies books. They begin at the beginning in language that anyone who is literate can understand. This one lacks the humor that I have come to enjoy, but still, it gets the job done. If you sit at your computer with this book on your desk and work with it, you will soon be laying out your pages and setting margin guides, drawing paths for your type and using graphics.
