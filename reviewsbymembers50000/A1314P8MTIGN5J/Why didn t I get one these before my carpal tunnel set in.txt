 These (I got 2) are incredibly wonderful. I am a graphic designer and long days at the keyboard have killed my wrists. This gadget fits on your desktop with the edge flush with the desktop and you put your monitor on top and pull the keyboard shelf out and down. The shelf holds your keyboard and mouse and is plenty big to hold both and do some serious mousing! I have 2 huge Viewsonic monster monitors, each 21" and they weigh a ton. The box the monitor goes on is steel and rated at 80lbs. and holds my monitor fine without any buckling. The shelfs have 4 levels you can lower them to. You can adjust them all the way to your lap. The shelf also tilts forward as much as you like and locks in position so you really have a totally comfortable mousing and typing position. No more trying to raise your chair up to 8 feet to reach the keyboard comfortably. The keyboard and mouse are held on when the keyboard is tilted by a comfy gel wrist rest that has adheisive on the back and is placed at the edge of the shelf. Ditto the super-slick 3M mousepad, also with adheisive, both included. The box makes for great storage when the keyboard is out. I really have loved my adjustable keyboards - for the price, these are the BEST and really cheap if you want some ergonomic relief. I thought they were really pricy until I tried them. Love it!
