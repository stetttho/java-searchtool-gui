 This is my favorite book in the "Quick Start" series; as a novice typesetter and Adobe products users, I have them all. This is written in plain, everyday English, not tech-talk and begins at the beginning of the layout process with getting your first page formatted with margins and other variables. It also includes a quick start for Pagemaker and Quark users who might be more familiar with page layout programs. Numerous illustrations on each page help one figure out, among other things, what the buttons look like and what a baseline guide is. While InDesign borrows much from Pagemaker, Photoshop and Illustrator, it combines them into one program so one doesn't have to switch from one program to another to perform a task. This is my choice for InDesign books, although as the program matures, many others will surely follow. If you buy only one book about InDesign, buy this one. Aside from its' usefulness, it is an outstanding value, too!
