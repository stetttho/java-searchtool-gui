 What a great gadget! It is so tiny, about 2/3 a stick of gum long. But what a worker. I use 4 Macs - 2 run OS9 and 2 run OSX and it worked great on all of them. I just took it out of the little package, plugged it in to my USB port, booted the computer and there it was on my desktop as "Kingston." Drag your file to it and as the little drive transfers it, a little green light on the side of the drive will blink until everything is downloaded. Just unplug it from the USB and plug it in where you want it and bada-boom, bada-bing. I keep losing the cap, which secures very tightly to the body of the drive and pulls off. The important thing about this, compatability issues aside, is the fact that this thing is FAST! It transfers substantial files very quickly! Love it.
