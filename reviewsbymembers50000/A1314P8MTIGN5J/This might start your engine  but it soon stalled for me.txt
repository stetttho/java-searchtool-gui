 This is a very, very cusory overview of a very complex program. I am an intermediate user and found that I knew most of what is in the book. That really bucked my ego up, but as a lover of Pagemaker, I advise that you do additional research, reading and invest in a thorough guide like a "Bible" if you really want to take advantage of all the features of Pagemaker after this book gets you up and running. On the down side, it is a little disorganize and confusing in the way it moves from subject to subject; this book does not even tell one how to use the "Crop Tool," which shouldn't be something just for intermediate and advanced users. Still, for the money, it is an excellent guide and will do what it says. Don't be afraid to use Pagemaker, it is the only way you'll learn. Sit with this book and it will get you started in fine fashion, but there is much, much more to Pagemaker that you might want to know.
