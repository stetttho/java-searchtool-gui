 Having never owned a computer before, I bought every book I could find about iMacs and Macs in general. What a waste of money! Robin Williams' book is the only one I or anyone needs! It not only is comprehensive, but  is easy to understand and to use. I particularly enjoy the way she uses  real- world analogies to explain what a hard disk is or what memory is. I  really believe that Apple should endorse this as the "Official Apple  Handbook," enclose it with every iMac they sell and give everybody a  big break, after all, Jeff Goldblum's charisma and Steve Jobs' Nehru jacket  only take you so far. Buy this book before any of the others pretending to  teach you iMac or Mac. PS: I got a strawberry.
