 This is really an encouraging book for those of us who took one look at Photoshop 5 or 5.5 and threw up our hands in despair. It begins at the very, rankist beginning (where I was!) and progresses simply, logically and  humorously. There are ample and helpful illustrations. The book is very  simple for newbees, who don't know anything about Photoshop. Its  explanations are worded in plain English and any tech-talk is interpreted  into English. In my copy, there is an addendum for the 5.5 upgrade. This  book, and only this book, got me started and has kept me going in  Photoshop, finally, and I love it and use it almost daily. It is really  worth a lot more than its measly price.
