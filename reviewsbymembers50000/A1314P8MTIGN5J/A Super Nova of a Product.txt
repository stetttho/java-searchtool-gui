 After struggling with an on-line clip art service and it's down-times vaguaries, I purchased the Art Explosion 750,000. I have never used clip art from CDs, but this was super easy to get the hang of. Stick in the CD,  click on it, pick a category, then browse, drag clip to Photoshop icon or  download to disc and voila! I have an iMac and a G4 and the clips really  fly by. The selection is fabulous-from retro to abstract and and they  always print out true-to-color, high resolution and non-jaggy. A bonus is  the inclusion 2 gigantic books of the images, alphabets, photos and fonts  so that you can get the general idea of what your're after. Also included:  a collection of fonts from Agfa and Bitstream as well as an extensive photo  collection, raster art collection and alphabets and backgrounds. It is so  much bigger (48CDs), faster and more convenient than I ever envisioned, I'm  sorry that I didn't get it sooner. Really a help in my hectic typesetting  business!
