 This is the best yet book in this series. It is arranged logically and begins at the beginning in simple English and takes one through the program step by step, each step building on the one before it and adding to your proficiency level. I have sat with this book and followed it exactly and I think that it has been excellent in getting me started. Now I actually know enough to ask questions and look things up in the index! It truly is an easily understood book and very comprehensive and if you have any prior experience with Quark or Pagemaker, it will be a breeze to get up and running with InDesign. This book is an excellent value and the one you should really buy first. I doubt you'll need any of the others after reading this one.
