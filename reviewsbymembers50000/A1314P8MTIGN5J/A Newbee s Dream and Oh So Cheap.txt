 This is the Most Excellent Book that I have found to guide me through the intricacies of Illustrator. It is written in simple, understandable lingo and accompanied by illustrations of your desktop and tools and what they  should look like when you perform a procedure. There are also comprehensive  illustrations depicting, step by step, how-tos. Steps follow logically with  a great textual and pictorial intro to the basics, then into other areas  such as how to create and alter type to create a logo. Excellent and easy  to read and grasp at such an unbelievably LOW price, this is The  Illustrator Book To Buy, and believe me, I have them all!
