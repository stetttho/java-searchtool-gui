 I love this genre, police procedurals, but have never read this author's work and thought this would be a great one to start on. Instead, I struggled with maintaining any interest in the characters, who I found to be unsympathetic, one-dimensionally drawn and therefore, boring! I also found the storyline to be a tired and very contrived old one. I woun't give you a synopsis; others will do that, I'm sure. I found the protagonist, a police detective, to be duly angst-ridden, but underneath the steely exterior, there is usually some redeeming feature that makes us interested in them and even like them. Moreover, I could not like or even maintain my interest in any of the stereotypical main characters: the detective with a tragic past, his superior, whose problem seemed to be infidelity, the spunky troublemaking, female pathologist and the jaded old cop, smoking like a facory and demoted for having sex with a female prostitute as part of a payoff in a payola scam. If you like this genre, read the masters: Peter Robinson, Ian Rankin, Robert Wilson, Reginald Hill, James Hime, Kirino's great "Out," a Japanese procedural that is UNBELIEVABLE!, and David Baldacci. I bought 2 of this series and will try the other to see if this was just a momentary glitch.
