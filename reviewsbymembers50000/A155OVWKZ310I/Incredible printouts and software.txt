 This is the best inkjet printer I've ever owned.  The printoutsare great.  Anyone who's shopping around needs to see the ouput thisprinter can generate.  Plus this inkjet is much more quiet than anyI've heard.  No more clanking, crunching noises; just a medium-pitchedhum. And as a surprizing bonus, it comes with wonderfulsoftware. PhotoImpression 2000 is quite an exceptional image editor.It's user interface is modern and sleek; it takes some getting use tothough.  PhotoMontage 2000 has a similar design, but it's very simpleto use.  Just select a picture and go.  And you watch the image getconverted to an amazing montage (mosaic of small pictures) with thephoto library included or your own images. The only minor downsideto the printer is its appearance.  It's not as radical as I thought itwould be.  It still has a beige body with only the lid beingtransparent.  But who cares, anyway?  It's quiet, fast, has impressiveoutput, and fantastic software.  It's easily a top-notch product....
