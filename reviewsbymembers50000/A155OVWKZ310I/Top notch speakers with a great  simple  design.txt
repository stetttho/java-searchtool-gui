 All companies need to take note of this "simple" pair of speakers.  The speakers get the job done extremely well.  And it doesn't use a bulky, box-like AC adapter; its internal power supply fixes that problem.  Also, the speakers don't have a subwoofer.  I know, I know, some people prefer a subwoofer and I used to have one myself.  Still I can't tell the difference; this speakers sound exceptional without one. Plus it has microphone and headphone ports, so after you hook up these speakers the ports become incredibly accessible!  I definitely recommend these speakers for anyone. And I think this pair is essential for computers with internal speakers.  There nothing like having a volume control knob (especially when the alternatives are annoying sound control slider bars or keys).
