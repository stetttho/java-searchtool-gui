 It's a shame they don't show pictures of the inside of this bag.  The top opens up and then the front zips down to reveal 3 mesh pockets meant for flashcards, floppy disks, and cables.  Actually, I use mine for a camera/binocular set I was given.  The point-and-shoot camera and compact binoculars fit in the main compartment easily together with the divider.  The mesh pockets don't hold bulky items, but it's good enough for a roll of file and a simple camera cleaning kit.  So I have the basics ready for travel in one small bag. I even bought another one for a personal 2" TV.  The TV and its AC adapter are in the main compartment with a small pair of headphones in the front.  I initially wanted to get this bag for my digital camera and accessories.  But with a camera, battery charger, AC adapter, and three cables, it was just too much to fit inside this bag; I got a small camcorder bag instead. So this camera bag is great, but don't expect the pockets up front to hold much.
