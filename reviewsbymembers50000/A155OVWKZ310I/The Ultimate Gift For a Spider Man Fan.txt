 This is a must-have for any Spider-Man fan.  First off, the book is a  beautiful hardcover reprint of the first comic book ever of Spider-Man.  A  great short story of how our hero, a nerdy teenager named Peter Parker,  gains his powers and deals with his new-found responsibility. Then  there's also an audio CD included that has Stan Lee (the creator) doing a  reading of the book and he talks about the his start as a comic book writer  and the ideas behind the Spider-Man character.  The background information  is interesting and the reading is very fun and cute with Stan changing his  voice to match the different characters' lines. All this and you get a  wonderful gold plated "class" ring with the classic Spider-Man  logo on the face and Stan Lee and Spider-Man's head busts on both  sides. And everything is packaged in a red box with a certificate of  authenticity, because this collector's edition is limited to only 2500  copies.  So don't wait too long for your copy! This is definitely for the  adult who loves Spider-Man and is a kid at heart.
