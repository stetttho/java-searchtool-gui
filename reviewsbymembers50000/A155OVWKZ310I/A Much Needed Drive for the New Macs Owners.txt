 Why don't new Macs have a disk drive?  I don't know.  But since they don't, this is an essential buy.  I have it hooked up to an iMac and it has worked without fail for me.  However, I have only used floppies and flashcards with it.  So I don't know if it has trouble with smartmedia cards. Anyway, this drive's design is great.  It takes up very little space and matches perfectly with graphite iMacs/Macs.  And it's USB powered, so there's no worry of an extra plug.  The only negative is its somewhat high price.
