 This graphic novel reprints the amazing epic comics written by Mark Gruenwald.  The `Squadron Supreme' was a group of unknown heroes I've never heard of before this book.  But it made the reading even more exciting by  figuring out who everyone is, what they think, and how they get along with  each other. The members of the `Squadron Supreme' decide to create a  utopia for mankind.  This idea slowly divides the team against each other.   At first they do good by getting food for the hungry and finding job  opportunities for the out-of-work.  However their deeds become more and  more controversial, albeit well-meaning, such as banning guns and criminal  reform via mind altering. The story progresses to a final deadly  conflict.  In the end you question to what limit your own morals extend.   ...  This is highly recommended for comic book fans.  A must-read for those  who enjoyed `Marvels' and `Kingdom Come'.
