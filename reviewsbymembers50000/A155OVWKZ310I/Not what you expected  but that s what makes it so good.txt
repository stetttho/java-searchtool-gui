 'Hannibal' fleshes out the main characters better than any of the other novels.  Clarice's true character is finally fully revealed; just like the metamorphosis of Lecter from 'Red Dragon' to 'Silence of the Lambs'.  Some  people may disagree with Clarice's transformation, but I couldn't image it  written better.  Lecter himself is also fully realized as you see into his  past and possible motives. The only misses by the author would have to be  the real villians of the novel, Mason Verger and his cronies.  Their  exploits dragged an otherwise very impressive book down.
