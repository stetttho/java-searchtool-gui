 At first sight, this appears to be an engrossing true-crime narrative.  But it soon becomes evident that the real agenda of the authors is to use the crime case as an excuse for attacking the Mormon church.  All of the Mormon leaders are presented as scoundrels and all of the followers are presented as fools.  In short, Mormonism is demonized.  The book is full of cheap shots.  No stone is left unturned in the authors' quest to ridicule Mormonism.  This is out of place in a true-crime book and hopelessly detracts and distracts from the narrative.  We are expected to believe that two-thirds of the inhabitants of an American state are scoundrels and fools.  Nonsense!
