 The author's name is Bernardine Kielty Scherman.  This is part of a series of books for teenagers about world history (World Landmark books) in the 1950's.  I read it with avidity when I was 14 years old, and I developed a passion for Byzantine history which never left me.  It was only years later that I discovered that the entire text was borrowed from Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.
