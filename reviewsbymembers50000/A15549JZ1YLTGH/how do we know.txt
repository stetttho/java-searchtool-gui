 Although an excellent study if all of this is true, it remains to be seen whether it is in fact true.  Herdt admits that the name of the Sambia is a fake name that he gave them to protect their identity.  There is therefore no way for other researchers to study this tribe and compare notes.  How do we know that this tribe exists at all?  All of the other studies of homosexual customs among New Guinea tribesman describe sodomy as their exclusive mode of behaviour.  The Sambia are the one and only tribe of this region to practice fellatio.  Why is this tribe out of sync with all of the other tribes?  It makes me wonder.
