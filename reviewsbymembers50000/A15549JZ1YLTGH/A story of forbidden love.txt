 I am the translator of this Danish novel.  The translation came out in 1989 in Amsterdam and is also out of print.  It is the story of a forbidden love affair between a male teacher aged 28 and a male student aged 14.  Considering the nature of the relationship and the fact that the teacher was messed up (a self portrait of the author), it is a wonder that the relationship continued into the adulthood of the boy.  It is very well written and convincing.  As the book says, the relationship could have ended in disaster but ended in love.  It had a sequel which I translated, but the translation never appeared.
