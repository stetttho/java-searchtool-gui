 This biography might have been wonderful to me if it had not been spoiled by the author's foolish attempts to cast doubt on Michelangelo's homosexuality.  This puts Beck into the same category with Irving Stone and  Charlton Heston in The Agony and the Ecstasy.  On the verge of the 21st  Century to get yet another book denying that there were any great gay men  in history is simply not acceptable.
