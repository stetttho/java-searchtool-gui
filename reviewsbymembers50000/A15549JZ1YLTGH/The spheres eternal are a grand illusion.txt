 I read this masterpiece years ago and was quite blown away by it.  I have had plenty of time to recover from the overwhelming mood and philosophy of it.  I do not feel that life is as the poet portrays it, but he lived a tragic life which included the death of the woman he loved ("the lady of the images"), and there was no way that he was going to see life differently.  I recommend this poem to all poetry lovers, regardless of their attitude about life, simply because it is wonderfully written.
