 I reviewed this awful book when it first came out, and I am glad that it is out of print.  I am not going to waste time repeating my lengthy original review.  Let me just say that it was the worst rubbish ever.  The author is a homosexual Marxist who thinks that homosexuality is not out of sync with Marxism, even though there is tons of evidence to the contrary.  Worse yet, the author is, um, eccentric in many of his attitudes and opinions (I am being polite; I wasn't polite in my original review).  Fernbach believes, for example, that communist revolutions have already taken place on other planets.  Fernbach belongs to the category of people like Judy Grahn and Andrea Dworkin, in more ways than one.   His theory that homosexuality can be somehow combined with communism to improve the human race is such a hoot.  He himself is a living example of the failure of human evolution along such lines.  I rated this piece of garbage with one star only because I could not rate it with none.
