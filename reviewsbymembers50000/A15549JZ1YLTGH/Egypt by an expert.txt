 This historical novel is about the Roman emperor Hadrian's visit to Egypt with his favorite Antinous.  There is a lot about the early Christians in it.  The homosexual nature of the relationship between Hadrian and Antinous is just barely hinted at.  This book was written in Germany in the 1880's by an Egyptologist who also wrote other historical novels about Egypt.
