 This used to be considered a classic, but it has sadly faded with time in the face of the loss of innocence.  To those who love calmness and virtue, it has its charms.  To those who love excitement and sin, it has nothing to say.  The climax, where Virginia allows herself to drown rather than get into a lifeboat in a storm because she is in her underwear and is too modest to let the sailors see her thus, is an absurdity to all but the most fanatical devotees of modesty.  And it is precisely this climax and its absurdity that have destroyed this book.
