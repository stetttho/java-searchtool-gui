 I began to have severe agoraphobia in 1974, but I had no clue as to what was happening to me until, by sheer accident, I came across this book.  I believe that it was the only book on the subject at that time.  I discovered what the name and nature of my disorder was, and that there were a lot of people who had the same problem.  Unfortunately, I gave up the struggle in 1975 and did nothing about it until 1992.  From then on, I slowly managed to desensitize myself to the world outside of my neighborhood.  I can now make trips of hundreds of miles without a reaction.  It is my own fault for not trying harder or sooner.  This book could have saved me twenty years of suffering if I had only had the guts to try it out.  And yes, it does take guts -- a lot of guts and a lot of faith in God.
