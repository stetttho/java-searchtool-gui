 This book was written by a mixed-up woman who had nothing less than four failed relationships with men and blamed her church for the failures.  She spent time in a lunatic asylum where she danced with a woman who imaginged herself to be a horse.  She was for a long time a darling of the liberal, anti-Mormon set, but eventually killed herself.  The dogs bark, but the caravan moves on.
