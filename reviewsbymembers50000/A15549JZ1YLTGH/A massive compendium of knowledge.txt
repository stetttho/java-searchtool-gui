 This is a behemoth of a book, very big and very expensive.  The average reader will have to get a copy through inter-library loan.  This is the first translation into English of a book published around the time of the First World War.  It contains an enormous amount of information about homosexuality in past ages and in the world of that period when it was published.  It unfortunately was based on the outdated theory of the third sex, in which "real" homosexuals are assumed to fit the fairy stereotype.  But one can look past this nonsense to the facts stored in this massive compendium of knowledge.  The list of famous homosexuals seems to me to contain a number of dubious entries based on flimsy evidence, and there is only the list of names without any details or explanation.  But this is a small part of the book, and any student of this subject cannot do without this work.
