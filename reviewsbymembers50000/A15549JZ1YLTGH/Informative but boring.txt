 This book contains a lot of information about Lisbon, both as a city to be visited and as a city which has inspired novels, films, etc., and the educated tourist can find this book very useful.  Unfortunately, I found the book boring.  Somehow, I failed to relate to it.  Maybe if I had heard of Tabucci and these other cultural figures, I might have gotten something more out of it.  I visited Lisbon in 1966 and enjoyed it, and I am fluent in Portuguese, so the problem is hardly Lisbon.  But the book just seemed to me to never get off the ground.
