 This book appeared just two years before homosexuality was removed from the official list of mental disorders.  It was written by a psychotherapist from the old point of view, the view of homosexuality as a disease.  Every chapter, almost every page, of this lengthy book drips with hostility to homosexuals.  It became outdated almost as soon as it was published.  Not recommended except to those who hate homosexuals.
