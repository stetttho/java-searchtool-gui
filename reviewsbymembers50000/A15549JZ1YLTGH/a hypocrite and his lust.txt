 This is about a hypocritical Christian monk who lives in late ancient Egypt, and who finally is overwhelmed by his lust for the title character.  Massenet made an opera out of this novel.  It is intended as an attack on Christianity, but if one can look at the monk as an individual and not as a representative of Christianity, even Christian readers can appreciate this study of human weakness.
