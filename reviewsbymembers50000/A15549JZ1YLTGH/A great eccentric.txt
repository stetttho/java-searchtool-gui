 Donald Weeks died late in 2003 but wasn't buried until several months later.  He was an American artist who developed a passion for the life and works of the eccentric and paranoid Baron Corvo.  Several biographies of Corvo have been published, but this is the only one by the man who cornered the market, so to speak, on collecting material about Corvo.  Weeks may have been kind in describing Corvo's moral behavior, but this is better than fuming over it.  Yes, Corvo was a rascal, but his strange life and personality deserve an objective study.
