 I read a paperback edition of this book when I was around 14 and lapped it up.  It presents a harsh, no-nonsense world in which the strong survive and the weak perish.  It is as if Lamb had just read Ragnar Redbeard's Might Is Right before he sat down to write this.  The reader is swept away with the true story of the invincible and ruthless Mongol conqueror and his hoards.  The exact historical facts are not so important as the mood of the book.
