 This is unfortunately one of the few books on the subject in English, as it is a dreadful hatchet job, a venomous, mean-spirited attack on Vittorio Emmanuele III and the other members of the Italian royal family.  The author stoops so low that he might as well crawl.  It is out of print, but copies linger in libraries, ready to poison the minds of the unwary.
