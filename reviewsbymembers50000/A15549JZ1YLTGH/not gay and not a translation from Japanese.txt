 Mathers translated these tales, not from Japanese, but from the French translation of Mardrus, and they appeared originally in a three-volume collection called Eastern Love (1930).  Hency this is more correctly called the Mardrus-Mathers translation.  Mathers never used the word "gay", this is anachronistic and it is the publisher who created the title.  The men and boys of old Japan who had love affairs were not gay, not queer, but pederastic or pedophile.  This was a whole different situation from modern Japan.  It had more in common with ancient Greece.  They moved in a world that had nothing in common with the modern world, their values were entirely different.
