 This is a long-hidden collection of letters written by Baron Corvo to a potential customer of some Venetian boys in their early teens a century ago.  The letters were known about but did not appear until a trio of slim books by Corvo were finally published many years after his death.  The letters may be part fantasy, but they are our only glimpse into the world of young male prostitution in Venice prior to the First World War.  They also provide a valuable look at the life and personality of one of the great eccentrics.  And I might add that this would be a good book to read in conjunction with Mann's Death in Venice.
