 After Reich came to national attention with his best-selling Greening of America, he made a fool of himself by writing this revealing autobiography, in which he comes across (to me, at least) as a jerk.  This is particularly evident in the section in which he describes how he was totally unaware that he was gay well into his adulthood, and that it was necessary for his students to point this out to him.  Duhhh, well, gee, whaddaya know?  So he went out and picked up a teenage hustler and thanked the boy for making a difference in his life.  Sheesh.
