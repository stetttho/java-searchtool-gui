 I lived in Morocco for 18 months in 1966-67.  This novel takes place in Morocco in 1971.  Symons worked on it for 15 years, and it was published in 1986.  Symons has been called the enfant terrible of Canadian literature.  I noticed that none of his books has been reviewed on this website, and almost all of them are out of print.  This novel is probably his best work, and it shows how he got his reputation.  He knows how to write and the novel is lively and entertaining, but it is also offensive.  It is not the Morocco that I was familiar with.  It is a sex tourist fantasy in which Morocco is supposedly crawling with youths, always black ones, who are sexually available to frustrated tourists who need to be taught how to lose their inhibitions.  In other words, it is about exploitation.  I, for one, soon tired of the endless explicit descriptions of bodies and sex acts.  The author's fixation on the male organ amounts to a monomania.  I am no prude, but I was disgusted.
