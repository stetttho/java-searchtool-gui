 This was a boy's book written in the 1950s.  I read it around the age of 14 and was fascinated by it.  It is somewhat simplified and leaves out some of the nasty aspects of life in the Legion, but that is to be expected.  Of course it ends with the 1950s and the reader gets no further information, but it is still a good read for boys.
