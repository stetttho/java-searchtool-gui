 This book is worth reading as an example of the local color school of literature of the late 19th century.  It consists of a novelette, Madame Delphine, and some short stories and sketches.  The problem is that the dialogue is written in dialect as thick as gumbo.  Outsiders can hardly understand it unless they speak it aloud.
