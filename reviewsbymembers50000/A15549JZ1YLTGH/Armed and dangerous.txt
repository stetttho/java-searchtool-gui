 This novel reminds me of Kevin Esser's Dance of the Warriors and of the Venezuelan movie Sicario.  They all deal with worlds in which gangs of teenagers are engaged in violence and sex.  This is the best of the three.  It is disturbing and is not for the conventional, and certainly not for the bleeding-heart types who want the United Nations to abolish the use of boys in war.  Only Burroughs could have written it.  The style is as unconventional as the theme.  This is a world in which morality does not exist.
