 It seems to me that the whole point of this book is to suggest that all of the familiar aspects of Christian doctrine, such as the immaculate conception, were somehow borrowed from other religions, and that nothing in Christianity is unique or original, thus implying that Christianity is false.  But even if one does not agree with this, one can still enjoy this book as finely written.
