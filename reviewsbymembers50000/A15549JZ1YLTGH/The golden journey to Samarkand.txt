 Flecker was a British poet who died young but still managed to produce a brilliant collection of poems which are almost totally unknown among Americans.  He is one of my favorite poets.  He was a friend of Lawrence of Arabia and it is with Arabia that he is identified -- not the real Arabia, but a fantasy Arabia that was the locale of a play called Hassan, which was produced with music by Delius.  At his best he is wonderful -- "the dragon-green, the luminous, the dark, the serpent-haunted sea"!  One of his finest achievements was to write two poems, "Pillage" and "The War-song of the Saracens", which present the same situation from the viewpoints of the conquerors and the conquered, both poems being in the same metrical structure, but the first one being languid and the other one energetic.
