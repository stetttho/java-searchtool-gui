 This is the excellent but forgotten biography of an excellent but forgotten Edwardian writer of short stories, essays and poems, who killed himself at age 29.  Middleton is one of my favorite writers, and sometimes a few of his short stories appear in anthologies.  Savage was a friend of his and this is likely to be the only biography ever to be written about him.
