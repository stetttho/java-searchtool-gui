 When this book first appeared, the New York Review of Books issued a long review in which the whole point of the book was dismissed as some sort of wishful thinking on the part of an author with an agenda.  But the evidence is overwhelming that Karlinsky is correct in his opinion, and that Gogol can never be understood except from this standpoint.  Imagine a major reviewing organ dismissing "theories" as to somebody like Wilde, Gide, Verlaine, etc., and one can see the magnitude of the absurdity of the dismissive review.
