 There is a hidden agenda in this book, and anyone who has read Bawer's A Place At The Table will, or should, know that the real point of Bawer's attack on "legalistic" Christianity is to get rid of the rule against homosexuality.  He has to be more inclusive in his attack on these people to disguise the fact that he is (probably) interested only in the gay question.  How many people would buy an attack on "legalistic" Christianity if they realized that the Ten Commandments, which are very legalistic, include laws against murder, adultery, and a number of other things that no decent person wants legitimized?  What if a murderer were to complain about "legalistic" Christianity and its failure to "love" the murderer instead of having a law against murder?  Before you buy into Bawer's talk about getting rid of "legalistic" Christianity and having a vaguely-defined "love" in place of laws, think about living in a society where there are no laws and no police.  Does Bawer also want to get rid of "legalistic" governments because they have laws against homosexuality?  And how would you have a government that isn't legalistic?
