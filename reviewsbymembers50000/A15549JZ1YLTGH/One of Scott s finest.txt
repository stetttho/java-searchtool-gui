 I read this novel forty years ago in the Modern Library edition and I am amazed that it is out of print except in expensive library editions.  It is one of Scott's finest novels, full of action and with a fine portrait of King Louis.  It was the first novel to use a gypsy as a character.  It was made into a movie in the 1950's.  Scott of one of the most neglected geniuses in literature and the world is the poorer for it.
