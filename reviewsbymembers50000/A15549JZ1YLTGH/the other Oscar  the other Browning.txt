 This is a fine biography, almost the only one, of a Victorian eccentric who was once quite famous.  Baronet Anstruther of that ilk, a Scot who has written other books about the Victorians, has waded through a mountain, nay, an Everest of correspondence in search of the truth.  This is a balanced biography which touches upon all sides of Browning's life, which normally is a good thing, but one could wish that Anstruther, who is likely to be the only person to wade through the archive, could have enlarged the book by fifty or a hundred pages and devoted much more space to the details of Browning's interest in boys.  In the long run, Browning will be remembered only as a pederast, an example of how such things were done in those days, and therefore the author should have recognized this and played it up.  But what he does say is quite interesting.
