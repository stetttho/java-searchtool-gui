 Ludwig was a popular biographer of some decades ago.  The scholar need not bother with his works.  Cleopatra's breasts are mentioned on the first page.  This is typical of the level on which Ludwig deals with his subject.  This is, in a way, an historical novel.  Ludwig invents things, as for example, he says that all four of the children of Cleopatra's father were clever and bright.  There is no proof of this, this is just off the top of Ludwig's head.  It sounds interesting, so he puts it in.  And so forth.
