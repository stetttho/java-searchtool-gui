 I read this wonderful story a few years after it was originally published, when I was eleven years old.  I liked it so much that I read it again when I was twelve, and again at thirteen.  I went on to read several other stories by the same author, but they have gone out of print, and only this story has lived.  It is a masterpiece that (as nobody seems to have noticed in their reviews) is based on Jules Verne's Five Weeks in a Balloon.  I strongly recommend this story for all kids who love adventure and Verne's brand of science fiction.  The illustrations are great.
