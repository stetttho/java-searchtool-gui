 Edgar Saltus was a minor but interesting writer of a century ago.  The whole point of this book, one of his best, is that what is believed about the Christian/Jewish deity is similar to what has been believed about deities of other religions, the implication being, I suppose, that there is nothing unique about Christianity, and that it is derived from these other religions.  One could just as easily reverse this theory and say that the other religions derive from the Bible.
