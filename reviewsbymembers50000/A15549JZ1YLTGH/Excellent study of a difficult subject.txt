 This splendid book appeared in 1970, when certain forms of behavior were still legal, and not nearly so much the object of hysteria as they are nowadays.  If this book were to appear for the first time today, it would be hooted down and angry letters would be sent to the publisher, demanding that it be withdrawn.  The author would receive death threats.  Such is the course of social evolution.  I would say that Smith's knowledge of the subject is wonderful and his handling of it is perfect.  The only fault, a minor one, is that he mistakenly thought that Cuthbert Wright was British and included him; Wright was in fact an American and is out of place here.
