 This is not really a novel, it is a collection of short stories held together by a frame-tale.  I suspect that Jack London had written these stories over a period of time, and decided to put them together in this fashion in hopes of making them into a novel.  But one can still read each story by itself.  The themes and backgrounds of the various stories differ greatly, also a few are rather dull, while others are interesting.  All in all, a great work and one of London's finest.
