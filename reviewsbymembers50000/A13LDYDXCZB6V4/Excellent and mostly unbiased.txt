 This is a great book. It's honest, and I like that. It's really interesting how unnecessary most vaccines are and how terrified the media and corporate drug companies like to keep us parents for their own gain. My husband and I have chosen not to vaccinate our son anymore than he has now that we have been able to make a completely informed choice about vaccinations.
