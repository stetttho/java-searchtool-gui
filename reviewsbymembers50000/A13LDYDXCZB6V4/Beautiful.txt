 This book is just so cute. It's an affirmation that a child and his or her papa can make over and over again attesting to the warmth, love and protection that only a father can give to his child. Goes very well with it's partner book, Mama, Mama. The refs to Attachment Parenting are obvious and I highly recommend this book to anyone who parents by instinct.
