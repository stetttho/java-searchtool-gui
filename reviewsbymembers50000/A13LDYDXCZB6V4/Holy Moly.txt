 This is ONLY my opinion, I'm not trying to sell the album or become chummy with anyone.   This album SO rocks! Beck has outdone himself with all the different funky beats, blues-y rhythm and vocals.   If you're not a Beck fan, this CD will definitely help you along to the path of enlightenment! =)
