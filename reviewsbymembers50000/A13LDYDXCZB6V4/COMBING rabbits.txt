 How many people would it take and how many HOURS would it take to comb millions of rabbits for their hair? This may be something that a "fancier" would do for their friends and/or family (oddly enough), but it is a mistake to believe that the rabbits are simply combed for their fur. There sure are a lot of furs around for such a time consuming project, indeed!  The idyllic picture that has been painted of a loving human combing the hair gently out of a rabbit for no other reason but that it will be used for a piece of clothing is just naive.   I wonder.. what do you suppose happens to all the millions of rabbits after they are no longer "needed"?
