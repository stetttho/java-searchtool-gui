 My 21 month old really likes this toy. It's simple, just right for his age. It's also very durable and has so far stood up to quite a bit of tossing around.  When you get correct answers after it asks you questions, it gets a bit more complex each time. I really like that because it can grow with my son as his intelligence increases.
