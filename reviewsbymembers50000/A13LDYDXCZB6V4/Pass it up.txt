 I thought this would be a great can opener. Not so. It works with extra tall cans, and that's about it. Don't even think about trying to open small cans, such as a 6 oz. or so. It just will not work. This can opener does indeed shred labels and is most difficult to line up with the place where it's supposed to lock on to the lid. Since I bought this can opener, it has taken me an average of about three attempts to open any given can.  In short, I'm taking this thing back. My manual can opener works better than this!
