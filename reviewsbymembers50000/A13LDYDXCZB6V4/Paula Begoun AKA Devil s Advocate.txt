 There's already about 200+ reviews on *what* is inside this book, so I'm going to give my opinion and my opinion only. First, I like the fact that Ms. Begoun is against animal testing. The thing I didn't like is that she didn't even really seem to like the products that she gave a 'smiley' and a 'checkmark' for. There's those two icons for each product that Ms. Begoun liked a lot, but after the product listed she would usually have some mediocre review about and/or saying "it's as good as anything out there".  So, I was left wondering what exactly was the best. In the back of the book there's about three pages of "what's best".. I did like that a lot.
