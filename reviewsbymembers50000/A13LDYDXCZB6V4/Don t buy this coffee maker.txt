 When I first saw this maker I was intrigued by it's sleek Euro-cool style. I was slightly dismayed by the fact that there is no timer, clock, or auto shutoff; however, those were properties I knew going in didn't exist.   After I started using the Villaware, I liked it ok. It made coffee in a standard way, no better or worse than any other pot I've used in the past.   I had it for six months and then the spring broke that lets you use the 'sneak-a-cup' feature. This is after completely normal use. Not too long after that, the pot's burner plate has burned itself off and it leaks from underneath.   This is the worst coffee maker I have ever used. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up. As for me, I'm going back to my handy standby--the Black and Decker SmartBrew Plus. Consumer Reports has this coffee maker listed as  'CR Best Buy', and I've never had a problem with it.
