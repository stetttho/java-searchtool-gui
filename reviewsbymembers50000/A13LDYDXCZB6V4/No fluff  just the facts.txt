 I'm very surprised that this was an open-an-shut case of suicide. After reading both sides of this story, I feel I am able to make a pretty objective opinion about this whole thing; Kurt was murdered. You can't explain away the facts in this case. The case needs to be reopened and thoroughly examined by the PROPER authorities. This book was written in an objective manner, that's why I highly recommend it. I've read it more than once; I find it highly intriguing.
