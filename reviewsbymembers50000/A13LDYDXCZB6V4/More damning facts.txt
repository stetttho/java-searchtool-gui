 Once I picked up this book I had a very difficult time putting it down. The authors are excellent in that they present the facts in a truly neutral way. I didn't feel like anyone was trying to twist my  brain into believing some weird conspiracy theory. I'm still left wondering if Kurt was murdered or if he killed himself. What I am adamant about is that the investigation NEEDS to be reopened and looked at. There are way too many strange events and unanswered questions looming around for the case to just be written off. The people who don't want to believe anything written in this book (or don't want to peek!) are simply dealing with one hardcore case of denial! If you call yourself a fan of Kurt Cobain, you must read this book, along with "Who Killed Kurt Cobain".
