 This movie is extra long, but I didn't really notice. The extra intensity of this movie keeps you wondering what will happen all the way to the very end. I learned about corporate misdeeds and also about the terrible poisons that nicotine holds. This is one of the best "whistleblower" movies I have ever had the pleasure of encountering. Al Pacino was his usual awesome self, but Russell Crowe REALLY gets the award. The acting job he did was stupendous! I was truly amazed at the way this man morphed into his character, he even had some odd tics that could only come from this character's stress level & personality type.
