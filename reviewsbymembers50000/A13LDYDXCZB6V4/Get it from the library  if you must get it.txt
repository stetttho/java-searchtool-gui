 I borrowed this book from the library expecting a lot more. Too much more, maybe. It reads like one of those meditation-a-day style books with a meditation (dumb label) on each page and really isn't very funny. Sure, there were a few good cracks on really dumb labels, but for the mostpart I felt that the authors were far reaching into labels that had every right to be attached to the particular product. I found myself thinking.. "What's wrong with that?" and "I understand why they have that label there".  Who knows.. maybe I've become immune to labels in a country where everyone is suing everyone else!
