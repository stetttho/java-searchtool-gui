 This book is a tool for myth shattering. When I first started reading it, I was gripped with suspense, especially because it's fact, not fiction. The real reasons behind the ALF are outlined in this book.. and the fact that the ALF does not condone violence, but liberation of non-human animals.  People may label the ALF as "terrorists", but the real terrorists are outlined in this book: vivisectionists breaking every law ever written on humane treatment, factory farms and their intense suffering (and more law breaking inhumanities), even government experiments and the conflict of interest surrounding them.  A definite must-read!!
