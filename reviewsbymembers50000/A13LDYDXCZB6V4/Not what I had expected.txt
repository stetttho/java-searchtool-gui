 We bought this for our baby when he was about 5 months old. He is now 14 months old and has never kicked the piano in his crib, nor paid much attention to it otherwise. He likes to touch the lights and tries to get into it and see what's behind it, and that rather takes away from the buttons he's supposed to push to make the sounds. This toy was too expensive for my son to be so disinterested. Maybe he'll grow into it, but so far, he hasn't.
