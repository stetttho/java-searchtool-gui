 Well, Courtney does it again. To be honest with you I cannot read this book. I picked it up off the shelf and saw that it had the actual journal papers in it. I am someone who journals and I know how it would feel to be violated in this way.. ESPECIALLY since this is nothing more than another of Courtney's ploys to make more money. Can I please puke now? Shame on any of you who are just too damn curious to not read Kurt's private thoughts.
