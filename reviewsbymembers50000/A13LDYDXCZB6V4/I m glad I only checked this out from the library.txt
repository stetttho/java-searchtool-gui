 My husband and I watched this movie and sputtered a few laughs.. this has got to be one of the worst outputs from James Spade, ever! I'm a huge fan of parodies, and this movie tries to poke fun at "trailer trash". I think that they could have done a much better job with the examples, like thrown in Wal-Mart and/or Jerry Springer somewhere.
