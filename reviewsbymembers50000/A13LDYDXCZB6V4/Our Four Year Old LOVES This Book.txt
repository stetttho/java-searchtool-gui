 Very compassionately written, this true story takes the reader (or audience) into a story about a baby chimp named Rickie, who is tragically separated from her mother by a hunter. Rickie is taken to a village to be sold, but a compassionate man (aptly referred to as 'Guardian') takes Rickie home with him and cares for her. When he goes on a business trip, Rickie bonds with Henri the scruffy dog.  I don't want to spoil the ending, so I won't. Our four year old son loves this book, and he doesn't impress easily! He's never had a problem with sitting through it and I never once got the impression that it was over head or too much for him. The books holds much truth, in a manner very appropriate for younger ones.   For myself, I loved the fact that Ms. Goodall refers to Henri and Rickie's "owner" as their Guardian, as it should be.
