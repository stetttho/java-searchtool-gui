 I'd never really thought about getting a scanner, but as time has gone by, I've started to realize some of the possibilities that I've been missing previously. So, I dived in and bought this HP 6300Cse (coincidentally,  the differences between "se" and "xi" versions are a  single software package, so far as I could tell).  I'm really  impressed. Setup was as easy as it could be, especially with the poster  that comes in the box.  Plug USB cable here and here, add power.  Hey  presto.  The software installation is similarly easy, a nice touch being  able to select all the packages you want up front, and then starting each  of their respective setup programs (as necessary).  Don't expect too much  in the way of printed documentation - there isn't any.  You shouldn't need  it though, and the software comes with more than enough documentation  online (in PDF format). The software provided is nothing short of  outstanding.  PhotoDeluxe is very good, very intuitive.  The provided HP  ScanJet Pro software is also excellent (and this is the piece that I find  myself using most).  The OCR software seems to work pretty well - but make  sure you spell-check that document before sending it to your boss, it DOES  get confused sometimes.  (I saw it convert "move" to  "||OVe", which is the worst I've seen, by far). I like the  concept of PageKeeper, but don't use it much.  (The intent is to use it as  a "scanned document manager" - I'm not exactly swimming in paper,  so I don't care too much)  It does its job adequately. Scanning quality  is first rate - printed materials are crystal clear when scanned.  A  printed (magazine) picture will even pick up the CMYK dots.  Wow!   Photographic scan quality is a dream. Overall, simple to setup and use,  excellent bundled software, and brilliant scanning to boot.  You can't go  wrong.
