 Boy was I disappointed.  I was hoping for information on the doing computerized measurements, actually how you do it.  Not at all what this book describes. The first few chapters have some good background  information on general measurement techniques, such as transducers and what  they measure.  Unfortunately it went down from there.  A whole chapter is  devoted to computer selection (a 486 is probably powerful enough!), and of  course this is starting to show its age.   A large portion of the book is  devoted to getting data out of some kind of data-acq board or from products  like Labview (TM, R, (c), whatever), which I wasn't that interested in.   Also included is lots of example code that describes how to get data of the  same products.  A lot of information is also devoted to IEEE-488 bus  (GPIB), which while accurate, is starting to show its age. If you're  looking for a modern book on the subject of computerized measurements, this  probably isn't it, and more importantly, much of the information in here is  now pretty out of date.
