 I stayed out of the whole Sim"What-haven't-we-done" thing for quite a while.  I didn't buy any previous version of SimCity, which may or may not be a bad thing.  SimCity 3000 (3K) I found really enjoyable - for a  while. The graphics are pretty good, the behavioral modelling is  excellent for a game - you really need to pay attention to what you're  doing if you want to be a successful city mayor.  Its all good fun - at  least for the first couple of months. Then it starts to fall apart -  things start to become pretty repetitve after your city has been going for  around 100 years.  The new things to discover dwindle.  Much of your time  is spent repairing things going wrong (sewer lines, power stations, etc  etc).  It does get rather monotonous. The fun is in building the city  (for me anyway).  The maintenance side is tedious to say the least, it  becomes kind of hard to be creative.  You'd have to be a genius to get your  road layout "right" first time out the box - so expect to build a  few cities until you get it right. On the whole, I've got to rate SimCity  3000 a "3-star" - its a lot of fun for a while, but the  excitement starts to disappear after a few rounds.  Its not going to keep  offering something new every time you play (although the scenario may  differ slightly).  It'll be interesting to see what a follow-up offers in  terms of "keep-playing-ness" (if a follow up will ever happen).   Buy it for less than full price, and you shouldn't be too disappointed.
