 This (to me anyway) is one of those things that you never really think about buying.  Then one day, you realize that you have tons of disk space, and documents littered all over the place.  That was my experience, anyhow. So, you go and buy PartitionMagic.  Period.  Don't bother looking  anywhere else, nothing can really touch this.  It makes partitioning as  easy as it can probably be.  I had a drive that was a real mess,  partitioned with Linux, FAT file system, and all over the place.   PartitionMagic cleaned up that drive in minutes. It does take quite a  while for some operations to complete (but we're talking gigabytes of  data), I set it going and went for lunch.   I like the other tools in the  package - BootMagic does its job admirably (and, IMHO, is much better than  LILO), and MagicMover (moves applications/folders across partitions)  appears to do its job adequately - this one really takes a while. There's  nothing out there that can really touch this, and if you have either (a) 1  very large drive, (b) two or more drives or (c) multiple OSs, then this is  for you.
