 Don't expect a textbook on how to develop strategy (although, expect a similar result).  Well thought-out and structured set of readings that provide insight into the process of developing strategy, from SWOT and Rumelt analysis (Conistency, Consonance, Feasibility, Advantage) through organizational structure and Entrepeneurship. However, I found the readings extremely hard work to read.  It may be inexperience, but (especially in the early chapters), the readings simply take a LONG time to do (and I'm not a slow reader).  A nice addition might be a more comprehensive summary of the readings at the start or end of each chapter. Overall, I go with a 3-star, mainly because of the reading difficulty more than the actual content.
