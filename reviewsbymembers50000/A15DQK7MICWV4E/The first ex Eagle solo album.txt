 Bernie Leadon was the most experienced Eagle having been around the scene longer than both Frey and Henley.  He worked extensively with Dillard & Clark, Hearts & Flowers and the Flying Burrito Bros, before joining Linda Ronstadt for the 2nd time as her backing band with Frey, Henley & Meisner.  Although initially being the Band`s spokesman the power struggle that tore the Eagles apart offered up Bernie as the first casualty.   Two years after exiting the Band comes his collaboration with Michael Georgiades, (who?) Don`t be like that as Mikey actually offers some of the best moments on this acoustic dominated and mellow Country Rock offering.  "Callin` for your love" is one such moment.   Leadon does well with "How can you live without love" and most of the rest is cruisy, laid back and enjoyable.  Although the last song I just don`t get "Glass Off" perhaps its an Americanism that didn`t make it to our fair shores, but really I don`t get it.  An album which highlights Leadon`s formidable talent and shows why he no longer could be an Eagle.   Anyway good stuff from an ex-Eagle and we shouldn`t forget Mike`s efforts either.  Probably essential for Eagles fanatics.
