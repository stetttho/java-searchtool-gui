 This album from Poco is as are they all underrated by the great unwashed.  Fabulous songs, harmonies and instrumentation.  Highlights include the emergence of other song writers in the band apart from Richie Furay.  Bad Weather by Paul Cotton is one of their finest ever tracks although Ol` Forgiver is not.  Tim Schmit contributes his first song here with the title track, which is a stilted piece with lovely lyrics.  Two songs on the album which show Poco at their absolute finest are Just for me and you, which is a feel good sing along highlight as is You are the One, (better live on The Forgotten Trail)  An essential album for Poco fans.
