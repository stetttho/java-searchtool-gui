 I guess if you are a Byrds fan, you could feel slightly aggreived at this album and many have been.   For me though this is the Byrds album which most often finds its way onto my Stereo.  Sure, there is all the talk that Crosby and McGuinn both held their better material back for upcoming solo efforts, and that the album is full of cover versions.  Yes, correct, and isn`t that where they cut their teeth? (Remember some guy called Dylan who they covered constantly)  OK so they swapped Bob for Neil`s covers instead.  See the Sky about to Rain and Cowgirl in the Sand are both excellent versions of Young classics, featuring Byrd harmonies.  And not too overproduced either.  Laughing written by Crosby and covered by the Guess Who is also fantastic.  Multiple listening has allowed Gene Clark`s "Full Circle" to become a favourite very similar to his work with Dillard & Clark.  Sweet Mary could have been taken off any previous Byrds album once again featuring the saccharine harmonies.  For Free by Joni Mitchell shows Crosby trying to recreate the success of Woodstock by CSN.  Some of the other songs are light weight but not so bad that the album needed universal contempt hurled at it.   I guess if I`m honest, the album doesn`t quite meet up to some of the other `73 albums of the same genre like Poco, Eagles etc, but its still enjoyable and I for one have no regrets buying it.
