 I bought Wind on the Water and Crosby & Nash as my first purchase which didn`t involve Stills.  My initial reaction to Crosby & Nash was "Wow".  Their voices are as strong as ever, the songs are great augmented by Jeff Pevar and Crosby`s son Raymond and some top notch session guys Kunkel and Sklar, yeah those guys. Who contribute their composing talents.  Overall the impression is of lovely acoustic based, environmental, themed songs, crafted and lovely.  I am really impressed with this album.  I am a great CSN fan and am so pleased with this purchase, and in danger of going over board i know am so pleased for these guys after all they`ve been through in their lives and careers, approx 40 years after they first started recording, they can still thrill me and for that I am genuinely excited by this album.  Oh and its a double for single price.  Yahoo
