 Compared to Henley Frey and Walsh, Schmit is low profile and underrated.  He has a smooth brilliant high singing voice and a lovely turn of phrase in his songs.  He writes songs from personal experience with heart felt emotions.  This album is certainly his finest clearly displaying his extrordinary talents.  He does the acoustic guitar on The Shadow which is a lovely tune with lots of string noise which adds to the ambience.  Every song is You is a driving song in the vein of his Poco Seven efforts.  Schmit covers the Stylistics You are Everything contributing all vocals in a brilliant rendition of a great tune.  These are just some of the highlights.  If you like Poco and the Eagles "Long Run" try this album it has a beauty that Henley rarely achieves and Frey almost never does.  The Eagles long awaited new album hopefully will see Schmit`s talent more to the fore where they belong.
