 The Eagles have their place in Music History (Biggest Selling Album of all time "Their Greatest Hits 1971 - 1975", Rock `n Roll Hall of Fame etc etc)but did you know they acheived all that on the back of only about 60 tunes, not all written by them.  That is probably the most outstanding feat of the Eagles, that so little has created so much.  For me therefore the major aspect of "Hell Freezes Over" is the four new tracks.  I and most Eagles fans worldwide hunger for new material and can`t wait for the new studio album (circa 2004??) In the meantime whe will just be content with the newest Eagles material, new from 1994!   "Get Over It" is Henley all the way lyrically, married to some great Frey rock `n roll licks, the guitar playing is outstanding with all three, Walsh & Felder contributing (at least live) very well.  I always crank this song up.  "Love will keep us alive" is written by Jim Capaldi (ex Traffic)Paul Carrack (ex Roxy Music, XTC & UK Squeeze) and Pete Vale.  Just how Tim Schmit got to sing this one, I`m not to sure and would love to find out if anyone knows.(E:Mail available on my about me page) This is lovely, balladeering, by a champion of the artform and finally gives Tim another song to do live.  "Girl From Yesterday" is pure Nashville all the way and possibly the most countrified song the Eagles ever did, ever!!  Even this song has its merits and I like the lyrics especially.  The last new tune "Learn to be Still" is chock full of Henleyisms and could easily have come from any of his solo albums.  It features strong guitar playing but little of some of the other things that made Eagles music famous like the harmonies and killer choruses.  Anyway regardless of the strengths or weaknesses of these songs its still the Eagles and for this myopic fan is therefore amongst the greatest music ever recorded.
