 For your Pleasure was Roxy Music at their absolute finest.  More polished than their amazing debut, with Eno virtually taking over on side 2 (vinyl) Brilliant lyrically (Beauty Queen, Editions of You) Distincively British countryside on Strictly Confidential, just plain ecstatic on In Every Dream Home a Heartache.  Sure Do the Strand will go down as the hit song off the album and one of Roxy`s finest ever moments, but there are other stunning moments on this album, Beauty Queen which is a love lorn lament, Grey Lagoons where every member of the band gets to solo out in a very 50`s frenzy and The Bogus Man which is bass heavy and bombastic.  Clearly the finest moment is In Every Dream home a Heartache with its false ending and brilliant solo guitar/synth.  Excellent stuff although Eno`s last Roxy moment.
