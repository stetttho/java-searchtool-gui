 Indian Summer starts as beautifully as any Poco Album with the gorgeous, languid Indian Summer (1 of Paul Cotton`s finest moments), thru Twenty Years onto the evocative, Me and You by Tim Schmit which is one of his finest contributions to Poco.  Rusty chimes in with Downfall with soaring harmonies, chiming guitars, driving bass line in a brilliant rendition of Country Rock.  Songs 5 thru 8 include the Autobiographical Living in the Band with its surging melodious rock, then two Schmit songs, Stay and Find out in Time, both up to his usual standard.  The album ends with Rusty`s The Dance which has its moments but sadly descends into a Disco/Funk blend which probably prevents this album from being the best album that Poco did.  This was Schmit`s last outing with Poco before joining the Eagles.  If you can find this then certainly get it.
