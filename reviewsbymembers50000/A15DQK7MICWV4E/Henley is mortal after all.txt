 Don "the voice of the Eagles" Henley.  Love him or hate him Henley does have something to say and his social commentary is usually right on the mark.  This guy has a great voice, he can sing a heartfelt ballad and rock out with the best of them.  Tunes on this album include four sublime efforts, My Thanksgiving, Everything is Different Now, Taking you Home and Goodbye to a River.  Two duds in Genie and Miss Ghost (good guitars) and the rest as good as anything he`s previously done in his solo career.  He does tend to get a bit bogged down in new technology this time out, particularly with drum machines. A pity given the high quality drummers in his working entourage (Lynch, Crago and himself)Other passages of interest include Stevie Wonder on the opening track and two acoustic ballads, For My Wedding sounds deeply personal but is not written by Henley.  Henley fans will love this, it certainly rates right up there with his other solo highlights, I Can`t stand still, Garden of Allah etc.
