 I only ever bought one other album on release date and that was Eagles Long Run just to prove how old I am.  Heard great reviews about this one although probably biased given that the Finn Brothers are top of the Kiwi pop tree or shrub is probably more accurate and the reviews were written by New Zealand journalists who wouldn`t want to get offside with our only Superstars, sorry Goldenhorse, Bic Runga, Dave Dobbyn etc.  Anyway i wasn`t disappointed, Edible Flowers, is a great song and all the rest bar none are good solid songs, no filler here, but there is Don`t Dream its Over or Weather with You or Many`s the Time (which I fervently believe is Tim`s best work)  Also love the introduction of Banjo and Mandolin into two songs, giving them a lift and ambience sometimes missings with acoustic & electric guitar.  So anyway buy it if you like XTC, Crowded House, Elvis Costello.  Pop without the fuss
