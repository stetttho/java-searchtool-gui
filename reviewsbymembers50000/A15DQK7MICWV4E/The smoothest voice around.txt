 Home by Dawn is the JD Souther album that monopolises my stereo more than any of the others in this genre.  An album of really strong songs with the trademark silky smooth J D vocals. The great songs include Fast: Home by Dawn and Slow: Go ahead and Rain, All For You. J D is an artist whose brilliance far surpasses James Taylor & Jackson Browne with more melodies, more vocal depth and breadth and all round better performance.  The backing group reads like a whos who of LA music, reflecting the acclaim that important musicians hold JD in. This album is one you can`t be without if you like Eagles, Tim Schmit, James Taylor, latter day Poco etc, get this, his best album.
