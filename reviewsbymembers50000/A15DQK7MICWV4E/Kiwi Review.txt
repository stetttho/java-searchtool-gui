 After reading all Aussie reviews of Bernard Fanning's Tea and Sympathy, I thought I would offer an unbiased and balanced, non parochial view of the album.  So here goes.  Its FANTASTIC, its so good that I actually thought that Fanning was some sort of American Indie/Alt Country artist that was the next best thing, then found out that he is actually the Powderfinger lead man.  Fanning succesfully in parts sounds like a modern day Jackson Browne, James Taylor, Lowell George.  He's sort of in the same genre as Counting Crows/Train except NO FILLER on the album at all.  This is a class act from an exceptional talent.  America wake up! this guy is all you ever dreamt of.  Wish You Well is the bouncy, melodic, catchy but fulfilling and tough, single.  But if you think that is the highlight think again, its almost the low light as everything else just grows on you.  The perfect album for the Indian Summer that is upon us.  Enjoy
