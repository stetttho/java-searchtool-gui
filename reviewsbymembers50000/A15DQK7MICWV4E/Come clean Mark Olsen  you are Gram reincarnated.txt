 I came to the Jayhawks the wrong way round via Rainy Day Music but having already a working knowledge of Burrito Bros, Gram Parsons I was astounded to hear how the early Jayhawks with Mark Olsen are the aural spitting image of Gram Parsons but tighter and with a better ear for melody.  The vocals are not overproduced like Eagles harmonies but a great natural live sound.  Track 7 Bad Time is as finer pop tune as you would find anywhere.  The lyrics shift from endearing to whimsy in the flash of an eye and are driven along by some great guitar work.    (particularly 12 string) Miss Williams Guitar and Ten Little Kids are real fun almost bluegrass and Blue is another driven country rock tune.  Every track is a winner and the Jayhawks are a knockout
