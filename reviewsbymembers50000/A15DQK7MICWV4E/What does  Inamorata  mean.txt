 An interesting album from Poco, more diverse than Ghost Town which it was paired with in the original CD release, more modern (80's)productions and some damn good songs.  But really I think the fire was pretty much starting to flicker at this point.  Richie Furay and Timothy B Schmit are both listed in the credits and you can certainly hear them on track 1 "Days Gone By" which is good Poco in the Ghost Town, Legend era.  An excellent and emotive version of Rick Nelson's "This Old Flame" and a couple of other good things like Paul Cotton's "Odd Man Out", but some of the albums songs start to drag, like "Brenda X".  Apart from the re-union album of the original Poco "Legacy", this was it until "Running Horse", which I listened to again the other day and it grows on you.  A better album than Inamorata.  Buy it if you are a Poco nut and I believe there are plenty of us out there.  If you a casual Country Rock fan, The Essential Collection or Cantamos, Indian Summer are the place to start.
