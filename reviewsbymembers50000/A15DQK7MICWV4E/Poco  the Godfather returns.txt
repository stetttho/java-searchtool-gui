 This album is Poco`s first for 13 years since the Legacy album which featured the original band line up.  This album features stalwarts Rusty Young, Paul Cotton (who replaced Jim Messina prior to the wheel being invented)and George Grantham the original singing drummer. The lineup is augmented by Jack Sundred who has been playing live with Poco for some time.  The music is closer to the modern Nashville sound and this makes sense given that most of modern Nashville will have been inspired by the early Country Rock stars like Poco.  The songs are as strong as ever with standouts being, I can only Imagine, Running Horse and Everytime I hear that train by Paul.  The Running Horse vocal sounds very Glenn Frey like.   Rusty chips in with a couple of love songs and Jack comes up with a couple one of which Shake It is very un-Poco like but a good foot stomping tune none the less.  I think this album deserves to find a wider audience than what Poco would normally achieve, especially given the modern country sound.  All in all I like it and believe the music continues on the great Poco tradition.  Poco for Rock n Roll Hall of Fame.
