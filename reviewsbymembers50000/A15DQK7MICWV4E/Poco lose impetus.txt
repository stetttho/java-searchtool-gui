 Cowboys and Englishman was an album where most of the material was Country covers.  Yes they played and sung with their usual passion and skill but the dirth of ideas and the step back into Country instrumentals (Ashes / Feudin) showed devolution rather than what any Poco fan could justifiably expect after the highs of Blue and Grey.  Having said this there are some highlights for the diehard Poco fan, these being, While your`e on your way, Sea of Hearbreak, No Releif in sight (which could have been on Blue and Grey??) It seems that Cowboys & Englishmen was Poco fulfilling some contractual obligations.  Still Poco fans should enjoy and also fans of the newer Country music style will too.
