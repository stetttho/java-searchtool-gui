 The Thorns arrived in New Zealand complete with positive reviews and a media campaign, promoting the album.  Being a fan of CSN, Eagles etc my ears pricked up at the radio snippets and in due course the album was gifted me.  This album has carved a niche in the car stereo with finely crafted country rock, alt country, folk rock tunes, done with impeccable 3-part harmony and really interesting musical touches.  Highlights are No Blue Sky, I set the world on fire, Such a Shame and I Can`t Remember.  Track 3 Blue is probably done better by the Jayhawks on Tomorrow the Green Grass but that`s just being picky.  For me one of the highlights of 2003 along with Jayhawks "Rainy Day Music" and Poco`s "Running Horse".  Here`s some modern music for you 70`s Country Rockers. Enjoy.
