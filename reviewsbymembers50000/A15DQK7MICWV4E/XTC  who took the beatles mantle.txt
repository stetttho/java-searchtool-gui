 Skylarking is not just one of the great British albums of the 1980`s, it is an all time great album.  As many of the great albums it was made under great pressure with Todd Rundgren, producing and managing to upset the Partridge ego and have Colin Moulding quit briefly.  In the end Partridge went home and missed the final mixing, Rundgren did it and there was born Skylarking.  The songs which flow together beautifully leave one with an almost summers day languidness.  The album actually takes you outdoors on a summers day on grass with a picnic and a loved one, a bottle of Riesling and thou.  Oops sorry got carried away!!  The music is brilliant with so much happening, its all here, Black Sea quirkiness,(Thats really super, Supergirl)English Settlement pop (The Meeting Place) and of course the acoustic brilliance of Dear God.  So many ideas, so much talent so little reward.  XTC the princes of Brit Pop.
