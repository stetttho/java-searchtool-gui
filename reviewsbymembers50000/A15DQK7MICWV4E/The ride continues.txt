 My Private Nation is without doubt the strongest of Trains albums to date.  From the opening bars of Calling all Angels thru to the closing I'm about to come alive, the band alternatively rocks, croons, harmonises and generally pleases this punter.  OK I know its a different genre, but I think Train is to the 2000's as the Eagles were to the 70's.  Sorry Train!  What I mean by that comment is Train's ability to bring together many influences and deliver great rock music.  There melodies and harmonies are right up there and they above all are having fun.  I digress, the point is Save the Day, Get to Me and the title track are classics.  Am patiently waiting for the 4th album to be released in NZ, the single "Cab" is here and fantastic so I can continue my Train ride.
