 But Seriously Folks is a great Album, not necessarily for its lack of resemblance to previous Joe Walsh works but for its quality in terms of the Country Rock genre.  People talked of the Joe Walsh influence on Hotel California, this album illustrates the Eagles influence on Joe Walsh.  Most typical is the outstanding harmonies on Second Hand Store and Tomorrow, (my fave`s along with Indian Summer)This album apart from Life`s Been Good is a poignant well crafted musical triumph and in my opinion a vastly underrated album.  If you like Eagles circa Hotel California, or Walsh tunes like Help me through the night, get this album.  Tomorrow, Indian Summer could have been Eagles Tunes.  Sadly the jokey theme of Lifes Been Good permeates his later work far too frequently.  Even a great riff as on Ordinary Average guy is ruined by an ordinary average lyric.
