 Joe Walsh, now there is an enigma.  Brilliant Guitarist, Occasionally brilliant songwriter, Clown Prince of Rock.  Guitarist with the great Eagles.  He is all of these things and less and more.  This album showcases how good he can be and how maddingly average he can be.  I Can Play that Rock `n Roll is just good fun Rock as good as Joe gets, Told You So came from the Long Run sessions and features Don Felder the Eagles other guitar hero.  Here We Are Now is reminiscent of But Seriously, Folks with its Pop leanings and features Henley on backing vocals.  Then along come 4 & 5 where Joe gets weird and I guess humourous.  Then bang back into class rock with Space Age Whizz Kids.  Then Love Letters a 60`s standard that became infamous on David Lynch`s Blue Velvet.  Class of 65 is neat and pulls aside the personal veil momentarily.  The album finishes with a recurring theme instrumental, Theme from Island Weirdos.  All in all a good album but not a great album, leaving me scratching my head.
