 Poco is unknown in New Zealand, but music like A Good Feelin to Know deserves to be listened to by a wider audience.  This is one of the best Poco albums, with tunes like the rollicking `And Settlin Down, Tim Schmit`s brilliant timeless I Can see Everything, the album title, A Good Feelin etc are all as brilliant as anything that appears on what is considered to be the closest of the other bands in the country rock genre Eagles, debut album also released in 72.  These are the best songs on the album and all appear on The Forgotten Trail which if you don`t want all the Poco albums, I Do. Then The Forgotten Trail is the album to get instead.  This album is up there with other Poco efforts Seven, Cantamos, Crazy Eyes and From the Inside.  Beautiful Music
