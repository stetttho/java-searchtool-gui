 Timothy B Schmit the angel voiced bass player with the Eagles and previously Poco, displays a wide variety of styles on Playin it Cool. From pure vocal harmony`s with minimal back up on Voices (which was originally put up for the Long Run - Eagles)and So Much in Love (off Fast Times at Ridgemont High)to rockin out on Gimme the Money, to typical LA Soft rock (good soft rock) on Lonely Girl,Take a Good Look around You and Tell Me what you Dream. The latter three songs are the highlights of the album being more what is expected from Tim in terms of lyrical content and great vocal delivery in the sad song vein that he does better than any of his former band colleagues. OK this isn`t a great album you`ve gotta luv Tim but it is essential if you are lookin at his whole career. Timothy B and Tell Me the Truth are about the same quality whilst Feed the Fire is a giant and brilliant leap forward.
