 If you want to hear the greatest version of the Kinks` You Really Got Me, then get this album.  Eno delivers in his usual quirky manner with Manzanera tearing the place up on rhythm & lead guitars.  Other highlights include the Beatles Tomorrow Never Knows, originally off Revolver which is elongated, mystic and avante garde.  Listen Now, Miss Shapiro & Baby`s on Fire from Eno & Manzanera`s solo projects also appear on an album which must be considered one of the great live albums of all time
