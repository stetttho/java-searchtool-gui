 Apart from a couple of movie soundtracks including "Heavy Metal", this is the only work Felder published post the Eagles.  Whilst it is not an absolute work of art, it does have one or two moments which do work, but probably highlights as so many other Eagle members solo albums have as to why the whole was better than the sum of its parts.   Felder did write the music to Hotel California (the track not the whole album) and that was in my opinion the talent of the man, laying down licks and melodies for Henley, Frey, Souther and others to work with.  Which leads me to say that some of Felder`s work here probably shows a lack of such collaborators (Kenny Loggins pops up on one track), and also highlights why he only ever did one lead vocal for the Eagles.  You can see what part Felder played in the Eagles harmonies if that sort of stuff interests you.  OK I`ll get a life.  His use of the vocal mastery of Tim Schmit on 3 tracks is flawed and Winner highlights the worst example with an almost screeched backing vocal. But being a fan and I am, lets look at the good times, Bad Girls and Never Surrender both benefit from good riffs and reasonable melodies, lyrically he ain`t no genius but then not everyone is a Dylan.  However some of the other material does not hold my attention as it should.  The use of George Perry on bass provides some funk on Haywire.  The album shows some technical progression in terms of the use of keyboards, synthesizers and shows some of Felder`s flair, a lot of the album shows just how dramatic his guitar could be and he does take the opportunity to cut loose as he couldn`t always in the Eagle environment. Once again an album that Eagles fans probably need to have, but nowhere near as enjoyable as the works of Henley, Frey, Schmit and Meisner although it would give some of Walsh`s solo stuff a run for its money.
