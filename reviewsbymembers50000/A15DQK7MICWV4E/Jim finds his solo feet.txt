 Jim Messina, ex Buffalo Springfield, Poco & Loggins & Messina in  this his second solo album is certainly a step up from His first solo outing "Messina" where the pop pretensions got in the way a tad.  This one is more reminiscent of his Country Rock leanings in Poco and in fact on some its a pity that some of his former bandmates weren`t helping our on Backing Vocals.  It also doesn`t hurt the album`s accessibility that there seem to be one or two borrowed half riffs or half melodies.  Not a criticism at all. No this is good old fashioned driving music, not heavy on solos or strongly lyrical but pleasant none the less.  As for the songs the title track is something strait out of the Poco songbook, before the next track "Meant to be Together" dips into melancholy.  "I got radio" is a song whose content has been covered by artists before and since (Roger McGuinn, Back from Rio) but is lifted above the norm by a great lead guitar part at the end played by the man himself.  Playin that Rock n` Roll is yep you guessed it Rock n` Roll.  "The Island" sounds like he`s been talking to Paul Cotton in terms of the subject matter.  "Treat her Right" could be on Glenn Frey`s "No Fun Aloud"  All this is sound Messina music but wait the best is yet to come on track 7 where he suddenly remembers that he`s a class act and delivers accordingly with "We got to get back"  Moody beautiful lead guitar, highlighting the mans talent in a wistful, love tune.  "Big Tease" is filler but is followed by "Can`t live without you" which includes the familiar riffs I mentioned at the start.  Good LA soft rock!!   If you enjoy Poco from their Ghost Town/Inamorata period or Randy Meisner`s solo work then you may well enjoy this.
