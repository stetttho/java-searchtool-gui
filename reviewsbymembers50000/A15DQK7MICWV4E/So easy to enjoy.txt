 Where have you been all my life Jayhawks?  This is the group which dragged me kicking and screaming into the 90`s and modern music having been head in the sand over Eagles and Poco for 20 years.  This the seventh album is a return to the type of music which earned them the tag "the new Byrds".  Whilst quieter, and more of a one man show, courtesy of the brilliant Gary Louris it is in line with the earlier, Hollywood Town Hall and Tomorrow the Green Grass which are essential CD`s for any lovers of American roots, Country, Folk.  Top tunes are Eyes of Sarahjane, Don`t let the World get in your way, Tailspin and in fact virtually all of it.  The Jayhawks sound pays homage to Gram Parsons, Richie Furay and all the other champions of Country Rock, albeit in a more Garage feel and is the link between the Jack Johnson`s, Ben Harpers and Ryan Adams of this world.  Buy it you will love it.
