 This collection is a pretty well thought through study of early Poco with all the hits up to Cantamos.  Includes Good Feelin to Know, Bad Weather and a medley off Deliverin.  Two Buffalo Springfield tunes fine their way here (Kind Woman & Go and Say Goodbye)the second one should not be here being a weak effort compared with the Stills original.  But the sing along feel good country rock of Just for Me and You (Underrated) My Kind of Love and Pickin up the pieces all appear.  Faith in the Families off Seven is mid period Poco as is What Ever Happened to Your smile and are a wee bit out of place here.  Room perhaps should have been found for Here We Go Again which was Tim Schmit`s greatest moment, and Settlin` Down, Blue Water.  The good news is that all these can be found on The Forgotten Trail which is the superior collection.  Get it instead.
