 Yes the Eagles were imploding at the time this album came out and most of the material is from around 1980 during the bands final tours and months together, but hey these guys are pros and there is nothing in the performances that suggest that anything apart from Happy Campers is the order of the day.  The Eagles have never been known to rock out and expand the tunes ad libbing, remaining true to the studio versions.  This polarises people, but would you rather have Henley do a Dylan and actually sing new versions of your old favourites?  I think not. A couple of things show some inconsistencies like when Glenn says "this next song is from the Hotel California album which is out in a couple of weeks" meaning Wasted Time.  The crowd don`t seem too enamoured of the song due to its unfamiliarity in 1976 prior to the release.  But that is a nit picking attitude and really some of the best live renditions of classic songs are to be found on this album, Take it to the Limit also from a `76 concert is brilliant.  New Kid in Town reaches new heights in a live setting.  "Life in the Fast Lane" is a superior version to Hell Freezes Over although "Take it Easy" is better on HFO.  The Long Run is great especially the crowd chat.  Two new songs for the Eagles that is, "Seven Bridges Road" showcases the vocal skills of the band and All Night Long a Walsh tune off the Urban Cowboy soundtrack is helped by a great choir of Roadies and Friends, great stuff.   This release could only be bettered by including Tim Schmit`s Keep on Tryin` from his Poco days which apparently the Eagles were doing live around the time but that wasn`t to be.  Anyway still a great live album from one of the best.
