 When Glenn split from the Eagles in 1980 and decided to make solo records he made No Fun Aloud with the aid of long time Eagles collaborator Jack Tempchin and a smattering of others, Hawk Wolinski etc.  You may have expected Eagles formula LA rock but Glenn wentback to his blue eyed soul roots in Detroit and released an album full of R&B in a happy throw away style. First listen and subsequent listens allowed the words unsubstantial and light weight to spring to mind but time has treated the music well and some songs have grown on me as time went on.  That Girl written with Bob Seger is one, as is I Volunteer which sounds a bit like Eagles, On the Border period.  Don`t Give Up utilises 80`s electronics effectively and sounds vaguely Eagles Long Runnish.  Sea Cruise is a joy in a happy go lucky Jamaica/R&B style while the Hit off the album the One You Love is a lovely ballad which brings a touch of moistness to the eye (occassionaly)  While Don was venting his political spleen Glenn was having a good time.  Treat this album as just that a good time record.
