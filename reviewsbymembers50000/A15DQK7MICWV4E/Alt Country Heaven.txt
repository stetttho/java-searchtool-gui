 Tales of a Traveler is an album full of beauty, rural pastiche, bucolic charm, blues invention and most of all a synergy from a vast variety of roots influences, with a modern twist.  It starts off with a couple of driving country rockers.  Poppa has driving guitars, before diving into the poppy and catchy Comic Book Kid.  And so it goes, mostly fantastic dives into country repetoires with the odd diversion into Chris Isaak territory but mostly just great Alt Country.  The last three songs ending the album are simple brilliant, deeply melancholy, melodic guitars, moody vocals.  These songs simply grab you by the throat and insert themselves into your head.  If you love The Jayhawks, Son Volt, Wagon etc then Blue Mountain are the next stop on the journey.  Enjoy
