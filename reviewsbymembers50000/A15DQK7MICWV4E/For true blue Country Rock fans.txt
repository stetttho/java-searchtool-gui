 This album by Souther Hillman Furay band is a very good album although I think better music is available by all 3 on other projects.  JD Southers contributions all pale beside Black Rose and Home by Dawn except Deep Dark and Dreamless, with its soaring harmonies and Pretty Goodbyes.  Heartbreaker and Border town were too Tex/Mex - Rockabilly for the rest of the band and the album and just don`t seem to fit.  Furay`s Believe Me is a standout, a never released Poco song.  Fallin in Love is also a great tune by Richie.  Hillman is the weak link, Safe at Home sounding exactly like some of his collaborations with McGuinn later in his career.  Heavenly Fire and Rise and Fall are forgettable too.  All in all I would look for Poco`s A Good Feeling to Know, the above mentioned Souther albums and Manassas albums before this.  Having said that it does seem to creep onto my car CD player with monotonous regularity!?!  and its my 2nd copy!?!
