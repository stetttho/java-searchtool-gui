 Being an avid Eagles fan I have over the years picked up just about everything available that allows me to learn a little more of the guys whose music I cherish.  When I purchase a book I would expect it to be well researched and perhaps contain information gleaned from the Horse`s mouth.  This book seems to have been written after the author watched Hell Freezes Over as he quotes liberally from a video which and correct me if I`m mistaken, virtually every Eagles fan has seen multiple times!?!  Other quotes, stories and ditties are common knowledge to Eagles fans, or available by reading web sites, articles, etc.  Therefore whilst mildly enjoyable, the nature of the material renders this publication superfluous unless you are only mildly interested in the Eagles.  I believe a better read is the Marc Eliot, "To the Limit" slightly more sensational and some people say inaccurate, but better than The Long Run by some.
