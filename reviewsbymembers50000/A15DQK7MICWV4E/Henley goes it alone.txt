 Don Henley the singer/drummer with the great 70`s band the Eagles found himself without a band in the early 80`s and when he learned that his old friend Glenn Frey was about to release an album, Don too decided to make one.  Don has always collaborated with others in his songwriting endeavours and found two like-minded conspirators in Danny Kortchmar best known for his playing days with James Taylor and Carole King.  Waddy Wachtel a regarded session musician was also around.  Together Don & Dan created some serious, political, social comment supported with great melodies (Dirty Laundry, Johnny can`t Read) some personal snippets from some difficult times in Don`s life (Nobody`s Business) and what Henley album would be complete without a great love song (Long Way Home) Henley even explores his Irish roots (Lilah) and covers a traditional gospel song with some help from Bill Withers (Uncloudy Day) All in All an album which mystifies especially when compared to Frey`s 1st outing No Fun Aloud, you wonder how Frey and Henley could create the Eagles sound when their solo outings are obviously different.  Henley Tex/Mex Country and Gospel music and Frey White R&B and Rock and Roll.  This is a really good album which set Don up for a great solo career.  Oh and what a voice.
