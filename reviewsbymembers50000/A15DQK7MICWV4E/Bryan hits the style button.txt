 Ferry`s - The Bride Stripped Bare, is an album which really shows Ferry at his best in terms of his early solo work and succesfully bridges the lean mid seventies period.  This album contains an eclectic selection of covers (mostly R&B and Soul)and originals supported by a strong cast of Brit Rock champions.  Highlights include Can`t Let Go, a great driving song, What Goes On from Velvet Underground, a beautiful rendition of a traditional Irish lilt "Carrickfergus" which Ferry takes ownership of.  Sign of the Times which sounds like it should have been on Roxy Music`s Siren.  An intense, theatrical, This Island Earth and some sublime vocal performances, Thats How Strong my Love Is. Same Old Blues.  Ferry demonstrates his love of R&B and his ability to mimic the genre.  An overlooked album which did not receive the sales that it should have.
