 OK so everyone has different tastes but to my mind some of Glenn`s best work did not make the cut on this album.  Instead we`ve been given work which has`nt appeared in any of Glenn`s previous releases, Common Ground, Who`s been sleepin in my bed etc, which while good pale beside I Volunteer, That Girl, Some Kind of Blue which all sound like they could have been Eagles tunes.  Having said that it is a good album although I would recommend Soul Searchin, Strange Weather ahead of this one.  Further proof that the Eagles whole is better than its parts
