 Poco - Seven is in my opinion Poco`s finest album.  Seven sits between two albums one of which Crazy Eyes signalled Richie Furay exit from the band and Cantamos which continued the direction derived from Good Feelin to Know and Crazy Eyes, that is slightly Country but with some good rockers, lyrics influenced by the south and the old west.  But smack in the middle came Seven a modern album with a modern driving sound.  Slide Guitar and greater influence from Paul Cotton and Tim Schmit occur here.  Rusty Youn`gs sole track Rocky Mountain Breakdown is the only concession to their previous sound. This is Country Rock more reminiscent of what the Eagles were starting to do on On the Border.  Highlights include Angel, You`ve got your Reasons and Krikkits Song.  However there are no weak tracks on the album.  This was my first Poco purchase and forced me to invest in more Poco.  This is the only album in this vein however as Cantamos retreats back into the old style albeit with excellent musicianship and great songs.
