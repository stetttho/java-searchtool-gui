 Matthew Sweet is a brilliant musician always nearly there but not quite.  Unlike most fans who prefer his earlier music I am a fan of his later stuff which I find slightly more Poppy and more accessible.  He really hits his straps on his slower tunes like "If Time Permits" which sounds like the Thorns to me.  Funny that since he`s in the Thorns.  Some of his Power Pop riffs are good too but unkind in terms of categorising an artist who shouldn`t be categorised.  If you are a fan of `90`s Power Pop or slightly alternative rock or alt. country check out this example of Matthew Sweet.  All his good tunes like "Girlfriend, Devil with the Green Eyes" are here from his earlier period.  This is the best way to get into his thing.
