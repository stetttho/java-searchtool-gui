 In 1980 Roxy Music released Flesh & Blood. The beginning of the Ferry Lounge Lizard phase, it was less than favourably received by the critics who continued to expect ground breaking progressive rock from Bry & the Boys.  For me this is the least dated sounding of all the albums and probably the most influential in terms of the New Wave thing that occured with OMD, Simple Minds, Human League, ABC et al.  Highlights are the Byrd`s Eight Miles High with the Funky brilliant, ending.  Over You a great pop tune.  My Only Love, Ferry`s ode to whoever he was involved with at the time.  Oh Yeah another poignant moment with great vocal delivery.  I just wonder what McKay did whilst waiting for his sax pieces which are few & far between.  It appears Roxy were pretty much Ferry, Manzanera, McKay at this time with lots of session superstars, Andy Newmark, Paul Carrick ex Squeeze & other mid 70 British pop bands, Neil Hubbard & Garry Tibbs on bass of Adam & the Ants  became Roxy`s touring bassist.  Realistically there are no weak moments on the album.  A step up from Manifesto & certainly Siren.
