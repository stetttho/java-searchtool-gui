 In terms of the Country Rock genre, you simply need this album.  The singing and playing on Cantamos makes all their previous albums and future pale into comparison except perhaps "Seven"  The major highlight is Rusty Young`s emergence as a song writer.  His efforts are some of the strongest on what is a very even high qulity album.  "Sagebrush Serenade" which effectively marries, Bluegrass, High Harmonies and Country Rock together and High and Dry which is straight Country Rock, sung by Tim Schmit will leave you wanting more.  Paul Cotton has major highlights, "Western Waterloo", Another Time Around are lyrical improvements and really rock out.  Tim Schmit has Bitter Blue which continues his growth as a songwriter and has the more commercial "Whatever Happened to your smile?"  The strongest song on the album is All the Ways which is quite simply a classic.  Realistically this is as strong an album as Poco ever did and one which I would strongly recommend to all Eagles, JD Souther, James Taylor fans as an example of how good Country Rock did get in the early mid `70`s.
