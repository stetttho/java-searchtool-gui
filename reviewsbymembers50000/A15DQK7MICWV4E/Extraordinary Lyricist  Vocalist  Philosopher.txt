 The last thing Amazon needs is another Essence review but then I just wanted to lend my weight to the shouts of "Lucinda you are the Chosen one" or whatever it is that they yell.  Quite simply Lucinda is the greatest writer of love lorn lyrics that I have ever come across.  She tells it like it is whether or not people want to hear it.  Imagine being in a relationship with her, you would never die wondering how she felt.  And the delivery in her low key gruff almost burbled way, is disarming but charming.  Even my wife who pretty much loathes all of my music tastes, and accuses me of being one dimensional, likes this.  (Likes not Loves) anyway thats an on-going project and Lucinda you can help.
