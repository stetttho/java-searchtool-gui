 The Long Run is one of the Eagles finest albums showing excellent musicianship.  Technically superior with a lot of great stories, King of Hollywood, Sad Cafe etc this is a very good album which demonstrates the completion of the evolution away from Country Rock, the impact of Joe Walsh and that Tim Schmit is one of the most beautiful singers in this genre.  Sad Cafe sounds like it could have come off any of the previous two albums.  Much maligned tracks Teenage Jail and The Greeks dont want no Freaks for me are enjoyable, the guitar / synth solo at the end of Teenage Jail and the tongu in cheek lyric of Greeks are highlights.  Disco Strangler is a study in accuracy and In the City is a great Walsh rocker with superb harmonies and great slide.  All in all a fantastic album and one which dominates my stereo more than any of the other studio albums including Hotel California.
