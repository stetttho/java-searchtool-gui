 This self titled album of 1982 not to be confused with the self titled album of 1978 shows Randy moving well away from his Country Rock origins into a more bombastic sound reminiscent of Styx or REO Speedwagon.  His collaborators included Craig Bickhardt an Alt Country musician who later worked with Poco on the 2002 Running Horse.  Mike Flicker who sometimes produced Poco, Mitchell Froom an Australian musician/producer who worked with Icehouse and Crowded House from Down Under, Ann & Nancy Wilson from Heart and a raft of LA session musicians, Phil Kenzie, John Corey who will or had worked with the Eagles.  Randy was obviously trying to recapture the sound of Poco/Eagles and sometimes went close on some of the tracks here.  The better tracks include Never Been in Love, Jealousy and Still Runnin.  The album features an Elton John cover and a Bryan Adams tune, but fades towards the end with two tracks of debatable worth.  I would certainly look at his two previous albums before this one especially One More Song which is a little beauty.
