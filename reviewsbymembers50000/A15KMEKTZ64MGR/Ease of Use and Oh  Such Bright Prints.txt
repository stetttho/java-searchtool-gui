 Yes, it costs more than most photo printers. Advantages: multiple paper sizes/quality can be used. It is whisper smooth quiet. It prints fast and seemingly, after just a day of printing many pictures, uses very little ink. The set up is fast and not cumbersome; even with me using old fashioned Windows 2000, the software worked without a hitch.  Seems sturdily built, hope it lasts longer than either of my Epsons (albeit, cheaper models) did. Canon is stingy and only had a starter pack of six or so 4x6 papers. While awaiting my shipment of more papers from Amazon (by the way, Amazon was amazing in giving a low price+ no shipping charges and it arrived in 24 hours!)I tried my old Kodak photo paper and still the colors and sharpness were outstanding. I, or my friends, could not tell the difference from photo store professional printing and Canon prints. It was in this case, money spent wisely. I haven't used the pictbridge feature yet. My other softwares: MGI photosuite and MS Picture It, both work well with the printer. The easypicture that comes with it is very good too. A fair warning: using the free photopaper that came as an Amazon add on is worse than useless. The colors spread and the pictures are blurred. With Canon paper the prints are fine. With Kodak, they are passable.
