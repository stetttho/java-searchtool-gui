 Mr. Dunning broke into ranks of top detective authors with Booked to Die and followed it up with the best Cliff Janeway, a bibliophile and a detective, book, The Bookman's Wake, a masterpiece. Since then the downward drift has been very noticeable, although the non-series book, Two O'Clock Eastern Wartime, had a very nice premise with good writing spoilt by an implausible ending. The last Bookman was just so-so but this one is worse. The question is why? Mr. Dunning is a good writer, Mr. Janeway is a good man. It is the plot. I realize for Mr. Dunning fans, deservedly many, that does not matter. All these four and five stars! It is, however, dreadful. And the characters are corny and unconvincing. That's what kills the book ultimately. The ending is predictable but the hokey, soapy way it is presented makes it totally repulsive. Mr. Janeway's girl friends have . . just bad luck.  The story itself has nothing of note. A faint surprise from a Bibliophilic point of view, not much; so you learn signatures add to the value of books. Anyone surfing ebay or abebooks, knows that. There is a quality of derivation in the book, don't get me wrong, most American mysteries still follow in Hammett/Chandler footsteps; but it is done as if the author were writing in a trance, nothing clearly emerges. The atmosphere is flat and the people predictably inane, so that one is hard pressed to read on. . . at least with pleasure. Mr. Dunning's writing, not top-notch anymore, is high grade, and that keeps the reluctant fingers exercising.  Deputy Walsh is so badly drawn that it makes one cringe, especially what happens in the court room, later in the book. A Sgt. Holcomb gone insane.  Every scene is unconvincing; every situation is stretched, every person in the book is confused. We still love you but like the early season of the Yankees, deeply distressed at the level of play. Take a long break and come up with something fresher, which you are capable of doing.
