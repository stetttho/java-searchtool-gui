 I like Mr. Deaver's writing and his Lincoln Rhyme character. So I rushed out and got a signed first edition, hoping to keep it with my prized books. No. Unfortunately, Mr. Deaver is out of his literary depths in this book. The characters are totally cardboard and unconvincing. The historical figures mumble platitudes and add nothing to the narration.  Ugh! Where is the suspense? Who cares? Mr. Deaver, you should have read Mr. Forsythe or the early Ken Follets, before attempting to write this book.  Sorry.  Why keep writing Hail instead of Heil. So irritating!
