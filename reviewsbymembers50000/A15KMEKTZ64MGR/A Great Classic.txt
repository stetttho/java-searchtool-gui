 So why am I writing a review of a book published in the early 1900s? I hope some young people will read all the positive reviews and pick up the book and have a great time. No Stephen King or Dean Koontz wrote this. A wonderfully narrated book of a time that is not coming back. The language is smooth as flowing honey and the Indian words are used with the skill of one born and brought up there (Kipling was later sent to England to complete his schooling).  Enjoyable even after years and years. I would recommend to buy the hardcover (Everyman Library) edition. A bargain at Amazon's prices
