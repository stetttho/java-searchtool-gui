 Peter Davison and Brian Glover as the Golden Age detective Albert Campion and his 'varlet' Magersfontein Lugg, are terrific. The screenplays follow the books, which is great. The action is somewhat slow but more than makes up for speed by quality of actors portraying secondary characters. All of Agatha Christie fans would delight in the series. The quality of DVD is poor and could have been bettered by making an effort especially at the price they are charging (even with Amazon Discount). Highly recommended for the lovers of British Mysteries. Ms. Allingham has been called rightly, a shining star.
