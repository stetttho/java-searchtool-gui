 I loved the first two Bookman novels. Booked to Die is absolutely fantastic, and The Bookman's Wake is labyrinthine and vastly enjoyable. So what went wrong? I think, this is a forced book. The writing is stilted, who writes, "I'll come and tear your heart out," in 2004? Almost none of the Janeway asides on books and First Editions are present. It involves Richard Burton-the explorer. There is almost nothing new or of note in the book about one of the most interesting men of the Victorian Era. That part of the narrative is flat like women's old fashioned shoes.   Where is the mystery? What, even, is the mystery about? Burton's presence in the USA around the beginning of the Civil War? The twist here is ludicrous.  It is just a routine watered down thriller by a writer trying to revive flagging skills. One wonders how did this writer produce the last two Janeway books? Two O'Clock Eastern War Time, Mr. Dunning's last book, had a great narrative punch and style. This one has no heart or one with seriously clogged arteries. Despite all the other glowing reviews (perhaps they are still smitten by the magic of the first Cliff Janeway in years), I put the book down with disappointment. Perhaps the new Michael Connelly will console this inveterate detective novel reader. Sorry, Mr. Dunning.
