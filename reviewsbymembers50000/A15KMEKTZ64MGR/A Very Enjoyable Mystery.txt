 I started the book with trepidation, for it is by an unknown writer. However, once begun, I could not put it down! The mystery is lively and the author's love for the golden age detective stories comes through in every page. I read it at break neck speed and enjoyed every moment of it. The book ends on a mysterious note and I had to think hard to unravel the final bit of puzzle. A great read for the upcoming holidays!
