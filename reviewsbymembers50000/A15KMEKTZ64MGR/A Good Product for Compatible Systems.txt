 Why am I giving this little piece of hardware a four star when I actually had to send it back? For two reasons: One: GREAT tech support-via email- knowledgeable, prompt and helpful Two: Great video capture.  Unfortunately my laptop did not support the sound input. This could be a problem as one user has noted, that there was lack of synchronicity. So, perhaps a new model with video and sound together!
