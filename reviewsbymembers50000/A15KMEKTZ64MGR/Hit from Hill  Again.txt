 Mr. Hill continues to write prolifically but the quality of his writing and the puzzles in his mystery march forward unabatedly.  This book (and don't forget Death's Jest Book, published late last year in England, which is a follow up to this one) lifts the modern mystery to new heights. Why am I not giving it a five star? Just because it is too long, and some of it unnecessarily.  Especially the love scene details of Rye Pomona and Hat.  Still a far cry from and one of greater satisfaction than reading the pseudo British trash from Elizabeth George.  Dalziel remains the greates of modern detectives. He surpassed Inspector Morse many a moon ago.
