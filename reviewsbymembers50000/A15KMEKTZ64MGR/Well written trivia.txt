 Mr. Katzenbach can write. We all concede it. The story starts off very well, with C-Bird, the narrator, in the right frame of mind as a released mentally ill patient. He goes back to the Mental Hospital for a ceremony and meets another ex-patient, Napoleon and they reminisce about what went on there. A female FBI agent, shades of Clarisse Starling -who isn't?- comes to the place looking for a serial killer who hides in mental hospitals. She became a prosecutor after being raped by a person never caught. The book does not go anywhere after that. Still, the mental hospital atmosphere is authentic, except for one big blunder: no therapist, in this case the psychologist, can treat a patient who had harmed him personally (his brother perished in a fire set by one called the Fireman).  Suspense is artificial and the characters, outside of the patients, are routine. Mr.Katzenbach, a great writer, needed this out of his system, so he can go back to thrilling readers as before. An honorable failure.
