 Mr. Tilston's well researched and competently written book is published by a small press, probably a subisidy publisher. The real question is not how good the book is, but whether established publishers like Harper Collins, Bantam or Simon Schuster would have published it. Are we losing out on good writers and good books because money making has become the name of the game? Perhaps Mr. Tilston can answer my question. Is he satisfied with the way the book is published? Has he recouped his investment or a well caressed ego is worth the outlay? I'll be interested in hearing from him. He certainly has the flair of the language, hall mark of a real writer.
