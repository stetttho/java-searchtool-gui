 This is obviously an update of the 1200 laserjet printer. 8 megs of memory and upto 15 ppm. The print quality is good. The printer is noisy, which is the greatest drawback, especially if it sits next to you on the desk.  Either HP forgot to enclose a manual or it does not exist. This would create difficulty for one who had never put together a printer before. It's a snap for others. Good product.
