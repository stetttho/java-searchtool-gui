 So surprised to read a book of such complex plot, from a writer I have never heard of. Is Mitra a nom de plume of someone famous? The story spans from an English village in the 70s to the modern day Manhattan! Hints of Agatha Christie books is an effective ploy. The sheer delight is the camaraderie of the chief characters, Dr. Martin, Halley Willard and Sandy Bloorwoise. Into the cauldron, where single malt whiskey and gourmet food sizzle, add the delightful (but rather feeble witted) Inspector Dobbelia Smith and the results are heart warming. The first mystery in the book is more compact and convincing. The main mystery, although unnecessarily convoluted, is still a danger to your hair, since you keep scratching your head! Keep it on your Christmas list!
