 I have been painfully and slowly recording my old VHS tapes on to a DVD-R on my laptop, using a video converter. Then I got the bright idea of getting a DVD recorder. I picked this one because of the price and the great reviews. It works.  All the positives are totally correct. I don't understand the negatives. Finalized disks ( I am using DVD+R and am not sure what advantages -Rs have) work on all my other DVD players. The remote is simple to use.  The quality of the recording is the ultimate test. They are as good as the original recordings. The sound is nice.  It is fast and reliable. I do miss the convenience of titling each little piece on my computer with transitions, but the time I save with this is amazing.  Longer recordings are a snap. There are still some old VHS tapes which are not copyguarded and those are going to join my contribution to the local library as I transfer them to the DVD. Highly recommended for the beginner and very enjoyable to use. Good work, Panasonic!
