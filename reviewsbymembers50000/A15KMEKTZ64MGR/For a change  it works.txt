 Went through nightmares with the other video convertors, especially with ADS Video Express, and found this product, contrary to many customers, A DELIGHT TO WORK WITH! It captures easily, recognizes the hardware straighaway. The My DVD 3.2 is highly superior to the previous versions. But why oh why, does it not reproduce sound while recording? Without this unreasonable quirk, it would be near perfect. For converting old video tapes, it is really very good. The DVD picture, synchronization and sound qualities are very good.
