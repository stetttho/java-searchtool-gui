 Discover a jewel for the price of a book! The first piece is for those Broadway Buffs, who enjoyed the many musicals that graced the stage and provided them with life long memories. Mr. Nash certainly shows his love for them, 'I,too,wanted the music/ To play on forever.' The rhythm and cadence of Mr. Nash's writing does leave more than a lasting impression on the readers. It consolidates nostalgia with lovely regrets. James Nash is not a newcomer to the writing world, with two acclaimed books, Poor Teddy Black and The Last of Ellman, both published by Harper and Row under his innovative belt.  This book impresses as a sharp toothed tiger letting its roar loose on the world, and saying, come and read me.  The pithy ending from Satan to Our Father, 'Why not give in/Admit I win?' to the satirical, 'Why don't we smile on Frowning?' and the parodies, Old King Cole, 'When discovered in bed/With his jesters, he said/He was keeping his wits about him.' There are some Limey limericks, reminding the Anglophiles fondly of Clerihews.  Perhaps the weakest of the pieces is the long, 'The Passing of Stoppan Stink, which, notwithstanding its outstanding title, fails to hold its own in the book. It is actually quite good, but compared to Mr. Nash's brilliance before, it, as they say, pales in comparison. The book seems like a work of a life time, little pieces written years ago gathering dust and now dusted, sparkling like new, put together. Perhaps a debt or two to Ms. Dickinson and Edward Lear. Who cares? What a find; I urge readers to rush out and get it. New Yorker, as one of the other readers pointed out, would have been proud to have published many of the pieces included in this wonderful book. Enjoy.
