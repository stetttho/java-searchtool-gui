 Gerard Freeman, the hero of the book at a very early age in Australia, growing up with his mother, realizes something is wrong with her and with him. He falls in love with a pen pal, who is going to undergo surgery and can become paralyzed. Such is the beginning.  True to Victorian times, a large part of the book is spent in Gerard reading old manuscripts, nice short ghostly tales somehow never reaching the finesse that Ms. Byatt achieved in Possession. Perhaps Mr. Harwood did borrow, albeit unconciously from that book, perhaps not. It is so well written that time and pages fly quickly. Ultimately, everything is neatly tied in with a rather unbelievable climax. Still, a very tidy book. Good ghost stories are hard to come by and the last one was also from Australia, Richard Adams' (Watership Down) The Girl On The Swing.That was a real spine tingler. This one could have been a stunning novella, in the manner of The Turn of the Screw. Expanding it to a novel length has robbed it of much needed intensity. The author has promise and I look forward to his new book.
