 Geraldine McEwan is Miss Jane Marple. She has now a past, which is O.K. although exploited more than necessary. Yes, Joan Hickson was good, but Ms. McEwan is great. She has this wonderful twinkle of naughtiness in her eyes and a sense of humor just Agatha Christie must have visualized Miss Marple to be. The village background is astonishingly good. Looks as if photographed probably through a filter; the colors stand out, the reds and blues are vivid. The village is a real English countryside. The setting is pure nostalgia. Acting is uniformly competent, no wonder, given the parade of stars that play the parts.  Now, who thought of focusing on Raymond Chandler's The Simple Art of Murder, as the book Miss Marple was reading in Murder at the Vicarage? Is it a joke? For Chandler disliked village mysteries, hated Christie and Sayers. His article, The Simple Art of Murder lambasted the golden age mystery writers. So why this particular book on Miss Marple's bedside table? And then, consider this, The Simple Art of Murder, the book, a compilation of various Chandler works was not published till 1950! And Murder at the Vicarage was published in 1930 and set in those wonderful and peaceful years before Hitler. Come on, we are all mystery fans and such things cannot be overlooked.  Yes, the whole series is full of more sex, salty language and women in bikinis than previous Christie mysteries (forget the godawful Endless Night)but that's all right. Mrs. Christie was no prude. She, like all good writers of that age, hinted at rather than wrote explicitly about sexual escapades. A lesson to more hard boiled colleagues, her books have survived for more than eighty years; and as things are going, she might become like Shakespeare. Everyone can interpret her wonderful stories their way and prove that good mysteries don't die.  Worth watching.
