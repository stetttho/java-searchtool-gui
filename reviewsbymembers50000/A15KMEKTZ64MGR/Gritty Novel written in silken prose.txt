 This is a village mystery but of the kind that would make Miss Marple sit up and bite her tongue. Yet it is not far from what goes on at St. Mary's Mead. The characters are sharp but not described in the overblown manner of the modern novelists. The village, Highfield in Surrey, is typically English but no time is wasted in lulling us with its beguiling description. It is after the War and action starts, thankfully, from the very first page and does not relent. Inspector Madden, a man of intensity, himself a survivor of the trenches, is an understated character. So are the others. The conflicts of the local village officers and Scotland Yard are mentioned but not glossed over. The author has plenty of material to keep the mystery on a taut stretch without taking excursions on side roads. That is perhaps the best part of the book; in these days of writers overindulging in their writing which leaves readers (at least some of them) gasping for an abridgement -Elizabeth George, for instance, Mr. Airth keeps his writing on a tight leash. The book moves like a well edited movie. The reflected horrors of the war are stark and far removed from what Bulldog Drummond experienced.  Cleverly the author leads us to the denouement and the truth is not what one was led to believe.  So what more does one want? A very good mystery, violent for those that enjoy it, sophisticatedly complicated which is what I enjoy, and written in a silken smooth prose that is shorn of pretence. Somehow in this atmosphere the explicit torrid love scene between Madden and Helen Blackwell seems out of place.  A wonderful suspense novel, one that I missed on first appearance. Now I am gleefully opening the first pages of The Blood-Dimmed Tide.
