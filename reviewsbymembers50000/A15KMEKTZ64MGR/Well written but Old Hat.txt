 Starts off with a young Oxford Historian and his girl friend getting fed up and 'retiring' to live at a place where Daniel Kind, the historian, lived and remembers a brutal murder. His father, the policeman was never convinced of the guilt of the man presumed to have committed the crime, but who died-accidentally or by suicide. He left our hero and his family and Daniel exhibits the usual angst of sons in this situation. One of his father's old flames, Hannah Scarlett, now is in charge of 'cold crimes' and reopens the case. She has a relationship which began at the time of the murder.  Nicely written, very atmospheric, and lyrical language which enhances the Cumbrian landscape. But the characters behave in predictable ways, the domestic squabbles of Daniel and Miranda are hackneyed. The usual village gossipers want to let well alone. 'No good will come out of digging into the past,' etc.  It actually reads like Christie's Hercule Poirot tackling old mysteries. Unfortunately for the author, while Mrs. Christie's books ran to about two hundred pages, this one, at twice the length, fails to totally snare the readers' attention. But in the end, it is a solid mystery, none too distinguished but then everyone cannot be another Reginal Hill.
