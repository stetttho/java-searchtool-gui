 I loved Mr. Taylor's first book, the iridiscent Caroline Miniscule. I have tried to read his 'village mysteries' and found them rather heavy going. I just loved Quincunx (by Charles Palliser). I am surprised at some of the rave reviews this book is getting.  The atmosphere is fine, the characters, especially the women are predictable. Edgar Allan Poe is a small boy and the mystery involves his buddy's family. What's the point of making such a noise about Poe in this book? This is one of my main bones of contention with the book. The other is the over writing that has become the hallmark of most writers. Yes, I did read the entire An Instance of the Fingerpost, a much superior thriller. An average Regency mystery. I got tired of the repeated 'thrashing' of the students. So got the Crime Dagger for the best Historical Mystery! Left me quite cold.
