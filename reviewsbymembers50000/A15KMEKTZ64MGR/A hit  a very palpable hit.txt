 It is impossible not be impressed by Shakespeare's genius, no matter who he was. Modern language has been practically written by him, for e.g. 'my salad days', 'murder most foul', 'method in madness','ides of March', 'cold comfort', and the list is endless.  Mr. Greenblatt's excellent, well researched and exciting biography is a great read ( a five star is the highest of recommendations). So some critics are saying it is not biography but fiction. No, it is not. The author presents a meticulously crafted thesis.  Why did Shakespeare leave Stratford and go to London? He takes the prevalent view it was conflict with Sir Thomas Lucy ( he had been caught poaching and dealt with harshly) and with an analysis that virtually is a short history of Tudor/Stuart England, comes to the conclusion that Shakespeare might have had underground Catholic leanings and that led to his 'escaping' from his home town, not to be caught by religious witch hunters.  Is it true? Mr. Greenblatt with evident fervour, quotes Shakespeare's own words as proof, as he does with his supposed 'happy' marriage with Anne Hathaway, to conclude differently.  History, facts, Shakespeare's poetry and author's scholarship are all in  skilfull melt in this book.  A nipping and an eager book, well worth the time of anyone who likes Shakespeare, English Language, Poetry and History of England.
