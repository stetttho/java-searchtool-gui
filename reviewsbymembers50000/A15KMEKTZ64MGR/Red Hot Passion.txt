 A Very Insipid Passion (what a title!) is really a red hot passionate tale. Full of witty intrigues, and a mystery that is reminiscent of the best of the classic fiction of the genre.  The premise is so magnificent! An English Physician (who has a mysterious past) has made a serious suicide attempt because there are no more new Agatha Christie novels to read. As part of his therapy, he gets to participate in a murder investigation that has enough twists and turns to baffle the architect of Minos' Labyrinth. The characters are lively and their  drinking habits will send any like minded Bacchanalic to the nearest pub to quench their thirst which develops as one reads the book. Pub owners should be ordering this book. However, Martin, Halley and Sandy are far from the morose alcoholics of Chandler and Hammett. They seem to share Fat Andy Dalziel's love for single malt whiskeys and enjoy their own bibulous escapades. There are glamorous women, and they provide much fun whether they are sleeping in bed with a pillow in between the occupants or trying to kill themselves or just enjoying the fun with the men! Inspector Dobbelia Smith with her quaint English phrasings will certainly become a favorite. (Can she be patterned after Watson or Hastings?) A delightful confection, very reminiscent of Mrs. Christie's wonderful books (there are references to some of Christie's works) and will be an ideal gift for the frustrated Christie fans for this Christmas. The reason I have deducted a star is the less than competent editing and some overlooked typos. A grand read. Enjoy!
