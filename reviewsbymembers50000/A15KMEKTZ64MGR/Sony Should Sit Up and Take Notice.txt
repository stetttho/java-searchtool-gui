 I returned the SONY DVD/VHS combo: because it does not allow for internal recording from DVD (non-copyrighted) to VHS. I wanted to copy some home made DVD-R to VHS for friends who don't have a DVD player. So I bought this one. Someone complained of the remote control layout: I found it very easy to use.  The quality of VHS playback is very good.  All functions work well.  Now perhaps someone can tell me, why I need to connect with components out (another expensive piece of cable) to obtain progressive scan picture? Overall a sound investment
