 When it works, it is very good; quality of video and sound captures is great. Unfortunately the problems are: 1. Recognizing the hardware, repeated rebooting and power on and off to start it. 2. Ulead Software, absolutely fantastic when it works, freezes for no reason. THE WORST FEATURE IS THE SUPPORT: NON EXISTENT. AFTER MORE THAN A WEEK'S WAITING AND SENDING TWO E-MAILS OF DISTRESS TO SUPPORT, THE REPLY WAS WHICH VERSION OF CAPWHIZ? COME ON, ASK THAT ON THE DROP DOWN MENU WHEN HELP IS SOUGHT WHEN OTHER RELEVANT QUESTIONS ARE ASKED. I am still in two minds about returning it, awaiting tech support reply after giving them information that it is CAPWHIZ 3.0 Any help from other users?
