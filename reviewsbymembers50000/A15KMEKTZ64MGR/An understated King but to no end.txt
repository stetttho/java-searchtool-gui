 The concept is great. Lurid cover. New and reprinted mysteries. And Stephen King for the first title! It cannot fail! That it does is because of the book itself. First, let me tell you, I am not a King fan. Rather, I used to be one, I lost all interest in him when he expanded into meaningless balloons of literature. So it was encouraging to see the length of the book. The beginning is wonderful. The book has a nice old fashioned touch to it. It follows classic lines of two people telling a story to an admiring co-worker, a woman. (Is that her picture on the cover? I had a different idea of how she looked from the book). A perfect ghost story technique! I can bet if a new writer tried this style, no agent would touch the book with a ten foot pole, it is that ancient. But in King's hand it becomes very palatable. Avoiding exaggerations and adolescent cursing-which have become the hallmark of Mr. King's writings- the story moves along till the end where he packs up his gears, shuts down the barn door and goes to sleep. What about the readers? Not every story in real life has a beginning, middle and end. But, please, give us a break! A mystery has to have an end. Sometimes even the most fantastic one would do instead of none. A good morsel of steak(!)that's so well done as to be unchewable-literally.
