 This is a great CD by a great master. Shri Maharajapuram Santanam was a true master in the traditional mould - he was actually 7th generation in the direct disciplinic lineage from Swami Tyagaraja himself. The production and recording quality of this CD are excellently done by Music Today and the choice of performances is very diverse and satisfying. The lyrics of many of the performances are in Classical Telugu with a lot of Sanskrit and some actually in Sanskrit (Ex: Shankari Samkuru in Raga Kambhoji) allowing people from all parts of India to appreciate the music. You need expect nothing short of the best from Maharajapuram Santanam, no "experiments" or gimmickery. The best traditional renditions.
