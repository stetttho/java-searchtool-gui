 This collection is a true treasure-trove of music from another era that is difficult to come by. It also covers a wide variety of music by great artists that is hard to find on store shelves nowadays. Beginning with Alap and Dhamar by the Dagar brothers in Ahir Bhairav, we move on to one of the most beautiful Khyals I have ever heard, by the late Ustad Yunus Husain Khan of the Agra Gharana in Raga Sujani Malhar, a Raga that he composed in memory of his ancestor and progenitor of his gharana, Nayak Sujan. In fact Yunus Husain Khan composed the beautiful lyric for the khyal himself as well with his pen-name "Darpan". You could buy this set for that one performance - but there is plenty more. There is a rare Rudra Veena performance by a young Ustad Asad Ali Khan in Raga Vasant, raw and energetic. Then there is the only performance on a Surshringar that I could find - in Raga Miyan Ki Malhar with Sulalit Sinha on Surshringar and Manfred Junius on Surbahar doing a short Alaap and a vigorous Bandish in Chautal in Raga Miyan ki Malhar with thunderous Pakhawaj accompaniment evoking a storm. This is a real collectors treasure.
