 This is a solid compilation and would be a great reference or a gift. The artists featured are top-notch: Buddhadev Dasgupta, Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia, etc., The text is concise and helpful. The quality of the recordings is excellent and I loved the colourful booklet. However, the 74 ragas performed are not full-fledged performances as such but more like compressed demo pieces, so an expert listener may not enjoy it as much - but the average listener probably would not appreciate a 75 minute performance of Raga Multani anyway.
