 Just like the character Chauncy played by Peter sellers in the movie, the movie seems to invite many interpretations with people finding all kinds of meanings in the movie.  The movie tells the story of an imbecile gardener (Peter Sellers playing Chauncy/Chance) who is mistaken for a man of profound wisdom ending up with the Presidenf of the U.S quoting him as an expert. Everybody seems to see what they would like in him and his enigmatic personality, all the while projecting their own perceptions and needs on to him. The sly lawyer thinks he is a scamster, the billionaire's daughter finds a potential lover in him. However, it does seem that for some reason all of the characters in the movie are hell-bent on deluding themselves about Chauncy. Peter Sellers gives a weird performance as a TV-remote toting gardener who speaks with a British accent.
