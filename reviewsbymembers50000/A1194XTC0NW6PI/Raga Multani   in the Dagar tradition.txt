 The Dagar brothers perform a full rendition of the Raga Multani here with an extensive Alaap, a Dhrupad and a Dhamaar. The Raga Multani is said to be a speciality of the Dagar family and it is easy to see why. Raga Multani has a certain restless feeling to it that only comes out in a full Dhrupad Alaap in the hands of masters like the Dagar brothers - no prolonged rambling Khyals here. There is also a recording of this same Dhrupad with Alaap on Cello by Nancy Lesh who studied Dhrupad from the Dagar Family.
