 If I were to name the greatest Samurai movie ever, this would be it. Kobayashi tells the story of a Samurai reduced to penury upon his clan's abolishment. It is a harrowing tale of Samurai as pawns in the hands of the feudal lords, to kill and be killed at a whim when an ex-samurai (Tsugomo played by Tatsuya Nakadai) sets out to avenge the cruel, forced harakiri of his impoverished son-in-law.  There is great dialogue and plenty of black humour in this movie - especially when Tsugomo sarcastically ridicules the feudal lord and the Samurai code. This movie avoids the "Samurai gets mad and chops up dozens" formula and depicts action sequences extremely realistically. The narration style is flawless and movie is perfect in every detail. The great Tatsuya Nakadai gives a truly amazing performance. Especially not to be missed are Tsugomo confronting the feudal lord's arrogant Samurai on a windswept field and the explosive ending.
