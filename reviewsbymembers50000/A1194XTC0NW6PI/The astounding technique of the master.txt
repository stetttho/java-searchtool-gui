 There are no words to describe the music of Asad Ali Khan. Listening to his rendition of Raaga Asavari sends thrills through my body every time. If there is music that one can never tire of listening to, this is it. His  powerful right hand technique and pulling technique demonstrate his  tremendous control over this powerful instrument and his musical genius.  The last master of the Rudra Veena, the noblest and most ancient of Indian  instruments played only by the finest and the greatest musicians. Even the  ancient tradition of the music he plays, the Kandharbani of Dhrupad is of  the noblest order. This is not music to be listened to triflingly.
