 The amazing genius of Ustad Salamat Ali at it's height in jugalbandi with his late brother Nazakat Ali. This rendition of Raaga Darbari Kannada is by far the closest to my heart. I was skeptical before I heard it, but his  music is unlike any other Hindustani artist that I have heard. His amazing  technique of singing sargam and aakar taans replete with subtle gamaks and  brilliant taranas has to be heard to be believed. Sadly, the gharana that he hails from has no living representatives in India. No lover of  Hindustani classical can aford to miss this recording.  UPDATE: I recently found out that the Drut Khyal "Anokha Ladla" that they perform on this recording is a song on Lord Ram's childhood. "anokha ladla khelan ko mange chanda" - as in the Ramayana. Just another thing that makes this CD so much sweeter.
