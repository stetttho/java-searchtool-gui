 Emani Shankara Shastri was the Guru of the other Great Master Chitti Babu. This CD has a very good selection of many well known Karnatic compositions probably compiled with the casual listener in mind rather than for the expert listener since there are no elaborate Ragam-Tanam-Pallavi style tracks on this CD. This CD will be an excellent addition to anyone's music collection.
