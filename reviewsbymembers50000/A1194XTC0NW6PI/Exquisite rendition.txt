 This is a great CD where Shri Buddhadev Dasgupta gives the "full treatment" to the Raga Naiki Kanada. The raga has a majestic sound to it from the Kanada side and in the hands of a master like Buddhadev Dasgupta comes out shining. The Alaap and the Gats are exquisite and immensely enjoyable. I have had the pleasure of meeting Buddhadev Dasgupta at believe it or not, a concert by Ustad Ali Akbar khan. His music reflects his personality, solid in it's grounding in tradition and solid in his direct approach with no gimmickery.
