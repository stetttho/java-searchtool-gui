 Raga Desh is one Raga that I could recognize even before I knew anything about classical music, and I believe every Indian irrespective of familiarity with classical music will know it by it's sound. It is the Raga to which the National Song of India, "Vande Mataram" is set. It is an amazingly beautiful Raga, full of inspiring, uplifting sentiment and Shri Debu Chowdhuri does not disappoint with an exquisite Alaap. The Sitar that Debu Chowdhuri uses has a nice shimmering sound to it that sounds very nice as well.
