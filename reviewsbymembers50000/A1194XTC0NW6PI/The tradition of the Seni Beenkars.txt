 The first Raga (Puriya Kalyan) is presented in the Seni Beenkar style. The Seni Beenkars are descendents of the legendary Tansen from his daughters side. Although there are no living descendents of Tansen that play the noble Rudra Veena (The Seni Beenkars) today, the tradition has been adapted to instruments like Sitar  and Sarod by the Ravi Shankar's Guru the great Ustad Allauddin Khan. The sitar used by Ravi Shankar here is similarly adapted to play the deep and stately Dhrupad style. He presents a more traditional Alap, Jod and a brilliant Jhalla with sections of the last two perfomed with accompaniment of a Pakhavaj-like tabla in Chautal. He rearely records this extremely rare and difficult style(I know of only one other recording available) probably due to his reverence to his Guru and the tradition. If you already have heard Ravi Shankar, this recording is unlike any other. I would sincerely recommend this CD to anyone interested in the art of Dhrupad.
