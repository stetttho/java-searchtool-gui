 I love Shri Debu Chowduri's Alaap in Raga Lalit. As far as the Alaap is concerned, it is very much in the mould of the tradition of his Guru Ustad Mushtaq Ali Khan. He likes to do an elaborate Alap building up to a short and brilliant Jor with an even shorter Jhalla. The effect is surprisingly pleasant and it does not give you a pounding headache from excessive jhalla-ing. I do agree with the earlier reviewer about his Gat. I feel Debu Chowdhuri is rather idiosyncratic in his approach to his music and the Gat seemed rather helter-skelter with his penchant for sudden runs across the scale. This should not discourage the music enthusiast however, because the Alaap is truly exquisite and I buy his CDs only for the Alaap. His Sitar has a strange shimmering sound to it that goes amazingly with this beautiful morning Raga.
