 "Darpan" was his Pen-name. I particularly like the renditions of "Raga Path Bihag" (CD 1) and "Raga Rageshvari" (CD 2) where he launches into an unexpected but brilliant Hori Dhamaar after the Drut Khyal. The last great master of the pure Agra Gharana -> robust, masculine Dhrupad-influenced Khyal. The Sarangi sounds exquisite with his vocals unlike most recordings where it comes out sounding muted or too thin. If you are a Hindustani music enthusiast, this CD is a must.
