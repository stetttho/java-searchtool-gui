 This movie is like a ticking time-bomb. I never imagined that I could actually enjoy watching two guys drive a ton of explosives at 15 miles per hour and find it entertaining: it is actually nerve-wracking! Yves Montand gives a great performance as the protagonist Mario and Charles Vanel gives a trememdous and touching performance as Jo, a tough bully who turns out to be a scared old man, both of whom risk their lives for a ticket to a better life. The movie seems to be about the irony of down-and-out humans gambling with their lives for a way out of their desperate existance.
