 This is an amazing movie that explores the vanity and ruin of a once-prosperous feudal landlord (Biswambhar Roy) in Bengal around the turn of the century. Roy is a man who can not come to terms with a fast-changing world where his old feudal order is slowly disappearing and he is being upstaged by a vulgar money-lender (Ganguly) upstart whose family were once his beneficiaries and whom he considers beneath contempt for his lack of refinement. Even as he loses all else that he held dear, Roy remains a Zamindar to the end and decides on one last party in his Jalsaghar (music hall) that has remained closed for so long to teach the upstart a lesson. The movie features excellent black-and-white cinematography, great acting and of course, the genius of Ray's direction.  To the lovers of music, this movie features a real treasure-trove of music with music direction by the late great Ustad Vilayat Khan, vocals by Akhtari Bai and a rare classic by the late Pakistani singer Salamat Ali Khan who was only 19 when he was recorded for this movie.
