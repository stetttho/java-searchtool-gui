 This is a great recording. There are precious few recordings of Ustad Asad Ali Khan and this one is a solid performance. He meticulously plays each traditionally prescribed phase of the Alaap as demanded by his tradition, a lengthy Tarparan after the main Bandish - this is the part that I love the most in Asad Ali Khan's music - the excellent improvisation with the Pakhawaj. Some tend to do the Tarparan part at the end of the Jhala before the Bandish as Ravi Shankar does on his recording of Raga Puriya Kalyan and Asad Ali Khan plays it after the Bandish. I also want to clarify a point regarding a previous reviewer who seems to think Asad Ali Khan plays the "Sitar Idiom" and not "Rudra Veena Ideal" which is pretty strange since every aspect of the traditional Sitar Alap is a exact replica of the Rudra Veena tradition. If he intends to cast that aspersion on Asad Ali Khan's music, he should mention which aspect of Asad Ali Khan's music is representative of the "Sitar idiom". Also, there is and was no "one Rudra Veena Ideal" ever. There are/were many traditions of Veena playing and Asad Ali Khan is faithful to his tradition which is no less legitimate than Shamsuddin Faridi or anyone else's. The reviewer seemed to have been excessively swayed by the liner notes while not being able to correlate them to the actual performance => the notes that casually mention peripheral influences on the Jaipur Beenkar's tradition and the changes in the construction of the Rudra Veena that were necessitated by the need to give it a lengthier life and better sound quality.
