 This is a real beauty of a devotional album. Especially O.S Arun's rendering of the traditional "Chalo Mann Ganga Jamuna Teer" by Meera and Tulsi Das's "Gopala Gokula" are breathtakingly melodious and beautiful. The orchestration is traditional and unobtrusive: Tabla, Violin and Harmonium that stays where it belongs, unobtrusive in a supporting role. The overall effect is very soothing and inspiring. The quality of recording is also excellent. A thorougly satisfying CD.
