 This is an exquisite performance indeed. This is one of those few recordings of Sitar music that I truly treasure. His Alaap technique is solidly based to the Dhrupad tradition of Vishnupur and Manilal Nag is a true master of the instrument. Many a time a solid Alaap can be ruined by a poor Gat, not in this case. He chooses beautiful compositions to accompany his excellent Alaap. This one is a masterpiece.
