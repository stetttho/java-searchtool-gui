 A man of acute perception and immense integrity. One of the greatest social and political writers of India. Just like every other writing of his, a thorough and clear analysis of the missionary institution, it's ideology and practices as applicable to Indian society. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in contemporary social issues in India.
