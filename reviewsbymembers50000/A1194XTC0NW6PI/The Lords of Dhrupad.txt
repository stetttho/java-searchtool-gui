 The absolute lords of this noble, majestic and ancient tradition. The Malliks have preserved the tradition of Dhrupad in their family for hundreds of years. Dhrupad is an extermely rigorous and difficult discipline that takes a lifetime to learn and precious few have the ability to master. This CD is a treasure trove of rare Dhrupads probably existing only in their family. There are Dhrupads composed by Swami Haridas Dagur (Tansen's guru.15th century) and Sadarang (Niyamat Khan, father of Khyal.18th century) among others on this CD. The Malliks' powerful yet clear and sensitive rendering of the compositions is a sheer pleasure to listen to. The accompanying booklet is very good with translations of the lyrics and notes on the Ragas. The vocals are unbelievably powerful, complex and vigorous; accompanied by the deep, intricate rhythms played on the ancient Pakhavaj drum. I have had the pleasure of seeing them in concert twice on two consecutive evenings in the New York area, this CD comes close to that experience. If you listen to Hindustani music, this CD will open your mind to an experience unlike anything you have heard before. My gratitude to the Malliks for their incredible music.
