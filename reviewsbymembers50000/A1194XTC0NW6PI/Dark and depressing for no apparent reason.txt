 Overall, this movie fails to move the viewer. Tatsuya Nakadai gives a great performance as the pointlessly cruel Samurai who embarks on a course of self-destruction following a vile past of evil. The movie has a very forgettable appearance by Toshiro Mifune as a fencing teacher and seems to build up to a final confrontation with his student that never happens. Your time will be better spent watching Kobayashi's Harakiri or Samurai Rebellion if you like more serious drama or Kurosawa's Yojimbo or Hidden Fortress if you like adventure.
