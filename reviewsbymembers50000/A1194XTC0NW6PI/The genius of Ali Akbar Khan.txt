 To those not very familiar with Hindustani Classical music, Ustad Ali Akbar Khan is the Son of the legendary Ustad Allauddin Khan (also the Guru of Ravi Shankar). Raga Chandranandan is his own creation and among his performances of this Raga, this is the most brilliant. This is one of those recordings that I can not tire of repeated listening. This is Hindustani Classical at it's absolute best.
