 This is a rare film that combines amazing storytelling, excellent technique, well developed characters, excellent cast and the best Samurai action sequences ever filmed. Truly a Samurai film for the intelligent cinema-lover. It is an excellently presented drama about a Samurai who chooses to rebel against the feudal lord in whose service he has spent his entire life. Most of the movie explores the transformation of a respected Samurai who retires to a life of gentle liesure into a heroic rebel who defies his lord for the honour of his son and daugter-in-law even as the rest of his family deserts him. The dialogue and steadily paced narration is excellent as it builds up to an explosive climax.
