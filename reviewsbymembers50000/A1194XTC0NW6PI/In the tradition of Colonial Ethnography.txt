 It is arguable that Manu Smriti is a text that is as important as it is claimed by this author. The Manu Smriti is virtually unknown in Southern India (Traditional Vedic Hinduism survived virtually intact here) and definitely not considered an integral part of Vedic Learning. The claim that Manu Smriti defines Hindu Moral law is absurd since each region and sect of Hindus have their own Smritis and traditions. The true moral code accepted by all Hindus is in the Mahabharata, the Bhagavad Gita and the Ramayana.  An earlier reviewer above seems to be under the impression that Women were "purposefully left uneducated" in India - this is a simple case of absolute ignorance of Indian history and total acceptance of the British Colonialist misrepresentation. This book is truly in the tradition of condescending colonial interpretation of Indian history and society which denies India a history, it's people a consciousness and projects the entire history of India through the narrow prism of Colonial and Jesuit misrepresentation. These Indologists have done enough damage to India in colonial times by projecting literature that suited their purposes as the soul of India. It is sad that this tradition survives to this day.
