 This is the best Hindustani Classical album I have bought in a number of years. I have an earlier album of Shri Indrakishore Mishra from Makar Records from which I was familiar with his austere style and his virtually unknown tradition and have always loved his music for his immense sincerety, strict adherence to an otherwise completely forgotten tradition and deep contrast with the "popular" versions of Dhrupad that we hear nowadays. Discovering Shri Indrakishore Mishra's music is like opening a door into the distant past and you can't help but admire this unassuming master of Dhrupad.  The liner notes by Deepak Raja are extensive and very helpful in understanding and appreciating the music. For all those that have an interest in Dhrupad, this album is an absolute must.
