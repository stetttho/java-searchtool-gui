 The last living master of the Rudra Veena, the noblest and most ancient of Indian instruments played only by the finest and the greatest musicians. There are no words to describe the music of Asad Ali Khan. Listening to his rendition of Raaga Asavari is a highly emotional experience every time. If there is music that one can never tire of listening to, this is it. His powerful right hand technique and pulling technique demonstrate his mastery of this ancient instrument. Even the ancient tradition of the music he plays, the Kandarbani of Dhrupad is of the noblest order. This is not music to be listened to triflingly.
