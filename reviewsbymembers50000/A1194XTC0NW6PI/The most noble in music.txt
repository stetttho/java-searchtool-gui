 The most amazing musician in my opinion. This CD and the other CD with his performances in Ragas Kapi and Pantuvarali are some of the greatest recordings on the Vina. The nobility of the musical tradition and the maturity of the music were very much a part of Chitti Babu's personality and his performances. It is an Amazingly emotional experience to listen to Chitti Babu every time.
