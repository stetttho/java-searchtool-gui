 Don't be put off by the corny cover-shot, this is an excellent album. There are so many poor performances of Raga Darbari Kannada, you can usually tell the caliber of the artist by his performance of it. The Gats in Darbari Kanada is simply excellent. The instrument is exotic by all standards and the sound is lovely.
