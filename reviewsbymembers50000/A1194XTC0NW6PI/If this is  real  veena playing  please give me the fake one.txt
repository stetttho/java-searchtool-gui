 Tradition is a fragile and valuble thing. Tradition is the basis of culture and culture is what makes art noble. Shamsuddin Faridi is a maverick in every sense of the word. The Alap that he presents is the most haphazard sequence of boing boings masquerading as an Alap I have ever heard. A performance of a Raga is meant to evoke a mood, a sentiment, not to numb you with haphazard movements and stange pauses only to make more such noises. Overall, the Alap was a complete letdown. If you want to hear a real Alap, listen to masters like Asad Ali Khan or Bahauddin Dagar or better still, Zia Mohiuddin Dagar.  The area where Shamsuddin Faridi excels is in the plucking technique. Apparently he has mastered many different mizrab and plucking styles and this is borne out in the sometimes impressive Bandish. However, no sooner than he starts the Bandish than he rushes into improvisations - one wishes he returned to the beautiful sthayi at least once.  Overall:  1) The Pakhawaj accompaniment is excellent (1 star)  2) The Bandish is enjoyable in parts (1 star).  3) Recording and sound are good (1/2 star)  Since I can't give 2.5 stars, I shall give this 3.
