 This is simply one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen. Shot in stark black-and-white with excellent screenplay and direction, it has the most unexpected ending I have ever seen in a movie. Suffice it to say that the movie does a complete u-turn about midway. It is a movie about the brutality of war, occupation and how kindness is often repaid by cruelty.
