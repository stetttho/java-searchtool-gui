 Shri Balamurali Krishna is considered one of the greatest Karnatic Classical vocalists. Although I do not have this album, since this is the only one listed by Amazon, I will sincerely recommend his music to any lover of Indian classical music. His mellifluous voice and rendition is unlike any other. Also, this album covers compositions of Swami Tyagaraja, the legendary 18th century saint composer and reviver of Karnatic classical music.
