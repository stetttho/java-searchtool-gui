 I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the Malliks of Darbhanga sang Khyal too and with such awesome mastery and presicion as I have not seen elsewhere. I especially find their forceful but precise style very applealing. They are masters of Dhrupad and it shows in their massive, powerful style. Their vigorous vocals are especially refreshing when compared to many contemporary vocalists with no power in their vocal chords.  Their taans are absolute marvels of rhythmic and tonal precision. It is an absolute delight to hear them do sargams and deliver the same note clusters in taans. The compositions they perform are also very special. Being Dhrupad singers, they sing the lyrics with absolute clarity. I consder it an honour just to hear them.  No fan of Indian music can afford to miss their music.
