 I've read and reread this book more times than the typical Texan has had her hair frosted this year.  Fun, witty and full of not-so-known southern trivia, it makes those of us born North of the M-D feel shorted.   Read this book and you'll fall in love with tomato sandwiches and keen your eye to scout out sterling silver Co-Cola tumblers.  There are moments, while looking over my pool, that I imagine a group of Russian's bathing with my best soap.--Laurel825
