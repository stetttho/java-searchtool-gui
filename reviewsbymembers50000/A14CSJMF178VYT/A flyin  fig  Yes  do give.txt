 A haunting book who's scenes I still see at times. Not too heavy in details so as to bog things down, but just right. Coffee cups, bathrobes and unmade beds become talismen of the tale. In real life, I doubt the fait accompli of the pilot would fly for long. "The Policeman's Wife", "The Salesmen's Wife"; not quite the same ring to it. And, in print, there's some measure of sympathy for all 3 adults and what is assumed to be their visions of circumstance.--Laurel825
