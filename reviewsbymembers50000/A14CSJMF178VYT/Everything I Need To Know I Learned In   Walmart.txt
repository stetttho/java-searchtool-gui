 A depressing book, not from poor writing, but from detailing the poor (in finances and apparent joy) lives of so many people.   The author, while always having her "out" to return home, does a fairly deep job of digging in with the working class of minimum wage.  One aspect that I seemed to miss was how she cashed her paychecks - another hassle for thousand's of "unbanked" Americans.   People might remember "He who walks between the rows" of Children Of The Corn.  Who knew there was the equivilant at Walmart - He who walks between the racks?  --Laurel825
