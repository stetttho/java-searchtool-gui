 Musty homes, heavy draperies, wild gardens, untamed sexuality and The Devil coming to dinner.  A dish best served in the heat of Summer. This is a mammoth book - over 900 pages.  My first reading took 4 weeks; I've heard others say the same.  Don't be put off; what it lacks in quickness it makes up for by opening a door, inviting the reader in...and slowly shutting it behind you.   Psssst...LASHER! --Laurel825
