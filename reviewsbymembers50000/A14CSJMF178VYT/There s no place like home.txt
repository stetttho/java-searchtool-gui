 Kathy Nicolo would kiss the ground to have the heel-clicking talent of Dorothy in this painful tale of stupidity, indecision and desire. When two people, in dire straits, battle for one roof, no one is thinking straight.  Good is not white.  Bad is not black.  The grey, ecru and taupe fog we all sometimes walk in is colored perfectly here.   No poppy seed naps or helpful men behind curtains, a great story with no happy ending. --Laurel825
