 A few years ago Stephen Heywood was a great looking guy with a seemingly unending future.  Raised among academia and European holidays, he chose a different path, becoming a carpenter.    While other guys might make sure that the car was vacuumed out before a date, Stephen was concerned with having to start the car with his left hand, his right seemingly unable to turn the key. But, the object of his affection takes his hand anyway, beginning the journey together, towards...?  The reader learns that Heywood's affliction is ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease).  Choices are to be made:  To continue living life as he knows it, with needed changes along the way.  The romance turns to marriage and later, he's blessed with becoming a dad.  His brother leaves a career to pioneer in ALS research and fundraising.    This story is one worth knowing and certainly one a reader will remember.  While disease may tether someone to the ground like Gulliver, as long as the brain can think, think, think! the giant survives.  -Laurel825
