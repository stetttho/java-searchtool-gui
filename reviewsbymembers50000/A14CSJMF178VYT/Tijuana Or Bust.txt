 Is the key to happiness having a great love who is nice enough to kick the bucket many years before you?  Or, dreaming of a ripe tomato while shivering through another Illinois winter?   From My Mexican Kitchen: Techniques and Ingredients by Diana Kennedy conjures up life,love, lemon zest and a zest for living that begs the above question.  A beautifully photographed book, including references to her previous cookbooks, she inspires us to reach beyond tacos. Diana Kennedy is a  Mexican food anthropologist. Kennedy, a Brit, has taken on south of the border cuisine and the country as her second home. Her spouse, a guy who looked like Spencer Tracey (Coming from the Mrs. herself.) passed away in 1967. In the time since, his widow has gone on to be THE expert at mining what goes into great Mexican food and being awarded that country's highest civilian honor.   Would she?...Could she?...have accomplished that had her spouse been by her side all these years? Is there something to be said about mad passion and seeing it buried that allows some women to bloom in rich soil in a way not seen among retiree couples playing shuffle board in Florida today?     I immediatly liked Diana Kennedy. There is a crusty, damish, no guff quality to her that makes the reader feel as if sitting on a kitchen stool, watching her work and digesting tidbits to get through life in a gutsy way.   When life throws tomatos, make salsa.   Ole!  --Laurel825
