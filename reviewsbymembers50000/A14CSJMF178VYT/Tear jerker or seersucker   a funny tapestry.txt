 What can a small-boned (...)kid of Greek origin hailing from Raleigh, North Carolina have to offer readers of middle America today?  If that kid grows to become the hilarious, poignant, National Public Radio and David Letterman favorite , David Sedaris, the answer is "A lot!"    His background may be different from yours, but his thumb easily gravitates to a familiar pulse, particularly for those who grew up with a semi-rounded spoonful of dysfunction.    The memory of his father's pipedream of owning a beach house is detailed of the ride there (in the family car...and the emotional trip) and knowing, all along, that being let down is just a turn away.   A tale of childhood stings is followed by laugh-out-loud moments.  Read the passage about his brother's dog's special talent and try to say the phrase "on tap" without giggling; I can't.    While Sedaris' work is written for oral presentation, it speaks well to the reader.  Whatever you clothe your family in, dress-up part of your day with a book that deserves your time like this gem. --Laurel825
