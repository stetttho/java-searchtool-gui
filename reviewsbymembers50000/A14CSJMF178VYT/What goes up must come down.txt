 I'm training for a regional pogo stick competition.  This garment has proved to be a wise buy; I wear it for daily workouts and free form pogoing. (ie. Incorporating side kicks and jazz hands.)  If only our team uniform wasn't a bikini, I'd be clad in my AKIL3MSB while going for the Gold! --Laurel825
