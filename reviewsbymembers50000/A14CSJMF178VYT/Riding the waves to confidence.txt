 Not since Charles Schultz introduced "Frieda" and her "naturally curly hair" to the world of Peanuts (and the world in general in 1961) as the rebel against straight hair, has curly/wavy haired women had such a friend.  Where Schultz dropped his pencil, Lorraine Massey takes up the wide-toothed comb, dispensing advice on what to do and more importantly, what NOT to do in order to make peace with the follicles you were "blessed" with in Curly Girl The Handbook.  Massey, co-owner of the New York salon Devachan, and a curly girl herself, schools the frizz prone masses on discovering what type of curl you have  - Corkscrew, Botticelli or (like yours truly) Wavy.  Some of her suggestions, mainly going without shampoo and cleansing the hair with alternative products, might be met with the "ewww" factor, but many women swear by it, given the testimonials contained in the book.  She encourages readers to seek out salons that are willing to be curl-friendly (and willing to trim the hair while dry) and not view less-than-spaghetti straight hair as something to be cut, thinned, and texturized into submission. While some of her homemade concoctions seem, well, concocted and her styling suggestions might not work for people needing a more professional look, her good intentions make me to give this book a bouncy "B".  Published in 2002, Curly Girl has become a sleeper hit among books, fueled in part by haircare websites such as Naturallycurly.com. Frieda would declare that she could do anything because she had naturally curly hair.  We should all have Frieda's self-acceptance! --Laurel825
