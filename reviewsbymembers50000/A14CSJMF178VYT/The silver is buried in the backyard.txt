 The airline stock information is in your grandfather's wardrobe. The coin collection is behind the Meow Mix on the back porch shelf. Your older sister is going to stab you in the back. Your brother's neurosis may be an act. You're a good kid, but you won't pass "GO." Better make your own money.--Laurel825
