 No good deed goes without a good thumping from the universe.  So learns Carl one evening on the train when he throws caution to the wind and does a good deed in The Coma, Alex Garland's third book.   Upon coming to, he's aware that life is not as he left it.  A distant bell rings and he becomes the most aware unconcious man a reader will meet.    While Carl slowly wraps his slumbering mind around his situation, each chapter is illustrated with black and white sketches (by Nicholas Garland), giving the narrative an even more play-like feel; sadly, it's a one-man show that doesn't really go anywhere.    I give a lukewarm recommendation, knowing it may appeal to minds that actually enjoyed Vanilla Sky.  For the rest of us, The Coma is just what the doctor ordered for insomnia; a slow ride to Snoozeville.  --Laurel825
