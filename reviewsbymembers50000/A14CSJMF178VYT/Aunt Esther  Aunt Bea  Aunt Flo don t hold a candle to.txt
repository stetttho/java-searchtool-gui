 Do I feel gipped!  My own Aunt's Barb and Joannie were absolute flops compared to Auntie Mame.   I tripped over the movie version of this tale one afternoon and was smitten by it's over-the-top flinging of conventional life.  In this case, the movie does justice to Mr. Dennis' tale.  Finding an author by accident is a gift...and it doesn't arrive C.O.D. from Macy's at Christmas.  --Laurel825
