 This book is the bible of household cleaning and maintenance concerns.  The fact that St. Cheryl was able to fuse it all together while still having a life is a leap towards Superwomanhood that most of us will never have the tarmac space to make.   Home Comforts is written and organized in a way that makes it incredibly easy to read.  While I doubt most readers will do one tenth of the chores outlined, it's a comfort read; who knew laundry detergent could be interesting to read about?  --Laurel825
