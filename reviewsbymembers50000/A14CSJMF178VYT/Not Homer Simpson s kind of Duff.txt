 Everyone wants to be a star, but no one wants to literally crystalize internally from sarcoidosis.  That is the life, onscreen and off, of Karen "Duff" Duffy. For the unbaptised, if Match Game were still around, Karen Duffy is the kind of all-around celeb that would be the next Brett Somers - Wiseacre, Girl Friday, Broad-in-the-making. She also meets the pain of a chronic disease with a glee that most people could not summon. While a little of the "Duff" persona goes a long way,  the sincerity of "Karen" is good medicine, page by happy spoonful.  --Laurel825
