 Not sure if this book of vignette's would suit Otis Redding, but I found it interesting.  Future fisherwomen are advised to be patient; it's a slow-burner/nibbler and just when you think you've hooked the crook of the story, Jane twists until you've almost lost her.   In youth, Jane is me - Girl Ganglia, tripping over her tongue and legs of knobby knee.  Midway through, she morphed (at least for yours truly) into someone out of Sex And The City.  Jane with Archie could have been Carrie with Big.  Jane with Robert might have been Miranda with....  Begs to wonder how many fictional characters of NYC are somehow stamped with that comparison from today on? --Laurel825
