 Being named after a nut or "human error" dulling his Mensa score are part of the typical day for Daniel Pecan Cambridge, but his story is not your typical read.   It's a knotted twist on what defines "normal" and maneuvering the curbs along the way.   Daniel lives life mainly in his head, entertaining himself (and the reader) with wonders of minutia.  In less talented hands than writer/actor Martin, Daniel might come across menacing; the "elixirs" served to the starlet in his building somehow taste like a kindness, an ear listening, an eye seeing some inner magestic...just like Daniel would like to be seen. He's awarded with "Most Average American" - not bad for someone who knows that acoustical ceiling tiles contain 64 sound-absorbing  holes; a bright fellow who's apartment's total light wattage must be exactly 1125.  Judge only if you don't care how your towels are folded OR if your remote control doesn't have it's "spot" to rest.   This story, Martin's second novel, shines a ray on one idea clearly:  No matter how secular, aloof or protected someone designs their path to be, life has a way of serpentining in and wrapping around "the quiet heart." "One half of my face was shut like a salted snail, while the other half was held open in an attempt to see."  With THAT eye, introduce yourself to The Pleasure Of My Company.  --Laurel825
