 Nora crafted one of my all-time favorite books.  Why I picked up a paperback copy as a freshmen in high school is beyond me.  Why I finally got around to reading it at 18 is also a mystery.  Why I've reread it more times that my dogged copy can tell is no mystery meat; sadness steeped in life's tea.  In real life, I've played the part of the toddler in this tale.  Wish I could say my folks were class acts, such as the author and her former spouse, but chicken fried steak is more common in middle America than Lillian Hellman's Pot Roast. --Laurel825
