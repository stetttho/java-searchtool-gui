 This book was passed on to me (no pun intended) by a relative who's reading tastes don't normally agree with my palate; this story did. Read in nightly bubble baths while recouping from an illness that made me feel like an old sack of bones, I looked forward to it greatly. Susie's narration was hopeful and heartbreaking, and made me remember people I once knew who are no longer. Some, far too early. An odd thing to know they've been dead longer than they were alive...much like Susie. There were a few places that I found plodding, such as the running home in the rain sequence by the sister. More satisfaction with the killer's ultimate end and Susie finally being brought home would have supplied closure to the reader.--Laurel825
