 Was she her father's Cordelia? Was she Sam's Dee? Was she the aloof Miss Grinstead?  While Delia is an odd character, her blandness allows the reader to "wear her" for the moment, just like a new grey dress from downtown Bay Borough. Who has not left the house to take walk, a drive, a cool down? The temptation of one foot before the other, to keep going.... Lesson's learned: You can go home again, so long has home adapts to the new you wanderlust created and your spouse has not legally filed yet. Also, when planning to run away, take underwear.--Laurel825
