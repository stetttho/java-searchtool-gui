 that's exactly what stewart o'nan and steven king are.   fanatics.   there are some criticisms out there that stewart's sections of the book are childish/mud-slinging.   that's true, sure.   but there's no denying that o'nan is a fanatic and has all his heart into the sox.   all of it.   batting practice, autographs collecting various memorbilia.   he follows the sox the same way a child does.   there's something to be said regarding that, and perhaps that's why baseball is america's part time.   men and children alike enjoy it on the same level.   stewarts accounts are analytical regarding each games highlights and lowlights.  i found steven king's writing to be less clinical and more insightful/artistic.   personally, i related to steven's sections better because i don't try to get to every game possible yet watch it on TV like it's religious evangelism.  i only recommend this book to a certain type of person.   one who loves the red sox or one who loves the pure sport of baseball.   reading this book for me was re-living the entire 2004 sox season.   it was particularly fun when i got to games in the book in which i was in attendance.   and like the baseball season, there are dog days of this book.   reading through at points it feels like the marathon that one baseball season is.   as a sox fan, reading this book, the payoff is so much fun reliving.
