 No, it wasn't.   I remember being very excited when Driver 1 was supposed to come out.   You were supposed to be a gangster, running from the law, a game built oin the same engine (same physics) as the destruction derby games.    BUT, whoever made Driver 1 thought it way too controversial to make a villian as the lead, so they decided to make it an "on the run" police officer.   that was weak and i lost interest in it, don't care how great the game was.   do i want a watered down version of an artist's vision?   please, why don't you put that fig leaf on "David"'s unit in Florence. So, here we go, now we have driv3r, a couple years after the GTA wave breaks.   yay!   in driv3r they finally let you get out of the car and do foot missions, fight, shoot, run over people, now that the coast is clear.   there is nothing innovative about what they are trying to do here.   driv3r is not the original.   any company that forfeits it's edginess to be politically correct will not get my money.   might as well have tipper gore in the passenger seat the whole time, telling tanner what he could and could not do.
