 This game looked like it could be good, I wanted it to be as good as everyone says, and the star wars feel was definitely there (which boosted my rating), but there was something really missing in the gameplay of KOTOR.   I despised the whole targeting/round combat system as I felt I was merely watching as opposed to playing the critical fights.   I understand that the game engine is based on the dice system used in paper and pencil RPGs, but I felt it very quirky as a videogame engine to the point of being detrimental to the game's action.   This system detached (instead of engrossed) me from wanting to play more of it. However, the graphics, sound and music all seemed very well done, but I guess this game was not my cup of whiskey.
