 it oozes oh so slow and when it is on it is on.   sometimes i have trouble with kerouac as he makes references to things that leave me scratching my head.   every so often in this book i would turn back a few pages to see if i remembered what i read.   i think 60% of the time i didn't.   like the slow reading however, i know these pages have oozed into my subconscious.   these concepts may take a few years to be fully realized.  welcome to the wonderfull world of jack kerouac outside of "on the road".   do i love it?   i'm not sure, that's why i didn't give "desolation angels" five stars.   is he passionate?   no doubt.   is this book well-written?   not even a question.  but this is kerouac to me.   it's about patience and reward.   this is not a fast read.   in fact at times, i'll read four pages and feel exhausted.   did i expect a quick read when i bought it?   hell no.  bottom line:  was it an enjoyable read?   some parts yes, some parts no.   but this begs the question, is it supposed to be enjoyable?   i'd say same answer.   definitely thick on the emotion so in that sense, I hold it in high regard.   one part of the book i was singing the prose aloud.   strange, isn't it?  :o)
