 Blades Moby Extreme is quite possibly the best few hundred dollars I've ever spent.   My wife left me and the dog on Tuesday.   When I got back from the bar that evenin, she'd changed all the locks, left envelope under the mat.   You know what the letter said, but wrapped up inside was three hundred clams.   First, I tied the dog to a tree out front then went and bought him a big ol' bone.   Wednesday afternoon is when I spent the remaining two-fifty on this scooter.  Now, I'm no tough guy (5'1", 122), but I strapped on the helmet, left K-Bee on this scooter, headed toward the thruway to 95 South.   Don't know how many of you are familiar with Wilmington, but 95 South is about 20 miles South and East of the city.   Took me about twelve hours on this scooter, cars passing, honking, as I drove on the shoulder, one kid pulling a fist down like they do to big rigs.   Lucky, I had ten extra dollars and bought the horn at K-Bee so I could please this kid.   So, I finally get to I95-South, where I write the review of my BladeZ Moby Extreme.   I'm at a rest stop right near the Maryland border.   My kids'll be so proud if they read this!!!     (...)    You only get one chance at this game people, step over here and live it up!   Life begins at BladeZ Moby Extreme.
