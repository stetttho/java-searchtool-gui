 ...first hand accounts of Dr. Thompson's personal dealings with the Angels.   Much of the book is written as an essay on the topic of the Hell's Angels.   It includes many facts and quotes of everyone involved, from the Angels themselves, to quotes of police officers and politicians.   Included throughout are Hunter's analysis of press coverage of the Angels and how the press nearly glorifies criminals.   Too much facts.   When I bought the book, I was hoping to learn of the Angel's reputation not by reading someone's studies (because anyone could do research), but by living it through the author's eyes.   Hunter makes it clear that he studied/mingled with the Hell's Angels for about a year.   Where are all the crazy stories?   There were a couple personal accounts sprinkled here and there, but there he also a lot of general statements in the piece without giving me the experience I was hoping for. For example, he'd say something to the effect of... and no one wanted these modern day Huns coming into their town, raping, pillaging, and chain-whipping anyone in their path.   Did the Angels actually do these sorts of things?   Did they go through towns ravaging and raping everything in site?   After reading "Hell's Angels" I still can't answer these and similar questions.
