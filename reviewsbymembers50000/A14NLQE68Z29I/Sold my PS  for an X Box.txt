 And Halo was the first game that I purchased in the endeavor.   Boy, oh, boy was I pleased.   I am not the biggest FPS fan but when I play a good one, I love it.   Halo is an amazing game.   For one player, it is a great game where you also get some marine based support.   It' much fun overpowering masses of Covenant forces.   Then you get the vehicles.   Amazing.   The Warthog and Scorpian are great but my favorite is the Ghost.   The Ghost is a hover-bike that the Covenant use.   The graphics and fluidity of the game are amazing.   No slowdown in all the carnage, something that the PS2 had too much of. On to multipayer.   I haven't played too many deathmatches, but the co-op is unbelievable.   It provides hours and hours of mass destruction.   Then you and a buddy get the vehicles.   Still, no slowdown for a split-screen multiplayer game.   Unbelievable.   Me and my buddy played for 5 hours straight on Saturday. Happy I sold the PS2 and got the X-Box.   It did cost about a hundred dollars after the trade in, but at least I have a system on my shelf that is more than a dust recepticle.  :o)
