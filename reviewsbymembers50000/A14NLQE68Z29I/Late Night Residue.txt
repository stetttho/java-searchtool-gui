 If you buy this, keep it in your car always.   Or whenever you are in your car at night, that's the bare minimum.   This is early Tom Waits.   Defining that would be smokey AM truckstops, cafes, bars with "Last Call" being yelled.   Nighthawks at the Diner is the residue people are reduced to on late evenings after a frightful workweek, deprived of all sensibility.   It's the humanity left in your system when you're close to empty.   It's the quiet 5AM street you walk down after you leave the last affair for the night.  There are many Wait's ramblings and slow quiet tracks to put you in that late night mood, but you're already drunk, so you don't want something loud now, anyway.   This is the perfect mood piece for such a situation.   I find it's best listened to when I'm alone in these obscure hours.   Nighthawks never failed me yet.   Hell, I always keep it in my car.   Drive a lot at night, I suppose.  Enjoy!   Frank's Wild Years and Small Change are also excellent late nighters.
