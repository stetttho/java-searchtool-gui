 I recommend this horror collection if you enjoyed Night of the Living Dead/Castaway/28 Days Later.   The bulk of what you're getting here is the 170 page novel of "I am Legend".   The main character, Robert Neville is what makes this novel so great.   He is reminiscent of John Wayne/Charleton Heston muchismo, a bold, in your face tough guy.   Getting drunk, smoking cigarettes, and vampire hunting never looked this good.   There is not enough of that in literature, IMO.  "I am Legend" turns out to be a great social commentary, begging the question, "Who is the real outcast?" in a Planet of the Apes tone.  Short stories that stick out most in this edition are "Dance of the Dead", "Mad House", and "Dress of White Silk".   Each short is thought provocative in their own ends and it was enjoyable noting differences in style between each.  This is a collection definitely worth a look, especially is you are a fan of the horror/suspense genre.
