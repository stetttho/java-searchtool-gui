 I bought this game around Thanksgiving time.   I hadn't purchased XBox Live at that time so I was playing the standard 1 player mission based game.   The game has simple flight controls in which a monkey could operate with ease.   Crimson Skies is not a flight simulator.   The 1 player game flows like any mission-based shooter and quite frankly, gets stale rather quick.   The missions are destroy this, escort that, etc.   Fun, yet repetitive after a while.   Whenever you take out enemies, you collect their money.   Money is used to upgrade the different planes you commandeer.   Stealing new planes and comparing the differences in handling speed and firepower is fun.   The game's environments are huge and have hidden icons buried throughout, giving the single player reason to explore.   These icons are used for upgrading planes as well.   All this said about the 1 player game, I give it a 7 out of 10.   I only played it for about a week (25% complete 1 player) when I purchased Live. **Open doors** Crimson Skies on Live is utterly amazing and gave me no reason to return to the 1 player mode.   Modes such as Dogfight, Team DF, Capture the Flag, are all great.   16 players are allowed to join in one game (with a little lag, but not much at all). It is on XBox Live that Crimson Skies allows you to see the vast handling and maneuverability of these planes.   Live also keeps each pilot's stats, allowing the player to put everything in perspective compared to other Red Baron's out there. The environments on Crimson Live are completely huge and amazing and the battles that ensue are nothing short of utter mayham. I give Crimson Live 9/10 dumbfire rockets.   If you are looking for a reason to purchase Live, look no further.   This game to me, was worth the money. Look on the horizon for the wispy flames coming out of my engine, for I am BOO75.  :o)
