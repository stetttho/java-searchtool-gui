 heed all.   bow down.   scott stapp is back, returned down from the mountain which was the rock group creed, with tablet of "The Great Divide".   he's come down back to us.   i say come down because here is one truly gifted man, come down with divine knowledge of rock & rolls.   BUT FEAR NOT!   that which rocks does not roll down this mountain, but hails triumphantly down mountain trails like a choir of angels, come back to us believers with his gift of voice and tale.   SCOTT STAPP you are the one we've been seeking.  sure, sadness dawned upon man at the break-up of creed.   but SCOTT STAPP we are still believers in your mission.    please take your tour northeast, may we sing on top of mountains, praise hymns and rejoice like moses upon the mount.   your voice is what gives us breath.   your voice has steered me from the merky depths of drug and alchoholic and has spake, "NO!"   pointing us in the true light of what rock & roll is.   thanx, loser.
