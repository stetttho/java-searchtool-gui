 It's such a sad state when millions of people look up to a pillar and listen to a fool speaking.   Such a thing happened back during the Salem Witch Trials.   A town friar says because a woman skips menstruation, she be a witch, something laughable like the Monty Python parodies.  Fools use melted wax to seal things closed as their stamp of approval, may such a stamp be unbroken.   Sometimes fools put a sticker on a book, call it a book club, and the denizons below read it now as gospel.   Not unlike the mob that carries torches to light the way up the witches path.  But wait!   Other voices say it's bunk!   The preacher roundabouts but will the school of fish follow?   Of course.   The work of art in question is now invalid.   Forgotten?   Or just the whole thing pathetic?  Oh Monty Python.   Where are you?  Dave Chappelle.   Please come back.  The fiddle called artistic license needs restringing or a dusting, remembered; an alarm clock to the people sleeping and zombying to the sermon.  This is not Milli Vanilli folks.
