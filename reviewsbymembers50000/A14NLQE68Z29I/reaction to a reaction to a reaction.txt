 explosions.   random lyrics to a jimmy buffet song on a tropical dock while the sun sets across the carribean horizon.   drug running.   scrambling from one fuel-less plane to one that's been filled.   escaping in the nick of time, feds on the tarmac raising fists and cursing 'cause the cowboys escaped again.   YEEHAW!!!  a book of knowledge falls on your lap like newton's apple out of the tree.   mystifying as the words may be, you realize they are only words.   or don't you?   Do you find the words compelling enough to chase down the author as a pre-described detiny contained in the text?  this review.   a reaction to all these events.   but these are only words.   in the end it means nothing but pixelated 0's and 1's on your monitor.   fitting coincidence these 0's and 1's appear on www.amazon.com, a site referenced a few times in Weisbecker's book.   read the book or don't read it.   in the end it means nothing.
