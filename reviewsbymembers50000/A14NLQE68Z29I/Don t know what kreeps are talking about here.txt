 This game is an instant classic.   I'll bet no one on here never play it.   Sam is amazing.   I'll bet I'm the only one here who found the hidden sword.  The guns are fun, but on top the huge building in the Metro level you find a sword (behind the crate nearest the edge).   Hack and slash all night baby.   This opens up the game to the next level.   Forget everything else, you'll be addicted to this.   Online mode is pretty good.  I like the music on the dashboard.   Thumbs up, way up.   Don't lie.
