 I sold my PS2 last year for an XBox but I kept this game, slim chance that I got another PS2.   I really missed Hotshots Golf 3.   I would drink beer after work and play a round of 18.   I missed it.   I missed the bet that me and a buddy had for the first hole in one either of us would score.   The bet was to do shots of whiskey in celebration.   Neither of us ever had that whiskey until two weeks ago.   With March Madness winnings I bought me a new PS2. HSG3 is a golf game that doesn't take itself serious.   The taunts are really funny and will be stuck in your head for days.   The courses feel very lifelike, full of colors and unlockable animals, great weather effects.   Since I sold my memory card last year, I am playing through the tourney mode, unlocking all the clubs and other goodies once again. If you are looking for a serious golf game with collared shirt stiffs, this is not your game.   The Power Meter system in this games works just fine for me, but I hear the controls in Tiger are really good as well. I'm not a golfer and don't have any serious plans of ever becoming one.   I've been on a golf course less times than I have fingers on my left hand.   Don't even know why I actually ever bought this game, in all truth.   Good reviews I guess, something different from all the action titles and RPGS out there.   Not too serious a game if you don't want it to be, but the depth is there if you're looking for it;  about 12 unlockable players, tourneys, unlockable clubs and courses.   Great fun.  ;o)
