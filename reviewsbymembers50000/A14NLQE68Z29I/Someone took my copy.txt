 ...and now that it is gone, I really miss it.   I was more of a casual ween fan before I heard this album.   after i heard godweensatan i realized there is no such thing as a casual ween fan.   you are either on the poop bus or you are off the poop bus. i don't think it's the best choice as a first ween disc to buy.   go with chocolate and cheese first.    at a first listen [godweensatan] i thought to myself, "now this is really stretching it.   really."   now that i can't find the album i feel like a wounded soldier who's lost a limb.   i still feel it, i knew what it was like to have it, it is still with me, i want the dam*ed thing back. "don't laugh, i love you" is the best song on the album.   the end of it is the best part.   the end of it is boognish incarnate, bottom line.   i need to hear it again.   those of you who have heard it know exactly what i am talking about.   at a first listen it sounds downright inexcusable as a song.   upon further thought, however, it makes a lot of sense. ;o)   enjoy.
