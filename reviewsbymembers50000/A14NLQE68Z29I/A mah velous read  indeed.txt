 A few friends and I took a drive down to Savannah two years ago.   It was a quaint little city with delicate Victorian homes and Spanish moss hanging from tree limbs over each street.   The squares at each intersection had gardens which I found odd.   Going souvenir shopping, many stores had the book "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil".   Not being from the South, I never knew what the book was about, but this trip had perked my eyes to the novel.  The writing style of Berendt is remarkable in it's balance of putting you in the Victorian homes, having you walk those squares, and inviting you to the parties of Savannah's elite.     Berendt's deliverance of subtlety and character texture is one of the finest elements in the novel.   Each idiosyncracy and quirk of character leaves the reader wanting to know more.   For example, one character has a bottle of deadly poison.   Berendt only gives a taste, tells you all you need to know then drops you off, leaving only you and your imagination with that person.  This book has more charm and style than most books I've read.   The charm has everything to do with the "old" and "new" money of Savannah, each extravagence presented in a "this kind of stuff happens every day" tone.     The Lady Chablis and Jim William's belief in Minerva are two of my favorite aspects of the novel.
