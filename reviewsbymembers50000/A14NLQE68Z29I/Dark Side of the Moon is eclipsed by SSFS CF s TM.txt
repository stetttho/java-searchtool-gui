 Step aside rock gods and gurus.   corey, you know that little brat-a$$ kid from the goonies, is back with this bold new project.    i'm not sure if this release was big in America.   in fact, i know it was not.   i heard it when i was on a backpacking trip in europe.   i was in this small city in the UK called Gloucester when I walked into the club and I heard SSFS~CF's TM for the first time.   i turn to my friend Charlie that I'd met (his hometown is Gloucester) and I said is this Corey Feldman from "The Goonies?".   And he said "Hell YES!".   It was one of those dark underground clubs where everyone wears Dr. Martins and has spikey blue hair.   I looked over to some couches in the club and then to some punks standing around, and to my amazement, they all held this CD in their hand, reading each song as it was being boomed by the DJ in the corner.   A couple of goth chicks began making out under a strobelight when Soul Search Part 2 came on.    I realized how great this album was when I was at this small club that was buried under a building.   At the moment, I felt like my whole life had been leading me up to this point, like I was climbing some mountain and this was the peak.   Unbelievable were the sounds that raged through the speakers.   After a night full of sweat, blood and vomit, I carried my own copy of SSFS~CF's TM back to my hostile.   It hasn't left my discman since.
