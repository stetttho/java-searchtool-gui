 This is a great read for horror fans.   Taking place in the mid-1800s, Mr. Monochello weaves a story that is reminiscent of both Poe and Dickens.   Van Marlow Mansion is a fast paced novella with a nugget of suspense around every flip of the page, leaving the reader on his/her toes.   In the end, you'll be wanting more.   The writing style, dialogue, and suspense are all very well done in that it reads like a piece of old literature.   Very impressive.   If you are a fan of horror and anything Vincent Price, do yourself a favor and check this out.
