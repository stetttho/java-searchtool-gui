 Let me start by saying that I thought the controls were horrible as well.   Until I got used to them.   They are different.   You no longer have a camera that simply hangs ten feet behind Lara.  When you turn the analog stick, Lara moves in that direction and you need to manually adjust the camera behind her.   Is that a bad thing?   No.   It is different from all previous Tomb Raider games but that is not to say that it is garbage.   It worked fine in the N64 Zelda games and it works fine here. I think the new and "dark" story is great.   I'm sucked into it.  NO OTHER Tomb Raider game has ever had a good story (save Last Revelation).   The first and second TR games had as minimal story as possible. Down to the shaky aspects. While I think the new controls are good, there are times when they aren't too great.   Aiming can be a chore especially when an enemy is at a higher or lower position than Lara's standpoint.   There is a part when you are in a graveyard and are being chased by dogs.   After climbing a certain mosoleum (sp?), I tried to aim at the approaching pooches.   When they got to close to my standpoint I'd pull back and Lara moved on her own for a couple of seconds.   No big problem. The slowdown.   People have been complaining about it.   In the beginning of the game there is a part where Lara stands on a rainy rooftop.   The game slows considerably.   Yet this is the only time I've witnessed it so far.   Luckily there isn't much you need to even do on said rooftop. I give it five out of five.   It's really a 4 out of 5 in my opinion.   So why 5?   To conversely skew those who drank to much Haterade with their Cheerios.   Seems popular for gaming geeks (IGN) to give a negative review for Tomb Raider games that are not TR1 and TR2. Bottom line: If you've been a Tomb Raider fan all along then you don't want to miss this one.   Try the controls.   Get used to them and you will feel that whole TR thing all over again.  ;)
