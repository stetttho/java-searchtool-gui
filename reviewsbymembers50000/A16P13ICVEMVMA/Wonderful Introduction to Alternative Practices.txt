 I don't have a firm handle on the distinctions between voodoo-magic, and voodoo-religion. It seems to me they're not necessarily separable. In any case, unless you're born into a culture where voodoo, or santeria, or the other "sister religions" are predominant, it's virtually impossible to be initiated into these systems. What if you want to learn?  I agree for the most part with the author's criticisms of scholarly texts on the subject. Though helpful in some respects, the overwhelming tone of the anthropological and ethnographic work done on voodoo culture (and many others) paints it as a primitive remnant. Whether "primitive" or some other buzz word is used, that tends to be the implication in the works of Western academics who - though swearing agnosticism - are the product of a Western Christian world.  Whether interested in practicing voodoo magick, or just in getting acquainted with a world-view radically different from your own, this book serves as a wonderful outsider's introduction, as advertised. The authors are aware that the pillars of the western world have no home in certain cultures, and they don't attempt to justify unfamiliar beliefs and practices with familiar analogues. This can be jarring for some, but in my opinion it marks a positive trend that sets the standard of New Falcon Publications. None of the works of Chris Hyatt or S. Jason Black have disappointed me.
