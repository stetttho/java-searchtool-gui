 If you are already of the opinion that Timothy Leary was just some fanatical cult organizer under the influence of every illegal substance known to man, you have nothing to lose by reading one of his books. You can at least hope to obtain some first-hand evidence of his alleged insanity.  On the other hand, you would have a hard time convincing me that this book was written under any influence other than a joyful wonder and awe concerning knowledge and the world, and perhaps a mild resentment toward the system that imprisoned him for far greater a period of time than is typical for possession of marijuana.  By all means, InfoPsychology presents an unconventional model of reality, the human mind, and evolution. "Crazy" seems at times to be the best description for some of the ideas presented here. But as Leary himself points out, until the next evolutionary plateau is reached, concepts associated with that plateau will seem alien and threatening to the status quo (as well they should). But that is no excuse to dismiss these ideas as crazy. Subversive, contraversial, beyond the reach of our collective understanding and acceptance, perhaps. Certainly not crazy.  And if only for the time it takes to read the book we accept Leary's logical progression, we'll see that his book must necessarily be considered "crazy." He is dealing with evolutions that have not yet occurred. We cannot expect to fully understand and appreciate the complexities of an evolved form of humanity any more than neanderthals could've been expected to understand us. And in order to be able to reprogram ourselves, we must first recognize, or be made aware of how programmed we are to begin with.
