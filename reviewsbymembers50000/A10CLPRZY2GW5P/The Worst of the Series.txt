 I have read all the books in the Dune series, and I have to say that I feel "Dune Messiah" is the worst of the lot. After the initial novel, "Dune", the other books in the series took a turn for the philosophical. "Dune Messiah," perhaps more than any of the other books, concentrates on the philosophical, and leaves action and plot development by the wayside.  The story focuses on Paul Atreides after he has become, essentially, emperor of the universe. His legions of religious zealots spread the word of Muad'Dib to all the worlds in the universe, in a religious jihad. Paul, blessed or cursed with prescience, becomes more and more inhuman, he begins to question the Golden Path which he has created. The book covers a very short period in Paul's life, during which he wrestles with his self-doubts, as well as contending with a plot which has arisen against him. Look for the first "rebirth" of Duncan Idaho, a pivotal character throughout the whole series. I found it hard to read because, I was rooting for Paul, in "Dune," he was, in every way, the hero, and you wanted him to win. In "Dune Messiah," though, now that he has won, its sad to see how his initial dream has been has been corrupted by circumstances. I wanted Paul to be as heroic as he was in the first novel, but he is not. This may be more realistic, but its sad, and you really don't know who you should be rooting for, if, indeed, you should be rooting for anybody. All in all, Herbert took a very long time to say very little. However, he says it well, and as in all his books, Herbert's characters are quite compelling, even if they are more tragic, so it still reads very well, even if it isn't as interesting as the first novel.
