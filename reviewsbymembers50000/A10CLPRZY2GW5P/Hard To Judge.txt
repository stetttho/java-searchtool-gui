 3,500 years have passed and Leto II, Paul Atreides' son, is STILL ruler of the universe. With the memories of all his ancestors, as well as an almost perfect prescience, not to mention absolute control of the dwindling spice, Melange, Leto rules the universe with an iron grip. The way he has survived so long is that he has merged with the sandworm, to create a giant, sometimes uncontrollable hybrid of man and worm. He does not enjoy the power he wields, though, he views his transformation he had to pay to ensure that mankind does not stray from the Golden Path that had first been taken up, and then abandonned by his father. This is an incredibly vivid book with superb characterization. You really feel that you know Leto II by the end, feeling the pain of his supreme loneliness, the boredom which provokes his wry, sometimes vicious sense of humor, and the essential nobility which provokes him to sacrifice his humanity to save the human race.  I think the problem with the book for me, anyway, apart from the fact that the plot was very slight (choosing instead to be more a series of philosophical conversations) is that Leto II is almost universally hated and feared by all those around him. Even Siona, his protege, who supposedly understands his Golden Path, does not really gain sympathy for him. I had problems with this because as the ready we have been presented with such a sympathetic portrait of him, its hard to understand the hatred people like Siona and Duncan Idaho feel towards him. This being said, the climax of the book, which hangs upon Siona and Idaho's hatred of him, feels forced and unnatural. Nevertheless, I was drawn through the book merely on the strength of the characters.
