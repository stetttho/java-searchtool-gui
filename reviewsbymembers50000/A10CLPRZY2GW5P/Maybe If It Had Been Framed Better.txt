 I think its significant that this was the only PDQ Bach album which didn't include any sort of framing sequence -- that is to say, there were no intros or outros to any of the pieces, which put the work into any sort of a context, humorous or otherwise. As such, I found it to be a very confusing album. Add to this, the fact that the humor of some of these pieces relies on a visual component which, oddly enough, doesn't really translate well on a CD. As such, I think this is just about the worst PDQ Bach album of the bunch. Of course, Peter Shickelie is a great composer, and so even the bad stuff is worth listening to, just don't expect the belly-laughs you might "Oedipus Tex" or "The 1712 Overture." Its only for hard-core fans, or music afficianods who can catch the frequently subtle musical jokes in the purely orchestral pieces.
