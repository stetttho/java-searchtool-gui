 Boy, what a disappointment. Even the worst of Weird Al's albums is good for a few laughs, but the most that "Poodle Hat" could generate was a few chuckles. The songs seemed almost like parodies of the types of songs Weird Al has written in the past. "Couch Potato," an Emminem parody was nothing more than a listing of a bunch of different TV shows. I'm not sure what "Hardware Store" parodied, but it was just a song about all the kinds of stuff they sell at a hardware store (big shock there). "Trash Day" was about how gross putrifying garbage is (thanks for the insight, Al). "Party at the Leper Colony" could have been funny, but was just kind of tasteless. Even the obligatory polka, in this case "Angry White Boy Polka" didn't have any of its customary zeal. The three songs to look for on the album are "Why Does This Always Happen To Me" which was really the only song to make me laugh; "Ode To A Superheo" which is a tribute to the Spiderman movie, although its funny, it will probably seem dated in about a year; and "Bob" which is an admittedly BRILLIANT tribute to Bob Dylan, but it will probably go over a lot of people's heads. The songs "Wanna B Ur Lovr," "A Complicated Song," and "eBay" were all pretty bland and didn't have any of Al's previous wit and genius for parody. The final song, "Genius In France," was so long, repetitive and unfunny that I just stopped it in the middle, maybe I missed the punchline, I don't know, nor do I really care. Its a sad, tiring album, certainly not a worthy predecessor to "Running With Scissors," which is one of Weird Al's best. I'd reccomend buying that instead.
