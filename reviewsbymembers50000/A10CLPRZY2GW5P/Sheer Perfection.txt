 In my opinion, the early color cartoons of Mickey Mouse, are some of the best works by Walt Disney. This collection of many of them is amazing. The only thing I can say against it is that the DVD design is not very well done. The DVD always starts with Leonard Maltin's commentary on Mickey Mouse, and if you've seen it once, that is probably enough. It would be nice if it went directly to the cartoon. Despite that, though, this is an amazing DVD. The cartoons are great, and presented in wonderful condition.
