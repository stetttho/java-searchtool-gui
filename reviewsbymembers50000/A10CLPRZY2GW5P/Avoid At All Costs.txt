 By the time these books had come out, Robert Asprin had stopped making his Myth books self-contained stories. They were, instead unapologetically episodic, with long, meandering storylines in each book ending in a cliff-hanger meant to lure you into the next book. It was a cheap device used to snag the die-hard fans and new readers who might not know any better.  Its hard to think of these books as anything more than a marketting tool, since all the originality and humor present in the first few books of this series had long ago been burned away. Its like Robert Asprin is just noodling around at the keyboard, tossing off ideas to fulfill a contractual obligation. There is no joy in these books at all. At best they present over-used cliches, at worst they are tedious beyond belief.
