 Every other review of this book, either good or bad, starts this way, so I feel that there's no reason mine should be any different....I'm a huge fan of "Catch-22". Let's face it, if "Closing Time" lived up to the original novel, people would start their reviews with "I was a hug fan of 'Closing Time.'" That they don't, even if they are saying something positive about it, says something very bad about the book. There is no question that Joseph Heller was coasting on his reputation when he wrote this. My personal belief is that this is why this novel is billed as a sequal to "Catch-22" when it really has little to do with it.  This being said, "Closing Time" is really a very good book. It is surreal, and unsettling, and, at times, quite funny. Clearly Heller was concerned about his health when he wrote it (in one of the most clever surrealist touches, one of the characters even refers to Heller's health problems). That makes the book a little gloomy, maudlin, and yes, at times heavy handed as well. Nevertheless, Heller proves that he can still create strong, realistic characters, and that he is still the master of vicious social satire. If you read it as a sequal to "Catch-22" you will be disappointed. If you read it as a new and original work, though, you will be pleasently surprised.
