 You really can't go wrong with Roger Zelazny. Even his lesser works are still great reading, and of all his books, the Amber series is by far his best work. Part mystery, part fantasy, part political thriller, the Amber books have something for everyone. The first five books, which have come to be known as the Chronicles of Corwin, stand head and shoulders above books six through ten, which are the Chronicles of Merlin, Corwin's son. Merlin's story just couldn't quite capture the same sense of grandeur, or the strong characters contained in Corwin's story. Nevertheless, its still a great read.  I cannot stand fantasy novels of any kind, and I still found Amber to be great, I've read them over and over again, and my enjoyment of them never fades.
