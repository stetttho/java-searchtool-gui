 I am amazed at how many people just don't get this book. First of all, let me say, setting aside the plot for a moment, Harris' use of language is absolutely beautiful and lyrical. In this book, he uses storytelling devices which I have never seen used by another author, and they really blew my mind. Now to the plot. The end of the story is what most people have issues with, especially since Hannibal Lecter is given a very happy ending. It is not a conventional ending, especially according to Hollywood's standards (which may account for why the movie version failed so miserably), however, it is very unique, and very powerful. "Hannibal" does not, as some would suggest, look to excuse Lecter's killings. Instead, by looking into his history we see some of the explanation as to why he has become such a disturbed human being, and we see some of the Lecter's motivation for committing such horrible acts. At the end of the book, Hannibal's triumph is that he is finally able to set his madness aside. I thought it was wonderful, and very uplifting.
