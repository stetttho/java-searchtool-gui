 I love everything related to the Justice League, so its only natural that I had to buy the sticker book. In a lot of ways its pretty fun. However, you get the impression it was done on the cheap. There isn't as much clip-art of the JLA available as there is for Superman or Batman (the other two sticker books published by DK of DC super-heroes), so many of the stickers are action shots from the comics. However, they have been shrunk down so much that they are hard to see. Also, many of the labels for the stickers are mis-printed (something that probably nobody but another comics geek like me would notice).  If you like the Justice League, or like stickers, I'd get this, but its not as well-done as either the Superman or Batman sticker books.
