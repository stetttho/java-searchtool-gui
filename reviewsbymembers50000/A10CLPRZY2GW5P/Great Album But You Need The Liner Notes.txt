 Look at Peter Shickelie's web-site. He sounds like he's a little bit annoyed at the relase of this album on CD. The reason: the title piece on the album, Black Forest Bluegrass, was written entirely in German. Apparently, he wrote it when he found out a large group of Germans would be attending one of his PDQ Bach concerts and he wanted to provide them with a piece in their native language. When it was produced as an album, the liner notes containing the full translation were printed on the album cover so that those of us not fluent in German could enjoy it. It was never meant to be presented without the translation, and yet, when it was produced on CD, they left out the translation, making the entire song unintelligible. Fortunately, its pretty easy to find the translation online (like on Shickelie's own website).    Even without the words, Black Forest Bluegrass is pleasent to listen to and quite a clever merger of bluegrass and Baroque music. There are two other pieces on the album: No-No Nonette, a piece which uses toys as some of the instruments (pop-gun, music box, a doll that says "Ma-Ma", etc). Its clever, but pretty slow. "Now Hear Me Through" is an excerpt from "Diverse Airs On Sundry Notions" which are a series of advertisements composed by and purportedly endorsed by PDQ Bach. These are cute, but brief. The remainder of these fake-ads appear on one of his other albums "Report From Hoople." You get the impression that these are the leftovers that they couldn't fit on that album.   All-in-all Blackforest Bluegrass is the one piece that really makes this album, and if you're going to buy it (which I reccomend if you like Peter Shickelie's other work) make sure that you download a translation so that you can enjoy it fully.
