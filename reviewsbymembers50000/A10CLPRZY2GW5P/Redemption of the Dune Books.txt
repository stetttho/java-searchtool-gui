 I was nervous about reading "Children of Dune," because I was not overly fond of "Dune Messiah." However, once I began reading it, I found it to be an exciting, compelling story, filled with many surprises. The story takes place about ten years after the events in "Dune Messiah." Paul Muad'Dib's sister, Alia, sits as regent over the Empire, until Paul's children Leto II and Ghanima grow up. However the children, like Alia were pre-born with the souls of all their ancestors living inside of them. The story chronicles the corruption of Alia and the struggle between her, and children for control of the empire.  This novel contains a more balanced mix of philosophy and adventure, mixed with very vivid, interesting characters. It is very well worth reading -- though no book can compare with the original "Dune."
