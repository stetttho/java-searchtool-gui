 This is as close to a perfect book as I have ever read. Colleen McCullough succeeds beautifully in giving us a picture of what life may have been like during the time of Julius Caesar. My one regret is that this is the last book in her "Masters of Rome" series. I heartily reccomend it, along with her other books "First Man of Rome," "The Grass Crown," "Fortune's Favorites," "Caesar's Women," and "Caesar: Let the Dice Fly."
