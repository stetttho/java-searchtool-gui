 This is an incompetently executed video game, with obscure rules, many bugs, and ENORMOUS problems in translation. Contrary to another reviewer, it took me only about five minutes to discover this game is a (poor) translation of a game from Europe. Looking at the names of the people connected with it, I would guess it was made somewhere in Scandanavia. There's SOME humor value in the comically bad translations of the TV shows you will be producing, they really make no sense at all. However, the programmers made no effort to lip sync the animation and the soundtrack. The installation does not always refer to the program by the same name -- which I always take as a warning sign of sloppy programming. In the game itself, many of the pop-up message boxes appear on top of one another, obscuring important information. There are other bugs, and translation errors which made the game difficult to play, and quite tedious. I can't believe this game actually made it out of beta testing.
