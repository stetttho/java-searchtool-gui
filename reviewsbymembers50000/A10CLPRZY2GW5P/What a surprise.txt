 Someone once said "I cannot read more than ten pages of Steinbeck without throwing up." It is a feeling that I share wholeheartedly. I've found the novels of his that I've read to be bleak, depressing, and punctuated with lovingly rendered depictions of disease and gore.  However, this book (as well as "The Deeds of King Arthur"), to some degree redeems Steinbeck in my eyes. I found it in a used bookstore, and I was so intrigued by the idea of John Steinbeck writing a comedy, that I bought it immediately.  Its a farcical tale of a French Astronomer who, by some twist of fate, is briefly appointed King of France. In its style, it is reminiscent of novels by other famous authors, such as Dumas and Voltaire. It did not have me rolling in the aisles with mirth, but there were so many beautifully turned comic phrases and situations, that I was just in awe that this was the same man who had written the book "The Black Pearl" (in my mind, one of the most utterly disgusting books I have ever read). If he had added a bit more of the comic touches he used in this book, to his other novels, such as "East of Eden," I believe he would have humanized them, and would have better succeeded in conveying his message. "Pippin IV" is a true little gem as full of mirth and humor as his other works are full of misery and despair. I highly reccomend it, especially if you are not fond of Steinbeck's works. If nothing else, it will give you an appreciation of his technical abilities as a writer.
