 I'VE SEEN JOHNNY MANY TIMES OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS AND WAS SHOCKED IN 1997 WHEN HE CLOSED THE DOHENEY BLUES FESTIVAL IN DANA POINT , CA. HE HAD TO BE HELPED TO THE STAGE BY TWO ROADIES AND ONE HAD TO HELP HIM PUT ON HIS GUITAR. I WAS UNAWARE OF HIS HEALTH PROBLEMS AND WAS TAKEN BACK BY HIS CONDITION. FAST FORWARD TO THE LATEST DVD AND I AM SURPRISED THAT THIS WOULD BE RELEASED. ON THIS DVD YOU CAN SEE THAT HE IS IN VERY POOR HEALTH. SO MUCH SO THAT HE CAN HARDLY SING OR PLAY. JOHNNY IS ONE OF ROCKS ALL TIME LEGENDS AND DESERVES BETTER THAN THIS. I COULD ONLY WATCH A FEW SONGS AND HAD TO TURN IT OFF. I HAVE A DVD OF HIM PERFORMING IN 1979 AND PUT THAT ONE ON TO REGAIN MY RIGHT FRAME OF MIND. HE WAS IN RARE FORM AND THAT REKINDLED MY INTEREST AGAIN. IF YOU CAN FIND IT, TRY JOHNNY WINTER AT ROCKPALAST IN 1979. THAT DVD ROCKS.........
