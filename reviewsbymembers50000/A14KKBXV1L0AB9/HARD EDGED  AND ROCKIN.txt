 I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS DVD TO BE SET IN THE NTSC FORMAT AND BOY WAS THE WAIT WORTH IT. THIS SHOW HARKENS BACK TO THE DAYS WHEN MUSICIANS WERE OUT THERE TO ENTERTAIN. IAN HUNTERS VOICE IS THE ONLY REASON FOR THIS BEING 4 STARS INSTEAD OF 5. IAN'S THICK ENGLISH ACCENT SOMETIMES MAKES IT HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE WORDS TO HIS SONGS. THAT SAID, ALL THE OTHER PIECES ARE IN PLACE TO EQUAL ONE ROCKIN' CONCERT. HIS SLOWER SONGS LOOSE SOME OF THE FEELING BECAUSE OF HIS, SOMETIMES HARD TO UNDERSTAND, WORDS BUT IF IT'S ROCKIN' YOU WANT, THIS IS A GREAT SHOW............
