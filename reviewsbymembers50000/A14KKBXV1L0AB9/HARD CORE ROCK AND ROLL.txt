 IF YOU LIKE STRAIGHT AHEAD ROCK AND ROLL GUITAR PLAYING WITH BLUES MIXED IN, THEN THIS IS YOUR BAG. NO FRILLS HERE. JUST MIND NUMBING STRIPPED DOWN GUITAR PLAYING. THIS 3 PIECE GROUP LAYS DOWN SOME OF THE MOST HARD EDGED BLUES / ROCK AROUND. HER VOCALS MATCH HER PLAYING. ROUGH AND SMOOTH AT THE SAME TIME. TOUGH TO EXPLAIN BUT INCREDIBLE TO WATCH. HER STUDIO CD CALLED " SENDING ME ANGELS " IS , IN MY OPINION , HER BEST WORK. HER LATEST LIVE CD " LIVE, AS IT SHOULD BE " IS A DOUBLE DISC SET OF BUTT KICKIN' ROCKIN' BLUES. SHE ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE JOAN ARMATRADING VOCALLY SOMETIMES AND THEN JANIS JOPLIN. SOMEWHAT LIMITED IN SCOPE BUT A GREAT TREAT FOR US OLD TIME ROCKERS THAT HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF OUR MIND NUMBING STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN ENERGY. KEEP ROCKIN KELLY.......................
