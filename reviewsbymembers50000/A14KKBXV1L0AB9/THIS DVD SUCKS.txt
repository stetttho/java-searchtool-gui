 LET ME PREFACE THIS REVIEW. I OWN OVER 200 DVD CONCERTS AND I CAN'T BELEIVE PEOPLE RATE THIS 4 OR 5 STARS. I MUST BE WATCHING A DIFFERENT VERSION OF THIS SHOW. FIRST AND FORMOST, THE LEAD SINGER IS REALLY BAD ! I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD HE WAS SINGING. SECONDLY , I DON'T NEED A CHEEZY VIDEO OF THE GROUP AND SAN FRANCISCO DURING SOME OF THE BEST MUSIC ON THE DVD. I BUY DVD'S OF CONCERTS BECAUSE I CAN'T MAKE IT TO THE SHOW. I DON'T NEED AIMLESS ARTWORK AND ARTSY FILLER. GIVE ME THE  SHOW!!! IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR?. THAT SAID, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS AIMLESS AN POINTLESS CONCERT.THERE WAS A REASON THIS BAND SPLIT UP AND IF YOU BUY THIS DVD YOU'LL FIND OUT WHY...................
