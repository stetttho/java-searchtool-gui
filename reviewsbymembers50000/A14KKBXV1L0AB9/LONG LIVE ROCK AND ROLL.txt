 THIS RECORDING IS SO FULL OF GREAT GUITAR PLAYING AND SINGING THAT I USUALLY CAN'T FINISH THE CD IN ONE SITTING. IT'S ALMOST OVERPOWERING AT TIMES. GREAT ROCK AND ROLL AND BLUES IN ONE CD. EACH SONG TAKES ON A LIFE OF IT'S OWN. I THINK THIS BY FAR HER BEST RECORDING, STUDIO OR OTHERWISE!!! TOO BAD ITS JUST ON IMPORT
