 THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN ELEVATOR MUSIC FOR BLUES LOVERS.HER FIRST CD HAD AN EDGE TO IT. IT WAS FULL OF RAW BLUES.THIS CD SOUNDS LIKE A LATTER DAY LINDA RONSTADT CD. SLOW AND DULL. THE MATERIAL IS WEAK AND SUSAN HARDLY PLAYS HER GUITAR AT ALL.SHE EVEN DOES A BOB DYLAN SONG.DON'T GET ME WRONG, I THINK SUSAN IS A FINE TALENT, I JUST THINK SHE NEEDS TO GET BACK TO WHAT SHE STARTED ON "JUST WON'T BURN". I'VE SEEN HER LIVE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE COULD PLAY THE NEW STUFF IN A LIVE SHOW. I HOPE HER NEXT CD IS A LITTLE MORE FOCUSED. HORNS AND VIOLIN DON'T WORK FOR FOR THE BLUES IN MY OPINION...
