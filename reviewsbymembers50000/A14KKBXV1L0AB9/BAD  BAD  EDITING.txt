 I JUST FINISHED VIEWING THIS DVD. SEVERAL THINGS COME TO MIND. FIRST, OVER HALF OF THE CAMERA SHOTS ,IN THIS DVD , START AS "OUT OF FOCUS" THEN FADE INTO FOCUS SLIGHTLY. THE CAMERAS JUMP AROUND AS IF THE EDITOR HAD JUST DRANK ABOUT 50 CUPS OF COFFEE BEFOR ENTERING THE EDIT ROOM.I DON'T THINK THERE IS 1 CAMERA SHOT THATS STAYS ON THE SUBJECT FOR MORE THAN 5 SECONDS. VERY HARD TO WATCH. SECONDLY, THERE ARE A LOT OF FILL SHOTS. EVERYTHING FROM THE BASS PLAYERS BOOTS TO THE BACKS OF PEOPLE OUT OF FOCUS AND TOTALLY OUT OF FOCUS SHOTS OF WHAT I DON'T KNOW. I'M SURPRISED TOM PETTY SIGNED OFF ON THIS PROJECT AS BAD AS IT IS.TOM AND THE BAND PLAYED THEIR COLLECTIVE BUTTS OFF ONLY TO BE RUINED BY BAD, BAD, EDITING!
