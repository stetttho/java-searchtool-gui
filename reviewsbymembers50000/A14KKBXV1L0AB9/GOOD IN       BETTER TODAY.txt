 I PURCHASED THE DVD OF THIS SHOW AND WAS VERY SATIFIED. I'M GLAD THAT JOHN AND THE CREW STILL HAVE NEW MUSIC TO OFFER. JOHN HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONG WRITERS. HOW MANY SONGS HAVE YOU HEARD RECENTLY THAT COMPARE TO THE WORDS TO " THE ENDLESS COMMERICAL ". WE HOPEFULLY ALL CHANGE FOR THE BETTER AND IN MY OPINION THIS CD AND DVD SHOWS THAT JOHN AND THE BOYS CAN STILL ROCK AS HARD AS EVER. ITS OK TO USE THE PAST AS A REFERENCE TO THE FUTURE, BUT THE FUTURE IS NOW !!!!!!! KEEP ROCKIN' BOYS.......................
