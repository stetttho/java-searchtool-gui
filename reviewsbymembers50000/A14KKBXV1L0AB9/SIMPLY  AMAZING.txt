 THIS DOUBLE DVD IS " SIMPLY AMAZING". THE FIRST CONCERT (1982) SHOWS THE RAW POWER AND SKILLS STEVIE WAS ABOUT TO UNLEASH ON THE WORLD.WELL DONE, BUT IT'S THE SECOND DVD (1985) SHOW THAT IS OFF THE CHARTS. WATCHING STEVIE AND JOHNNY COPELAND JAMMIN' ON TIN PAN ALLEY IS EVERY BLUES GUITAR PLAYERS DREAM. I CAN NOW SEE WHERE STEVIE PICKED UP SOME OF HIS CHOPS. THERE IS VERY LITTLE OF JOHNNY COPELAND ON DVD, LET ALONE WITH STEVIE AS A PLAYER ALONG SIDE OF JOHNNY.THIS DOUBLE DVD IS WORTH EVERY DOLLAR.ROCK ON BLUES LOVERS.................
