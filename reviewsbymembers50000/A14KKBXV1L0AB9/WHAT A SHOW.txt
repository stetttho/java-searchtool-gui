 THIS CONCERT IS ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN. EVERYONE INVOLVED WAS TRULY INSPIRED. I'VE NEVER SEEN ERIC CLAPTON PLAY THIS WELL BEFORE. HE IS TRULY A GIANT AMONG MEN. BUDDY AND MICK ALSO PLAYED THEIR COLLECTIVE BUTTS OFF. I OWN OVER 100 DVD CONCERTS AND THIS ONE RANKS IN MY TOP 5 OF THEM ALL. SUPPORT THE BLUES AND BUY THIS DVD. LONG LIVE THE BLUES.........
