 DICKY BETTS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FAVORITE OF MINE. THAT SAID, THIS DVD IS A GOOD REMINDER HOW STRONG THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND WAS, WHEN HE WAS STILL IN IT. I DON'T THINK THAT EITHER IS AS STRONG MUSICALLY WITHOUT EACH OTHER. SADLY, I THINK THE A.B.B WILL SURVIVE WITHOUT DICKY, BUT DICKY SEEMS AT A LOST WITHOUT THEM. HIS VOCALS ON THIS DVD ARE NOT VERY GOOD. THE PLAYING AND SONG SELECTION SEEM TO SAY THAT HIS BEST DAYS ARE BEHIND HIM.THAT SAID, THIS DVD IS STILL VERY GOOD........ROCK ON DICKY...!
