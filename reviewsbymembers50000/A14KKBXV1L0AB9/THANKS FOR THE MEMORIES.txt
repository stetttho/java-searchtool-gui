 I'VE BEEN A FAN OF THE LRB SINCE THEIR FIRST ALBUM.THEIR MUSIC IS TIMELESS AND SOUNDS AS GOOD TODAY (BSG), AS IN THE BEGINNING.THIS DVD IS EXCELLANT. THE CD OF THIS CONCERT IS MISSING SOME OF THE SONGS THAT ARE ON THE DVD, HOWEVER IT ALSO SOUNDS GREAT TOO. THEIR BACKUP MUSICIANS ARE GREAT. THEIR LEAD GUITARIST SIMON IS OFF THE CHARTS. SUPPORT THESE GUYS AND BUY THIS DVD. YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED.................!
