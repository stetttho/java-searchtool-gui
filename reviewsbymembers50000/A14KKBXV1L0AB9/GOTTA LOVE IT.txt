 IN THIS AGE OF DVD'S WE SEEM TO FORGET THAT THERE IS NO PERFECT CONCERT. I'VE BEEN A FAN OF LITTLE FEAT FOR OVER 25 YEARS AND EVERY CONCERT I'VE EVER BEEN TO, INCLUDING LITTLE FEAT, HAS HAD EITHER SOME LOUD RUDE FANS OR SOME TYPE OF SOUND PROBLEMS DURING THE SHOW. WHY SHOULD WE EXPECT ANYTHING DIFFERENT FROM A DVD CONCERT. THE MUSIC IS WHATS IMPORTANT, AND LITTLE FEAT REALLY DELIVER THE GOODS. IM JUST HAPPY THAT WE FINALLY HAVE THEM ON DVD IN GOOD QUALITY. I ALSO OWN THE "ROCKPALAST" DVD DONE IN 1977 WITH THE ORIGIONAL LINEUP. THE MUSIC GOOD BUT THE VIDEO WAS BAD. SO ROCK ON LITTLE FEAT. I THINK YOU SHOULD BUY THIS DVD JUST FOR THE RECORD IF NOTHING ELSE..................
