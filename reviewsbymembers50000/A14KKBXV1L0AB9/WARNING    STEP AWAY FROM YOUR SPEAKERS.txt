 I FOUND THIS CD BURIED IN THE BLUES SECTION OF MY LOCAL CD STORE.IT WAS RECCOMDED TO ME BY A FRIEND,SO I BOUGHT IT. BOY WAS I SURPRISED. THIS CD KICKED MY BUTT!!!!!!!! TO START WITH, KELLY HAS A GREAT BLUES VOICE. SECONDLY, SHE PLAYS GREAT GUITAR. EVERY SONG STANDS ALONE VERY WELL. AFTER ABOUT 10 LISTENINGS,I WENT TO HER WEB SITE AND BOUGHT THE REST OF HER CD'S. I THINK THIS ONE IS HER BEST. THAT SAID,"LIVE AT TOMMY'S ON MAIN" RECORDED ABOUT 5 YEARS AGO, SHOWCASES HER LIVE CHOPS VERY WELL.BY OWNING ALL OF HER RECORDINGS ONE CAN HEAR THE MUSICAL GROWTH OVER THE LAST 6 YEARS. WITH ANY HELP AT ALL FROM THE MUSIC INDUSTRY, SHE WILL MAKE A BIG NAME FOR HERSELF. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE OVERBLOATED MUSIC COMPANYS DON'T USUALLY SUPPORT THE BLUES BECAUSE IT DOSEN'T MAKE THEM ENOUGH MONEY!!!!! LOOK WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO SUSAN TEDESCHI'S NEW CD. FROM GOOD BLUES TO POP ... IN 2 OUTINGS. KELLY IS EVERYTHING SUSAN COULD HAVE BEEN...TO THE POINT- THIS CD ROCKS...............
