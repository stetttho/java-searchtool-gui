 I HAVE OWNED THIS UNIT FOR ABOUT A YEAR. IN THAT TIME I HAVE HAD MULTIPLE PROBLEMS IN THE COPYING AREA.SOMETIMES IT WONT COPY PAST THE 4TH CUT.OTHER TIMES IF THE BLANK ISNT PLACED IN THE UNIT JUST SO,IT WILL REJECT THE DISC.OTHER RECORDINGS HAVE DOUBLE ENDINGS ON THE SONGS.NOT GOOD FOR OVER 500 DOLLARS.THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND THE UNIT IS NOT USER FRIENDLY.I WOULD THINK TWICE BEFOR SPENDING MONEY ON THIS UNIT.
