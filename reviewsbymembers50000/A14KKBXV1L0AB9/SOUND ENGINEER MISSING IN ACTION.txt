 I HAVE A BIG PROBLEM WIYH CROWD NOISE ON LIVE CD'S. ITS EITHER WAY TOO MUCH,AS IN THIS CASE , OR NON EXISTANT  ON OTHER CD'S. IT SEEMS AS IF THE SOUND ENGINEER AND THE PRODUCER CANT FIND A MIDDLE GROUND. THE CHEERS ON THIS CD ARE, IN MY OPINION, ARE WAY OVER THE TOP. I THINK SADE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SERVED RECORDING IN A SMALLER VENUE.IT SOUNDS AS IF SHE WAS THE SECOND COMING OF THE BEATLES LIVE.THE RECORDING ITSELF IS VERY GOOD HOWEVER IT SOUNDS LIKE THE CROWD NOISE WAS ADDED LATER. IVE BEEN TO OVER 300 CONCERTS AND HAVE NEVER HEARD THE CROWD FADE IN AND OUT ON CUE. BUY THE DVD IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHY THE CROWD MAKES NOISE.TO HEAR THE CROWD ERUPT IN THE MIDDLE OF A SONG MAKES NO SENSE ON THE CD
