 I'M SOMEWHAT PERPLEXED AS TO THE REASONS FOR THIS INCARNATION AND TOUR OF QUEEN AND PAUL RODGERS. PAUL IS A GREAT FRONT MAN AND LEAD SINGER IN HIS OWN RIGHT. QUEEN WITHOUT FREDDIE MECURY IS LIKE THE BEATLES WITHOUT JOHN AND PAUL. IT DOSEN'T WORK UNLESS THE FANS OF QUEEN WILL SUPPORT IT.I THINK IT'S SAD THAT THE MILLIONS OF QUEEN FANS WOULD SETTLE FOR THIS. HOW QUICKLY THEY FORGET. ALLOW ME TO REMIND THOSE QUEEN FANS THAT THEY NEED TO REVISIT "QUEEN LIVE AT WIMBLEY" AND "QUEEN ON FIRE AT THE BOWL" TO REFOCUS THEIR "QUEEN" ENERGYS. THIS DVD IS VERY HARD TO WATCH BECAUSE OF THE "A SCENE A SECOND" EDITING THAT GOES ON THRU THE ENTIRE DVD. I'M SORRY BUT THIS TOUR AND DVD SMELLS THE SAME AS THE "CREAM REUNION TOUR AND DVD".........MONEY, MONEY, AND MORE MONEY. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE REAL QUEEN DVD'S. THEY REALLY PASS THE TEST OF TIME............
