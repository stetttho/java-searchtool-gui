 I'LL BE QUITE FRANK ! I'M NOT A HUGE EWF FAN BUT I GREW UP ON CHICAGO TRANSIT AUTHORITY, THE EARLY MUSIC.THAT SAID, WHO IS THIS COVER BAND CALLED "CHICAGO" ? I TRIED TO WATCH THE CHICAGO PORTION OUT OF RESPECT FOR THEIR NAME, BUT I FELT LIKE THIS WAS NOT REALITY. WELL, THIS IS REALITY AND IF YOU WANT "CHICAGO" THIS IS WHATS LEFT. SAD BUT TRUE. I'LL BE TAKING THIS BACK AND TRADING IT IN TOMORROW. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE THIS 2 STARS IS FOR THE EFFORT AND ENERGY OF THE MUSICIANS..........
