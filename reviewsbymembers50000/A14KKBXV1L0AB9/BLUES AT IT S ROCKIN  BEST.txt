 I WAS VERY SAD WHEN LUTHER ALLISON PASSED AND HAD TO WONDER WHO COULD FILL HIS SHOES. HE WAS ONE OF A KIND WITH A VERY SPECIAL SPIRIT.LOW AND BEHOLD, HIS SON STEPPED UP AND IS NOW CARRYING ON WHERE HIS FATHER LEFT OFF.WHAT A BLESSING TO SEE THAT KIND OF ENERGY AND QUALITY PLAYING.AFTER VIEWING THIS DVD, I'M GOING RIGHT OUT AND BUY HIS FIRST DVD FROM 1999.THIS CONCERT KICKS HARD AND AT THE END HE SINGS ONE FOR HIS DAD.HONOR THY FATHER AND MOTHER I SAY AND IT'S RARE THESE DAYS TO HERE IT SO WELL PUT BY BERNARD. THE ALLISON FAMILY LIVES ON. ALL BLUES MUSIC FANS SHOULD BUY AND SUPPORT THIS MAN.........
