 WHY WOULD ANY ARTIST KNOWINGLY ALLOW A DVD OF THIS POOR QUALITY TO BE SOLD. THIS IS NOT EVEN A GOOD CAMCORDER QUALITY DVD.I DON'T THINK ERIC WAS INVOLVED WITH THIS DVD.IT'S NOT EVEN A VERY GOOD BOOTLEG....AND THE 5 STAR REVIEW WAS FOR THE OTHER ERIC AT THE COACH HOUSE DVD. THATS THE ONE TO BUY....
