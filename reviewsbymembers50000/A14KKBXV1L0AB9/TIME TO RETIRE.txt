 I'VE BEEN A FAN OF FREDDY FENDER FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS AND LOVE HIS STYLE OF MUSIC. THAT SAID, I THINK ITS TIME FOR FREDDY TO RETIRE.AS AGE AND HEALTH ISSUES BECOME MORE THAN JUST CONVERSATION ONE HAS TO DO SOME SELF REFLECTING ON ONES ABILITIES TO PERFORM AT A MINIMUM STANDARD. AFTER VIEWING THIS DVD, I CAME AWAY WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT ITS A CASE OF YOUR MIND MAKING A PROMISE THAT YOUR BODY CAN'T FILL. ON THIS DVD FREDDY CAN HARDLY SING.HIS HEALTH ISSUES HAVE TAKEN THEIR TOLL ON HIS VOICE. THE SHOW IS JUST OK. IF ITS FREDDY YOU WANT, THEN BUY THE TEXAS TORNADOS LIVE IN AUSTIN. THERE IS ENOUGH FREDDY IN HIS HEYDAY TO KEEP YOU SMILIN'.
