 I'VE SEEN MOST OF WHAT TOM PETTY HAS ON DVD AND THIS SURPASSES EVERYTHING OUT THERE.THE WHOLE PROGRAM IS BEAUTIFULLY DONE AND YES HE DOES ROCK ALSO. HOWEVER TOM'S MUSIC IS MORE THAN ROCK AND ROLL. HE'S OLDER AND WISER HERE AND SHOWS HIS EXPIERENCE ON EVERY SONG. EVEN THE SLOWER SONGS GET THE ROYAL TREATMENT. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE OTHER DVD'S UNLESS YOU CAN FIND A COPY OF "PACK UP THE PLANTATION". I FOUND A COPY "FROM VHS TAPE TO DVD" ON EBAY. DONE CIRCA 1985, IT ROCKS...
