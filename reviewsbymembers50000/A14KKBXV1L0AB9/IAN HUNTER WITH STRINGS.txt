 AFTER ALL THESE YEARS OF ROCKIN' WE GET A VERY WATERED DOWN VERSION OF WHATS LEFT IN IAN'S TANK.I KNOW HE CAN STILL ROCK WITH THE BEST OF THEM, HOWEVER ON THIS DVD, WE GET MILKTOAST ENGLISH ROCK FOR ENGLISH BABY BOOMERS. IN MY OPINION, STRINGS HAVE NO PLACE IN ROCK AND ROLL!!!! I GAVE THIS DVD ONLY 3 STARS AND THAT WAS FOR THE EFFORT IT TOOK TO STAGE THIS SHOW. IANS NEW DVD WITH THE RANT BAND AND MICK RALPHS IS JUST THE TICKET. A REAL IAN HUNTER ROCK SHOW !!!! KEEP ROCKIN' IAN....
