 I'VE BEEN A FAN OF WILLY DEVILLE FOR 30 YEARS AND I FEEL SAD THAT HE HAS TOTALLY INCOMPANTANT CAMERA PEOPLE WORKING FOR HIM. ABOUT HALF WAY THRU THE SHOW A CAMERA MAN GOES SPASTIC. IN FOCUS, OUT OF FOCUS SHAKEY IMAGES ETC. FROM THE SONG SAVIOR FARE ON, THE SHOW SLIPPED INTO DISARRAY. OTHER THAN HEARING A FEW OLDER MINK DEVILLE SONGS, DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS DVD. BUY THE "BERLIN" DVD.IT GIVES YOU A BETTER DEFINATION OF WHO WILLY REALLY IS MUSICALLY AND IS FILMED A WHOLE LOT BETTER. AT ONE POINT WILLY ASKED IF ANYBODY HAD ANY MORPHINE. JUDGEING FROM THE CAMERA WORK ON THIS DVD, THE CAMERA MAN HAD IT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!
