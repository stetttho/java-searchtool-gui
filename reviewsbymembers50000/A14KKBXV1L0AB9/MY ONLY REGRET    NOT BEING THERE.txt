 IN MY OPINION THIS CD/DVD PACKAGE IS THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN. I OWN OVER 80 DVD CONCERTS AND THIS IS NUMBER ONE IN MY COLLECTION. FINALLY WE CAN SEE THE TRUE GENIUS OF WARREN HAYNES AND FRIENDS. WITH A RUNNING TIME OF ABOUT 3 HOURS, WARREN HAS PLENTY OF TIME TO EXPLORE FULLY THE TALENT OF GOV'T MULE IN ALL THEIR GLORY. BE AWARE THAT THIS MUSICAL EXPIERENCE IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS IT GETS. AFTER WATCHING THE DVD, I SAT STUNNED AT WHAT I HAD JUST WITNESSED. PACE YOURSELF BECAUSE THIS CONCERT GETS PRETTY INTENSE AT TIMES. GOT MULE? NOW I DO.............
