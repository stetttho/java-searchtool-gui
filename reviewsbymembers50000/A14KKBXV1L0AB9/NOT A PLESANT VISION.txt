 I'LL GET RIGHT TO THE POINT ! THIS DVD IS NOT GOOD AT ALL. IT'S FOR DIEHARD FANS ONLY!!!!!!!! JOE LOOKS VERY LOADED. THE BACKUP SINGERS ARE OFTEN OFF KEY AND THE MIX IS HORRIBLE. IF YOU WANT EXCELLANT JOE THE BUY THE "ACROSS FROM MIDNIGHT" DVD. THAT DVD IS THE BENCHMARK JOE DVD. I'VE OWNED THEM ALL AND THAT ONE IS BY FAR THE BEST.........
