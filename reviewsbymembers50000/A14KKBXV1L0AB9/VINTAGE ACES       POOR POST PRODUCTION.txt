 I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF THE"ACES" FOR 25 YEARS. THEIR MUSIC IS ALWAYS GREAT. THERE POST PRODUCTION HAS BEEN SUMWHAT SUSPECT AS OF LATE.THE ONLY DOWN SIDE TO THIS RECORDING IS THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS COPIED FROM A RECORD COMPLETE WITH ALOT OF BACKGROUND NOISE, CRACKS, AND POPS. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING. I ALWAYS LISTEN TO A CD THE FIRST TIME VIA HEADPHONES. BOY WAS I SURPRISED TO HEAR ALL THE EXCESS NOISE. THE MUSIC AND SINGING ARE JUST AS I REMEMBER THEM IN THE MIDDLE "80s". LIKE A FINE WINE. IT JUST GETS BETTER WITH AGE..........
