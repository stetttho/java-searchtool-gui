 THE POSITIVE FACTS FIRST, IT'S ALWAYS FUN WATCHING ERIC CLAPTON BLAZE AWAY ON THE GUITAR AND HE CERTAINLY DOES THAT ON THIS DVD. JACK AND GINGER SOUND PRETTY GOOD ALSO. NOW FOR THE NEGATIVE FACTS. FIRST, THE EDITING OF THIS DVD IS MARGIONAL AT BEST. WAY TOO MANY AUDIENCE SHOTS, FROM THE OTHER END OF THIS HUGE VENUE TO CLOSEUPS OF PLASTIC CUPS AND THE BACKS OF SPEAKERS. IT SEEMS AS IF EVERY TIME THE BAND REALLY STARTS SMOKIN', THE CAMERAS END UP SHOWING HALLWAY AUDIENCE SHOTS.SECONDLY, THE MUSIC IS VERY DATED EVEN THOUGH ITS PLAYED WELL. 35 YEARS AGO IT WAS CUTTING EDGE STUFF.NOW ITS JUST A FLASH FROM THE PAST.DID WE REALLY NEED A "CREAM" REUNION ? I SAW "CREAM" BACK IN THE DAY AND IT WAS MAGICIAL. NOW IT SEEMS AS IF THEY ARE JUST GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS, TRYING TO RECAPTURE A MAGICAL MOMENT IN TIME. WELL, FOR ME, SOME MAGICAL MOMENTS CANNOT BE REDONE. LET IT REST, BOYS.....................
