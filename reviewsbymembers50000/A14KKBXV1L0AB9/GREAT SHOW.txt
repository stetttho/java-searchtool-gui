 I'M A LONG TIME JEFF HEALEY FAN AND WAS BLOWN AWAY AFTER VIEWING THIS DVD! JEFF JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER WITH AGE.THE VISUAL AND AUDIO ARE FIRST RATE.HIS PLAYING IS INCREDIBLE TO WATCH. IF YOU LIKE STRAIGHT UP BLUES/ROCK THEN BUY THIS DVD NOW. THE SAD THING IS THAT HE HAD TO GO TO CANADA TO GET SIGNED TO A RECORDING CONTRACT. THAT JUST GOES TO SHOW HOW SCREWED UP THE MUSIC BUSINESS IS TODAY AND HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME......MONEY, MONEY, MONEY EQUALS AMERICAN IDOL, WHILE REALLY TALENTED PEOPLE GET TOSSED ASIDE. ROCK ON JEFF!!!!
