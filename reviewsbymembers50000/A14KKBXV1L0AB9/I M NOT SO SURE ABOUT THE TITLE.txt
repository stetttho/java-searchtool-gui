 FIRST AND FORMOST, I LOVE THE MANY FORMS AND STYLES OF THE BLUES. THAT SAID, I THINK THERE ARE SOME BLUES BANDS THAT ARE GOOD BUT NOT GREAT. EXAMPLE, THIS BAND COMPARED TO THE FABULOUS THUNDERBIRDS. THE T-BIRDS KICK BUTT EVEN ON THEIR " TUFF ENUFF " 1985 DVD. THE BLUES COMPANY NEVER SEEM TO GET OUT OF SECOND GEAR. PLUS ALL THE TALKING IS IN GERMAN. GREAT FOR GERMANS, NOT SO GREAT FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T SPEAK GERMAN. THE VOCALS ARE IN ENGLISH WHICH CONFUSES THE VIEWER EVEN MORE. THE GUITARIST IS VERY GOOD BUT NOT TOO INSPIRING. OVERALL THIS IS A GOOD DVD BUT NOT SOMETHING I WILL KEEP IN MY COLLECTION.........
