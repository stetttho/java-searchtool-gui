 This remembranceof a friendship between two married couples over a lifetime is a mellow denouement of Stegner's career, written late in his life.  It is not only the story of a set of friendships, but also of two different yet equally complex long-term marriages.  And it is, on yet another level, as a remembrance by the writer/character Larry, an exploration of how the novel, how art, touches upon reality, real life, when trying to portray "ordinary" lives, without seeming to impose a structure and meaning that misshape that experience.  And, on yet another level, it is about the inability of individuals to control his/her life, that there are those elements of chance, both good and unfortunate, which deny that control we sometimes think we have.  In the novel's case, the fortunate chance that the Langs meet the Morgans in some small college in the midwest in the midst of the depression; alongside the unfortunate happenstance of Sally Morgan's contracting polio.   The novel tries very hard, through its narrator, to portray ordinary lives(albeit academics and upper/upper-middle class).  It is also about the complexities of love, both familial/marital and the love between friends.   And, while unassumingly achieving all that, it brings to the pages the splendid character of Charity Lang, who is at the center of this novel.   That these two couples remain friends, that these marriages - in their complexities of romance and misplaced ambitions and egoisms - forbear in lasting love, is the novel's affirmation.
