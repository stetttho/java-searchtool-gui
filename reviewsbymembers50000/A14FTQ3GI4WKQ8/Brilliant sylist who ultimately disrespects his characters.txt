 Updike continues to elicit, from me,a mixed reaction: on the one hand, he is clearly a spectacular stylist, with an incredible sensory encyclopedia of detail, a fine command of the language, and an ambition to reach out and capture the portrait of an entire social era.  And yet, ultimately, he portrays these middle-class people with condescension.  People who are, finally, just pathetic in their confusion, usually aimless and shallow and irresponsible.  In the figure of Rabbit himself, Harry Angstrom, one experiences a largely passive, terribly irresponsible man who hardly realizes the moral dimensions of his experience.  Married to a woman who is equally irresponsible in abandoning her child, equally shallow in equating sexual fulfillment and an encouragement of self-esteem from a man who is unwilling to make a marital commitment to her and has an affair with her own sister-in-law and then settles for her unsatisfactory marriage fatalistically.  It's as if Updike sees these middle-class people as stupid and aimless and amoral, in an era - the sixties, which overwhelms them.  And he meanwhile elevates their language to his own, giving them insights that are pointless to their lives as he sees them, and not realistically and respectfully a part of who they are.  Here is a talented writer who chooses to write about a society of people he doesn't care about.
