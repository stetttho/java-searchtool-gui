 This is more a long essay than a full-fledged treatment of a very complex subject.  But sometimes it is invaluable to take an overview, to separate the forest from the trees.  And Wood is skillful in outlining major issues underlying the details of these events and personalities.  His views on the transformation of ideology during the Revolution, the innovations during the Confederacy period, the basic conceptual shift represented by the Constitution, are communicated with clarity and insight.  This,without losing sight of the extemperaneity of those events, the trial-and-error of much of it, the incapacity to foresee what had never before been tried.  Readable, concise, and insighful.
