 Fitzgerald, in this book as with another I've read, shows herself to be a precise and evocative miniaturist.  The sweep of the events surrounding the main character, the English gentleman Frank, is brought into his small world, one of limited perceptions and a desperate need for equilibrium.  A great deal of the novel is happening out of the range of Frank, and just as much is unperceived or misperceived by Frank.  So that the ending is a series of shocks, some of which are not quite comprehensible.   Frank sees it all in domestic terms: his wife has left him, and left him with the chidlren; he is advised by his friend, the seemingly muddle-headed idealist Selwyn; visited by his brother-in-law, also seeming to be muddle-headed, Charlie.  But the Russian Revolution is swirling around him, and encroaches upon that world, re-defining this crisis in Frank's small life.   Fitzgerald at once brings a wry humor to the novel, but it has an Austen edge to it, and is in an environment that adds a shadow of pervading seriousness.  At the same time, we see more than Frank but less than many others, caught between the English humor and the socio-political storm. It is a subtle and provocative book.  And short.
