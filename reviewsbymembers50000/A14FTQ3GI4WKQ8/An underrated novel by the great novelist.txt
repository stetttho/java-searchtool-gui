 This is a surprisingly fine novel, so often overlooked, by James.  About the usual upper-class Londoners near the turn of the century.  In this case, disturbed by the arrival of an acquaintance of the earlier generation, one women in particular, and his effect upon the marital prospects of that woman's granddaughter, with whom he establishes a special relationship.  Each person has an agenda, often at complex cross-purposes, filtered through misunderstandings, indirectness in communications, and the hypocrisy of greed and social ambitions.  One need only get through James' penchant for the prepositional phrase, and his characters' habit of so seldom saying anything simply and directly.  to be rewarded with a rare reading experience.
