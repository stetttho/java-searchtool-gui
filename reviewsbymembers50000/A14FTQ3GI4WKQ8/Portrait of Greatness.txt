 This is not the usual biography, which seeks new original source material and catalogues facts and events.  It is an attempt at portraiture of the most reticent of our forefathers.  Ellis explores the mind and emotions of Washington through his known actions and known information about him from his own words and those of others who were there with him.  What is the nature of his greatness?  Why was he the right person at the right time?  What did he contribute to the beginnings of our country?  There are struggles for Ellis, such as Washington's attitudes and actions regarding slavery.  But there is a real excitement in that struggle, the uplift of Ellis trying to fathom the inner workings of this great man at this unique time in our history, with its unique needs.    Washington emerges from this exploration as a man of vision, of experiential intelligence, of physical courage, and of undiminishing dedication.  At one and the same time, Ellis succeeds in penetrating the mythical ikon while not faltering to sometimes-fashionable denigration or apologetic idealization.  By doing that, he makes Washington vivid, and however imperfect, most admirable.  It does, indeed, establish one criterion by which we might judge our current political leaders.  It does, also, help define who we are as a nation by seeing more clearly this aspect of our origins.  It does, finally, make one proud of that heritage, and thankful for that blessing.
