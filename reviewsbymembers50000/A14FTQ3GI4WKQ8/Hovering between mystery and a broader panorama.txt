 This provocative, skillfully written book by Perez-Riverte shows a writer hovering between a number of genre - the mystery novel, the historical novel, and an urge for something more.  He is a journalist by "trade", and that shows in his research - here, an extraordinary and nuanced knowledge of fencing, Spanish and 19th century, as well as Spanish political history.  The prose is often lambent, overwhelming the storyline, the usual devices and limitations of mystery novels and historical novels.  Those who read it as either of these will be - and by the reviews here, were - disappointed.  that is understandable, but unwarranted.  This novel of his is different, more than that, but still tethered to those genres, trying to stretch past them but confusedly not quite achieving that.   In Perez-Riverte, in this first novel of his I've read, there seems a talent not unlike P.D. James, a prose talent arching over the mystery genre.  And an intellectual curiosity that touches the same world as, let's say, Byatt.  It is often hypnotic, and it is a puzzle.  But in a most favorable way.
