 This mystery takes place on Nantucket Island, which I've visited.  And the feel of the island is nicely drawn by Langton, if not with particular colorfulness.  the incredible coincidence at the core of the mystery, however, undermines the novel.  It demands a leap of "faith", that is, fantasy beyond any degree of realism, which I was not willing to take.  In a nutshell: Langton, here, can't tell a story.
