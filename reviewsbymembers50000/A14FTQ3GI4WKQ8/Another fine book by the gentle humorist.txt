 This is yet another book of Lodge's that I've read, for me his latest.  And, again, I find his humor gently heartfelt, his guy-perspective identifiably familiar to me, and his craftsmanship assured.  This is a more somber effort, about a man in mid-life neurosis, an artist at the end of his commercial rope, his lovable marriage at a sudden end.  While it sustains a humor that derives from an understanding and ultimately lighthearted attitude towards the modern urban environment, and the distresses of the middle-age male, it also delves the intellectual and emotional depths that approach the shadowy landscape of despair.   And Lodge does some showing off, in taking ont he voices of the women characters only to reveal the "author's" voice.  And his style moves from Neil Simon-like one-liners to a more somber and perceptively introspective mode, as part of Passmore's journey towards a renewed maturity. Lodge does seem to flail a bit to find a resolution to these new depths and tone of his work, between the nostalgia of a first-love renewed and a still-loved but lost wife.  He does not surrender to gross sentimentality.  But the book does paint itself into a corner, in which only sentimentality of some sort is possible. Lodge is a most likeable writer.  And one who respectfully confronts the male world with a smile.
