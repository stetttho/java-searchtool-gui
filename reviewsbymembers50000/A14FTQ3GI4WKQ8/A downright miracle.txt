 I'm not a cook.  But during winter months especially, I do make a few soups to help in the household.  And this book is the one I usually use as my guide.  I need a recipe.  I need recipes that are foolproof.  And here is where I get them.  Not only does every recipe end in a soup that is edible, but one that is tasty and repeatable.  That, with this "cook", is downright miraculous!  There is variety here, a learning experience, and in the end a soup that is invariably a tasty success.  And I'm not even Italian.
