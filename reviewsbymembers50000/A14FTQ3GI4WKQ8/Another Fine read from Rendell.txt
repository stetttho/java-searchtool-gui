 I have never read a boring book by Ruth Rendell. This one centers on a quiet and unnoticed psychopath. As she often does, Rendell places two stories side by side, and brings them together in a mind-blowing resolution. Here, the story of one man's romance with a woman married to a violent mate, and a psychopath brought to the edge by seemingly tiny cirucmstances. It may be a bit schematic - two men who coinicdentally have the same first initial and last name, a woman who leaves her violent husband just as the other story has reached a climactic crisis - but it is so much fun, so imaginative and not-quite-predictable, and such a fitting reader-revenge - that it is forgiveable.  It does seem: you can always count on Rendell.
