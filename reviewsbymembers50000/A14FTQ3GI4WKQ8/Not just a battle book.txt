 Having researched the Revolutionary period recently, I became increasingly curious about Washington among the founding fathers.  This book not only relates the exciting battles of Trenton and Princeton, but does so as a multi-perspective portrait of the various elements of the British army and political environment.  The description of the first battle of Trenton - an attack by the desperate American forces facing an unexpected sleet storm - is mesmerizing.  Fischer's set of perspectives that only makes more vivid the central events and the central figure, George Washington.  It only adds to the reputation of a man who, with less education, understood most deeply the requirements of a leader in this unique situation, and adapted to a new strategy of guerilla warfare that made what seemed an impossible victory possible.  It is downright inspiring.  Fischer writes with dramatic insight, with a wide-ranging respectful empathy for all sides in this pivotal conflict, and with a main focus upon the great man in its midst.
