 I first read Jane Austen as a freshman in college, reading PRIDE AND PREJUDICE in one fabulous day, a singular feat for me.  I can only add my voice to those praising her works, which are deceptively unpretentious and  straighforward.  This one, late in her career, is a bit complicated at  first with a myriad of relatives and relationships.  But at its core it is  a mature portrait of social pressures on women, focused on an intelligent  and wise and loving woman who finds a man equal to her.  It is not merely a  good story, not merely proto-feminist, not merely a satire... it is all of  those, and a lovely read.
