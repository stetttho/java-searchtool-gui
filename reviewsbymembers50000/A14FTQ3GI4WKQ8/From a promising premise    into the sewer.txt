 Aubert begins with a fascinating premise, the whole novel from the persepctive of a young woman who is paralyzed, dumb and blind. And that is a beguiling perspective, and a frightening one, which is - importantly - guilded with a sharp sense of humor, especially refreshing for one in that devestating state. And, for awhile, that's enough. Because Aubert does keepone guessing, as to whom is killing all those 8 year-old boys and defacing them horribly. But then, the solution begins to develop through ever-more murders, including several attacks upon the woman herself, for - it turns out - no better reason than hate. And through this dung-heap of violence, one begins to notice one wildly improbable event after another - a coincidence here, a relationship out of the blue there, a connection that's as farfetched as a satellite from Pluto... And then you come to the climactic revelation. Through the longest scene of melodramatic mishmash I've endured for quite some time. Just as the French admire Jerry Lewis, this prize-winner is inexplicable to me.
