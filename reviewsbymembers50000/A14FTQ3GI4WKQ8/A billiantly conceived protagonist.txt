 Ms. Lathbury is a 30-something unmarried woman in 1950's smalltown England.  She is the voice of this novel, one of edgy humor, the pathos of repressed and unrealized romanticism, and an acceptance of men's lax attitude towards her without a trace of self-pity.  Pym does indeed remind one of Austen, in her voicing of women in a secondary place in society, too dependent upon men and marriage, in an era now gone-by, the era of postwar England no less distant than Austen's.  "Excellent women" are those "old maids" who are not very attractive physically, and are therefore - however unfairly - the half-seen nurturers of their society.  The men are - each and every one - presumptuous, myopic, self-indulgent.  Yet Lathbury sees them clearly but without bitterness, and without fatalism. This is a delicately written, observant and complexly perceptive novel.
