 There are very few writers who can sustain a humorous novel.  It is a talent wildly under-appreciated until one seeks out those few examples of truly funny books: currently, David Lodge, last century, P.G. Wodehouse.  A few others.  And then there are the Dortmunder novels by Westlake, who takes the mystery genre and turns it into clever, lovable, hilarious adventures of these star-crossed robbers.   This one, his most recent, returns to the level of his earlier ones, those memorable ones like the serial robberies in HOT ROCKS and "bank-robbing" taken too literally in BANK SHOT and the un-robbery of WHY ME?  These are shamelessly shallow feel-good lovable entertainments: a rare accomplishment for any novelist in any period.  This one, about DNA and Native Americans' casinos, is a splendid hoot.
