 This is my first book by McEwen, who has more recently won the Booker Prize.  It is written in the style of a pseudo-documentary, its main character being a sceince writer of struggling rationality confronted with  an emotionally disturbed mystic, making that all the more fitting.  It is  compelte with footnotes, at least some of which are imaginary, and a  scientific paper that is imaginary.  This patina of scientific fact is  fascinating, if also moving the reader to a dsitance from the emotional  texture of what is depicted.  And being from a single point of view,  punctured only by letters from the disturbed person and one from the  victim's lover, it brings to the landscape of a rational scientific mind a  world of wild emotions and mystical inexplicables.   So that McEwen,  through these techniques and with this story, is exploring whole worlds of  social realities.  It is, then, an ambitious work and is in many aspects  quite successful.  Along with that, the story itself has a cumulative  suspense, a sense of an inevitable tragedy (that does not quite happen), a  sad deconstruction of a loving but untested marital-type relationship.  The  writing, the viewpoint through the sensibilities of its narrator, is cool  and crafted, the high emotions combining with intellectual considerations.   That makes it unusual, and a bit difficult, but not without its rewards.
