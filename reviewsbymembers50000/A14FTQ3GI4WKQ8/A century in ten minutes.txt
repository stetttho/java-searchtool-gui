 This exploration of a ten-minute explosive meeting between philosophers Wittgenstein and Popper at Cambridge is not just about philosophy,although it focuses on what the authors make a seminal conflict between two sharply divided perspectives on morality in a world gone brutal.  It is also about two Jewish men, both brought up in Vienna at the height of its anti-Semitism; it's about mid-century history, the consequences and personal intellectual and deeply emotional responses, the hope and despair, that came out of two world wars and the haolacaust.  It is also about what might be seen as the dry heights of philosophical argument, as two men whose entire lives are devoted to different visions, commitments to different definitions of one's role in a tumultuous, terrifying and endlessly pioneering time in our lives.   This book is extraordinary in its extending this one short meeting, these two seemingly ego-centric and insulated academics and their philosophies, to something that matters.
