 FYI, on January 10, 2005, reviewer Nadine Mueller "nanimue" (Wuerzburg, Germany) gave low ratings to a different slang book, but recommended this one ("Kauderwelsch: American Slang, das andere Englisch"). It not only contains German slang but also German translations of American slang.    Of course, slang keeps evolving quickly, while book publishing usually moves as slow as a glacier, so the words you learn in a book can be out of date.  Ms. Mueller says the best way to learn slang is to ask native speakers.  Even if you can't do that by travelling to a German-speaking country, try to find a German-American neighborhood, store, or restaurant in/near your city.  If that fails, there's always the Internet.
