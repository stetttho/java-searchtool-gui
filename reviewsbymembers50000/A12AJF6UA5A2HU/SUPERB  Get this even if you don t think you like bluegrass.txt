 Gorgeous singing, virtuosic playing, well-written songs, and a lively crowd come together in this 2-CD set recorded live in Louisville, Kentucky.  Alison Krauss is credited with crossing over from country-bluegrass to a wider audience, but I'd go one further and say she has the power to bring you back over with her, even if you never thought you liked country or bluegrass music.  I got hooked on the ballads you'd find on the "Forget About It" and "New Favorite" albums (Stay, Maybe, New Favorite, etc.), which Alison sings heartbreakingly beautifully, and with the good taste of simple accompaniment.  Those songs were so good that I was persuaded to listen to other Union Station songs.  Some jangled my non-country mind at first, but after another listen, I could hear what incredibly accomplished instrumentalists and vocalists they all are! For one thing, Alison is not only a great singer, but a great fiddler!  Jerry Douglas is a real master of the Dobro (a type of guitar specially designed to be louder and more resonant).  Dan Tyminski's singing, especially in The Boy Who Wouldn't Hoe Corn, is haunting--O, those blues-y notes and ornamentations!  You'll love the imagery of the lyrics for Ghost in This House.  But I hate to leave out Ron Block and Barry Bales, because their playing and singing are excellent, too, in solo and as part of the incredible harmonizing.  And it's really fun to hear the live crowd having such a good time!
