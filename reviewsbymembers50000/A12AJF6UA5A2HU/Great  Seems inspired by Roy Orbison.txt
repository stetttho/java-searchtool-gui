 This song is a little strange on first hearing but it really grows on you.  I kept thinking "Who does she remind me of in this song?"  Finally, it dawned on me--Chris Issak.  But really it's a person who seems to have influenced both Beth Gibbons and Chris Isaak:  Roy Orbison, with his distinctive, wonderful way of conveying pain and longing (e.g., "Cryin'").  It's really interesting to hear Orbison's style transposed to a female voice.   So try listening to this more than once before you reject it.  But, just in case, keep the Prozac handy. :)
