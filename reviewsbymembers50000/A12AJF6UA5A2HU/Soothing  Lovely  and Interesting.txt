 This is wonderfully relaxing--great for putting yourself into a meditative mood or winding down at bedtime.  Unlike many attempts at "fusion" between different styles (which too often clash), this blend of Western and Hindu/Bengali styles really works. The vocalist has a lovely and pure voice, with good range--great for the exotic scales of the composition. The accompanying Indian instruments are lovely, too, and interesting.   I note that one reviewer feels this music goes nowhere.  Indeed, it is somewhat repetitive, but that's what I'd expect from a chant.  To me, there is just enough repetition to bring on a meditative state, but not too much to be boring--there is just enough variety of melody, rhythm, dynamics (loud/soft), and instrumentation. If you like this, download Govindam.  Also see what you think of Kabe Habe Bolo; I think it's beautiful, even though the mood is somewhat marred by some bass guitar riffs that are a little too rock-pop to suit the rest of the composition. If you like the 3 free downloads, you will probably like the Union and Devotion CDs.   And if you want an example of another amazingly beautiful fusion of cultures, listen to a song called Mais Filhos de Gandhi, sung by Indian-Brazilian Ana Rita Simonka on her Bossa Nova Delhi CD.
