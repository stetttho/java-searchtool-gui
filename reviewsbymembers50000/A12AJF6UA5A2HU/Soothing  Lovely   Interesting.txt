 This is wonderfully relaxing--great for putting yourself into a meditative mood or winding down at bedtime. Unlike many attempts at "fusion" between different styles (which too often clash), this blend of Western and Hindu/Bengali styles really works. The vocalist has a lovely and pure voice, with good range--great for the exotic scales. The accompanying Indian instruments are lovely, too, and interesting.  I should caution that this music is more to RELAX to than to LISTEN to; it's somewhat repetitive, as one would expect from chants. However, to me, there is just enough repetition to bring on a meditative state, but not too much to be boring--there is some variety of melody, rhythm, dynamics (loud/soft), and instrumentation. Additional recommendations: If you like Indian music, I highly recommend Call of the Valley.  And if you want an example of another amazingly beautiful fusion of cultures, listen to a song called Mais Filhos de Gandhi, sung by Indian-Brazilian Ana Rita Simonka on her Bossa Nova Delhi CD.
