 Perfect for just letting your mind drift--play this for a mini-break or while meditating, giving yourself a facial, napping, studying, etc.  The pace is slow and gentle, and the layers of sounds are lovely:  a peaceful flowing melodic line is bolstered with low droning notes and high bell-like peals.  The sounds are close enough to nature (like a soft rain) to be very soothing.
