 This is not one of the best songs from the Union CD, but it has a lot going for it:  lovely melody, pure vocals, and interesting instrumentation.  I think it's beautiful, but the mood is somewhat marred by some bass guitar riffs that are a little too rock-pop to suit the rest of the composition. Samsara and Govindam are better.  If you like those, you will probably like the Union and Devotion CDs.  And if you want an example of another amazingly beautiful fusion of cultures, listen to a song called Mais Filhos de Gandhi, sung by Indian-Brazilian Ana Rita Simonka on her Bossa Nova Delhi CD.
