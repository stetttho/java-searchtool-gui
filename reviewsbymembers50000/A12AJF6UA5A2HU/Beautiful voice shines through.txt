 Alison Krauss's incredibly beautiful, soothing, and expressive voice shines through in this song.  She is accompanied by the extremely talented musicians of Union Station.  (At the end of this song, following a brief pause, there's also something funny.) My husband and I have become ADDICTED to "AKUS," even though we dislike most country music and only had a nodding acquaintance with bluegrass.  When we heard AKUS "cross over" into lovely folk and blues, we were so charmed that we were willing to cross back with them and listen to their traditional bluegrass numbers with an open mind.  Now we love everything they do.  Another sad but gorgeous song you should hear is "Maybe" -- the harmonies are fantastic.  For a completely different mood, listen to the upbeat and wry "The Lucky One."  "Stay" is also lovely.
