 This is a very good video. Even though I have over 25 years of experience on the guitar, Jim Tolles' explanations were captivating and prevented me from assuming things that would lead to bad habits. He is clear, articulate and addresses the important points that a personal instructor would provide. The video itself is well done, with a time frame in the upper right of the video so that you can rewind and play sections over and over for practice purposes. The "Fiddler Primer" book by Jim Tolles is a recommended companion to the video, and is also available here on Amazon.com.
