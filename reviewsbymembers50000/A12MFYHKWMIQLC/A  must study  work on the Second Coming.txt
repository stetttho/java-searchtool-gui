 MacArthur's book is an excellent defender of premillenialism, and a primer on the pretribulation rapture view. The fallacies of the preterist position become obvious from the careful exposition of scripture. In this reviewer's opinion, however, MacArthur does not provide sufficient scriptural evidence for claiming that the 70th Week of Daniel is synonymous with a 7-year "Tribulation Period", nor does he successfully support from scripture the assertion that the Tribulation Period is a time of God's judgment. These are two fundamental points that the Pre-Wrath view has called into question, and which continue to fuel the supposition that pre-tribulationism has some major flaws regarding the timing of the rapture. Also of interest is the text devoted to imminency. The claim for imminence has been a third component of the Pre-Wrath attack, and MacArthur does provide a good explanation of imminence. However, he avoids the question of "When did Christ's return become imminent?" Since there are specific prophecies which we have seen fulfilled, it can be argued that Christ's return was not imminent until those certain prophecies were fulfilled. For example, Christ Himself prophesied that the Holy Spirit must come. Therefore, His return was not imminent immediately upon His ascension. The same might be said for the destruction of the temple in 70 A.D. Since scripture specifically states that God has fixed the time of Christ's coming by His own authority (Acts 1:7), Christ's return is not at "any moment". It will occur at the appointed time, which arguably could be any moment *from our perspective*. This, therefore, is the crux of the problem with imminence: *our perspective* is irrelevant. We must simply, and obediently, be prepared. Also missing (unless I missed it!) is the classic Rev. 3:10 argument. But then, this is not a "rapture" book as much as it is a premillenial book. Excellent material, as usual, from one of our generation's greatest expositors.
