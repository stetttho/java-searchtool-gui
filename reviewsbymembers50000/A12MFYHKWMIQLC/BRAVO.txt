 A perfect treatise on the church's sidetracked theology that we can change the world through political might.   This book defends the Christian's responsiblity to be involved, but correctly eschews trusting in man-made structures such as government to solve what are spiritual problems at the core.  This book will cause Christians to consider whether God has ever given them the right to punish the world through boycotts or other hevay-handed methods of force.  Another excellent resource in the same vein is "Blinded by Might" by Cal Thomas and Ed Dobson.
