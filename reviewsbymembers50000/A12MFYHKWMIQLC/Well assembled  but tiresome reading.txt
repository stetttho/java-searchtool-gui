 The author has done a great job putting together historical ideas related  to the Great Pyramid.  However, the book rambles too much with so many  mythological examples. The tables drone on and on, and the reader is left  wondering where he has been and where he is going.  The text would be  better if it had focused only on decoding the Great Pyramid, and not trying  to address every ancient symbolism that came to the author's mind.  There  are so many sidebars that you aren't sure what to read as you turn each  page.  I was looking for a book that gave me the facts, drawings, figures  and historical data about the pyramid itself.  This book's predisposition  is mostly mythological. In the book, the appendices are the best part for  the text.  The book does not have a lot of photos concerning the pyramid,  but it does have many drawings, illustrations and tables.
