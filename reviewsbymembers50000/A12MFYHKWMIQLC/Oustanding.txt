 This is a clearly presented, non-sensational book. It is arguably the only work on the pyramids that approaches the subject without the preconception of mummies and tombs. Clear, documented facts are presented. When coupled with a non-secular view of the ancient world as presented in works by Drs. Henry Morris and John C. Whitcomb, it becomes more comprehensible that ancient man was far more advanced and had the time, resources and knowledge to harness physics for practical purposes. This reviewer does not take the bait hook, line and sinker -- Dunn may be incorrect; but the theory of the Great Pyramid as a harmonic generator is compelling to say the least.
