 This is the kind of book that reads well in bed at night. It is calm, interesting and generally informational. it is not a classic MacArthur book dealing with a hard-hitting theological issue.  In fact, this book is the first one by MacArthur that actually reads into scripture a certain quantity of "dot-connected" conclusions. For example, the personalities of the apostles are described by MacArthur where there is no true description revealed in scripture.  The chapter on Peter is fantastic, as is the one on Judas Isacriot. However, MacArthur's treatment of Nathaniel was my favorite.
