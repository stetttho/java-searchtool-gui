 I was mildly disappointed with this DVD. Nice clear video and great sound [especially in DTS]. Maybe too much time spent on closeups of Johnny. Music performance uninspired. Johnny looks and sounds tired. Band members playing as though they were on the last leg of an exhausting tour. The Rick Rubin American Recordings several years later really brought out the great soul that Johnny was [is]. It was an emotional moment for me when June Carter Cash joined Johnny on stage and I really appreciated Johnny covering songs by John Prine and Guy Clark, but despite the great venue this was a rather mediocre concert.
