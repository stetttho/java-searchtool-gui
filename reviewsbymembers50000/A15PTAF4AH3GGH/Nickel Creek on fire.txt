 Imagine putting Ralph Stanley and Kurt Cobain in a studio and assigning them to arrange and produce an album that they both liked. An impossible and absurd collaboration? Nope. Why Should the Fire Die could be the result of such a hypothetical synthesis of musical styles----check out the track Can't Complain. Although those who hoped Nickel Creek would return to traditional bluegrass will be disappointed, this CD is a very positive step forward and is one of their best releases.   I would love to see this band live.
