 Read the reviews sent to Amazon and you will see that Dogville was either passionately loved or hated. Please include me amongst those that love this film. Only the first few minutes were difficult before I became totally involved. The 3 hour length was not too long. The DVD is a very worthwhile addition to a serious film library.
