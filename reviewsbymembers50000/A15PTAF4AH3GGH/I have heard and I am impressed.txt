 This CD was released late in 2005 and it seems to have been overlooked by critics and fans. I can imagine what a tour de force Toshi must be live. On this album Toshi is out in front with clarity and power that puts her in a league all by herself. Every track on this CD is good. And wow what a take on Heartbeak Hotel!
