 There are those who did not like the production Glen Ballard gave 'Love Shelby'.  I am NOT one of those folks and I appreciated that album a lot.  'Identity Crisis' will please them with its relatively spare arrangements. It is an album of good taste and musical beauty that stands out in the plethora of female pop and country artists currently being promoted.   ALL of Shelby's fans will enjoy this cd!
