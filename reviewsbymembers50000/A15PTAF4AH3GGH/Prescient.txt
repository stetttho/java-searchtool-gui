 Over a half century in age this film holds up well. I was 8 years old when I saw this in a theater and I was really scared. Of course the film is no longer scary at all [probably not even for todays 8 year olds], but it does reveal itself as intelligent prescient science fiction. The message is just as valid today as it was in 1951 when it looked like we were going to blow each other up with atomic bombs. The black and white transfer is excellent, but I had to turn up the volume quite a bit to hear the dialogue. Really good value at less than ten bucks!
