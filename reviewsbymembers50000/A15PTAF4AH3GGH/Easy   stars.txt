 Showtime [DirecTV] offered a free weekend of their programming and based on a positive review I read, I casually tuned into the pilot of Dead Like Me. I am generally hard to impress, but this was love at first sight [watch]. I ordered Showtime and I have not missed one episode of season one or two.  I only recently discovered that this DVD was available and I immediately ordered it from Amazon. This series deserves special awards in multiple categories. If you missed it on TV, get this DVD!
