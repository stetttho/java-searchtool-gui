 This album has had the same emotional impact on me that Otis Redding's track Sitting by the Dock of the Bay had on me 40 years ago. The allusions by other reviewers to Nina Simone and Nick Cave are accurate. I would ask the author of the August 4th one star review---whose other reviews are very intelligent---to give this CD another listen. I am very glad I bought this recording. At the right time and in the right atmosphere it is a sublime musical experience.
