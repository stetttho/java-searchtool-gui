 I still have my hardback copy from 1975. It is ragged from the multiple readings and perusals I gave it for several years...I was thrilled and felt liberated by its content. So,why one star? There is no evil???? Please consider the following from the Bible: "Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by giving heed to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons" I Timothy 4:1.
