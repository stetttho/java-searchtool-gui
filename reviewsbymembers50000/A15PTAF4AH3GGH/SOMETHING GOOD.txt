 I'm such a longtime fan of Marianne I could not wait for the U.S. release, so I paid for the import. All consistent with my inclination to ignore delayed gratification. And what gratification it is! The production of this album is stellar, thoroughly modern yet capturing the timeless essence of Marianne. Get it! You will be in for SOMETHING GOOD.
