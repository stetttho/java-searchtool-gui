 The tacky Britney Spears meets Shania Twain cover photos almost caused me to pass on this CD.  I'm sure glad I took the chance.  I was aware of the excitement over "I am Shelby Lynne", but had not listened to it or any of Shelby's work.  Perhaps that allowed me to have a fresh introduction.  Just let me say I am very impressed. I like ALL the tracks on "Love, Shelby" and I appreciate the production by Glen Ballard. It is accomplished with an intelligence that far exceeds most of the hyped female 'new singer songwriter' drivel that is now out there in the pop and country genres. Shelby is special.
