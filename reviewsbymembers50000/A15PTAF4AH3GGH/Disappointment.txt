 First the good news: 78 minutes of music on one CD. Clean sound from original tapes. Nice booklet giving a history and background to the recordings. And yes, the purity and nuance of the  vocal harmonies that make the Everlys so wonderful. It is the lousy choice of most of the songs and hokey arrangements that sink this CD. I am sure that Don and Phil lament the circumstances that resulted in these recordings. I listened to the CD a second time to confirm my embarassment for the Everlys and the disc now sits in a used CD bin. Want a really special Everly's compilation ?
