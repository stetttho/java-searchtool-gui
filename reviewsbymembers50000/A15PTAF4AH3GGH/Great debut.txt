 I can't imagine anyone not being impressed by this album. Real talent here that should result in success both critically and in popular appeal. Different listeners hear other artists in Amos' singing---I hear something of Terry Reid and Teddy Thompson! A bit of Otis too.  But make no mistake, Amos is a true original. I strongly recommend this cd.
