 First I give credit to Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake whose serious appreciation of Tracy is tangible in this recording. Next Tracy's voice is like the fine Zinfandel I enjoyed while listening to this album. Finally it is the great songwriting that places this cd in the excellent category. Although the songs were recorded months before Katrina, some of them [America,Before Easter] are so appropriate during sad/angry reflection on the Gulf Coast tragedy. Tracy Chapman is a wonderful artist who deserves to endure for a very long time.
