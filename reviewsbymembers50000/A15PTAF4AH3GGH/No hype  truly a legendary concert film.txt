 I still have the soundtrack LP I purchased more than 30 years ago. I did not see the original film. The DVD release is an absolute joy. It is as much an educational documentary as it is a profound musical experience. Yes, I am disappointed the Roberta Flack performances were deleted, but the balance of what is provided is thoroughly satisfying.
