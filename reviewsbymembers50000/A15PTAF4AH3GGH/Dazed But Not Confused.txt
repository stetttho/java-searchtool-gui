  I listened to Disc 1 on my small computer speakers---an internet offering from "Full CD Listening Party". I am not one given to hyperbole, but I was stunned. Think you never want to hear "Stairway" again?  Well let me change your mind.  I was jumping around the room playing air guitar like I haven't for years. This is Zep at their absolute zenith and I will be purchasing this 3 CD set and the new DVD. I can't wait to hear them on full size speakers. I am so impressed by what I heard I am going to see if they still sell Led Zepplin T shirts.
