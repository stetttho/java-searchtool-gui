 I usually pride myself on being able to understand and appreciate movies with dark, complex or subtle themes. True, the acting is good in Swimming Pool, but I failed to enjoy this DVD at any other level.  Note: If the beginning 7 minute inability to access a menu or skip ahead becomes a trend I hope consumers will be very vocal in their outrage.
