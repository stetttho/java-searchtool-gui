 This album is so good that it makes me want to reduce some of my reviews of other artists from 5 stars to 4. Black Cadillac is a true 5 star release and it is Rosanne's masterpiece. This coming from someone who has Rosanne's debut Right or Wrong on vinyl and most of her CDs. The songwriting on Black Cadillac is just superb along with the production and great supporting musicians. Yeah, even darker than Interiors [I like it that way], but richer and more profound.
