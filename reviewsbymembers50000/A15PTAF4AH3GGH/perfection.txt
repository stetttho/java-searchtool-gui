 There is not one thing to criticize about this album----songwriting, production, musicianship are flawless. The emotional impact on me has been overwhelming. Every track is a gem with a sublime balance of restraint and poignancy. In 2004 my favorite CD was released late in the year. In 2005 it appears to have arrived early. Trust me, Mercy Now is really great. P.S. Although the Hammond B3 removes this album from being "pure" country, I think it enhanced the sound in a most positive way.
