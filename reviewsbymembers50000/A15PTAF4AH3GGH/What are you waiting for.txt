 I send a review to Amazon when I think an album is a success and worth purchasing. BACK TO ME is definitely a success. I loved FAILER and BACK TO ME builds on that album in positive ways. Easily one of the best releases so far in 2005. By the way, it is not just Kathleen that is so sensational, but also her BAND that so aptly performs around her. I hope Kathleen's tour includes a venue close to where I live.
