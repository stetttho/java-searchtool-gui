 Although I haven't read Peter Gay's five volume history of the victorian era, I just might check it out after reading "Schnitzler's Century".  You have to be suspicious of any book where the offer admits that one might notice a more then faint resemblance between the current volume and the author's prior output(as Gay does in his foreword).  Regardless of any repetition, Gay is a more then capable writer, and I found the contentn of this book fascinating.  Gay uses the framework of Freud to discuss the mind set of the Victorian bourgeois.  Along the way, he debunks many myths perpetrated about the Victorians, particularly those relating to Victorian prudishness and fridigidity.  As we all know from our histriography books, the past is more complicated then historians of prior era's gave it credit for.  I never get tired of searching out the origins of "modernity", and for that reason, I would recommend this book to any with a similar interest in knowing why the world is the way it is today.
