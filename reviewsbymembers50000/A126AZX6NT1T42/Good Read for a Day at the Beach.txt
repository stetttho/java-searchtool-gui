 This was the first Elmore Leonard novel I've read, though I SAW Out of Sight and Get Shorty.  Obviously, I felt like I knew what to expect before I opened the book: numerous plot twists, character's who've seen better days and tight dialogue. I'm not a fan of "detective" fiction, so I can't really compare it to that.  I found the setting to be compelling: motel in South Florida, the Dominican Republic. I thought the main character's experience with the Marines in the Dominican Republic was interesting.  Frankly, as a 28 year old, I wasn't even aware that Marines were in the Dominican Republic at that time. Book is a quick read, no matter how you slice it.  Despite the "adult" subject matter, it occurs to me that Leonard novels would make a good read for a certain kind of high school student. Leonards books are always cheap to pick up and widely available.  The rythym of the dialogue in "Cat Chaser" is above average.
