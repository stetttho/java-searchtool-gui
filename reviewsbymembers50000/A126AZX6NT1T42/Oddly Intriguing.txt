 I read Sister Carrie first.  That was a GREAT book.  Read "Titan" second.  Not so impressed. I understand that this is the sequel to his book "The Financier".  The fact that I hadn't read the Financier didn't bother me at all.  Frankly, I have no intention of reading the Financier. "Titan" is the second part of the life story of Frank Cowperwood.  Cowperhood is a kind of prime-time soap opera type figure: a tycoon who can't keep it in his pants.  The book is equal parts of economic machinations (which take place in the exciting world of public utilities in turn of the century Chicago) and soap opera style emotional histronics. This was no doubt racy stuff at the turn of the centuury.  Actually, it's still pretty racy stuff now. Cowperwood is a serial cheater (on his wife Aileen) and Dreiser is hardly apologetic.  The fact that Cowperwood can't keep it in his pants leads him to boff (can I say that on Amazon?) the wife and daughter, respectively of two of this partners.  This, in turn, sets up the the central conflict in the book betweeen Cowperwood and the "quadrumvirate" of tycoons which will stop at nothing (even advocacy of socialism) to defeat Cowperwood. The central story line involves Cowperwood and his attempts to monopolize the street car concession in Chicago.  While Titan has some great scenery and an interesting supporting cast, the book is more "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls" then "Atlas Shrugged"(seriously, those are the two books this book MOST reminded me of.) Not sure why anybody would read this, but then again, I did.
