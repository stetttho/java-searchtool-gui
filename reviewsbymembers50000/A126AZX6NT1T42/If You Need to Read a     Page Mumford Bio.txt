 Should you feel compelled to read 500 odd pages on the life of Mumford, this is the book for you.  Ample coverage of his writing and personal life. He was a bit of a jerk to his long suffering wife, but who am I to judge?  The parts on his writing serve as a useful guide to his voluminous writing.  Would have liked more on his relationship with Frank Lloyd Wright.
