 This is a brief introduction to Bailyn's highly regarded "Voyagers to the West".  The book is, as it states, a serious of transcribed lectures that Bailyn delivered to college undergrads.  You can tell that these are lectures, but Bailyn has provided ample footnoting at the back of the book.  Understand that this is a short book.  It should only take about a couple of hours (maybe less) to read.  "Voyagers to the West" runs about 800 pgs, so you'd probably want to read this before that, just to make sure this is what you are interested in.  Bailyn uses four "propositions" to frame the themes of his lectures.  The propositions boil down to the idea that the received wisdom we have about the peopling of the British colonies in America is wrong and that the process was more complex then we thought.  I would refer those unfamiliar with this approach (that of framing "propostions" for historical inquiry), to the work of the Annales school in France (Marc Bloch, Phillipe Aries, etc).  Fans of David Hackett Fischer's "Albion's Seed" will want to check this one out.
