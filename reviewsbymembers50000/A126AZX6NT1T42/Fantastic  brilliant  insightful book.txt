 With Strong Motion, Franzen takes his place in the smart young writer pantheon along luminaries such as David Foster Wallace (Infinite Jest, duh) and Richard Price.  This book contains more compelling insights about what it is like to be a dorky, disaffected, intelligent young person then a whole truck load of other books with similar goals.    That being said, this book is also pretty "heavy" in that Franzen is not afraid to abandon the ironic detachment so common in young writers.  But no matter.  If you are even here, reading this review, it is obvious that you will like this book.  Read it.
