 Only book I've abandoned reading this year.  Now that Jacques Derrida is dead, does that mean we can stop reading stuff like this?  By "this" I mean over analyzed, incomprehensible post-structuralist gobbeldy gook.  Seriously, I could barely understand what Cawelti was trying to say.  Style and vocabulary aside, the over determined analysis is enough to turn you away from theory forever.  I have a high threshold for academic jargon, but this put me over the edge.  Avoid.  Hopefully work like this will be sent to the dustbin of history.
