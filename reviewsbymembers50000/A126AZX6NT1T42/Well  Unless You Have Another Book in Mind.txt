 ... You'll probably have to buy this one, regardless of your feelings about the shortcomings of this one.  As a defense attorney practicing in federal court, I deal with conspriacy all the time.  How nice it is then, to have a little portable book that is compact and durable enough to bring to counsel table at a motions hearing!  I mean really, that's just a useful thing to have.  Author is a former AUSA, not that that is a BAD thing, necessarily.  My bottom line is that you really do need a good treatment of the relationship of the law of conspriacy to the law of evidence.  Maybe I'm just taking a short cut here, but I think it's pretty handy. The rest of the sections are all right. You could probably sum up the law of conspiracy in two words, but I'm fairly sure that Amazon won't print one of them...
