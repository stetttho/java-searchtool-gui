 Bought in Portland, read it during my week long visit to the Northwest.  As a resident of California who has visited Washington (Seattle), Oregon (Portland, Bend) and Idaho (Boise, Sun Valley), I decided to get this book because it treats the three states as a region.  I figured it would be more efficient then reading seperate histories of the three states.  I wasn't dissapointed.  Schwanter does a good job differentiating the three states while at the same time making the case for the area's treatment as a region.  Most of the writing is workmanlike.  Rarely did I find myself transported to a different time and place.  The most interesting sections were the early settlement of Oregon and the section dealing with the politics of Oregon in the twentieth century.  Good introduction to the history of the area, but it didn't compel me to do any follow up reading.  Kind of seems like a community college text book at times.
