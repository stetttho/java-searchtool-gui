 I picked this book up after reading Arvin's classic bio of Herman Melville (which is itself worth checking out).  Werth's treatment of the tale is reminiscent of the genre of non fiction I like to call "The Expanded New Yorker Article".  That's fine, I love the New Yorker, but the weakness endemic to the genre is the feeling that 150 pages would suffice (and you're reading a three hundred page book).  Regardless, I read the whole book and don't regret it.  Werth's treatment of Arvin's tortured feelings about his own homosexuality are sad.  Arvin's own betrayal of his friends and lovers at the hands of the authorities is pathetic.  The fact that the "Homosexual Scandal of Smith College" (of which Arvin was the primary figure) dates to 1960 is astonishing.  It's impossible not to have sympathy for the man, but the bottom line is that he snitched on his comrades(i.e. he named names and testified for the prosecution in a co-defendant's appeal), and that taints his legacy.  I would imagine this would mostly appeal to young academics (and would be academics).  That probabaly explains why there are 13 reviews of this book on Amazon!
