 I studied with Jo Carrillo in Law School.  She rocks! This book is awesome.  Most indian law text books take a "doctrinal" (i.e. boring) approach to the interesting area of indian law.  Most legal subjects are taught "doctrinally" although there has been signifigant reform in this area.  Jo's approach is more contextual, and deals with a broader range of "issues" not all of which are "legal" issues.  Prof. Carrillo studied at Stanford with Lawrence Freidman and with Roberto Unger at N.Y.U.  This book is an invaluable resource for graduate students and undergraduates alike who are interested in Native American law and culture.  This is a book which hasn't gotten it's just due.
