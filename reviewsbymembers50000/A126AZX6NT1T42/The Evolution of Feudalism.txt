 Certainly an undeniable classic in the field of "history of the middle ages".  As other reviewers have already noted, Bloch was one of the initial members of what grew to become the "annales" school of western history, though, to be fair, he died before you could call it a "school" or "movement".  Volume one of the two volume set looks at the growth of feudalism in western society, and by western I'm talking about Northern France, Western Germany, England and Northern Italy.  Bloch's main concern in this volume is setting the conditions which led to the developmen of feudalism from 800 AD to 1000 AD and then describing the various forms that feudalism took.  The book is well translated, and I found it hard to argue with much of the thesis.  I too have read Norman Cantor's "the Making of the Middle Ages" where he calls Bloch a Marxist (and  maligns the entire Annales school).  I've also read more recent productions from the Annales school.  I have to say, based on this particular book, I don't really see where Bloch is a)romanticizing the peasant (another Cantor criticism) or b) a marxist.  It seemed to me that Bloch's explanation for the growth of feudalism was, basically, that central government decayed  to the point where various muck a mucks needed to find an alternative way to "rally the troops" in the face of frequent small to mid size invasions.  Feudalism, with its emphasis on individual obligation and quid pro pro, was an attempt to remedy the lack of communication over long distances and lack of central authority.  The peasants didn't really figure in this book at all, except near the end.  Certainly, one wouldn't accuse this book of being filled with marxist/post-modern/decontructionist gobbeldy gook.  This is a must read for those interested in the field, especially lay men.
