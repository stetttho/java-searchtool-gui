 A classic- I was referred to the book via Cantor's the "invention of the middle ages", and once again, I was not dissapointed.  I would imagine this is the standard work on the topic, judging from its continued popularity after being in print for half a century.  The histoiographical method- his use of various sources and willingness to give voice to many which "traditional" history ignored, is most impressive.    Considering that this book was first published in 1957,Cohn was ahead of his time in his presentation of a social history of the "Pursuit of the Millennium".  The cast of characters is colorful, to say the least: ranters, flaggelants,  the brotherhood of the free spirit, taborites, anabaptists.  You could almost call this a history of the "pre reformation".  Classic text.
