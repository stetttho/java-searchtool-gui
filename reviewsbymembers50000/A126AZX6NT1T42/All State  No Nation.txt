 This is a classic, both for it's clarity and for its brevity(110 pages!).  Strayer was a professor at Princeton and worked for the CIA on the side.  In his book, "the invention of the middle ages", Norman Cantor describes his life as a graduate student at Princeton under Strayer.  Apparently he was always running off to advise the government on one thing or another.  It's an amusing thought.  Strayer's analysis is heavy on the bureaucratic development of france and england, light on everything else.  Basically, he contrasts the centralist state of England with the "mosaic" state of France, and demonstrates how the heavy bureaucracy of france (and other contiental states of europe) can be attributed to the need of a weak central government to integrate provinces with their own "national" identities.  This goal was accomplished by layering different sorts of councils and administrators on top of one another, with the King at the top.  This is contrasted with England, which functioned, in Strayer's mind as a "large french province", with the King at the top of an abbreviated hierarchy.  His institutional focus is on the development of law courts and the finance ministry- these were the first departments to come of age in the west.  The law courts because the king's original power was as court of last resort, the finance ministry because... well, every prince needs money.  As the title says, this is a book about the state, not the nation. There is no mention of culture in here, so don't look for it.
