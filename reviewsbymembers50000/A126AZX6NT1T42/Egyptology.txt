 This book was first published in the 1920's, so be aware going in.  Over all, I found "The Dwellers on the Nile" to be informative, but that impression was undermined by occasional forays into cenury old academic disputes over various subjects relating to the Ancient Egyptians.  Modern generalist readers would be well advised to skip some of the lengthier foot notes (which, in my edition, were in 6 point type... ouch!).  Sir Budge covers daily life, history, work, religion, and literature.  He also provides ample examples of Egyptian script with accompanying translation.  I would like to read a more recent take on the same subject, although I should also like to read Edward Said's, "Orientalism" as well, to get a different perspective.
