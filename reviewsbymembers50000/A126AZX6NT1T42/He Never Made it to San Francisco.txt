 Growing up in the SF Bay Area, I was told (taught?) that Sir Francis Drake "discovered" the bay and left a plaque.  So I was suprised to read in this book that um, he didn't ever go to SF.  Go figure!  I mean, I was genuinely suprised when I got to the end of the book and figured that he wasn't heading towards SF.  I guess that story was proven false about twenty years ago, but I never heard different.  So that was cool.    Otherwise, the book is capable, but hardly imparts the um, flavor of what a 16th century sea voyage must have been like.  His prose is decent enough, but it doesn't sparkle.  There is over ample coverage of the high politics of the period (understandable, since Drake figured prominently in many inter govenmental shenanigans).
