 Correction to the Amazon listing: this book is authored by Frances and Joseph Gies, not just Joseph.  It says so on the cover of the book.  Husband and wife team of (amateur?) scholars, synthesize recent scholarship (from mid 60's on) on the middle ages for your reading pleasure.  As the title hints at and the subtitle: Technology and Invention in the Middle Ages, spells out, the focus is the manner in which technology and invention transformed society in the area soon to be known as "the West".  The broadest service this book provides is to cue the reader in to the massive scholarship on the subject that exists outside the English speaking world of academia.  The French in particular have made many developments in this field of study, but their work seems to be only occasionally translated.    The Gies' are careful footnoters and their method is fairly rigorous.  Because they rely on the scholarship that is anywhere from 10 to 200 years old, there are bound to be statements that are inaccurate.  This does not effect the merit of the book.  This book provides and excellent introduction to the scholarship on the history of the middle ages, specficically as it relates to technology.  However, the bibliography points the interested reader to a fuller picture of the available scholarship, and therfore Cathedral, Forge and Waterwheel, is useful in that sense as well.  Probably not for strictly "general" readers, nor for scholars/academics, this book is best for the motivated lay reader.
