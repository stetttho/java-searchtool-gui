 Not just for scholars...  I was referred to this book by the bibliography of History of Private Life vol. I.  This is really more of a short (120pp.) essay on the title subject then a full treatment of the topic.  As a non-specialist, I found quality to be appealing.  MacMullen sketches out a thumbnail portrait of Roman society during the republic.  It is not a complex picture.  The wealthy comprised one ten thousandth of one percent of the entire population, but they controlled almost all of the wealth.  Below them were their often wealthy slaves and on the bottom were the "free romans".  Life in Roman times was nasty, brutish and filled with oft-violent conflict.  In fact, the Pax Romana was anything but "pax".  MacMullen's portrait of Roman life (at least in the rural areas) sounds like something a social Darwinist writing in the 19th century would approve of.  Wealth was derived from land, and conservatism in all things economic was the rule.  Note on the other review posted: I'm not sure how one could read the same book I read and say "not enough detail and support" for the statements made.  The notes and appendixes are almost as long as the text itself!  The notes contain references to over 380 works on ancient roman life, so I think the below reviewer was not paying attention.  I recommend this book for non specialists.
