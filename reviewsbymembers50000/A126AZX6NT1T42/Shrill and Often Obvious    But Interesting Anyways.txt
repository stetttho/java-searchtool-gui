 OK, OK, I get the point: elites manipulate the physical world for their own enrichment and then disguise their machinations by comprimising the media.  So what else is new? One complaint that has already been voiced about this book is that it is not reall "about" San Francisco at all, but rather makes a point about all cities.  That complaint is true in that author's theoretical underpinings for his argument extend to examples outside of San Francisco.  Really though, what else would the author do? Personally, I found authors attempt to relate San Francisco to Rome and other cities to be interesting and relevant. Another complaint voiced in these reviews is authors tone. That tone has been described as "shrill".  I would have to concur with that complaint.  I found the tone of this book to be distracting.  I would venture to guess that anyone, ANYONE who reads this book is likely amenable to his "Cities suck" thesis.  To belabor the point in the manner that author does is just beating a dead horse. In defense of author, he doesn't present himself as a true "academic" but as a sort of journalist/academic cross-trainer.  I found that perspective refreshing.  Author is impassioned about the subject of book in a way that makes you put up with the occasional hectoring and shrillness. One fundamental problem I had with the substance, rather then the style of the book:  Author repeatedly discusses various civic improvement schemes as plots to "increase real estate values". Query: Is that really such a nefarious scheme? If you look at California today, property ownership is hardly the exclusive province of the elite.  In this way, I think the book unwittingly lends supports to an alternative, and contradictory hypotheses: That the actions that economic elites take in their own self interest ultimately benefit those outside their own social class. So, that's something to think about.
