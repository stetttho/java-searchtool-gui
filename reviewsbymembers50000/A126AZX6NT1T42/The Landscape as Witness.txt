 As a fan of both the high desert and true crime, this book was a can't miss. Just as an aside about the genre of "true crime": Really, true crime is a bit of a misnomer.  Parts of any true crime story are fictionalized due to the inevitable problems of sourcing a recent crime.  Additionally, I don't see how you can write a true crime story without shifting focus between the perpretator, the victim and the setting.  All three help reveal whatever "truth" that can be learned from the description of a murder or whatnot. That being said, Stillman, a writer from Los Angeles, does an at times workman-like and at times inspired job of revealing the murderer and victim. Where she really shines is her treatment of the desert of California as a character.  Her descrptions of the world of the high desert are evocative and resonate with other, similar descriptions contained inside and outside the genre of true crime. As a criminal defense lawyer, I thought Stillman gave short shrift to the legal machinations surrounding the trial, but I can't blame her for it, since the tone of the book is apparent from the blurb on the back. I'd recommend this to fans of true crime and post modern philosophy, but I urge the old and easily horrified away.  If this book freaks you out, you probably won't get much from the book aside from the facts of the case.
