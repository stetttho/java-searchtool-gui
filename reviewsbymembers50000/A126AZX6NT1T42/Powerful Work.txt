 Fischer uses the sociological concept of "Folkways" to organize his exploration of the cultures which created the United States.  Folkways are the "ways of life" that combine to create a distinct cultures.  In turn, those distinct cultures combine to create our society. Fischer identifies four relevant folkways: the Puritans of New England, the Cavaliers of Virginia, the Quakers of the Delaware Valley and the Borderers (or Scotch Irish) of the back country. The most extraordinary part of this long, long book was the manner in which Fischer was able to unpack the regional cultures of the British Isles.  As Fischer himself remarks, British historians and social scientists have devoted negligible time and attention to regional culture (as supposed to strictly "local" culture, which is often covered in Britain). Once Fischer links up the regions in England with their counter parts in America, the once obscure has become obvious.  This, I believe, is one of the hallmarks of excellent scholarship. It's almost impossible to critize anything about this book until the last hundred pages, when Fischer blithely asserts that all events for the past three hundred years are eminently explainable in terms of the four folkways of this book. I was suprised to see him reach so far, especially since this is "volume 1" of a "proposed five volume set".  Since this book was published fifteen years ago, I guess we'll have to be patient while we wait for, "The Ebony Tree: African Folkways in America" , volume two of the set. Still, this book was near revelatory in both method and analysis.
