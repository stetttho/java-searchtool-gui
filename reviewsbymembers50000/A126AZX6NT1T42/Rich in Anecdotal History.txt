 Beam's "Gracefully Insane" is rich in anecdotal history, but poor in other areas.  Makes for a light, enjoyable read, but Beam rarely teases out the interesting insights that arise from his excellent access to the inner workings of America's "Premier" mental hospital. This book will make you think about the (troubled) history of psychiatry/ treatment of mental illness, and Beam's portrait of this institution caused me to shed no tears for the fall of this fabled refuge for blue blooded loons. Reading interviews with "graduates", its hard not to question the assumptions that underlied McLean's very reasons for existence.  Few of the individuals profiled within seem like they were ever a "danger to self or others".  Indeed, when a rash of suicides hit McLean a couple of decades ago, the staff were singularly unprepared to cope.  Perhaps this is because the "inmates" were not as bad off as one might suppose? Makes an interesting companion piece for Goffman's "Asylums".
