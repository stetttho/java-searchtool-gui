 Cantor ablely lays out the various schools of thought in 20th century Middle Ages Studies.  This book was close to a god send for me.  I've been reading almost exclusively out of the Annales school, like a blind man, having no idea that there were other areas to explore (more accurately, what those avenues might be).  Cantor uses the personalities and backgrounds of the major midievialists to explain their works.  Along the way he offers excellent summations and critiques of the various works.  He includes a list of 125 books that provide a "core collection" of the subject.  If there is a thesis or over riding theme in this book is that the great tragedy was the triumph of the instutition builiding Annales school at the expensive of the more talented (and English) R.W. Southern.  Cantor goes so far to present Southern's refusal to create an institute in his image as an "Arthurian tragedy".  I understand what he's talking about since I've been reading on the subject for over a year and have yet to come across anything other the annales school and their decendants.  Funny.  I haven't been this excited about a book in a couple years.  I read it in about a day and if you have gotten to the point where you are reading this review, I HIGHLY recommend you get this immeditately.
