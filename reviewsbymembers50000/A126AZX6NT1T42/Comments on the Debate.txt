 As a non-Mormon who finds the story of Mormonism compelling, I don't understand what the fuss over this book is about.  Krakauer is not writing as a serious historian, he's writing as a popular author.  Obviously, if you want to get closer to the "real" truth of Mormonism, whatever your perspective, you're going to have to read more then this book, and the author tells you that. After I read this book, I read Fawn Brodie's biography of Joseph Smith, and well, if you think this book is controversial, you ain't seen nothing.  And Brodie's book was published in 1954!  Mormonism was created, by Joseph Smith, to be a sensationalistic kind of religion. Brodie even refers to the temple ritual as a "mystery cult", and the ritual was itself reformed back in 1990. I think you can meaure the power of idea by seeing how often people go to extremes to defend their conception of the idea.  That doesn't mean the extremist are right or that the idea is bad, it's just a testament to the POWER of that idea.
