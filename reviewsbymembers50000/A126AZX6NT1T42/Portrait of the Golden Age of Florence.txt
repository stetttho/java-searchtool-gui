 This book chronicles the golden age of Florence, from the 1300's through the 1500's.  Brucker does an excellent job of using the ample primary source materials located in Florence itself: his text is chock full of merchant's account books, diplomatic letters and funeral arrangements.  His treatment compares favorably with Hibberts book on the Medici, which covers much the same ground but with little or no use of primary sources.  At the same time, the tone of the book is conversational.  Brucker doesn't let his sources get in the way of readability.  This book is one of Norman F. Cantor's "Core 150" books on Midevial studies and Cantor himself edited it as part of the "Historical Cities" collection.  Although "Renaissance Florence" was written in the mid 60's, it still feels vibrant and up to date.  I think this quality is attributable to his reliance on primary, rather then secondary source material.  "Renaissance Florence" is broken into six chapters: the renaissance city, the economy, the patricate, politics, the church and the faith and culture, with an epilogue "the last years of the republic".  This approach provides a cohesive portrait of the Florentian golden age without unduly emphasizing the painting and sculpture of the fiftteenth century.  I found the sections on the economy and politics more interesting then the section on culture, which is a testament to Mr. Brucker's fine scholarship.
