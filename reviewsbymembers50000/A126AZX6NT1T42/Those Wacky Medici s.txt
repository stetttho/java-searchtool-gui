 Well, reading about the Medici Popes certainly was eye opening.  Hard to believe the Catholic church survived, but I guess they are a pretty resilient bunch. I wanted to read about the Medici's because I'm interested in the origins of capitalism in Europe.  I had the impression (wrongly, I now realize) that the Medici's were forerunners of the modern capitalist economy. While it is true that the family got its start in banking, they quickly moved into the Church and full time Princehood.  Whether they continued their banking activities is hard to tell, since Hibbert seems little interested in the economic activities of the Medici (or maybe there wasn't that much activity, I just don't know for sure). My main criticism of this book is that it lacks context.  Although this is a recent reprint, the book itself is from the seventies, and it reads like a history book from the seventies.   This book is basically a chronological series of chapters about the succesive heads of the Medici clan:  Where they lived, what artist's they supported, descriptions of their wives, the political turmoil they caused, the wars they fought, etc. That isn't to say this book is boring, far from it.  Highlights include hilarious descriptions of the dinner parties thrown by Leo and Clement, the fun loving Medici Popes.  I also learned more about Pope Leo's "anal fistula" then I probably need to know (including the grossest assasination plot I've ever read about.) Hibbert expands the scope just far enough to give us the machinatioins of the various surrounding monarchs: The Holy Roman Emperor, the King of Spain, the King of France and a brief appearance by Henry the VIII. On the whole I was entertained, but found my interest in the Medici's saitiated.  I doubt I will follow this book up with any further reading.
