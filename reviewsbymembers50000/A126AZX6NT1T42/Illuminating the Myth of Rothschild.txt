 Captivating either in spite of or because of it's extremely short length. Most important thing to note about this book, other then the observation that it is a very good book, is that author really does "paint" a portrait that includes both the Man AND his time.   I felt the attention to the society of Rothschild really paid off at  the end of the book.  Rothschild is important not merely because he generated a truly epic amount of wealth for his family, but because he serves as a symbol of the manner in which capitalism changed the lives of those who practiced it. Certainly, the Rothschild clan has been the focus of much anti-semitism and conspiracy theory.  As a Jew, I always felt such talk was ridiculous, but I was interested to find the so-called "grain of truth" which, coupled with a long standing, virulent history of anti-semitism served to transform the Rothschilds into a focus for so much bile. For example, the Rothschild's lent signifigant amounts of capital to the family which held the postal monopoly for the Holy Roman Empire ("Thurn and Taxis" Post).  This relationship enabled the Rothschild's to take advantage of the "intelligence gathering" capabilities of the Postal system to their benefit. This was a theme at the heart of Thomas Pynchon's excellent novel "The Crying of Lot 49".  Which I recommend to those who enjoyed in this book. Like Niall Ferguson's two part saga of the family history, this book was written in cooperation with the Rothschild family. I recommend this book both for the portrait of the man as well as the portrait of the place and time.
