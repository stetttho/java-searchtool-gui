 Certainly a novel with a capital "N", from a time when authors wrote grand, sweeping, "epics of the soil and those who work the soil".  Norris was inspired by the work of French novelist Zola, which is funny because some of his harshest writing takes to task San Francisco society matrons attempting to appreciate French style landscape art. I read this book after reading Kevin Starr's "Californians and the American Dream".  While this novel does culminate in a retelling of the infamous "Mussel Slough" shoot out, where a group of "squatting" ranchers shot it out with representatives of the U.S. government and the Marshalls, it is most notable for its classic descriptions of California ranch life circa 1880. The character's at the center of the Octopus are broad: Vanamee, the "Hebraic" looking sheep herder/mystic who yearns for the sweet embrace of his departed lover; Presley, the would-be poet who gets wrapped up in the affairs of the world, only to turn away from the world in the end; Annixter, the rough-hewn young rancher who is transformed by the love of a woman. The Octopus is also notable for the supporting cast of minor characters.  They reveal as much about life in California in the 1800's as do the major characters. Still relevant for its historical value, but let's face it... the prose is dated.  Also, I agree with other reviewers in that this book is too long by about a hundred pages.  Probably a must read for people who are serious about the history of California.
