 Been dying to read this book for at least six months.  Finally found it at  a used book store for six bucks! Huzzah! Having now read the book, I probably would have shelled out for it new or used at the 10+ bucks it commands here on Amazon.  The 18 reviews below indicates that this is a fairly popular work.  That's more then three times the reviews of the other history books I've checked out on Amazon. Since the other reviews are substantial, I won't comment much, except to say that while several reviewers have commented on the role of "first" and "second" nature in this book, I didn't see anybody mentioning his use of "Central Place Theory", which was apparently developed by German theorists in the 1800's.  He also doesn't discuss Lewis Mumford at all, even though he cites to that author in the bibliography. I thought this book made an interesting contrast with "Imperial San Francisco", another book about the development of a western city.  I was hoping Cronon would include more information about the "flow of capital" between Chicago and the FAR west, rather then focusing so intently on Chicago's immediate hinterland. Cronon chose to focus on a description of the processes which led to the creation of Chicago.  It might have been interesting to look at the ways in which the interests of wealthy individuals tracked across various industries and time.  A point made in "Industrial San Francisco" was that the oligarch's who made money in mining gradually "cleansed" their money through the purchase of utilities and media firms(newspapers).  Did something similar occur in Chicago?  I suspect so, but Cronon's treatment of the newspaper/media industry is largely descriptive.
