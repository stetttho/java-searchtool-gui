 I was looking for a book that would describe the Colorado Desert, i.e. the area south of the Mojave desert, including the Palm Springs area, the Salton Sea and the Imperial Valley.  This is that book, although the publishing date on my copy was the early 70s, making this book more than 30 years out of date. Book provides interesting coverage of the area, including little known details like the prehistoric oyster fields in the imperial valley and the old haunts of "desert Steve".  Main criticism, aside from the age, is the complete lack of any maps.  I believe a guidebook should include maps for the covered area. It would be nice if there was something more recent in print for this area.
