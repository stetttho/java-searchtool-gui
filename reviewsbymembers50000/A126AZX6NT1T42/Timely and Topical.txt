 As the "killer storms" lash California, those in search of some perspective would do well to check out this book.  The authors conclude that most of the development in San Diego county took place during a relatively dry period in recent history (1940-73).  The authors believe that this bodes poorly for houses built on the sea shore.  As with all books that prognosticate horrific implications for the near (or far) future, one must take such theses with a grain of salt... human ingenuity (or high property values) can adapt to changed circumstances, whatever they may be.
