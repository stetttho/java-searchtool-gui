 As a native Californian (San Francisco) I read this book after seeing it cited again and again as an excellent entry point for a study of California history. I was not disappointed. I believe this book is widely acknowledged as a classic in the field of California history, and I certainly wouldn't disagree with that judgment. Prof. Starr attempts to illuminate the psychology of early California by providing mini-biographies of important California residents.  These biographies are linked together by several recurrent themes.  It is these themes that provide the thesis (theses?) of the book. The themes are:  The dark side of the optomism which characterizes the "California" personality; the harsh conflict in early times which affected the development of a Californian "civilisation" and the melding of cultures (Mexican and Californian, Northern and Southern) that produced Californian culture. Starr focuses more on cultural rather then economic or political figures.  Starr also shows a fondness for somewhat Freudian explanations for behavior (repressive parents, absent parents, neglectful parents).  Given the age of the book (1975) it's hard to quibble with the inclusion of a perspective tilted towards psychological explanation. On the whole it was a worthwhile read, and not too dense either. Recommended for those interested in the history of California and it's culture.
