 Well, let's get one thing straight.  "Drexicya" is probably just another name for Jeff Mills (but don't quote me on that).  If you listen to X-103 Atlantis by Jeff Mills and then this record back-to-back, you'd  probably agree with me.  There is a whole back-story to this act involving  Atlantis and escaped-black-slaves turned aquatic supermen that I,  personally, find intriguing along the lines of Parliament.  The music is  eerie sounding "aquatic" techno that veers all over the spectrum  that is "Detroit" techno.  Bear in mind that this a long CD.  You  get your money's worth.
