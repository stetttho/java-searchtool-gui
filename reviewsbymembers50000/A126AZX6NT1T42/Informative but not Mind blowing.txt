 Well, I'm in the market for a car, and reading this book was sort-of an eye opener.  Bradsher indicts SUV's for a host of crimes, but I can't imagine his case converting many who didn't agree with his charges prior to reading this book.  You might want to file "High and Mighty" in the "preaching to the choir" section with "Fast Food Nation" and "Earth in the Balance". That being said, it is a well researched, informative book.  Bradsher isn't afraid to criticize the environmental movement, which he believes was co-opted by the sophisticated marketing of the auto industry.  His chapters on the history and development of the SUV are first rate.  Also interesting was his thorough documentation of the POSITIVE effect the SUV has had on communities in the United States where these behemoths are built. These descriptions, coupled with a tendency for Bradsher to assert harms in the future tense, combine to diminish the strength of his over all argument: that SUV's are baaaaaaaaad. One thing is for certain: SUV's benefited from a series of regulatory loopholes designed to benefit "light trucks".  The very existence of these loopholes are detrimental to the safety and health of American drivers, and action should be take to amend them forthwith.
