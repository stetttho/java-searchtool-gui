 I've read this book three times:  First time was in undergraduate, second time was in law school, third time was last week.  I can honestly say that my understanding of this work has grown with each reading, but that growth in comprehension has come more from my reading of other books either discussing or related to Discipline and Punish. Specifically, I would recommend Jurgen Habermas's critique of Foucault, although I now forget which book of his contains his critique.  I would also recommend Goffman's "Asylums" and Sykes "The Society of the Prison" as works which can illuminate Foucault's oft dense prose. Foucault's main thesis is that the transistion of society into modernity has resulted in institutions which are increasingly devoted to the control of the "inmate's" time.  The instituions use this control of time to develop discipline.  Discipline is then used to both reinforce the strength of the instituion and also to expand the reach of institution's into the community. As other reviewers have noted, this book isn't really about Prisons.  Rather, the development of the modern prison represents the pinnacle of the relationship between power and discipline.  Foucault leads up to his discussion of the prison by examining developments in other instituions: the work shop, the school and the barracks. I really would encourage admirers of this work to read Goffman's "Asylums".  The two books overlap to a considerable degree, but they both complement one another.
