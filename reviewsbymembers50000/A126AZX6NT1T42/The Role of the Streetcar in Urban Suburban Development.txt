 This book is straight forward:  Warner describes the process of suburbanization between 1870-1900 in Boston, Mass.  Warner is focusing on a period of time that most contemporary American's would not equate with the process of "suburbanization", but it is this very approach that makes "Street Car Suburbs" so interesting.  Warner shows that the street cars and suburbs were both linked to the increasing wealth in the Boston area after the civil war.  Capital was looking for places to be invested and both the wealthy and middle class found it in their interest to lay the foundation for suburban growth.  The wealthy developed street car lines.  In response, many members of the middle class engaged in small scale suburban "developments".  Perhaps it the small scale of the street car suburb that will most intrigue the modern reader.  For the most part, the builders of street cars didn't develop the housing market.  One explanation for this seeming discepancy is that the mortgage market for residences was most primitive during this time period.  Warner shows that most of the small scale "developers" carried the mortgages of the buyers of their newly developed properties!  This is a far cry from our world of today!  Warner's photos of various homes are excellent, and they make a fine counterpoint to the text.  This book is an interesting treatment of a little known period of American suburban development.
