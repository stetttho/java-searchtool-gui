 I'm not a sociologist, a student of sociology or really, even that interested in sociology. I read about this book in David Orland's, Prisons: Houses of Darkness, where Orland often referred to Goffman's work in this book.  I was not disappointed. Goffman uses a mixture of field observation and references to literature to describe and critisize the theory and practice of the "Total Institution".  As the reviewers note below, a "total institution" is an elastic concept.  Goffman focuses on "strong" examples of T.I.'s: the mental hospital, prison, a 19th century man of war, monastery.  Through these "strong" examples he fairly describes the concept and applies it well. Less clear is the implications of Goffman's concept to those institutions which are either "weak" total institutions or non-total institutions with total institution tendencies.  After reading this book, I saw aspects of "total" institutions in almost every institution I cared to think about: schools, churches, courts, etc. I think it is fair to say that "All institutions dream of being total institutions."  Therefore, this book has application beyond the world of "strong" total institutions. I recommend it highly.
