 This book is the product of the methodology created by the annales school of historians in france.  Founded in the late 20's, the Annales school pioneered the use of the methods and teachings from other schools of social science in the service of history.  This approach spurned a focus on wars and politics in favor of a focus on "everyday life" i.e. the life of non-presidents and generals.  The general editors of this book (Durby and Aries) were pioneers of the approach, along with it's most famous author: Braudel.  See his work on the mediteranean, or Aries' classic "In the Hour of Our Death".  These authors are second and third generation.  The work is, on the whole, excellent, but it's a distinct style of scholarship, which may account for some of the confusion in the other reviews.  Each chronological segment is written by a different author.  The section on Rome is an anchor to the whole five volume series.  The secton on late antiquity is a bit brief.  I skipped the chapter on roman domestic architecture in africa.  The period on the early middle ages is rich and fascinating, but too brief.  I could have read a whole book on the Merovinigian empire in northern Gaul!  The chapter on the Byzantine empire focuses on the later empeire (900-1200(?) and the source material for the last chapter seems to consist almost of entirely of information on monastery life.  Over all, one is struck by the dramatic, though gradual, shift from pagan rome to early christianity.  It is a unique book, and well worth reading.
