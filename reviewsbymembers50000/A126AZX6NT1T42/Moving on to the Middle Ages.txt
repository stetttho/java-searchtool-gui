 This is vol. 2 of the epic, five volume set.  Normally, I can see how  a reader might shy away from the prospect of reading five volumes on a single subject (any subject).  However, given the time span covered and the all encompassing nature of the topic, private life, this is one five volume "history of" set that is worth the time invested.  In volume two we move to the late middle ages.  Gone is the semi-alien world of Rome, now we are emerging into the more familiar middle ages of western europe.    Duby;s introduction discusses the different meaning of "public" and "private" power in the Middle Ages.  I'm afraid the discussion was a tad techinical for me on the first read, but the theme seems to be the gradual emergence of the state (as supposed to the family) as the center of power.  The second chapter discusses the world of feudal (northern) france and pre-renasissance tuscan italy.  Both segments are, to my mind, what this series is all about.  I found the section on tuscan italy to overlap nicely with my reading about the Medici family.  The differentness between our world and theirs is well apparent.  For example, the Tuscan Italians(not that they would call themselves that), kept their unmarried women locked up in their homes.  the author repeatedly compares this world to the modern muslim world to give the reader a sense of what he is talking about.  The section on "Exploring Literature" is a yawner, up there with the chapter on "Roman Architecure in Africa" from the first book.  This book ends with a hint of the modern period which lies ahead, but all in all it is content to dwell in the midevial times and is careful not to jump the gun on the topic of modernity. I appreciated that.  Next up, volume three!
