 In his foreword, McDougall is candid about his own doubts about whether America needs yet another multi-volume set of tomes chronicling its history.  As the existnece of this book indicates, McDougall answered his own doubts. The book is built around the central thesis that "America is a nation of hustlers".  McDougall's central insight proves to be fresh and interesting enough to carry subject matter that has (as the author admits) been covered many times before. His sythesis of recent scholarship in the field of American History is top notch, and the notes alone make the book worth the cover price.  Interested readers will find hundreds of jumping off points for further exploration in the field of merican history. McDougall is cognizant of the diversity of "histories" which have multiplied in recent years.  He includes citations to and summaries of gender and ethnic histories that demonstrate his familiarity with recent scholarship. At the same time, he drops footnotes lauding Huntington (a historian favored by conservatives) and certainly doesn't shy away from the "great man" school of scholarship.   I especially enjoyed the treatment of the links between intellectual history in Britain in the pre-revolutinary era with the developments in America leading up to the revolution. On the whole, this is a balanced, nuanced reading of American history and I anticipate the next chapter(this is projected to be a three volume set).
