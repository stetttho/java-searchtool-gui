 This book is generally acknowledged as an excellent, recent account of the life of Frederick II.  Frederick is famous in the German-speaking world for being an inspiration to the Nazi party.  The earlier biography by Kantorowicz(who later taught in America), was seized on by Nazi's and Nazi sympathizers in support for a strong, mystical leader who would bring Germany back to greatness.  Although Abulafia notes this troubled history in the notes, he account is mostly concerned with Frederick II's actual life and times.  In a way, he is trying to debunk the superstition and legend that was built up around Frederick II in the early part of the twentieth century.  So who was Frederick II?  He was the heir to the kingdom of Sicily and the Holy Roman Empire.  He managed to unify his vast kingdom during his lifetime, he re-conquered Jerusalem without a fight, he wrote a subperb book on Falconry, corresponded with Arab scholars and, oh yes, fought bitterly with a succesion of Popes who just hated his guts.  In fact, these Popes, more then Frederick himself, emerge as the focal point of this book.  More then anything it was their unreasoning hatred for Frederick's power that defined his life.  Particularly, it seemed like Frederick spent the majority of his life fighting rebels in Lombardy who were supported by the Pope.  Recommended.
