 Properly belongs in the pop-literary genre that can loosely be identified as "the social history of concept/food item/technology/etc.".  DeJean's writing is from the school of annales meets cosmo, peppered with phrases like "bling-bling" and repeated references to Carrie Bradshaw and Manolo Blahnik.  Her repeated attempts to create parallels between the 17-18th century and recent currents events are alternately amusing and lame.    The combination of writing styles makes this book a lighter read then one might expect.  Would be easy to read hanging from a subway strap or on the beach, a couple of pages at a time.  People working in certain industries(fashion, publishing, p.r.) might find some of the quotables or anecdotes useful at work/play.  The basic idea is that Louis XIV birthed modern ideas of "style" by his example/expenditures as king of france.  Not a particularly sophisticated thesis (the desire of non-nobility to emulate nobility is barely discussed, except in passing), but servicable enough as a framework for DeJean to pump her "everything new is old" idea with plenty of hilarious period details (illustrations are included}.  Not a great scholarly work, but better then reading "the Devil Wears Prada".
