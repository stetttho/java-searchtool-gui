 The subtitle of this book explains what it is about, ?Varieties of American Experience 1865-1915?.  This is a ?cultural history?, though as Jones points out in his preface, he takes great pains not to define ?culture?.  Age of Energy is organized around the thesis (or theme) that the conclusion of the Civil War unleashed a hurricane of American energy upon the physical/psychic/artistic landscape of America.  It was a hurricane that had its roots in the industrial revolution and the railroads.    Jones is more concerned with the history of ideas then the history of events, an approach that I found rewarding.  As early as the first chapter he discusses the primary conflict between evolution and theology in post Civil War, this uneasy state of tension between two conflicting ideas (and the attempt to resolve them) characterizes many of his discussions of intellectualism during this era.  Chapter 4, called ?Energy, Expertise and Control? is a real stand out. In this chapter, he discusses the significance of the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia and provides a stand out discussion of the increasing importance of the concept of ?conspiracy?.  His chapter on the ?Genteel Tradition? introduced me to a much dismissed period of American culture.    His conclusion is that Theodore Roosevelt was the apogee of the age of energy, and I thought that a bit trite.  The rest of the book is too good for him to come to such a pedestrian conclusion.  However, I found this book to be a comprehensive introduction to an era I had previously known little about.
