 "Five California Architects" is a good introduction to the works and lives of the architects profiled (The Greene brothers, Irving Gill, Bernard Maybeck and R.M. Schindler).  The book consists of biographical essays on each architect (the Greenes are handled together) and various photos and sketches of buildings they each designed.  This book is more like five little books; one for each individual architect.  There is little attempt to provide any linkages between them (although some links are so obvious that the style of treatment reveals them none the less); and little attempt to provide context.  The style of writing is heavy on anecdote.  "Five California Architects" gives the reader a good sense of the kind of men these architects were, but less of a sense of the position they occupied in the development of modern architecture.  Despite its short comings, this book is a must have for those interested in the development of modernist architecture in California, and I would recommend it to all those interested in the subject.
