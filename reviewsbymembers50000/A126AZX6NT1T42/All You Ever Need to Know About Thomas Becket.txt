 Frank Barlow set out to write the definitive Becket biography.  Mission accomplished.  Thomas Becket, the 12th century english politican/archbishop/martyr/saint, rose from semi-obscurity to become chancellor of england under Henry II and then became Archbishop of Canterbury.  After becoming Archbishop, he promptly got into it with the King (his buddy) over whether religious clerks could be subject to the king's punishment (among other issues), fled to France and spend five years arguing with Henry II over who was right and who was wrong.  Upon his long awaited arrival in England to resume his position as Archbishop, he was promptly murdered by some over zealous nights.  The rest, as they say, is history.  He was soon made a saint because his blood had miraculous healing properties(eww.)  Barlow knows his primary and secondary sources.  When the sources are unclear, he says so.  When the sources are absent, he tells you. It is clear that Barlow is not overburdened with a love of Becket or King Henry.  His understanding of 12th century politics and religion (really the two were inseperable) is unimpeachable.  In summation, I found this book just as interesting for its portrait of 12th century society (albeit the elite side of society) as for the story of Thomas Becket.  I doubt I will ever read another book about Becket after reading this one.
