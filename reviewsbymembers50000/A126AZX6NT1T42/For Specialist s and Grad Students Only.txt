 Reads like a dissertation (which it is).  Aside from the exhaustive bibliography, I can think of a reason for recommending this book (unless you are a graduate student working in the area of the history of California 1850-1910, which I'm not). Deverell didn't really tell me anything I didn't already know, which is a little dissapointing since I have only a light background in this area (i.e. The first three volumes of Kevin Starr's history of California, Fragmented Metropolis by Fogelson and The Octopus by Frank Norris). It's a suprisingly short book with only six chapters.  The first chapter handles early reactions to the coming of the transcontiential railroad (Mostly positive).  The second chapter covers slightly later reaction to the railroad (mostly positive, some negative).  The third chapter discusses the Pullman Strike in  Califonia.  In my opinion, this was the stand out chapter of the work. Chapter four covers the Los Angeles "Free Harbor Fight". This chapter is largely duplicated in "Fragmented Metropolis".  Chapter five covers written opposition to the railroad, with a close up of Frank Norris' "The Octopus".  Chapter six covers "Progressives and the Railroad"(they didn't like it.) At this point, I'm ready to never read anything about the California Progressive movement ever again.  They are, simply put, a boring, hypocritical bunch. Again, if you're looking for a book with a good guide to the less accesible literature in within the field (academic journals, etc.) this book does have an excellent bibliography.  Otherwise, you might want to just stick to the more well known works in the field of California history and skip this book.
