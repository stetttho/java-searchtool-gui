 Disagree with two of the reviewers below:  Gay is not unbearly biased in favor of Freud, book is not too much for casual dabblers in the subject.  First, one could hardly expect a six hundred page biography of Freud to be authored by someone who hates the man.  Important to be realistic about who writes books in the first place.  Second, Freud was a prolific writer, and the book doesn't shy away from in depth analysis, so really it's like two three hundred page books.  Now, if that's too much Freud for you, you're probably not that interested in the first place.  I like to read biographies of thinkers who left behind copious amount of published work.  That way, it's easier to get a sense of what you want to read (if anything) by the author.  Because much of Freud's work revolves around family life, his family life is more then usually interesting.  It's impossible to appreciate the originality of Freud's thought without having a firm context for HIS everyday life.  This book provides a balanced reading of Freud's controverial life.  I found the bad to be included as much as the good.  Freud's influence on the 20th century has been so profound that even if you completely disagree with the man (over, say, his attitude towards women), it is still rewarding to learn about his thought.
