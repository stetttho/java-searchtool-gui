 This is book five of the five volume series.  Yes, I have read them all.  If I had to recommend two I would recommend the first volume(sex) and the third volume(agression).  I struggled with this volume, even though it is the shortest (240 pp.) by far of the five.  Perhaps that's because the theme: bourgeois taste in art, was so dreadfully boring.  There's not a single chapter I really enjoyed until the (last) chapter on the emergence of moderning.  Or maybe that was because I was so close to the end.  So now I know plenty about the Victorian bourgeois.  What can you say about them? That they defy easy categorization.  But really, can't you say that about many subjects?  Gay's focus on the journals of every day bourgeois as source material was fine, but over five volumes, I could have used some more "great men" and current events.
