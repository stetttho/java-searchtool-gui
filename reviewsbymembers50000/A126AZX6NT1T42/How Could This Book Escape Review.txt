 Simply put: Where else are you going to turn to when trying to decide whether the appopriate vehicle for post-conviction, state court relief is a petition for writ of habeas corpus or a writ of error coram nobis? This handy book, by Professor Donald E. Wilkes, Jr. provides a useful jumping off point when you've decided to tilt at some wind mills, legally speaking.   The book is divided into four chapters: Introduction, History of Postconviction Relief in the States, Current State Postconviction Remedies and Relief and Forms.  Additionally, there are two appendixes: a survey for each state and the uniform post conviction procedure act. Far and away, the appendix which contains a state by state summary of the law on post conviction relief is the best part of the book.  Since post conviction relief is largely state specific, it's best to use the body of the book in conjunction with the state specific appendix. This book would be most useful to someone doing their first habeas/coram nobis writ, or for a more experienced practioner looking for some voluminous state citations! Happy tilting!
