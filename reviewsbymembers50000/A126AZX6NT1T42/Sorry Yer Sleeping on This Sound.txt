 Call it what you will. Seminal record in the most (only?) interesting sub genre in dance music right now.  Had the good fortune to pick this record up when I was in Cologne ("Koln" in German).  CD is a mix of "Minimal Techno" and more ambient, less beat driven stuff.  The track by Michael Mayer is a classic.  Good as an introduction to the sound. Personally, I'm totally over the ambient end of the spectrum, but I think the more beat driven stuff is just the hottest thing going in the electronic realm. Can't wait for the Fabric compliation that's coming out next year (by Michael Mayer, who is THE beating heart of the Koln sound). Much better then similar compilations on Morr music, which tend to be more glitchy and ambient.
