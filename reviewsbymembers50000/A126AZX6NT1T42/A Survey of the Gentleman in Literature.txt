 First reviewer! Huzzah! This book is a survey of the role of gentleman in English society through history.  Castronovo "opens up"(a favorite phrase of his) the gentleman as a concept.   Central to this book are the different layers of "what it means to be a gentleman" throughout time.  He starts with midevial times, tracing the evolution of the word "gentleman".  He then talks about the gentleman as nobility, the gentleman as property owner, the gentleman as a rich person, and so on and so forth. My favorite section of the book (by far) was his treatment of the gentleman as dandy.  His description of the life of Beau Brummell left me clamoring for more ("People would come and watch his extraordinary toillete each morning").  Fun! This book is short (130 pages) with a full accompaniment of notes and an excellent bibliography that makes purchase of this book worthwhile, in and of itself. There are also a section of black and white photographs that document the gentleman in (English) art. I also note that the same author has published a companion book, the "American Gentleman".
