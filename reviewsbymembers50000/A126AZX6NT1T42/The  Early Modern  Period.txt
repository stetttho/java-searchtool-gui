 And now volume three.  My reviews of the first two books in this series have garnered a fat total of 0 votes, positive or negative, so I'll make this review brief.  This book charts the transistion from the middle ages to the beginnings of the modern period.  In the introduction by Aries (who's scholarship is the inspiration for this project), he makes a claim that this time period deserves to be treated as a seperate "early modern" period.  It's a noble thought, but the book reads more like one would expect: a lot of the middle ages and a little of modernity, but a lack of the coherence that one sees in volumes I, II and IV.  The authors are mostly concerned with discussing two (seemingly)contradictory trends: the attempt by families to develop "private space" and the attempt by the state to intrude on that private space.  Chapter two deals mostly with the first statement, chapter three with the second.  You have to keep an open mind with the Annales school of scholarship.  The writers favor open ended generalizations to conclusive statements and are just as interested in providing ideas for further study as they are in answering questions.
