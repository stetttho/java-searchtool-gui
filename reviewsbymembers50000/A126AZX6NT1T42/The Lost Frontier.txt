 First Cather book I've read. I was impressed, frankly and I think I'll read more. Set in the 1880's/90's in Nebraska, this book chronicles the relationship of a young boy/man and the wife of a wealthy local luminary.  As the boy turns into a man, his early admiration for the lady turns into contempt.  Is this about a human relationship or rather a metaphor for the rise and decline of the plains economy in the aftermath of the railroad?  Maybe both. One interesting aspect about this book, and, I suppose, all of Cather's work, is that she is writing about a period some twenty or thirty years prior to the era when she was writing.  I thought that was pretty cool.  She seems like an early example of the "New Yorker" style fiction writer.  Good stuff.
