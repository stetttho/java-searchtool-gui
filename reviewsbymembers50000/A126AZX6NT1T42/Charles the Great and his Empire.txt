 This is another of the many great books about the Middle Ages I was referred to by Norman F. Cantor in "the inventing of the middle ages".  I doubt I would ever have come across this book without the help of Cantor's guide to the literature.  This book is translated from the German... in the sixties, but Fictenau is writing about the 800's, so you shouldn't be put off by the age of the book.  The copy that I bought is a reprint by the "mediaveal academy for teaching".  It has a plain red orange cover and lacks charm.    The basic idea of the book is that the Carolingian Empire managed to combine a number of conflicting trends through the strong personality of its leader... Charles the Great.  After the death of Charles, the conflicts were brought to the front, and the empire disintegrated.  So lay off on on Louis the Pious, OK?  It wasn't his fault that the Carolingian Empire fell apart!  This is a very manageable book (170 pgs.) on an immense topic and I recommend it as an introduction to the subject.
