 I believed that this book would be an exploration of the concept of "wilderness" as it relates to the American mind.  And it is, for about one hundred pages.  Since this is a four hundred page bok, that leaves a lot of space to fill. I found the first two hundred pages to be interesting, the last two hundred to be a slog.  Nash spends an interminable amount of time covering "contemporary" environmental struggles. Were it my book, I would have omitted the chapter about Alaska. I imagine that most who read this book have a grasp on the environmental struggles of the recent past. As I mentioned before, the reason I read this book was to gain a perspecitve on how these struggles came about.   This book is, I suppose, a classic in the field.  I guess, ultimately, it's just a field (environmentalism/ecology) that doesn't interest me that much.  So I'm glad I read it, but I wouldn't recommend it to others, unless those others consider themselves dedicated environmentalists.  Then you HAVE to read this book.
