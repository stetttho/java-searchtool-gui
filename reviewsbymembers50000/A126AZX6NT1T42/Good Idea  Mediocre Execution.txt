 Not a "must-have" Jeff Mills CD.  This is the most self-consciously experimental of any of his work I have heard.  Not something you'd want to dance to.  It is suitable for home listening, as  background music (i.e. more "ambient" or "minimal"  techno then what you'd expect from Jeff Mills).  If you're thinking buying  "X-103 Atlantis" you might want to consider purchasing Drexciya's  1999 release "Neptune's Lair" (on Tresor Records).  That record  explores many of the same themes but is more focused, and, in my opinion, a  more enduring work.
