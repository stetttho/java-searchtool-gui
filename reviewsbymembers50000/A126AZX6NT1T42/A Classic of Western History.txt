 Surely the 59 other reviews that are listed below have covered much of what there is to say about "Cadillac Desert".  Resiner has an engaging writing style that veers occasionally into rage and anger.   He, um, doesn't much care for the Bureau of Reclamation or the Army Corps of Engineers, although much of his fury is spend on the Bureau.  Why, I wonder, did the Army Corps get off so easy? This book actually reads like a series of shorter articles placed together.  The book lacks clear sense of direction. The last couple of chapters dealing with "case studies" of specific Dam sites can only be described as "tiresome".  However, his early chapters, those dealing with the beginning of irrigation in the west, are fascinating. Personally, I am totally interested in the history of the Salton "Sea" and the mere fact that Reisner devotes several pages to the subject was enough to make reading half this book worthwhile.  The other half was made worth while by the fact that I no longer have to pretend that I've read this book, now I've actually read it!   Is it me, or this one of those books you're supposed to read as an undergraduate? One final note, this book makes for an interesting companion read with Imperial San Francisco, by Gary Brechin.
