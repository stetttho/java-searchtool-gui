 I read the old version, which was fine.   Augustine spanned the gap between the classic world and the emerging world of the middle ages.  He started life as a Manichee and flirted with neo-platonism before settling down to life as the bishop of Hippo in Roman Africa.  His was a very "Roman African" kind of career (a phrase which meant nothing to me before this book).  Roman African Christianity was a "purer" form that was less influenced by decadent Roman/Italian ways.  In fact, the main schism of Augustine's time, the Donatists, had split from the Catholic church over the issue of Christian collaboration with Roman pagan authorites.  Throughout his career Augustine stood for the religion of church and parishioner (as supposed to the religion of the monastaries).  His theology emphasized original sin and supported baptism at birth.  Humans needed Christianity as a weary traveller needs an inn.  He was a prolific writer, but always anchored his writing in current events.  For example, City of God was written after the sack of Rome by Alaric the Visigoth(love those names) sent patrician Romans(who were Pagans) scurrying to Africa for succor.  I felt I got a better sense of the "life and times" of Augustine as supposed to his thought and ideas.  Not that I have a problem with that.  Augustine is an important transitional figure between the classical and christian worlds, and his times give the reader of what it was like to live during the fall of the western roman empire.  I recommnend it for people interested in Augustine himself or the time period in general.
