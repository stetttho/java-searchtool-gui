 As a fan of both books about prison and the author, I was understandably excited about reading this book.  I maintained that excitement until I was about three quarters of the way through, and then I realized that I really didn't care for plot elements that involved Warden Matthews and the prison guards. If there's one thing I learned from this book it's that begin the warden of a U.S. Prison is just as exciting as working in the General Services Administration. On the other hand, I found the stories about the inmates to be fascinating.  The book is worth reading if only for the chapters on inmate Silverstein, who has been on "no human contact" orders since he was convicted of killing a guard at Marion in the 1980's.  Silverstein is a sort of prison culture icon: he lives in a cell where the lights are on 24 hours a day and nobody is allowed to talk to him except a pyschologist who's job (apparently) is to ensure that he doesn't go nuts. I did notice that the author did not seem to interview a single African American inmate.  All of the profiled inmates are white.  I don't understand how you could spend two years in Leavenworth and not interview a single black inmate.  I mean, this is the United States prison system we're talking about.
