 Michael Mayer is a veteran producer/dj from Cologne, Germany.  There, he is one of the forces behind top micro house label Kompakt.  This CD was produced during/shortly after his residency at the famous British super club, Fabric(London, UK). It is similar in composition to other mix CD's produced by top DJ's and producers in series like K7's "DJ Kicks".  As the producers of top quality dance music have migrated into non-English speaking areas (such as France and Germany) these compilation CD's have become increasingly essential to followers of quality dance music. Several of the tracks on this disc are from Mayer's Kompakt label.  Kompakt rarely releases anything other then vinyl, so these tracks make the CD worth the (expensive) price of purchase. Mayer also includes a piano based remix of a popular Westbam track from last (2003) summer. What is remarkable about this CD and micro house as a genre, is how flexible it is.  Unlike most dance music CD's, Mayer has created a sound that is nice for reading, cleaning, working out, or dancing. I hestitate to even write something like the sentence above for fear that I will shortly be hearing Mayer played tracks on ads for Gap and Target, but what are you going to do?  His sound has been around for some time, and he deserves some recognition. Additionally, strong sales of this record might induce him to come states side to play some more dates.  This would be a welcome event!  All in all, a CD that reminds you of a time when dance music was more relevant.
