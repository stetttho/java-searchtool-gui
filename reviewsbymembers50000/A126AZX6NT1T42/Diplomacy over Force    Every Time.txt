 Well written (though translated from the french) introduction to the capetian kings of france.  Appears on "Cantors 150" list of books about the middle ages.  Interesting to see how the practice of diplomacy, not the use of force, was critical in establishing the territorial boundaries of the french nation.  Maybe our own leaders could benefit from reading this book?  Loses a couple of "stars" for being overly schematic in organization and deadly dull.  Has some nice pull out maps of france in the middle ages.
