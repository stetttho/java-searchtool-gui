 At one point, not so long ago, this was my favorite record.  Recently, I had cause to hear it again, and I re-evaluated my feelings for this disc, and I have to say, it wasn't as good as I rememebered.  While I still feel that this disc is a "breakthrough" record, I don't feel that overwhelmed by it's brillance any longer.  Maybe I'm just getting older.
