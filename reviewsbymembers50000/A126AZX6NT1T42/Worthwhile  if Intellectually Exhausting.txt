 You have to admire Ms. Herrin's careful and resourceful scholarship about an era that is shrouded in mystery.  Herrin focuses on the transistion from "late antiquity" to the early middle ages, aka from about 550 AD to 850 AD. She is specifically concerned with answering the question of "what makes western europe different?"  Her answer is that western is europe is unique in its division of power between temporal and spiritual authority (i.e. church and state).  Does her answer sound familiar?  Herrin delves into the gradual seperation of Rome from Constantinople both in terms of theology and military force.  On the former subject, you had better be prepared for a ton of information on the debate over iconclasm v. iconophilism.  The later topic is a bit easier to grasp: Byzantium was pressed by Islam, which led to an abandonment of military responsibility in the area surrounding Rome, which led to the Popes soliciting assistance from the Franks, which led to the Holy Roman Empire, more or less.  It's an interesting subject, and this is a well written book, but at a nearly five hundred pages, it takes a great deal of rigor to penetrate.
