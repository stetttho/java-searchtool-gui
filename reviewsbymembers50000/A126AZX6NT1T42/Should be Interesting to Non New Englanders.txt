 Even though I live in San Diego, I found this book to be well worth the read.  Dense but short, "Changes in the Land" gives a close reading to the ecological impact of British colonization in New England.  As Cronon states in his conclusion, this transformation has ramifications far outside New England, since the environmental degradation that accompanied early colonization forced settlers farther and farther afield. Twenty years after it was published, the scholarship is still, what I would consider "cutting edge".  Cronon cuts across disciplines and primary sources to produce a nuanced model of the interrelationship of humans and the environment.  Cronon's work is just as interesting for his (to me, anyway) novel technique of writing a history where the personalities of humans take a back seat to the consequnces of their decisions. The effect is at once radical and main stream.  Radical, in that Cronon strips away traditional justifications for human decisions that reinforce the implicit assumptions that cause those same decisions.  Main stream, in that he manages to stay away from the hyperbole and argument that plague revisions of history. I've also read Cronon's "Nature's Metropolis", which is his book about the development of the city of Chicago. I would recommend that book, as well as this one, to anyone interested in the subjects that Cronon covers.  His scholarship is top notch.
