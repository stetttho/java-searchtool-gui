 Even though it clocks in at seven hundred plus pages, I wouldn't call it the definitive book on the reformation.  Perhaps that's because one needs more then a single volume to deal with this particular subject.  It's really more like a very good introduction to a difficult historical subject. I applaud MacCullough for his objectivity, but I'm not convinced that objectivity is something that's possible, or really even necessary for a project like this.   I was struck, time and time again about the many, numerous, obvious parallels to our own times, which MacCulloch himself discusses in the text.  We were founded by protestant/evangelical/calvinist types who were fleeing the utter insanity of the period in Europe.  And I do mean "utter insanity".  Reading about the French civil wars of the mid 1700s or the 30 year war in Germany is enough to give the most hardened evangelical pause about any actions taken in furtherance of the imminent return of the savior.    I rate this four stars (rather then five) because first of all, it's obviously an attempt to turn out a "one stop" book for a subject that requires more in depth perspective.  in fact, if you look at the author's prior work, you will see that he himself would hestiate at such an ambitous tomb.  Additionally, I though his recommendations for further reading were weak.  The end notes are good, not great.  This book easily could have been four volumes or more.  It could have just as easily been four hundred pages.  I found recent reading I'd done on Augustine of Hippo(by Brown) and "the evolution of midevial thought" by Knowles to be useful in understanding the context.  Also, having some familiarity with the history of the holy roman empire is nice to have.  The stuff about Spain, France and England should be accesible to anyone with a college education.  I'd recommend it for someone looking for a general introduction to the reformation.
