 Yes, this certainly is a classic in urban history.  Fogelson succicently tells the story of Los Angeles, from it's beginnings as a Mexican backwater berg to the enormous Metropolis it became.  Fogelson includes chapters on all of the important subjects: L.A. and its Mexican roots, the quest for water, the signifigance of new modes of transportation, the failure of the light water system, the development of the board, the conflict with San Diego, the public utility movement and, of course, the progressive movement. Fogelson's history is academic in tone, but it's just such concise and well documented writing that you have to love it.  A must for readers of Southern California history.  I might add that although this was a book about L.A., the chapter on the L.A./SD conflict for Southern California supremacy was actually the best thing I've been able to dig up thus far on San Diego history!  How about that, huh? I might also add that you might want to track down a first edition  hardback of this book, rather then paying for this overpriced reprint.  The original hardback is handsomely designed and makes a fine edition to your book shelve.
