 Maybe if you're a grad student in history, this might be an "introduction".  If you're a lay reader, this might be a tad much in the detail department.  Blair commands the material, but the material itself is a tad on the dry side.  I say that as someone who's read a fair amount of books about "late antiquity" and the "middle ages".  Part of that is attributable to the obvious fact that Anglo Saxon england was a brutish, hobbseian kind of place.  Certainly its a thorough read, but it lacks fun and is a slooooow read for a book of 350 pages.
