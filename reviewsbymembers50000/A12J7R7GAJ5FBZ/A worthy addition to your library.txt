 It seems that interest in the Civil War never ends. Not only does each month bring another book on some facet of the war but Civil War reenactments are flourshing around the country. This book is a good reference book of 131 battles, engagements, assults, combat, or siege portrayed on 117 maps. It is a month-by-month atlas that documents the progression of the war during the entire four-year period. Using primary reference materials and Official Records, the author has included a brief text or narrative to go with the maps that indicate positions and troop movements. The result is a highly readable account of particular battles, with tactical actions and results, that is easy to understand and relate to the overall history of the War. The account of the battle of Cold Harbor, Virginia, in 1864, which resulted in the death of 13,000 Union and 5,000 Confederate soldiers, reminded me again of the terrible cost of this war. In addition to the maps and discussion of the battles there is a legend and index,alphabetical by location, with a list of all battles and the names of all commanders mentioned in the book. While the book does not describe every battle of the War, the one's dealt with are clearly described and the maps are uncluttered and easily read. This book will appeal to any reader interested in the battles and tactics of the Civil War. It is a worthy addition to the never-ending study of our nation's march to the edge of the abyss.
