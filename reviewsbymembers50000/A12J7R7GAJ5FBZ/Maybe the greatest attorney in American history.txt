 Clarence Darrow (1857-1938) is perhaps the most famous, maybe even greatest, attorney in American history. His defense of Darwinian principles in the Scopes "Monkey Trial" of 1925 resonates even today and his views on the dangers of religious fundamentalism are as relevant today as when he proffered them. This book of essays and social criticism touches on issues such as women's suffrage, Prohibition, criminal psychology, science, capital punishment, and religion. This book will get your juices flowing regardless of your political or philosophical views.
