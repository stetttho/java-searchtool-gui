 Prairie Schooner is one of the oldest and most prestigious literary journals in the United States. It has been in continuous publication for 75 years and has been called one of the best magazines in America and was named one of the "Nineteen Magazines That Matter" by Writer's Digest. I think they got it right. Best of Prairie Schooner provides the reader with some of the best personal essays from critics, novelists, and poets such as Wright Morris, Maxine Kumin, David Haward Bain and Nancy Willard. These essays are personal in that they connect with the reader in personal, almost intimate levels, letting the reader see"...what makes their stories, what makes their poems, what makes their lives." This is a wonderful anthology that will provide the reader with delightful, insightful, worthwhile reading that is as advertised, the Best of Prairie Schooner. A good job by the Univ. of Nebraska Press.
