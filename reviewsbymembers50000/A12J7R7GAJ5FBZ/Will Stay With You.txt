 These poems are from Hamer's memories of his Southern Childhood, which are then woven into his dreams and insights of his present life in Northern California. He speaks of Vietna, the nature of evil and identity, both sexual and racial, his father's military life, family, and loss. These are moving, heartfelt, universal stories that only a poet of this talent call tell so well. This book will stay with you long after you put it down.
