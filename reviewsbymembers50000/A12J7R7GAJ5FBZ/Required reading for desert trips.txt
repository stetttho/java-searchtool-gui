 This book should be required reading for anyone remotely thinking about desert exploring of any type. I have done a fair amount of desert trips and have read and reread this book a number of times. It is packed full of important, potentially life saving information that will help you navigate safely in the desert. Everything from techniques for hiking,mountain biking, and 4x4 trips including vehicle preparation is included. There is an interesting section on troubleshooting worst-case scenarios and even a section on selecting the proper gear and equipment for desert conditions. When considering desert trips it is well to remember the admonishment of famed desert rat and author Edward Abbey:"...Enter at your own risk. Carry water. Avoid the noonday sun. Try to ignore the Vultures. Pray frequently." I would add "read and study this book" or perhaps "Don't leave home without it." Highly recommended.
