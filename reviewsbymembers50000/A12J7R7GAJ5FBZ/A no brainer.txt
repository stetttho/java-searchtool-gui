 This book is a no-brainer. Given that Mexican Americans are now the nation's fastest growing minority and increasingly Mexican American votes can mean the difference between winning and losing elections in growing numbers of local, state, and national elections, not to mention the never ending controversy over immigration, this book is a must read for anyone remotely interested in Mexican American's political participation and activism. Demographic, cultural, and historical determinants are all discussed including some interesting predictions on the political future of such a crucial group in American society.
