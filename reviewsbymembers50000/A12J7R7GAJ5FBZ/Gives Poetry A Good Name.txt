 This is a sweet, tender collection of the author's recollections of growing up in an Albuquerque neighborhood with both a grocery store, where he worked, and the Catholic Church, which he attended. He writes of his neighbors with gentle wit and wisdom and reveals their souls in a manner that will make you proud that such a poet exists to give substance to the bricks and mortar of a neighborhood. Lopez teaches in the English Department of Mesa State College in Grand Junction, CO. What a wonderful, inspiring poet.
