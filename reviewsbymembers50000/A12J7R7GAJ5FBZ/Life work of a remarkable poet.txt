 Gerlach has been writing poetry for fifty years. As would be expected it exhibits wisdom and a maturity that will invoke a nod of understanding from the reader that has experienced life in its many dimensions. He is a private person, this being only the second volume not privately printed, and his poetry is both personal and universal, not an easy feat. For example, one of my favorites, "February Noon," in a mere sixty-one words records the death of a loved one that conveys a profound sense of personal loss and feelings associated with death while at the same time will touch and resonate with the reader of any age. This rare work of a remarkable poet is well worth the readers time.
