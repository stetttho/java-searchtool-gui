 This is a long overdue book about a region of the country that is generally overlooked by historians. The Southern Plains is defined as western Texas, Oklahoma, and eastern New Mexico. In eight essays by such notable authorities as Elliott West, Dan Flores, John Morris, and Diana Olien the reader is treated to the multi-faceted history of the region. It's all here, the history of human occupation, exploitation, the climate, land, resources, and the never-ending effort to build a future in an area that resists change. This is a must book for any reader remotely interested in the history and future of an area that occupies the center of the United States but is rarely understood.
