 For two weeks in July of each year, on the rural Tennessee campus of Sewanee, The University of the South, the Sewanee Writers' Conference meets to encourage"creative writing and creative writers." The Conference has been meeting every year since 1989 when it's founder, poet Wyatt Prunty, used a donation from Tennessee William's estate to establish a location for writers to gather and practice their craft in a place known for its "remoteness without cultural dislocation." Sewanee Writers on Writing is a collection of 14 "Craft Lectures" selected from the first ten conferences and offers selections by playwrights, poets and fiction writers. Some of the contributors include Russell Banks, Alice McDermott, Ernest J. Gaines, Horton Foote and Marsh Norman. These are world class writers including Pulitzer Prize winners as well as a host of other national awards. This collection is a must for writers, professional or amateur, who are interested in cultivating the art and craft of writing. The insights, suggestions and experiences of these masters of the written word are as inspiring as they are informative. Tennessee Williams truly gave a gift that keeps on giving. A real literary treasure from some of the best in the business.
