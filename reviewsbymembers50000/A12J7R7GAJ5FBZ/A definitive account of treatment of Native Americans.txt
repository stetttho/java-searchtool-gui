 This is the definitve account, taken from over two thousand pages of documents from the National Archives, of the tragic action of the Cherokee Commission that ultimately removed fifteen million acres of land from nearly twenty tribes in Indian Territory and placed them in the public domain. The intimidating, dishonest, subversive action of the Commission toward Cherokees, Pawnees, Poncas, Tonakawas, Wichitas, Cheyennes, Araphos, Sac and Fox and other tribes resulted in their accepting allotments in severalty and then selling the surplus to the U.S. Government. The surplus then went to white settlers and resulted in statehood for Oklahoma. The story of the bad faith strategy of the Commissioners and the heart breaking efforts of the tribal leaders to retain their land is familiar to those that study U.S.-Indian relations. It is an old story and not one designed to instill pride in this period of American history. Sadly, such efforts continue to date. Highly recommended.
