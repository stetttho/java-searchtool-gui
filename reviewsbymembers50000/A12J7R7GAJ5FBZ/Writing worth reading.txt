 This book contains 41 cowboy poems, 52 general poems, and a number of short stories that reflect the author's stated goal of "writing to be read." They offer humorous, sometimes poignant anecdotes and messages that speak to a reader's heart. In a manner reminiscent of pulling up a chair in the shade and talking with an old friend, Rourke shares a heart-rending lesson the the unforgettable poem titled "The Old Black Man;" then, his encounter with "The Pilgrim" reminds one of the biblical admonition found in Hebrews 13:2 about entertaining angels unawares; and finally produces chuckles with "Visitin' Noo York City." The poem, "Sharing the Journey," with its concluding line, "In hearts with open doors," will give readers a glimpse of the breadth and depth of talent this wonderful writer possesses. I hesitate to label this as "cowboy poetry," which it partly is, for fear many readers may be turned off. Far from it...this is a must have introduction to a writer I suspect will be garnering acclaim and awards from around the country. Who knows, maybe from as far away as "Noo York City." Highly recommended.
