 Wow! This is one marvelous work by a Pulitzer Prize winner and famed French translator. Simpson has translated Francois Villon's epis masterpiece. Villon is generally considered to be one of France's greatest poets and this work has been described as "one of the most enduring epics ever." This bilingual edition means, of course, that you get the benefit of both the French and English translation side by side. This belongs on the book shelf of any discerning reader, regardless of whether you like poetry or not. This is quality work both by the translator and the Story Line Press.
