 This is a unique book of poetry. Unique in that the two authors, one living in rural Nebraska and one in Texas, have never personally met or even talked to each other over the telephone. They met on the Internet, discovered they shared a love of poetry and similar philosophies on marriage, family and friendship, and decided to create a book of poetry.While it is not unprecedented for poets to collaborate in such a manner, the highly acclaimed Braided creek by Jim Harrison and Ted Kooser comes to mind; it is unusual to do so without ever meeting or talking to each other. While Johnson and Sulik are not Harrison and Kooser they have done a credible job of writing this wonderful anthology of poetry that gently searches for wisdom in the myriad experiences of the human condition.  These poems run the gamut of life's experiences from love to pain to change and just about evry other emotion that makes up what Randall Jarrell calls "the dailiness of life." In poems like "Dad" and "What Mother Did For me" the authors reveal their feelings for their parents that is touching, emotional and raw. In the poem "Lost Friends" Johnson laments the death of her friend who she says "...was a gift..." and yet she did not attend her funeral, "convinced myself I'd honored her in life. I hope I did, at least." For those who have ever had occasion to revisit a friendship this poem will undoubtedly say in print what you have thought in private. To read Sulik's "The Knight and the Lady in White" is to be witness to an unabashed love song that is beautifully written and an example of heartfelt feelings that while almost universal in feeling is sometimes difficult to reduce to print.  These are honest, heartfelt poems that are worthy of the readers attention. They form a unique collection that will resonate with readers who value friendship, family, love and other things that matter. I would like to meet them both, together.
