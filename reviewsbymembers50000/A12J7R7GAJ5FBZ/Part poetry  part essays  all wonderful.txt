 While not a new book, this one is worthy of the readers time. Hasselstrom is a poet, an essayist and a working ranch woman, dividing her time between her ranch in South Dakota and a residence in Wyoming. This book is part poetry and part essay. It is all exceptional. If you want to read of death, life, love, the land and being a woman by one of the best writers in the business, this is the book for you. She has written a number of fine poetry books but I recommend this collection as a start. From here I suspect the reader will go on to her other works. She's that good.
