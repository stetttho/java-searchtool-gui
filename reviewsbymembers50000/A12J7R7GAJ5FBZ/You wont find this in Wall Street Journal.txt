 This anthology is provocative and guaranteed to create debate and discourse where ever two readers gather. It focuses on the writings and interviews of many proponents of the new anti-market left that has been around for awhile but gained increased visibility after the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle in 1999. Interestingly, increased numbers of centrists and conservatives are questioning the legitimacy of market driven societies that are destroying their investments and jobs. Serious questions about the role of the market driven economy are no longer the province of the left. The writers of this book discuss such topics as politics, culture, gender, and alternative economic systems in a non-doctrinaire manner that will give the reader an up-to-date discourse on globalization, war, and economic decline.  This is not something you will read in The Wall Street Journal.
