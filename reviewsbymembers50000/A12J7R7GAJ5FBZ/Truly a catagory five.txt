 This is perhaps the most stunning book of photographs I have ever seen in a coffee table type book. There are over 200 color photographs of a state whose splendor inspired Katharine Lee Bates to write "America The Beautiful" from atop Pikes Peak.  I lived on the western slope of Colorado for a time and can testify that these unforgettable photographs di it justice and are faithful to the awesome sights of the flora and fauna that abound in this magic place. From Abrams Mountain to Yankee Boy Basin and every place in between Steelman has painstakingly captured the mysteries, the moments, and the sheer magic of Colorado through its natural inhabitants and landscape.  This is the type of book you buy two copies of, one for a friend and one for yourself.
