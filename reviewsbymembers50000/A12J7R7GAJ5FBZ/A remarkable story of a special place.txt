 This is the definitive story of artist Georgia O'Keeffe's inspiration for her internationally renowned landscapes. Ghost Ranch is located on twenty-two thousand acres in the Piedra Lumbre basin of the high desert of northern New Mexico. Now owned by the Presbyterian Church, it has been the source of awe, inspiration, and spiritual renewal for thousands of visitors including the Rockefellers, Cary Grant, Robert Wood Johnson, and a virtual who's who of the artistic, business, and literary world. It is now recognized as one of the Southwest's premier conference centers as well as a cultural mecca. A remarkable story of a special place.
