 These poems pay tribute to a world that is flawed, defies understanding, and the struggle to somehow make sense of "...the world in all its gorgeous indifference." In poem after poem the author laments the sorrow inherent in the world and just when you think there is no hope she reminds us "What does it matter if, after all, we don't get what we think we want? Aren't we alive in the yearning, in the appetite?" Schwartz writes in a readable, thoughtful, honest manner that spotlights the struggle of one who is haunted by the indifference of the world and yet has hope because "The end of the story has not been written yet." Autumn House is a small press that publishes extraordinary poets that are worthy of the readers attention. This is such a book.
