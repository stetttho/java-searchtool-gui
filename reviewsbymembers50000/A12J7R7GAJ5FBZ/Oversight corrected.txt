 If there is any event in American history that has been thoroughly documented it is the Lewis & Clark expedition, 1803-06. Surprisingly, one area that has been generally overlooked is the medical aspect of the expedition. A retired cardiac surgeon and wilderness medical expert, Bruce C. Paton, has remedied that oversight with this fascinating book. In a highly readable, non-techinal manner, Paton examines the state of medicine in 1800 and discusses the medical preparations made by Meriwether Lewis for the journey including, at the urging of President Jefferson, his meetings with leading scholars of the time. The story of Lewis' meeting with Dr. Benjamin Rush, the advising physician to the expedition, is interesting not only for the advice given to Lewis but for Rush's varied interests and activities. Rush's list of 10 steps to follow in order to maintain the health of the expedition members provides the reader with a stark reminder of the state of medical care in early 1800. In addition, the author discusses the diagnoses and treatment of three specific major medical crises that confronted the expedition: the gunshot wound suffered by Lewis, the illness of Sacagawea and the death of Sergeant Floyd. While the death of Floyd did not affect the ultimate success of the expedition, the author speculates on what the outcome might have been had Sacagawea or Lewis died. That they did survive may have been due more to luck than the treatment they received. Only one member died during the incredible three-year ordeal despite limited medical knowledge and medications that were largely ineffective. This is a must book for anyone remotely interested in the Lewis & Clark expedition. Highly recommended.
