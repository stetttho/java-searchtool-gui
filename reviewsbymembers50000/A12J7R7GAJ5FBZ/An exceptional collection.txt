 These poems, from a professor at Emporia State University in Kansas, are from an astute observer of the Great Plains landscape. Using the landscape as a backdrop, Heldrich searches for meaning and revelation in our everyday lives. In his unforgettable poem "Momentum," while driving to Tulsa, he takes note of the cast off trash along the way and yet finds in such an everyday experience "...an unsung love to it, a love of the highway, a love of the country, a love of people and their wasteful bodies so deep the momentum drives me home." In poem after poem, forty-six in all, the reader is made aware of our surroundings and the sometimes taken-for-granted events in our everyday life and urged to celebrate life amidst all of it's uncertainities and limitations. For Heldrich, he shares some of his simple beliefs used to ward off the void in a wonderful poem "Good Friday:" ...the returning sun at breakfast, the beautiful coupling of our lake's geese, the rising green after prairie burnings, the silence of Sunday morning at home, or how my wife fills an empty room with light." For the reader looking for faith, hope, charity, and reconciliation without the usual touchy-feely verse, this is one of the best. An exceptional collection.
