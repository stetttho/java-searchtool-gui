 For the reader looking for information on the history of wildfire, their cultural impacts, and the state of modern wildfire suppression tactics, this book is a must. Not only is the text highly readable but the photographs should be enlarged and placed in a coffee-table size book. They are absolutely georgous. This is a timely book given the increasing frequency of wildfires in the west and southwest. Scott Thybony is a first rate writer and when his highly readable style is coupled with the photographs in this book it is a must have for any reader remotely interested in the topic.
