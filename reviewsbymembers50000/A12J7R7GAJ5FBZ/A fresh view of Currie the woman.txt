 I have always thought that a well-done volume of narrative poetry will appeal to readers that do not otherwise particularly like poetry. This book is just such an effort and will appeal to readers interested in history, women's achievements, and just good writing. The book is a poetic history of the personal and professional life of Marie Currie and her discovery of Radium. It's uniqueness lies in the tender, understanding way Swanson portrays Currie as not just a scientist but a woman struggling with death, love, public ridicule, and the age old problem of being almost obsessively devoted to one's work and the need for a private life. This biographical narrative provides a compelling view of Currie the person that has been overlooked in other efforts. Highly recommended.
