 I am a long time fan of Philip Levine. He is among a select pew preeminent chroniclers of the lives of working class people and has managed to faithfully record their experiences in a clear, true and genuine manner. With this volume Robert Gibb has joined Levine in this select group. Gibb was born and raised in the steel mill town of Homestead, PA, the kind of town that used up grandfathers, fathers, and sons, indeed entire families, in the hearths of blast furnaces and tap rooms. It also produced this highly personal account of loss both personal and communal. These poems portray loss and sadness in a tender, passionate manner that renders a dignity to those that labored to preserve the things we all hope to save. You will not forget this one.
