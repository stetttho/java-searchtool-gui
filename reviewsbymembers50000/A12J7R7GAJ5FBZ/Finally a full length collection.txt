 Finally, a collection of Mark Todd's poetry has been published! I first read his works in the classic collection of Colorado western slope poetry titled "Geography of Hope." Ever since, I have hoped for a full-length collection. It has finally arrived and what a collection it is. Todd lives among the incomparable landscape of the Colorado Rockies near Gunnison, Colorado. He writes in a manner that chronicles and respects the geographical region while at the same time his verse is so powerful that he transcends region and speaks to the heart regardless of where you live. His pose "The Doyleville Schoolhouse" is one of my favorites. His reminiscences of the old schoolhouse and it's importance to the farmers and ranchers is a reminder that "Some traditions run deeper than concrete." In fact, "the where can sometimes tell us who we are." The poem titled "Passages" will give the reader a flavor for his observations of the land he calls home: "These back-road passages still guide the lost wanderers, No matter the distance of the journey called home."  The book contains forty-one poems dealing with the weather, friends, animals, family, tragedy, humor, the land and a host of other subjects related to "...the country here-abouts..." that portrays the reality of a landscape that will speak to the reader where ever they reside. Wallace Stegner said "No place is a place until it has had a poet." With this publication of Wire Song the western slope of Colorado, indeed the entire state, has a first rate poet. Conundrum Press continues their high standards with this book.
