 Roger Henn, a native of Ouray, Colo., has been described as a storyteller extraordinaire, and indeed he is! In "Lies, Legends & Lore," his second book, Henn has compiled 43 stories he has collected over a  lifetime of events that occurred? in the San Juans. No, the question mark  is not a mistake. You see, with Henn one is never quite sure what to make  of his stories. The following quote from the preface will give you an idea  of what you can expect. "Unfortunately too many of today's historians  are engaged in debunking the lore involved with the history and the  personalities of the West...Give me the story that is told so well you are  not sure when the truth stops and the great lie begins." I have read a  considerable amount of history of the San Juan area but Henn's book  introduced me to a virtual gold mine of little known facts and stories of  everyday folks who settled the mountain towns that comprise the San Juans.  The story of Billy Nagle, the murderer, will touch your heaart and leave  you forever wondering if perhaps there is room for compassion in the  administration of justice. The story of Rose's Cabin will bring back many  memories tp those who have traveled the Alpine Loop Back Country Byway, or  would like to. The story of Snow Snakes and Snow Mosquitoes, along with the  one about a pet fly and murder, or justifiable homicide, will provide you  with ample evidence that Henn surely deserves the title of storyteller  extraordinaire. If you are looking for a well written, easy to read,  delightful and informative book about the history and lore of the San Juan  Mountain area, this book is a must read. Henn is one of those rare writers  that can tell a story in print that leaves you feeling he is talking  directly to you from in front of the livery stable in Ouray. And that's a  fact!
