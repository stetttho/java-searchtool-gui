 This is an extraordinary anthology of women's poetry that is both a landmark and a cause for celebration. Statistics indicate that at the end of the 20th century just a little over twenty percent of women were represented in major literary anthologies. This during a period when women were writing highly acclaimed works in unprecedented numbers and were receiving prestigious awards, such as the American Book Award and Nobel Prize for Literature, in all of the critically recognized genres. Thanks in large part to CALYX Books women writers are beginning to receive the recognition and honors they deserve. This anthology is the result of CALYX Books success in publishing first-rate women writers. In all, there are 101 women poets in this collection and their range of subjects are as diverse as their talents and accomplishments. From the pens of Nobel and New York State Poet Laureates; American Book Award winners; a MacArthur Fellow; a Commonwealth Poetry Prize winner, as well as other prestigious award winners, the reader will find poems on such topics as family, wars, domestic violence, the female body, sexuality, nature and ecology, and a host of other issues that is sure to satisfy every literary taste. These poems are powerful statements written by some of the best women writers in the world. The speak to, and will likely invoke, feelings of joy, sorrow, anger, despair, ecstasy, hunger, and hopefulness...sometimes all in the same poem. These are not the touchy-feely poems that sterotyped many women writers of the past. These poems are powerful statements that will introduce the reader to women's voices in "A Fierce Brightness." CALYX Books is to be commended for making this collection available at such an affordable price. Highly recommended.
