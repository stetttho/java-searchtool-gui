 This is a reissue of a book first published in 1939. It was considered by many critics destined to become a classic and was mentioned as a candidate for the Pulitzer Prize. As fate would have it the book was overshadowed by another book with an amazingly similar theme-John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath. As they say, the rest is history. Steinbeck's book went on to be a best selling classic and this book lapsed into obscurity. This book is the story of Depression-era Oklahoma tenant farmers struggling to survive in a hostile environmental and economic climate. The conflicting methods of the brothers Strickland to securing economic and social justice, one favoring criminal activity and the other a more legal course, makes for a powerful theme and wonderful book. This book deserves the second chance provided by OU Press and belongs on the shelf of any reader interested in Oklahoma history and the dust bowl era. It is surely in league with Steinbeck's classic.
