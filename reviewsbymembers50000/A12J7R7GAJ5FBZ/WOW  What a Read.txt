 As a rule I am not a fan of fiction, historical or otherwise. I suspect it may be a flaw in the genes or DNA or the like but there it is. However, every once in a while there is an exception and this book is a perfect example. I became interested due to its subject matter, Wildfires. I have been intrigued with Wildfires after once living on the western slope of Colorado and experiencing their often devastating effects first hand on numerous occasions. Thus, when this book was recommended to me it piqued my interest and it turned out to be well worth my time. The author skillfully blends the true story of Michigan's largest wildfire in modern history, the Metz fire of October 15, 1908, and the actual experiences of survivor Henry Hardies with a host of other characters, some fictional and some composites of real participants to tell a story that is highly readable, believable, and guaranteed to hold your interest from first page to last. The effects of the fire which killed 43, destroyed in excess of 900 homes, left 4,600 homeless, and destroyed the town of Metz is recounted in vivid detail and contains elements of love, death, sorrow, family, friendship, and rebirth that will leave the reader both a bit sad and yet hopeful. In a time when some 175,000 books are published each year and many good writers, such as Walt Shiel, go unnoticed due to financial limitations for promotional activities, books such as this deserve a wide spread audience. This is first rate writing that at times will leave you wondering whether it is fact or fiction but in a manner that does not deceive or talk down to the reader. Highly Recommended.
