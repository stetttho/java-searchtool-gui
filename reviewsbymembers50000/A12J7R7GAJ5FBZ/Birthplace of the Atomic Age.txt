 This is a great book for anyone remotely interested in the development of America's nuclear program and especially the city known as the birthplace of the Atomic Age. What makes the book unique is both the reader friendly narrative style of the writing and the author's focusing on the establishment of the town and men and women that created a livable community out of wartime chaos while confronting the myriad of social and cultural issues of the Atomic Age prior to the rest of the country...or world. A fresh look at the development of the Atomic Age culture.
