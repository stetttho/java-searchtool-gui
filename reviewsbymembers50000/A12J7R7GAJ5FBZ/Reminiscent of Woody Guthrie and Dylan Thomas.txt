 This is a thoughtful and hopeful book of poetry that called to mind two of my favorite poets, Woody Guthrie and Dylan Thomas.  I thought of Woody Guthrie and his poem " I've Got to Know" while reading di Suvero's "Tell Us." Both poems speak to the injustice and greed and fear fostered by illusions of grandeur and purported needs of socitey that serve to oppress those less fortunate. The unmistakable references to war in both poems are haunting and will give the reader, regardless of political leanings, pause especially at this point in time. It would be interesting to compare the lives and poetry of Guthrie and di Suvero. I suspect they are kindred souls that reached out and touched the stars in spite of the adversity that somehow invoked pure beauty in their writings.  In a blend of sometimes subtle, sometimes humorous and always thoughtful verse the reader is taken from poems with a war theme to ones of love and life and hope. The author notes in the beginning that this collection contains "...some new poems, some with a bit of gray between the lines, some angry and some still filled with hope." And so they are. These are not the touchy-feely type of poems that seem to be in vogue today. These are poignant, heartfelt, self-experienced poems that deal with life and love and questions that visit us all sooner or later. They truly offer faith, hope and charity in the biblical sense.  Now, as to my being reminded of Dylan Thomas while reading these poems. di Suvero writes that a new book should "...acknowledge the past as another mistake to be undone." He refuses to cease pointing out the inequities he views in life and even after close to 8 decades takes to heart Thomas's admonishment to "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night." In a compelling manner di suvero continues to "Rage, rage against the dying of the light."  This book is worthy of the readers time. Read it slowly...twice or more and be prepared to be moved in a special way.
