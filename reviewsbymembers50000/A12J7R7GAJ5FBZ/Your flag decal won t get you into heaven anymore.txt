 This book is not for the weak of heart, political partisans, or those exhibiting symptoms of what the author calls superpatriotism, that is "...the readiness to follow national leaders unquestioningly in their dealings with other countries, especially in confrontations involving military force." In a total of just 160 pages the author examines how hype, fear, and mindless flag-waving have replaced informed debate and a commitment to democracy and social justice in America. The relationship between US leaders and the media to promote fear and win support for military interventions and out of control budgets and insure political orthodoxy both at home and abroad is explored as are such vital questions as: What does it mean to love one's country? What determines America's "greatness"? and What is the messianic message behind much of nationalism?  I am reminded of John Prine's song titled "Your flag decal won't get you into heaven anymore" when reading this book. This one is guaranteed to get your juices flowing!
