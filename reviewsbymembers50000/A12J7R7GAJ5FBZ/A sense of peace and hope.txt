 Frannie Lindsay holds an MFA from the Iowa Writer's Workshop, is a classical pianist, writes wonderful poetry, and resides with her three retired greyhounds. This book was the winner of the 2004 Swenson Poetry Award and none other than the renowned poet J.D. McClatchy, in praising her work stated, "In her craft in the truth." I first read this book, twice, late in the evening and was struck by the sense of calm and tranquility it brought after a somewhat hectic day. This even though the subject matter frequently deals with loss and pain and its attendant bewilderment, denial, and sorrow. Lindsay has the rare ability to convey her obviously genuine, heartfelt, truthful feelings about some of life's most sensitive subjects and make the reader feel, in the end, a sense of peace and hope. This is the type of book that stays on the bedside table.
