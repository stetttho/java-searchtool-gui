 If this is not the first, it is undoubtedly the best, anthology of cowboy poetry available today. For many years I thought cowboy poetry was kind of, well, you know, cowboyish. That is, it was kind of cute in a nursery rhyme  sort of way but was not really relevant when you compared it to real  poetry. Fortunately, I was privideged to live in the west for four years  and was introduced to some of the best poetry I have ever read. It was  called, well, cowboy poetry! Not only was it as well written as any  so-called mainstream poetry but it has a way of speaking to the reader that  will forever change the way you view cowboy poetry. Thus, it was with great  interest that I read Cowboy Poetry Matters. The book brings together some  of the best and brightest cowboy poets writing today, most notably Linda  Hussa, Linda Hasselstrom, and Laurie Buyer and places their work along side  such well known mainstream poets as Donald Hall and Maxine Kumin. The  result is a remarkable collection of poetry by diverse poets that discover  they share a lot of common ground and that cowboy poetry can be, and is, as  relevant and diverse as the poets. In addition to a feed bag full of  wonderful poetry, the reader will find memoirs by Linda Hussa and Wallace  McRae which will stir your soul. Not to be overlooked is a stimulating  series of critical essays by Dana Gioia, Paul Zarzyski, and Kathy Ogren  which will challenge you to view cowboy poetry in ways you may have never  considered. I encourage readers that want to be introduced to some of the  very best cowboy poetry available today to try this book. As they say in  the west "How long has it been since you read some really bood cowboy  poetry?" "Well pardner, that's to long."
