 Every now and again a book is written by a relatively unknown author that deserves a wider audience than is usually given to such efforts. This is such a book. Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Powell reservoir has been controversial from its inception. It is alternately referred to as the jewel of the Colorado and Lake Foul sewage lagoon. There are literally thousands of books dealing with the subject from almost every conceivable angle. Surprisingly, there are very few about the people and places that "...few people knew and almost no one remembers." Places such a White Canyon town now under 200 feet of water. The town was built in 1949 to service a uranium-processing mill during the atomic energy craze of the late 40s and 50s. The book tells the story of the rise and fall of the town and the people such as the authors grandparents that made it a special place in southeastern Utah. This is a magical, bittersweet story of a special place gone but not forgotten. Highly recommended.
