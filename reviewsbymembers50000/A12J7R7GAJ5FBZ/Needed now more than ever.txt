 This is a major book that is a must-read for anyone interested in one of the foremost radical figures of the twentieth century. Readers familiar with Zinn will remember his as a historian, activist, and proponent of radical social reform. He was a leader in the Civil Rights movement and one of the early opponents of the Vietnam War. His book "A People's History of the United States" has sold over a million copies and is considered a classic. At age 80 Zinn continues to write, lecture, and promote his views of a better America through radical social reform. Always controversial and sometimes considered un-American, this is a great book about an American icon, and is a must-read,  as noted by Noam Chomsky, "For those who value the diversity of American voices and appreciate the importance of radically different viewpoints outside the mainstream." Davis Joyce is a first rate scholar and highly readable writer who can make you feel as if you were sitting at the kitchen table with him and a cup of coffee discussing Zinn and social issues of the day. He is that good. A superb job by a talented author. Highly recommended.
