 This is a remarkable first person account of Navajo culture as observed by the trader at the Shiprock Trading Post for a half century beginning in 1893. Divided into three sections: Historic, People, and Culture, the author tells down to earth, first person stories of his customers, friends, and neighbors on the Northern Navajo reservation. The book is unique in that it records Navajo history and stories of individuals about whom precious little biographical information remains. This is unvarnished history through the eyes of a most astute observer. Absolutely first rate.
