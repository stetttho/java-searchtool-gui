 This poetry anthology by 12 Colorado writers is a real keeper. The backgrounds of the poets are as diverse as their poetry. Whatever your taste in poetry you are sure to find something that speaks to you. Humor, regret, nature, politicss, love, and a dash of magic are all represented in light and darkness. The diversity of the poetry is amazing considering the writers all reside on the common ground of the Western Slope of Colorado. Wallace Stegner, dean of writers of the West, wrote that "...no place is a place until it has had a poet..." If that is true, the Western Slope of Colorado is truly a place thanks to these poets. This collection, now in it's second edition, is a must have for anyone remotely interested in contemporary poetry of the first rank.
