 It has been said of McDougall that her work "...gives voice to the ineffable emotions of plain people." No less a poet than Gerald Stern has noted her poetry is "Excruciating honest" and has the qualities of "Subtlety of spirit. Forgiveness" that, taken together, make it "A joy to read."  This is her best work and lives up to both the critics and readers expectations. It will appeal to avid poetry fans as well as readers that typically tend to not be big poetry fans but like plain, down-to-earth, heart felt passages about everyday occurrences and events that comprise life. In other words, poetry that is succinct, relevant to everyday life, and a pleasure to read. For example, her poem titled "To My Daughter, Who Refuses To Meet Me Halfway," McDougall writes of the heartbreak associated with the death of her daughter:                "Dating our lives from their departures,               We beg them for signs.               We want to stumble upon them napping               or peeling an orange.               They send nothing, no nearer to us now               Than the day they nodded to Death               And asked him in."  Thus, in 41 words and 7 lines she is able to speak the truth for anyone who has ever lost a loved one. Ther is more to the poem but these lines are illustrative of the power and insight of her work. She also writes of hope, growing old, living in Kansas, (61 poems in all) and a wonderful poem titled Snow In Arkansas that reminds me of the havoc snow sometimes plays on Oklahoma. These poems describe real things in a beautiful, readable, magical manner and will make you understand why she is "A joy to read."
