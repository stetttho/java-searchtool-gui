 Finally, an anthology about the significance and importance of place and landscape in poetry as experienced by sixty-two poets from throughout the U.S. The author, former director of the writing program at Johns Hopkins University, and his wife spent the better part of a year traveling and interviewing poets from Rhode Island to Washington State, from Minnesota to Texas, and virtually every state in-between. They met with such award-winning poets as Sam Hamill, Naomi Shihab Nye, Charles Wright, and Rita Dove. The question was always "What part does place play in your writings?" The answers were as diverse as the poets and yet remarkably similar in one respect: Place does plan an important role in writing and is much more than simply geography. Together with suitable poems, photo's ,and word portraits, this is a must read for any reader interested in the craft of writing.
