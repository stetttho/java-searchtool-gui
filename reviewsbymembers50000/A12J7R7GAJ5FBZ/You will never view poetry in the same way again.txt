 So, you say you like reading about the history of Colorado's early gold mining camps but usually don't like poetry?  Well, you are in luck.  Robert Cooperman, one of Colorado's premier poets, has written a book of narrative  poems that is unlike anything you have read in a long time. In The Colorado  Gold Fever Mountains is a trilogy of poems that are a pure delight to read.   These poems paint pictures of the people and events in 19th century  mountain towns that are so vivid you will take a place among the  participants.  Cooperman does this by giving realistic, believable voices  to the people living in the Mountain West we know as Colorado. Book One  takes the reader into the thoughts, activities and every day life of  residents and visitors alike to a fictional Colorado gold camp.  Don't miss  "Francis DeLacey, Publisher of the Gold Creek Optimist" or the  thoughts of "I.O. Emerson, Freighter, Salida, CO."  This is  definitely not your every day poetry. Book Two is my favorite.  It is  titled A Coffin and a Carved Stone and relates the towns feelings prior to,  during, and after the death of a prostitute who was hanged.  The thoughts  attributed to "Simon Black, Hangman" and "Thomas Burden,  Preacher" will stay with you long after you lay the book aside. Book  Three describes the journey of a proper English lady and her hired outlaw  escort on a tour of Colorado in the 1870s.  It is a touching, gentle, harsh  narrative with a surprising ending. Cooperman has a talent to write  nattative poetry in a manner that draws the reader in, sits them down, and  virtually involves them in the discussion or event.  He is that good.  If  you are looking for a book that portrays the entire spectrum of humanity as  it may have been during the gold fever period of 19th century Colorado, get  this book.  You will never view poetry in the same way again.
