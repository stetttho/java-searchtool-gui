 Simply put, Combat Flight Simulator 2 is a fantastic combination of fun and white knuckle thrills!  Where the first outting was slightly lacking CFS2 nicely fills all the voids and then some.  Stunning aircraft details abound, bullet holes, flak damage, flames, smoke as well as the ships, islands and even the waves of the ocean are so finely detailed they'll make your eyes pop and your mouth water!  Critical point however, make darn sure you have the very latest drivers for your video card or you'll spend alot of time banging your head on the keyboard wondering why you can't keep your system from stalling.  Also be sure to keep your screen setting (in game) at 800x600x16 or above, when set at 640x480 on my system, I got kicked out of the game every time I was shot down, at the higher settings, no problems to report just brilliant hours in the air!  Difficulty options make this flight sim a must for the pilot or thrill seeker, there is litteraly a setting for everybody at any level of flight sim experience 8 to 80.  Set in a 40's comic book theme, The cut scene's are colourful and cleaver, although the subject matter and voice overs give you an erie feeling that the boys that fought in the skies over the Pacific so bravely, knew full well there was a very fine line between victory and death at sea.    If you've got the system to run it, you'll be releaved and thrilled that the future of combat flight siming has finally arrived!  So, try your steady hand at landing on the rolling deck of a carrier, or taking on two dozen zero's in a thunderstorm, with CFS2 sky's the limit and once you strap yourself into this title that's where you'll want to stay!
