 The things you love about Test Drive and hate about Test Drive run in a dead heat.  The action is fast and furious, the streets flashing by in a 100 mph plus blur is a bit of a rush but ultimately there really isn't much to look at, no check that, there's a lot to look at but there really isn't much to see that we haven't already seen in say... Crazy Taxi.  Frame rates are solid but the landscapes are anemic and flat, the cars don't fare much better, feeling a tad on the jagged side with muted paint jobs and reflections.   The sound is horrible, with some effects missing altogether, when you pile into a lamp post at break neck speed, there is no sound of crumpled steel, just an odd silence.  Which brings us to a another major disappointment, car damage, like the sounds of destruction, there is none, not so much as a scratch or paint chip, no twisted fenders or one single dented bumper, which in the end makes Test Drive feel unfinished to say the least.   On the up side however Test Drives levels are large and teaming with traffic and peds, the sense of speed is very nice and the controls are comfortable and easy to acclimate yourself to and the Cop Chase mode is a hoot but in the end there are better and much prettier examples of driving games out there, simulation; Project Gothem, arcade; see Wreckless and for a little of both we'll just have to wait and see how Midtown Madness 3 fares.  You wont love test drive but you wont hate it so if you're looking for something different to drive around on your X Box this weekend (that's arcade style crash 'em up fun) rent it and save your money for something useful... like say, a cute poster of a kitty.
