 My Compaq 5660 came with a 4mb ATI Rage Lt Pro, what a great board, it's  no Charles Atlas mind you but it truly was the little engine that could, or  at least tried every single time.  But with todays high software demands,  the little engine had to be retired to the round house, now his 32mb big  brother rules the rails of my computer.  I have friends that have spent  weeks working around patching problems for their Voodoo boards and it seems  everytime I log onto Lucas Arts and other software companies web-sites  they're offering the latest patches for Voodoo products, thank God I stayed  with a brand I used and trusted.  The installation was a breeze (and I'm a  computer idiot), visuals are stunning and the performance... well in one  word, flawless.  And can you believe it, ATI is the only board I could find  that offered a TV composite out, great option.  Seems Voodoo may have won  the marketing battle but in my book, ATI has won the performance war.   Bravo ATI, keep up this kind of effort in all the hardware you develope and  I'll demand it in every system I buy.
