 A while back I gave Microsoft's Flight Simulator 2004 one star (see review from 23 November) where in I took issue with MS's listed minimal system requirements ...Windows 98/2000/XP/Me, Pentium 450 or greater processor, 64 MB RAM for 98/Me, 128 MB RAM for 2000/XP, 8 MB/3-D with DirectX 7.0 or later videocard, 1.8 GB hard drive space... I ran it at those specs (on a Windows 98 machine) and as I noted in my review... "I couldn't leave the ground at more than 4-8 frames per second (fps) or cruise at more than 11 or 12 fps with settings a rock bottom! The world outside my cockpit was jagged and twisted as my 777 chugged painfully through the not so friendly skies like a wounded wildebeest trying in vain to outrun a charging cheetah!"...  well although I still stand by my disgust for misleading minimum requirements stickered to the side of software boxes (Microsoft not being the only offender) something wonderful happened on the way to my virtual airport the other day, I slapped down the cash for a new system...  Presario 8000T, Pentium 4 - 3.20E GHz processor, XP Home Edition, 256MB DDR ATI Radeon 9600 (Direct X 9) video card, 1 GB DDR / PC3200 Ram, 160GB 7200 rpm Hard Drive... and what a wondrous world I discovered at ground level and 35,000 feet!  With all settings to high including "Building Storms" selected in weather and AI aircraft set to 100 percent my performance has jumped to the stunningly beautiful and silky smooth new heights of 25 to 35 fps on the ground at large busy airports (Chicago O'Hare or Miami International) and 40+ at smaller strips like say Rapid City, SD or Madison, WI!  "Volumetric" clouds build in the distance, spraying twisted flashes of lightning across the sky as you would see in real life and as I climb through these true to life cotton balls, I'm seemingly enveloped by a fine mist, breaking in and out of the dense cover and able to spy specks of light from towns and highways far below.  Gone are the 2D "sprite" clouds from previous incarnations of MSFS, this truly is as real as it gets!  And did I mention my frame rates remain at a rock solid 24-30+ fps as I slice through the weather just beyond the safety of my cockpit?!  (Note: the images you see on your NTSC TV only run at 30 fps with PAL and film running at 24 fps) ...to top it off my frame rates frequently soar to 45-50+ fps and beyond when the atmosphere opens up!  On a personal note may I recommend flying at dusk?  Brilliant!  The terrain fading smoothly into a hazy horizon and the setting sun, wow!  MSFS 2004 is truly a world to behold with too many extra's technically and visually to list here, just know however that there's a realism and flight model setting for every level of experience (or lack there of) and the graphics (if you can take advantage of them) are nothing short of stunning!  You can ran run it on a lesser machine to be sure but for best results a P4 2ghz + machine with a bare minimum of 512 DDR ram and a 128 Mb (Direct X 9 compatible) video card is recommended.   And oh yes don't forget (at the very least) a good joy stick, say a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro (5 stars) with twist handle (for rudder) to make your day of flying complete.
