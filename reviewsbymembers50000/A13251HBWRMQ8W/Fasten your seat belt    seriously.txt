 Midtown Madness is the only software title I've ever purchased that keeps  me and my son going back for more and more and more (for almost two years  straight).  It's also the only title I will never uninstall.  A metal goes  to the genious' at Angel Studios for coming to the obvious conclusion that  driving in circles is a drag but having free high octane access to the  streets of America's greatest city (Chicago) would be a blast and Midtown  Madness is simply that, blowing away every other racing title off the road.   And a big high five and kudos to Microsoft for putting it in the box so I  could buy it.  Why?  Because it has been brilliantly injected with a mondo  dose of what every red blooded American driver wants, freedom!  Pile drive  your way down side streets, alleys or Lakeshore Drive at 100 mph plus  during rush hour!  Destroy every mail box, phone booth and street sign it  sight all the while driving poor unsuspecting citizens from the sidewalk  just to listen to them scream!  There's no blood, no death, no four letter  words or flying middle fingers just pure unrestrained fun everytime you get  behind the wheel of a wide range of four wheelers like a Caddy, Bug, Semi,  city bus or Mustang (just to name a few).  It ran great when all I had was  an ATI 4mb video board (my system is PII, 450mhz), but now that I've  upgraded to an ATI 32mb board the visual MADNESS is nearly lethal.  And  when I've got a half dozen of Chicago's finest flashing those pretty reds  in my rearview mirror, doing everything in their power to ram me off the  busy city streets, I just know I'll be spending the night in cyber jail for  any number of serious moving violations, and isn't that what it's all  about!
