 Castle Wolfenstein: Tides of War is everything Medal of Honor for Xbox should have been and much, much more.  The presentation is suburb and the graphics are so sharp you should be careful not to cut yourself.  I suppose a person could get into all the subtle details about this and that but the bottom line is if you're looking for a first person shooter that moves fast and furious and finds that perfect balance between run and gun action and an entertaining plot, Wolfenstein is it in spades!  Each level slips you deeper and deeper into a creepy world of Nazi mutant zombie experimentation and into the bowels of a Third Reich hell on Earth.  And it's your job to stop them before they stop you!    The "wow" factor of this stunner can be found on all fronts, from it's beautifully rendered world and characters, with lighting effects to drool for.  The throbbing theme music is spot on and the great voice acting rings the life out of the nifty story line.   The levels and game play are deep, well designed and executed, which will most certainly keep you coming back for more.  Tides of War is a mighty romp, well deserving of not only 5 stars but also a medal for gaming valor.
