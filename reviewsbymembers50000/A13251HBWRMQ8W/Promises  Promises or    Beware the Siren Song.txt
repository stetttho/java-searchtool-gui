 In my book, [this] is a major investment for any "game", so when you plunk down that much green, you'd better end up green with envy that you weren't the one responsible for designing such  an amazing product.  In the case of Gunship! you'll see plenty of green but  only in the form of the aircraft, the ground, the trees (did I mention the  ground?) and loads of lifeless buildings stacked together like some  survivalist compound.   The excitement in Gunship! hardly went further than  the slick graphics and screen shots on the box.   As for performance, the  play of this title is just plain... plain, sort of like Cream of Wheat if  you don't cook it with a pinch of salt, all the sugar in the world wont  help, and it doesn't help Gunship! So to avoid that familiar dull sinking  feeling you get in your gut and your wallet because you've been lured once  again into the cold murky depths by the Sirens Song (i.e. slick packaging),  wait until it goes on sale or you can get it in your local second-time  around software store for [less]...
