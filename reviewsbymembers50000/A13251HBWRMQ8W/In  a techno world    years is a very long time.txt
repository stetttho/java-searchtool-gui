 Frustrated with trying to run Microsoft's power hungry monster Flightsim  2000 on my PII, 450mhz system , I thought I'd give '98 a try.  Frame rate  was explosive but it's anemic virtual world left me flat.  Flightsim '98 is  only a couple years old but in todays high end visual universe, it looks  and feels nothing short of drab and dated.  So long old friend, the time  has come to move on to the budget software bin, your time in the sun has  sadly passed.
