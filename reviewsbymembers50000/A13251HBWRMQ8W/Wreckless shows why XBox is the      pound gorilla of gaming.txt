 The days of Microsoft�s� Midtown Madness and Need for Speed series seem so quaint as we look back with warm and fuzzy memories at gaming days past.  And oh, where have all the big chunky polygon's gone and the flat textures and slow frame rates?  Three or four years ago anybody who knew anything about computers and megabytes held out hope that we would eventually arrive at a time when video games would not only entertain us but would quite literally blow our collective minds and on November 15th, 2001 the future arrived with a bang and glowing green orb with the release of the XBox and Activisions "Wreckless" clearly illustrates why "the Box" quite frankly sets the standard in gaming.   Nearly every beautiful pixel in Wreckless can be crushed, driven through and or destroyed.  People run for their lives in the street, buses zig zag to safety and every four wheeler on the road from the family sedan to cement mixers slam into walls, poles and each other in an attempt to avoid becoming just another fractured piece of scrap metal on Hong Kong�s remarkably crowded streets.  Trying to describe Wreckless' stunning visuals is like trying to explain a sunset to someone who has been blind since birth, the graphics are so radiant and photo realistic at times that it�s easy to forget that the images flashing past your windshield are not lifted from some of Hollywood�s best chase scenes.  Smoke swirls, sparks fly and neon lights explode into a shower of fire and illuminated glass!  The cars you get to choose from are fabricated makes and models, no Mustangs, Corvettes or BMW's will be found here, my favorite being the scooter like police car (if you've seen the Depeche Mode video "Never Let Me Down Again" you'll have a clear picture of the kind of car I'm talking about) but that's part of the charm, who cares what the hood ornament says, the driving is fast and furious, the cars offer intricate detail and look amazingly realistic right down to the drivers behind the glass and that's all you need to know.  The vehicles also take more damage than just about any computer generated auto to date, doors fly off, bumpers crumple and glass shatters, although the physics are a bit odd at times, it only takes the slightest miscue to find yourself spinning out of control and into an on coming bus and the controls can leave you a bit frustrated as your thumb finds the "black" button instead of "B" for reverse but those are minor points and totally forgivable considering the completely immersive ride Wreckless offers. If you're a fan of Midtown Madness, Project Gothem Racing, Driver and Crazy Taxi, you get all three under one hood with Wreckless, a break neck romp that has very little to do with a real world driving experience but everything to do with driving like hell to accomplish your mission. However, one of the biggest problems with Wreckless (which made Midtown Madness great) is it's lack of a "cruise mode" (which dropped my 5 stars to 4).  Why not I ask, what would it hurt to let us wander aimlessly through the streets to discover the short cuts and wonders of this world.  For the record, it was Midtowns cruise mode that kept me going back for more, two years running even after the races were long forgotten. But in the end, prepare to be stunned by the stellar graphics and to yes Virginia, laugh out loud as you plow your way through Hong Kong�s incredibly crowed and drop dead gorgeous streets.  At night or day (or dusk for that matter) there's nothing like Wreckless to provide more thrills and eye candy than any other driving game on the planet.   It's titles like Wreckless that make me glad to put the PC age of gaming in the distant past, with great titles like Wreckless and the power of the Xbox, all you get is uninterrupted monster frame rate fun without spending $10,000 to do it and in my book that makes XBox the best $300 I� well ah, my son ever spent.
