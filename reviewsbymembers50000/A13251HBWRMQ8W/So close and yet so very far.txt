 Everyone loves this game yet everyone seems to hate it for all the same reasons and it's a shame really.  Crimson Skies was like a soon to be star standing in the wings waiting for it's big break but when it hit the stage and stood in the lime light, it choked and fell flat on it's face in the worst possible way.   What a disappointment it was to load Crimson Skies and have my jaw instantly hit the keyboard for all it's quirky and wonderful audio/visual treats, the voices, the music, the design, the brilliant colors and the trees (my God the trees!), only to have my guts turn while I listened to the hard drive in  my Compaq PII 450 mhz system grind and groan and crackle for what seemed endless minutes as it struggled with a simple drop down menu.  And lets not even get into the nearly three minutes it took to just exit the game.  Oh, I have the onboard tools to run it, ATI Rage Fury Pro 32mb board and 128 sdram but it seems it doesn't matter what your running, a  350, 750 or even 1000 mhz system, you'll simply end up spending much more time waiting to exit menu screens or load levels then you'll ever spend playing the game.   And even after an exhausting hour on the phone with our patient friends at Microsoft Tech Support, tinkering and tweaking my system, I gained very little satisfaction, although the frustration grew with the fact that this absolutely brilliant concept, wrapped up in probably one of the best designed packages ever to hit store shelves was so horribly flawed that it squeezes the very life out of what could of have been one of the best games of the year if not ever.   If  I were to rate this game on sheer fun, excitement and originality, there's no question it earns a solid five stars, but the endless waiting for those brief brilliant moments when I actually got to scream through amazingly detailed  billowing clouds and over Crimson Skies' breathtaking landscapes made me just walk away, shaking my head, muttering to myself with great disappointment, "so close and yet so very far".   Maybe someday they'll find the silver bullet patch that will redeem this worthy title, if not, it runs the very real risk of going down in software history as the Heaven's Gate of  PC gaming.  Here's to hopping that doesn't happen.
