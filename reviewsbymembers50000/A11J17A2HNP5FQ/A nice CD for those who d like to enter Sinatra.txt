 Being a sinatra "fan" is a bit like being an Elvis Presley Fan. You've got "new" albums almost everyday. Most of the songs you already own, and there's little or nothing new to add. But, then again, you say to yourself: "What the heck, perhaps it has better sound, or, well, if not, I'm having a different set of songs this time" and you buy it. With this CD, happened to me more than that. It was a gift from Ma'Mama and, inspite of being from HER, and being 99% (hey, she's my mom, I can't be all objective) objective I must rekon that this Compilation has something special. From the very beginning (the Package), everything seems so perfect... I can't almost believe that I'd become so fond of a collection whith no tracks that I didn't already had. My personal recomendation is that you buy it. Yes, you will tell me, another marketing thing, and, I will tell you "may be" but, at leasr this one is nice. The songs are perfect -though I would have included The Girl From Ipanema (Garota De Ipanema), one of my Frank's Favs-. I cannot find any complaint with this CD. So, what are you waiting for? Stop reading this useless review and press the ORDER button ;-)
