 Mondocane is, for me, one of the best, if not the best piece of documentary ever done. And, it's music is on the same level. When I was a child, I spent hour listening to the old 45 rmp record that we have at home. Nowadays, I haven't any Recordplayer, but I still enjoy listening to the CD. If you have seen the movie you might well think that the music won't fit without the images, and, even though you are a little right, when you listen to the music, images will came to your mind inmediately. This, as almost no other score, can bring you the images as if you were in the cinema...
