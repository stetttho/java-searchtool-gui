 I liked it very much. When they're in car, love, passion, Erin, kiss, and Foreigner sings I Wanna Know What Love Is, and I want You To Show Me... and so on, you can feel that the movie has something special. The same happened with the album, everytime I listen to it I feel that these mood is where my CD is (in my car mostly :-) One thing to take into account when you buy it is that it will recall you of the movie more than any other OST (well, perhaps it's because of the movie, and NOT because of the OST :-). Buy it now! You won't get dissapointed at all.
