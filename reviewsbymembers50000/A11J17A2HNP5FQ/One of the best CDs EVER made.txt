 This CD, along with "Weltreise" -or Voyage, as you like to translate it- and "Live (Er) Leben"  is one of the best CDs ever pressed so far. Not only the music -which is unbelievable- but the lyrics, the melodies, everything.  I find it hard to describe how wonderfull this CD is. "Leben... I Feel You..." can give meshivers all down my spine. When in hear the intro "Der Anfang | Guten Abend!" I can feel my head's spinning into the most happiest of all the whirpools it might ever be.  Schiller is for me, my new favorite. It's for me what once was Enigma, or Vangelis, or Secret Garden. I still like and listen to other music (nowadays too much too Jazz and Bossa Nova) but, I can be all day listening to Schiller without even noticing that it's the same CD over and over.  So, my final advice is, BUY ALL SCHILLER YOU CAN. Even here or in  amazon.de, but get all CDs! (and, if you can afford it, I trully recommend the German editions).
