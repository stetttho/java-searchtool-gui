 That's what the inlay booklet say. And, to be honest with you all, this is pure truth. I bought this almbum since I am a HUGE Vangelis fan, and a version of State Of Indepence (or Spiritual High as Moodswings call it) was on this CD. I never thought that "a version from someone else" would impress me EVEN more than a version by Vangelis himself (with Jon Anderson, in this case). This CD is incredible nice. All the songs are great. The last one, Hairy Piano is a Gem, and all the others are incredible nice too. Spiritual High, is, as you might guess, my fav, but all the CD is great. The inclusion of Martin Luther King Jr's "I Have A Dream" speech on the 3rd. movement of Spiritual High was totally acerted and makes the CD even more enjoyable. So, let's dream away, let's ease our tired minds... let this aural medication heal you...
