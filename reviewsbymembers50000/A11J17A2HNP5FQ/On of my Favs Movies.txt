 I had to admit it. I love this film. I dunno why when they ask me about my fav movie, I always say "Godfather". That's true I do love Godfather and think is one of the best (if not THE best) films ever made, but, I watch Birdcage more often.  This is the movie I had no time to watch. I mean, any mood will fit  a play of Bircage.  Robbin Williams is as great as he could be, Gene Hackman is at his best, Nathan Lane, Hank Azaria, all of them plays marvelous. And the film, as a whole, is increible well done. I remmember falling asleep EVERY SINGLE time I wanted to finish watching the original (Frehch) one, but not with this one.  I watched it over and over, for more than 1,000 times, and counting, and everytime I watch it, I find something I haven't noticed before. Is that great to me.  It's a great movie, also, because I has a great sense of Family. In times like these where Family values seems to be fadding away,  a movie like this that reaffirms them, is great. I know, I know, I know, it's not the typical family, but it's a family.   So, what can I say? I just love this one...
