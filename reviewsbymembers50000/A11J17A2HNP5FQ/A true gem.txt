 If you like Astor Piazzolla, you'll love this one. This, along with Buenos Aires Tango: Zero Hour and La Camorra, are Piazzolla's best works (even recognized by the master himself). If you like tango, you'll love this one. No matter how purist you could be, Milonga Picaresque es as pure as tango itself. If you like Jazz, you can't miss Milonga For Three (Reprise). And, if you just like music (like me) well, this is the CD to have.  It has something that makes it so special. It's great for all tastes. One funny thing: Milonga For Three (reprise) is GREAT FOR LOVEMAKING ;-)
