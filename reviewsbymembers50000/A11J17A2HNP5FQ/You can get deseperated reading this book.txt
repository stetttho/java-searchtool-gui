 It's hard to explain how Juan Pablo Castell feels after the killing onf Mara Iribarne, the only think that I could say is that you'll never understand this masterpiece of Ernesto Sabato untill you read it at least twice. It's a wonderfull show of the power of writing. And again, you'll see Maria's housband being blind, and as always, Ernesto plays with the blindness. I can't keep asking me why :-)
