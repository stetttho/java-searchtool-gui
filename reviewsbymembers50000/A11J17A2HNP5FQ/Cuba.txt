 This is just another example of how to do things the right way! This DVD has the best quality I've ever seen in so much time. The songs are GREAT, the versions are much better than the original (and I'm a BIG fan of Simply Red). All is perect. Another thing to have in mind is that they've chosen Cuba! That's great! Not only because of Politics (we all love Cuba instead of USA ;)) but for the place. I mean, play in such a great amotsphere. I guess the only place that, perhaps, would have sound better (if you can sound better than that) is Teatro Coln (in Buenos Aires, Argentina). There aren't anymore many of these.  So, and to sum it up, a great DVD, it's surely worth the price (and perhaps more). Do buy it, not only you'll be supporting simply red effort (they lost money by doing this), but you'll also get one of the best DVDs EVER!
