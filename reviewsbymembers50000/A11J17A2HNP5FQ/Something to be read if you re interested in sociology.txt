 If you know a little about general stuff, you'll know who's Giddens. He's not a newbie on the sociology scene. Moreover, he's one of Tony Blair's advisors (consultants). I think this book takes the Third way in a serious  way, and that it's the Third Way in itself. Read it if you are interested  in the subject, if not, do it anyway, you'll be interested after reading...
