 Yes, Jorge Lanata did it again. He proved he's not only (one of) the best journalist (in Argntina) but that he's a great writer and historian.  This book, along with volume 2, will allow you to understand Argentine history as no other book. It may be a little too much too cruel sometimes, but that's the truth. That's what happened.  It's amazing to see the clarity which he uses to describe things. Even the dumber will quite understand what happened.   A gem, truly a Gem, if you plan to know and understand Argentine history.
