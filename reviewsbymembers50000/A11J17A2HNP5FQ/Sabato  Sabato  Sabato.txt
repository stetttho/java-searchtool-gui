 Ernesto Sabato is, without any doubt, one of the best writers of our time.  Although he's in touch with 2000, he's still holding that  "pacefullness" that we are have lost. This book, as all other  Sabato works, is another ironic look to what's happening inside him and the  world in general. Always, in a way, he's ironic. All his books reflec  something deep inside him, and this one, this one is not the exception to  the rule.
