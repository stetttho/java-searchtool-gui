 I love Jazz, and this CD brings the best out of Jazz music. I loved the movie too (not *so* common places), but this CD is even better than the movie. (I know that's not the real sountrack, but that's an excellent disk anyway.) It's hard to find such a nice collections of Good Melodies alltogether and, moreover, in such good arrangements. At first when I noticed that, for example, Gee Baby, Ain't Good To You was not by Ella Fritgerald and Louis Armstrong (until now, the only ones who can play it that good) but by Matt Rollings with Lyle Lovett's version, I was a little dissapointed, but then, after hearing it in full, I noticed how wrong I was, this one has nothing to envy to the other (well, yes, Ella & Louis ;-), and so, with all the songs. So, if you like it, like me, the Jazzy way (I mean, being cozy in a cozy livingroom -near the fireplace- reading something nice in some winter afternoon) well this album will provide the right coziness for that moment... (it's also goog enough when you are dinning with your girl at home and you want something more intimate after dinner, but that's another story ;-)
