 Ernesto talks, this time, about all the things a writer has to go thru. I recall someday telling him "I'd love to be a famous writer like you" and he replied "Do you wanna be famous or writer?. Being famous is something... But, being writer has a lot of bad things" Those are the things he gives out here... Nice job, Ernesto!
