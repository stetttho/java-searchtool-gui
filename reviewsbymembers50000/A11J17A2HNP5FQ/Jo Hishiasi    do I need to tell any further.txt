 I think that Jo Hishiahi (Joe Hishiashi) is one of the best score composers in Japan. You might tell me that I'm wrong, and well, perhaps I am, but, IMHO (in my honest opinion) Jo is, by far, the best. I must admit that I entered Jo by Takeshi Kitano's films (and Kikujiro No Natsu) is one of his (if not the) best Kitano's film ever. If you like piano scores, calms soundings and great musicscapes (landscapes recreated by music, also mindscapes), this is the best album you can ever have...
