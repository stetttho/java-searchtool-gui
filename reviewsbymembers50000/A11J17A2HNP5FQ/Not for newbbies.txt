 This Vangelis album is not for newbbies. That why I'm awarding it just 4 stars. It's great, pefect, a gem, but definitely not for newbbies. If you are not a Vangelis specialist (I mean if you just like one or two songs by Vangelis) you rather buy Voices, or Spiral, or Direct, or Reprise, or... but never Soil Festivities. In my honest opinion you should know Vangelis, at least a little, before daving into this album. On the other hand, if you feel you are ready for Vangelis not-so-well-known stuff, then don't hessitate, this album's amazing from the very cover to the most inner parts. ;-)
