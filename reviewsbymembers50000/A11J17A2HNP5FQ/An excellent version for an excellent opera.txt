 I don't know how I got started in the opera stuff, all I know is that Purcell's Dido and Aeneas was one of my first operas. Nowadays, with a lot more of knowledge, I still recall this opera as one of the best I have ever heard. This version, from my humble point of view, is one of the best you can get. I love Gardiner's versions and, particulary, this one. If you'd like to enter the world of Purcell, that's the best entrance...
