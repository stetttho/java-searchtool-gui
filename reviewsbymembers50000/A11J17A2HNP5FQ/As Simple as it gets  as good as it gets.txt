 Simple, that's the word that best describes this Soundtrack. No  complicated arrangements and simple melodies. That's the point! This is an  incredible soundtrack! Something I cannot believe myself! When you watch  any Kitano movie you expect simple, but deep and spiritual, things. And the  sound that surrounds his movies is, as you might also expect, simple, but  beatiful. Incredible. If you are looking for some complicated ideas, buy  other CD, but if you want something Beautiful, yet very simple, don't think  it anymore, your chance is here. Again, Kitano, again the Master.
