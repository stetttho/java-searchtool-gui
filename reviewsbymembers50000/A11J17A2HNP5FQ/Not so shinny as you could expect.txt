 I love Carlos Gardel Movies and Music. I do love Cuesta Abajo (in fact one of Carlitos' best movies).  What I don't like is this DVD edition. I mean, not that it's bad, or anything, but I have a VHS edition and I thought that this one would have a lot more remastering, and so, but, no. Nothing new.  So, if you already have the movie, don't even think in buying this one, fi you don't... well, go ahead, it's a great movie to watch..
