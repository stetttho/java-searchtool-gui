 I liked ALL Richard Kern books, and since, people liking Kern recommend me this one, I decied to take a look. To my sourprise, this book is not that bad (I put 4 * to it) but, it's not comparable (IMHO) to Richard Kern Works. It hasn't that "je-ne-se-qui" that all Kern books have. I don't know how to explain it better, but, perhaps, you'll like this album, but in my case, comming from Kern, I found it a little "poor"...
