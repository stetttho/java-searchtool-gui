 I love this CD. Period. It's not just "trippie" but it's a lot more than that. It has atmospheres that will transport you to soundscapes you maight never been before. Evenmore, each track will transport you to another different soundscape each time you listen to them. Safe From Harm and Be Thankfull For What You've Got (my two favs) are some of the best tracks I've ever heard! If you are a Massive Attack lover, you'll love this album, if not, you'll start loving Massive Attack.
