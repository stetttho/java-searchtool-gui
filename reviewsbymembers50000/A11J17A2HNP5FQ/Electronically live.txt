 When I first heard Moodswings I wondered how would they sounded "live", but I then dismissed it since "live" is something that not often occurs with electronic artist. When I first saw Live at Leeds I guessed it was something promotional, having nothing to do with Moodswings, but, when I listen to it, especially to Spiritual High, I started to believe that, if something electronic was going to be live, I defenitelly has to be Moodswings. I cannot express into words the feeling of listening to this beatuful song by Jon Anderson and Vangelis played so wonderful by Moodswings. If you like the band, buy it, it will re-affirm all you feel about them, and if you do not listened to them yet, this CD could be a good start, don't you think? [It's wonderful, specially when listening into the car in a long route to the south a rainy day]
