 The first thing I thought when watching the album was how hard it is to diference Art [Erotism] from Pornography. And if there's such a dividing line, it might be even impossible to determine, but when I finished the  book, I get satisficed. I feel like the book was not just another nonsense  photobook, but a true work of art. This book gathers all the pictures from  the side of the line where the Erotism resides. Nice job by Rob Stuart.
