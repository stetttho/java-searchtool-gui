 An excellent, extremely readable book that traces the history of the Super Casino phenomenom.  The details on the financing of these behemoths had the potential to be dry, but Early kept it alive and moving (a remarkable  talent).  The vignettes by "Vegas People" were fascinating  reading and the details concerning Circus Circus Corp and the development  of the Luxor were intriguing.  Thanks to Early and the co-operation of the  Circus Circus group (now Mandalay properties) we are treated to the  behind-the-scenes of how Las Vegas has become, once again, America's  playground (but please leave the kids at home).  Oh yeah, thanks to Early  I'll never drop another "dime" on a roulette table.  One of the  best Vegas books to come along in years.
