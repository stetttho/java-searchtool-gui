 Guidebooks are a particular fascination of mine.  Where to go, what to see, and how to get there, all form the basis of many a road trip.  Desert Dancing, a new book devoted to the California desert country, goes beyond  being a simple A to B guidebook.	 	Len Wilcox has put together a  volume of information that takes you along as he explores the region.  In a  friendly, and enjoyable manner Len writes of his personal adventures  off-roading in the rugged reaches of the Mojave and Colorado Deserts, as  well as Death Valley.  It is obvious Len is one of the new generation of  Rainbow Chasers - those who ventured West in search of gold.  However, it  is not the gold of the 49'ers Len is seeking, it is the gold that lies in  the history of the people and places of the Desert lands. 	Subtitled,  Exploring the Land, the People, the Legends of the California Deserts,  Desert Dancing introduces not just the wonders of the desert, but some of  the people who make the small towns and wide spots more interesting than  any city in the world.	  	Desert Dancing reads like the journal of  a friend, who, in a highly readable style, shares with you a wonderful  trip.  Excellent research, combined with an in-person familiarity of the  subject at hand, makes this a necessary volume for anyone considering a  trip into the desert, or for the armchair explorer who wants to gain a  sense of what the desert is all about.
