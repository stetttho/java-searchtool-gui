 A book devoted to the tourist traps and amusement parks of Route 66 should be a fun read, one that makes you want to visit the site and buy a petrified cow-pie or a rattlesnake rattle encased in Lucite.  But Route 66  - The Empires of Amusement is so full of convoluted sentences and odd words  that you feel as if you are trapped in a Fun House constructed by Roget.  	 Route 66 stretches from Lake Michigan to the Pacific Ocean, however for  some curious reason Route 66 - The Empires of Amusement stops in Amarillo,  Texas.  Research errors that are a burr under the T-shirt of any  experienced Roadie compound the problems, i.e. the Big Boy hamburger did  not come to life on Route 66, but first hit the grill in Glendale,  California; and Buz, that erstwhile traveler of the Mother Road with his  faithful companion Tod, has always spelled his name with a single "z."  Affectation?  Possibly.  But it is his name, after all. 	Old family  photos, advertising literature and modern snapshots add to the book, but in  a manner that is more melancholy than upbeat, and a few of the photos beg  the question, "Why am I here?"  	What should have been a book  celebrating the world of the odd and unusual along Route 66 became almost  as sad as the remains of the Longhorn Ranch, a famous tourist trap in New  Mexico; but then we'll never know, because Route 66 - The Empires of  Amusement didn't take us that far.
