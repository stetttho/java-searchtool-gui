 An excellent book, well researched and enough photos to keep you looking for hours.  Each section of the book is highly comprehensive and detailed.  The Peacemaker was a beast and as such deserves a beast of a book to tell  its story. Definitely not a coffee-table book, this one is for the person  who is truly into the subject.
