 This is the most comprehensive book on field investigation I have ever seen.  Covers death scene evidence gathering in a manner that insures every detail is observed and that a strong chain of evidence is developed (hope  the LAPD has a bunch of these!).  As a writer this one is now tops on my  list for research involving murder, both for the intrepid police  investigator and for the perp to get away with the crime.  Excellent book -  can't say much more than that.
