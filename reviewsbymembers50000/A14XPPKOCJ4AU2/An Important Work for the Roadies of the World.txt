 As icons of the Mother Road disappear - most in the name of progress - there is always much wringing of hands and crying about preservation.  The reality of preservation is the cost - something most preservationists are  not aware of.  Shellee Graham could see the future of the Coral Court and  set to work in 1993 to preserve this icon on film - then over the years  interviewed dozens of people about this world famous icon of Route 66.  The  culmination of her efforts are presented in Tales from the Coral Court... .   Each story and photograph bring this famous "no-tell, motel"  back to life.  Shellee has answered the questions about those infamous  garages, hourly rates, and why this landmark was lost to progress.  This is  the most important Route 66 book to have come out in the past few years and  is THE Route 66 book of the year 2000.  Thank you Shellee for giving us the  definitive book on one of the most memorable locations on Route 66.
