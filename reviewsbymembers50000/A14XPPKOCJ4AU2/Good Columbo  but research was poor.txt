 Have enjoyed all of the Harrington Columbo's.  Great for plane trips or even motel nights while on a Road Trip.  This one pleased as always, but I found the shoddy research bothersome.  No one in Southern California heats  their home with oil and to find a block of up-scale private homes on West  Santa Monica Boulevard (let alone be able to close the street because of a  bomb) is really a stretch.  Outside of that enjoyed the book and the  references to previous Columbo books.  Hope the series continues (with  tighter research).
