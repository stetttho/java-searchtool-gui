 I just loved this book!  I identified with the main character right away, I saw where she was coming from and I like how she knows exactly who she is and what she's capable of.  I was so enthralled with this book that I wish it were longer so I wouldn't have finished it so quickly but if it had been longer it might have seemed draggy.    I'm so glad that the author is doing a sequel.  I really want to see what Mercy does next and how it's going to affect her relationships with her friends and her love interests (Hopefully the author keeps it to 2 and doesn't wander off into LKH territory)
