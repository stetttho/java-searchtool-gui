 I am not a huge VC Andrews fan.  I wouldn't even go so far as to say I am even a fan.   But I find I can't stop reading the books.  I have to see what's going to happen next, even though I know what's going to happen next since the story NEVER changes.  So I entered into Celeste thinking, maybe, this time things will be different.  Of course not.  There are changes, but nothing major.  There's still the same constants: the father is a kindly man who loves his family and dies, the mother is a nutjob, the young, beautiful, talented, and special daughter wants her mother to love her, and the family is torn apart by tragedy after tragedy.    I liked the idea of twins.  I liked the idea in the Landry series.  But I had hoped that the twin brother would last longer.  But no, that would be too different and then nothing would happen.  But the brother is the favoured child and is not insanely jealous of his sister.  Nor, does he want to begin an incestuous relationship with her.  So, that's different.  The young boy that is supposed to be the special, one true love of Celeste isn't all that great.    It's not a bad book, but it seems to me that the author spends a great deal of time rehashing the same issues over and over again.  I don't mean issues from the other books (I expect that) but the same issues from teh same book.  Celeste wants her mother to love her and so goes along with her crazy schemes.  Celeste keeps wanting her mother's love and isn't getting it.  Over and over, Celeste has the same conversation in her head, "If only mother would see me as a girl who can see spirits, then she would love me." This gets a little dull.    It's a typical VC Andrews style book.  You know the storyline, you know most of the characters, but you can't help but read the series.  It's like the road home.  You know the way very well, and you know the destination very well.  And if someone changed any of it, you feel very much put out.
