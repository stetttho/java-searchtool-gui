 I bought this book after reading the reviews of other readers.  I had low expectations going into it, seeing that quite a few people didn't think highly of this book.  I had hoped to be surprised but the book didn't even meet my low standards.  It was like the author had 6 ideas for a scene and then, instead of picking one, she told all six!  This makes for a VERY repetitive read.  Yes, Erik loved Christine, Christine loved Erik, Christine was in torment, she was in pain, she and Erik had given each other their souls!  Yes I got that the first 20 times.  But to repeat the same phrases on EVERY SECOND PAGE?  WAYYYYYY too redundant.  So I was dissapointed.  It was a decent idea, just told poorly.  If you want to read a REALLY good PTO book, get Susan Kay's Phantom.  It was told much better and the characters were more likeable.
