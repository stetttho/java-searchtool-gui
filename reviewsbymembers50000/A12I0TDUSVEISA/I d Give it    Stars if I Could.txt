 I first read this book when I was 13 and have read it about 30 times in the last 13 years.  Obviously, I love this book.  I wish the book were longer so there was more to read.    Ms Kay truly understood the entire story behind Gaston Leroux's novel and she made the characters her own.  I understand everyone's motivations.  I like the characters because of their faults, or maybe in spite of them.  The characters are deep and interesting; the plot is clear and involved without being confusing.  It's a simple story, yet a complex one.  There wasn't one part of this book that I didn't absolutely love.    I wish the ending could've been "happier", but if it had any other ending, I don't think I would have been as satisfied.  It's a beautiful story told by a masterful storyteller.
