 I really like this movie.  It's one of the better movie adaptations of the Phantom (at least until we see the musical this December *crosses fingers*), however, it is a shame that it didn't stick to the original story.  I did like it on its own.  If you didn't know much about the story, then you would probably really enjoy the movie.  If you have read the story, and countless retellings of it, you may be dissapointed.    Raoul has a completely different name and he's the one who sent Christine to the Paris Opera house for singing lessons.  She was NEVER a dancer in this movie.  The old manager knew about Erik and kept him hidden in the Opera house rather than trying to hunt him down.  Carlotta is vain and foolish (which is a lot of fun) and is probably the closest to true character.  The Persian is nowhere to be found, although you could argue that the character of the Persian is grafted onto the old manager.  All in all, I do enjoy this movie.  The humor quotient is refreshing, the plot is plausible (sometimes a little shakey), and the characters are likeable.  And Erik actually acts like someone who has no human contact, he is a bit socially inept.    If you are a diehard of the original, you will be dissapointed.  If you can step outside of the original's shadow, then you might enjoy this movie for what it is: a take on a classic story, told for modern audiences.
