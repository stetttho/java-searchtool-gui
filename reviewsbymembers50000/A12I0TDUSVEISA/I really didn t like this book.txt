 I read this book in my 11th grade English class.  And I hated every moment.  It was the first book that a teacher had given me to read that I hated.    I didn't like the main character.  I thought him an idiot.  I didn't like the supporting characters.  I didn't like the plot.  I didn't like anything.  Maybe it was the fact that there were no female characters and I had a hard time relating to young men in this situation.    It's been a few years since high school and I've had people tell me to try to read it again.  See if age has changed my views.  I tried, got 30 pages into it and threw it down.  I have such a strong reaction to this book, that I couldn't even give it a second chance.  I realize this is supposed to be a big literary achievement but I hated this book.  But at least I can't say I didn't react to it.
