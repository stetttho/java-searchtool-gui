 I'm relatively new to comic books.  I've only been reading them for the past 10 years so I missed out on a lot of "golden" era of comics.  It's interesting to see how far comics have come in storytelling from the 60's (when Mr. Fantastic married the Invisible Woman).  The stories seemed so one-dimensional (good guys vs bad guys with women waiting for a man to save them).  They are a little bit laughable but interesting at the same time.  We get to read the wedding stories of more than just what the back of the TPB says.  We see Reed and Sue from the Fantastic Four, Wasp and Yellowjacket from the Avengers, Quicksilver and Crystal from the Avengers, Betty Ross and Bruce Banner from the Hulk, Mary Jane Watson and Spiderman, and Scott Summers and Jean Grey from the X-Men.  I think the X-Men story was the best wedding story (but then again, I'm partial to the X-Men so maybe I'm biased).
