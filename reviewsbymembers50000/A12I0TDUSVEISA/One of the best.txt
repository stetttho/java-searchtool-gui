 I fell in love with this story when I accidentally caught the old movie version on tv one night.  I bought the book and fell in love with the story all over again.  Ms Du Maurier created some wonderfully vivid characters.  The coldly distant Maxim, the lurking Mrs. Danvers, the timid Mrs. DeWinter (I LOVE that we never know her first name), and the ethereral Rebecca who starts off as a tragic figure and then....well read the book.  The description of the house and the grounds and the boathouse were incredible.  I felt like I was walking the same corridors as Mrs DeWinter.  Felt her apprehension as she realized she could never live up to Rebecca and I will always get a chill when I think of Mrs. Danvers.  She is right up there with Hannibal Lector in terms of creepiness, in my opinion.  Rebecca is a great piece of literary fiction.  So creepy, so chilling, so incredibly brilliant.
