 I LOVE Laurell K. Hamilton.  I loved the Anita Blake books.  I fell in  love with the tough women she wrote about.  But her last 3 books (Seduced by Moonlight, Cerulean Sins, & Narcissus in Chains) left a lot to be desired.  Her books used to have snappy dialogue, thrilling mysteries, and interesting characters.  Now, she's relegated all that to the backburner as she gives each chapter a new sex scene.  The first 150 pages of this book were sex scene after sex scene.  I don't mind a little bit of sex, but what she's writing it might as well be a Harlequin  Romance.  I was looking for a mystery book with some supernatural overtones...not erotica.  They have a section for that at the bookstore.  This book was just starting to get interesting in the last 150 or so pages and then she just ends it.  No explanation.  I felt cheated.  There's FINALLY a story, and she ends it.  If Ms. Hamilton is running out of ideas, maybe she should stop now.  Any hack can write sex scenes.  If you don't believe me, go rent a porn movie.  They have lots of movies there with no story.  I'm not giving up on Ms. Hamilton.  I just hope she goes back to what made me love her books in the first place.  So...if you're looking for stupid sex scenes...try this book.  Looking for something with substance?  Try any of her early Anita Blake books.
