 I love reading anthologies because, occasionally, I discover a new author.  If it weren't for Out of This World, I never would have discovered J.D. Robb.  The first story was Kim Harrison's.  Right off the bat I was dissapointed that it was an Ivy tale.  I'm not a fan of Ivy, but I gave the story a chance in case it converted me.  Nope.  I still don't like Ivy.  I still don't understand her and if giving Ivy her own story won't convert me, then I doubt I'll ever truly like her.    The second story by Lynsay Sands was boring and predictable.  I couldn't even find it funny and the ending was so HOKEY.  And the sex scene?  Come on!  I'm sure the author could've done better than that! (I'd explain but I'd ruin the story for smoeone who hasn't read it yet)  The third story was my favorite.  Kelly Armstrong definately knows how to write a short story.  The characters were interesting and didn't have the bulky emotional issues that have to be resolved in 100 pages thereby making the story feel rushed.  This story is why I rate the book so high.  I sincerely hope Hope (no pun intended) gets her own full length book.  The fourth story I ended up liking more than I thought I would.  Lori Handeland's characters caught my attention and, although I thought them a little slow for solving the problem, I started to care about them.    I didn't discover a new author with this anthology but I wasn't as disspointed with this book as I was with Bump in the Night.
