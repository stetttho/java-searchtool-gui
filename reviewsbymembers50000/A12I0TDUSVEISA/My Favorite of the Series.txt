 This was my favorite (so far, we'll see what #6 is like) of the Harry Potter series.    Harry is coming of age and starting to get caught in that horrible world between being an adult and being a child.  Ron and Hermione are there and are going along for the ride.    The part I like best about this series, is that these are real kids.  They act like it.  They're not perfect, they screw up, and they are fiercely loyal to each other.    The plot is like most of Ms. Rowlings works.  Lots of twists and turns and surprises.  Plus a few things are explained that I had wondered about and a few things that I hadn't caught on to.  I have  never read an author who could reach all levels of readers.  Whether you are 4 years old, 25 years old or 72 years old, you will enjoy this book.
