 I, like many others, bought this book for the J.D. Robb story.  The story was OK.  Paranormal happenings just don't seem to work in the Eve Dallas universe, but this story was much, MUCH better than the remaining 3.  Poppy's Coin was an alright story.  I like history stories like this.  So I didn't mind this particular one (although the paranormal aspects were a bit of a stretch).  The Passenger was contrived, predictable, and boring.  The characters were not engaging, the plot was laughable, and I just didn't care what happened in the end.  Mellow Lemon Yellow was by far the worst story I've ever read.  I skimmed through most of the story because I kept rolling my eyes at every other sentence.  I just thought this story was too ridiculous.  I couldn't even find humour in it.  Just a complete waste of time.  (I, too, found the similarities to Drop Dead Fred. Except Drop Dead Fred had one or two moments of fun, this one had NONE).  I can't express how much I absolutely HATED this story.  Buy the book for the J.D. Robb story, or wait until she publishes her story on its own.  The other three authors did not make me want to rush out and buy any more of their books.
