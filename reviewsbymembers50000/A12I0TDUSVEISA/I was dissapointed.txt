 I love the character of Spike and I was really excited that he was getting a solo story.  However, this book is a almost a complete rehash of stories from Buffy.  There are a couple of new scenes, but they aren't that interesting.  It feels completely redundant. I was hoping for something new. I realize the author was limited in what she could do, she can't tell us what happened after Angel since the only one who can do that is Joss.  (Hopefully the Spike movie get greenlighted)  I never expected the book to answer those questions, but I thought it might give us a solo adventure during the years he was gone, or maybe a story that takes place during season 6 or 7.  Not this one that jumps around between storylines that were written by other people in the Buffy series.  I don't think this book is worth the money they're asking.  But it second hand, or maybe you want to support the idea of a Spike movie.  Amazon is selling a Spike DVD with popular Spike centered Buffy eps...maybe this is a way of finding out how popular the character is before going through with the movie.  If that IS the case...buy up!
