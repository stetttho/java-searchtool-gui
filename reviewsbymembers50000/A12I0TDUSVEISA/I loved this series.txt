 I read this series when I was 12.  And I loved it!  I loved the characters, I loved the story, I loved the romance.  I read it over and over as a teenager and even picked it up again recently.  I start to see the flaws in the storyline, now that I'm older but I quickly  push those thoughts to the back of my mind.  I don't want to see them.  It's a favorite book (and series) from my childhood.  I don't want to see this book as anything but perfect.  This story instroduced me to the world of science fiction and fantasy and a slew of other types of books that are still with me and I continue to read.    The best thing about this book is that the female lead is brave, bold, knows what she wants and isn't afraid to go after it.  So few books (even now, over 10 years later) don't have many strong women who can take care of themselves.  Elena doesn't just swoon and wait for a man to take care of her.  She takes care of them (okay, so sometimes she needs help too) but she is a lot more real than some characters.  Mainly because she isn't always the "nicest".
