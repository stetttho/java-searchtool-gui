 At the end of Stolen, I decided I didn't like the character of Paige (the witch).  I thought Cass (the vampire) was much more interesting.  So when I found out that the 3rd book was about Paige...I was dreading the next book.  Paige struck me as whiney and weak in Stolen.  But Dime Store Magic really brought Paige into her own.  She came out strong, smart, and independent.  I think I liked this book more than the previous two.  And since the 4th book is about Paige as well....I'm counting down the days....
