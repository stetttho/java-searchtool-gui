 I loved this book.  But I love Edward so I enjoyed the little excursion into his life and seeing what he actually does when he's not out killing the monsters.    I know some people don't like this book because JC and Richard are barely in it.  They are talked about a little bit and JC makes a cameo appearance but they aren't in this book.  And it didn't bother me.  I was too busy enjoying Edward.    I've always liked Edward and he has always fascinated me.  So this was a big treat for me.  I liked how Ms. Hamilton explored the very platonic (and very satisfying) relationship between Edward and Anita.  It's closer to a brother/sister thing than a buddy thing.  I loved Edward's theory that he and Anita are soul mates.  It made a great deal of sense to me and I was just grateful that Edward was not joining the legions of men who want to be with Anita.  I like the fact that there is one man out there that doesn't want a sexual relationship with her.    I also enjoyed the storyline and I liked seeing how the power structure for vampires and werewolves interact in a different city.  But mostly, I enjoyed the character development of Edward and Anita and their relationship.    If you like Edward and want to see his home life (trust me, it's an eye opener) then you'll definitely like this book.  If you want more interaction between Anita and the numerous men in her life, you may want to pass this one over.    But, honestly, I think you'd be foolish if you did.
