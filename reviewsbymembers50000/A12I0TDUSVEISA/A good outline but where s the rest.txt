 The Undead series is a guilty pleasure for me.  I don't count the days until the next one but I enjoy the series all the same.  This book's storyline just felt thin.  Like this was the rough outline for the book and the author was pressed to finish it by deadline and decided to just publish the outline.  A lot of interesting plot points were raised but nothing was done with them.    Betsy's sister is the devil's daughter.  Betsy finds out about the sister and then FINDS the missing sister in about 10 pages.  Then in 2 pages we're told that she's the good guy.  Huh?  No sneaking around, no misdirection, no mystery.  The whole point of the book was the "devil's daughter" plot and it was summed up in a total of 15 pages (give or take).  And that basically sums up all the othe plot points raised.  Mention it, deal with it in 10 pages, the end.    I don't expect the book to be THAT good, but it kind of let me down as my favorite guilty pleasure.  I'm really glad I waited for the paperback version.
