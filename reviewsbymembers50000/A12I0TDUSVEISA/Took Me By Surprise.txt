 I hadn't expected this book to be any good.  I thought it was brainless fluff and picked it up because I was desperate for something to read.    I was surprised.  It's not the greatest book I've ever read and it doesn't require a lot of brain power but....you do end up liking the main character.  She is flakey and the whole idea of her being Queen of the Vampires is laughable but the characters in the book thought it was funny too.  So, it's a kind of tongue-in-cheek humour.  The characters are likeable, the plot is decent, and it doesn't try to be too serious (which it isn't).    If you're looking for something light and fluffy and mildly entertaining, give this book a shot.  You might be surprised.
