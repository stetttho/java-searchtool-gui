 I liked this book.  But I liked it more for the character developement than the murder mystery.  I liked hearing about another chapter of Eve's past (although would it kill Ms. Robb to give Eve ONE happy memory in her childhood?  It wouldn't make Eve any less cynical if she just had one shining moment), but the murder mystery was just dull.  So painfully obvious who the killer was.    I found the same problem with the last book.  The killer's identity is getting more obvious with every book.  The character development made up for the lack of surprise at revelation of the killer's identity.  I'm still looking forward to the next book, I just hope the murder mystery has more "oomph" to it.
