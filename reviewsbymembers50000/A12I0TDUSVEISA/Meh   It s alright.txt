 The main beef other reviewers had with his book is that it didn't focus enough on the romantic relationship between the main characters.  In my opinion the minimalist approach on the romance subplot was the best thing going for this book.  I REALLY dislike science fiction/fantasy books that have 90% of the book talking about the romantic relationship and 10% about the actual plot.  If I wanted romance I'd read Harlequin, and since this book is in the SciFi/Fantasy section, I expect to get something along the lines of Sci/Fi Fantasy.  My real problem with this book, is the writing style.  The author tends to start at the end of a scene and work backwards.  Once or twice I didn't mind, but for EVERY SINGLE SCENE?!  That's a little much.  BAsically, in one chapter Wren would be trying to figure out what's going on and then in the next scene she's taking a course of action and while she's on this course she's leaving snippets of information on how she came to this conclusion.  I'm not explaining it very well, but it made the story choppy and slow.  I just found it made the story go 1 step forward and then 2 steps back.  The storyline was interesting, magic security block is stolen and it turns out that there is much more to this stone than Wren originally thought.  Which is cool.  I wish I could've learned a little more about what made Wren tick.  I didn't feel like I truly got to know her in this book.  I found Sergei a lot more interesting and I'm curious to see how his past will affect his new, "upstanding" life.  But I don't know if I'm curious enough to buy the next book.
