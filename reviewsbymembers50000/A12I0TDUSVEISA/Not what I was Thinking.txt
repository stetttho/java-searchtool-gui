 I will admit I bought this book because I had seen the movie.  (I know, I know, not a great way to pick up a book).  But I had enjoyed most of the movie and decided to compare the movie to the book.  I shouldn't have been surprised when the book and movie were completely different.  The only real similarities was the haunted house and the characters names.    I did enjoy the book, but I was a little dissapointed.  I was expecting more.  It felt like there was something missing from the book.  Or maybe I was missing the whole point.  Either way, I was dissatisfied with the ending.    It's a good book, but it could have been better.
