 This is the 21st book of the In Death series.  Maybe I've become a little jaded on the storylines, but I thought this book was about 140 pages too long.  I found the first half of the book incredibly draggy.  It seemed to take Eve and her team an extremely long time to figure out what was going on.  I lot of "How could anyone be this perfect?" and "I just don't believe anyone is this perfect." and a lot of reinterviews.  I was getting very frustrated in the lack of progression.  I had it figured out after the prologue (and I'm sure most other readers did as well).  Why give away the big surprise at the beginning when you know the characters won't be able to figure it out for awhile.  Although it seemed that Eve took even longer than normal.  The second half of the book picked up.  Of course once Eve knew what was going on, she could do more interesting things.  I have to admit I was very dissapointed when we didn't get more interaction with Roarke's family.  I had been looking forward to the Thanksgiving dinner from the moment it was mentioned early in the book, and then...we only get a couple of pages.  That would have been great character development for Eve and Roarke but instead we got a few pages and that's it.    Maybe it's time to let Eve and Roarke go off into the sunset.  Or maybe Ms. Robb/Roberts needs to find another angle for a murder mystery.  The ones over the last few books are getting a little dull.
