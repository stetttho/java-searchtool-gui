 This book is by the world's whisk(e)y expert and it shows.  Unlike many books on whisk(e)y that limit themselves to Scotch and maybe Irish, this book also includes extensive sections on Bourbon, Tennessee Whisk(e)y and Canadian.  Mr. Murray does not categorically state that Scotch is better than Bourbon or vice versa.  He understands that each has their own particular qualities.   Mr. Murray has visited all of the North American distilleries as well as the Irish and Scotch distilleries and he describes them all.  He gives one a feel for each distillery. He also offers some of his suggestions for the best whisk(e)y of each type.  This is truly an outstanding guidebook to the whisk(e)y industry and its products. One Note:  The text in this book is essentially the same as his The Complete Guide to Whiskey : A Guide to the Worlds Best Scotch Malts, Irish Whiskeys, and Bourbons (Pocket Guide Series).  Admittedly this is a much prettier book though.  Enjoy
