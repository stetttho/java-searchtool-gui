 This is an outstanding multitool but unlike most multitools, it is actually a pocket tool similiar in size to a swiss army knife.  It is a little smaller than most multitools.  (I own seven full size multitools and three key chain tools.)  It does not come with a sheath though Leatherman told me that a nylon Crunch sheath will work for this largest model of the Juice. This tool has as many tools as you will get on a multitool.  Realize that everything is smaller.  If you want a larger multitool get a Leatherman Wave or a Gerber Legend.  If you want a compact tool this is the best way to go
