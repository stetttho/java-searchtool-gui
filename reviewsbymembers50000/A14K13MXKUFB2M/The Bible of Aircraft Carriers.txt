 This book has every aircraft carrier built and most if not all of them planned up to its publication.  It includes all US escort carriers and other carriers converted from merchant ships.  The book goes to the mid 1980's so it does not include the very latest carriers such as the new French and other carriers but it includes everything up to then, such as the US Nimitz class.  The new Russian carrier is missing also.  It has all but the last half dozen carriers.  If you are looking for an encyclopedia of aircraft carriers through the 20th century then look no further
