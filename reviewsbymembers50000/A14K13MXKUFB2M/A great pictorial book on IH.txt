 This book combines some beautiful pictures of IH tractors up to some of the last prototype models.  While many books only cover the older IH tractors, this book covers IH tractors to the end of the independent company in 1985.  There is also interesting text on the background of some of the business decisions that the corporation made.  These cover some of the decisions that caused the company to fail.  Don't expect a comprehensive history though.  If you are looking for something that discusses some of the last model IH tractors including beautiful pictures of a privately owned copy of the final prototype four-wheel drive tractor then give this book a try.
