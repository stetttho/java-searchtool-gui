 This movie resorts to making the British worse than they were to hype its excitement for the audience.  The American Revolution was more of a civil war in the South than most people realize.  By watching this one might get the idea that it was just Americans against British.  Americans fought each other also.  The battles scenes represent no one battle nor were the British as bad as shown or the Americans as good as shown.   If you just want mindless entertainment than it is good.  Just don't confuse it with real events.
