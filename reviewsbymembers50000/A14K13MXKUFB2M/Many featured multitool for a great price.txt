 I own seven large multitools, a Shrade Tough Tool, a Leatherman Wave and Juice XE6, a Gerber Legend and custom 600, a SOG Powerlock and a Bucktool. I have probably looked at or reviewed most of the other tools and I have have to say that the Shrade has some great features at a great price.  Unlike many of the other multitools the Shrade allows one to access most of the tools without opening it. Most multitools require one to unfold the multitool to get to the various tools. The Shrade offers about the most different tools. It includes a scraping blade and an awl. It includes lockable screwdrivers of both types and a saw and knife that lock. It also has many other tools and a large pliers. It feels great in your hand and it does not hurt your hand when squeezing tight on the pliers unlike traditional Leathermans. The disadvantages are that it does not have as many flat screwdriver blades as many other multitools and unlike my Gerbers and Bucktool all tools do not lock.  Still after balancing everything, the Shrade has some great features at a great price.
