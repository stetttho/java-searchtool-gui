 This is an excellent book on American whiskey which is the only spirit developed in the U.S.  It demonstrates how the history of the United States is tied with the history of its whiskey.  The author makes a case for the fact that the loss of grain purchases to produce alcohol greatly hurt the economy before the Great Depression as did the loss of jobs in the distilling industry.  The loss of alcohol tax revenues hurt the government.  Whiskey then was an important part of American history.  The book also describes the distilling and aging process.  It covers all of the major American distillers and their whiskeys.  The anecdotes about the people who craft the whiskeys really give you an inside view of the industry.  Most whiskeys have tasting notes and it concludes with a selection of recipes and the method for conducting a tasting.  This book is my guidebook to explore our only native spirit.
