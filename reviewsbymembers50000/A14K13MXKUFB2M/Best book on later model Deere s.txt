 This is a great book on late model John Deere equipment from around the world.  It is filled with color photos.  It describes equipment chronologically and by type.  Not only does it discuss agricultural equipment but it covers construction and lawn and garden equipment.  There are charts on equipment statistics and it has a large section on the "New Generation of Power".  If you are interested in later model Deeres, then I highly recommend this book.
