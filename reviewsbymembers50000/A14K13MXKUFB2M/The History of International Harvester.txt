 This book is an excellent history on IH.  It is the best one that I have seen.  Unlike many books on tractors, this does not stop in about 1960 but covers IH to the end of the independent company in 1985.  It goes to the latest prototypes that were never produced.  It has detailed history of the corporate decisions of IH.  There are many color pictures also. This is truly the definitive history of IH.
