 I own six multitools (also custom Gerber 600, SOG Powerlock, a Bucktool, a Shrade Tough Tool and a Leatherman Wave) and I have to say that the Legend is the best one I own. The Legend has many good points.  All of the tools lock and can be opened without opening the entire tool except for, of course, the pliers and wire cutters.  The replaceable wire cutters are the best ones going. I have had wirecutters fail.  On the Legend you just replace them. The handles are the most comfortable out there.  They are the only spring loaded handles I have found.  I especially like how the knife blade and Fiskars scissors have tabs to easily open them.  The scissors cut better than any other.  The short cutting area is made up by the superior cutting ability.  I have cut plastic coated wire with no problem. The only disadvantage is there is no traditional can opener, just a bottle opener.  I have large hands so the size is no problem for me but it may be for some. The Legend is the most expensive multitool I own but it is not much more than many others and it is worth the extra money.
