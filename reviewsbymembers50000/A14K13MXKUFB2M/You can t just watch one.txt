 The scream trilogy is an actual trilogy.  There a story that runs through all three movies.  These movies have humor, catchy lines and great characters.  I usually don't bother with horror but after I saw the first Scream, I liked it.  I like it even better that there is a story that runs through each of them.  You have to watch them all in order.  The Scream series also take some pokes at horror films in general with its tongue in approach.  Finally not all of the characters are unbelievably stupid.  You can't watch just one.  You have to watch them all.  Those are the rules.
