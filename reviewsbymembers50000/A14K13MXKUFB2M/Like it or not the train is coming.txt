 The globalization described in this book is a new phenomenon.  Never in history has information been so quickly available.   Countries that do not make themselves competitive can expect to see their income drop.  Outside  individuals and companies will not want to invest in countries that are not  competitive.  Witness the growth in Irish business and the drop in French  business.  Why should  other nations buy more expensive products?    Globalization is not all good but countries will have to work with it as  well as they can.  Other economic systems such as socialism will not be  able to create wealth at such a rate. People themselves must learn new  skills to adapt to this economy.  The well paying, unskilled  jobs will not  exist in the future. Friedman uses many analogies and even fictional  dialogues to make this process easy to understand. Now we must prepare  ourselves for it.
