 This book covers the myriad of areas of Information Warfare.  Mr. Adams goes into detail on the perception management areas of IW as well as the more expected computer areas.  He covers much material and sometimes he jumps around but I appreciate the wide-ranging discussions.  He even covers the Russian view of IW as well as Chinese operations.  He reviews the defensive IW element of counterintelligence and includes economic espionage.  He also talks about the morality and legality of the use of IW.  He is not afraid to offer his personal opinions in this book.  Overall a detailed treatment of IW while still being entertaining.
