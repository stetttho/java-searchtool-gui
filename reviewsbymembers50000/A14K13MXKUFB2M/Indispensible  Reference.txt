 As a historian and army officer this is the first book I turn to when I want to know about a campaign or battle.  After that I can look elsewhere for more information.  This book has outstanding information on non-western battles and campaigns.  It also rates the greatest leaders in each historical period.  While one may not always agree with the authors,  they are willing to take a stand and offer their evaluations.
