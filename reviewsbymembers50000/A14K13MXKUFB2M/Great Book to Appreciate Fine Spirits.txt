 This book is a great book to learn the lore of the different classes of spirits.  Mr. Jeffers covers all of the spirits in the title and also has chapters on Rum, Gin, Tequila, Vodka and Liqueurs.  This book really helped me understand the differences between the spirits and gave me an appreciation for spirits other than Whisk(e)y and Rum.  Mr. Jeffers recommends what a well stocked bar should have.  He also offers ratings of many brands of spirits in each classes.  His ratings are limited to three levels, though. In the section on liqueurs, he discusses the great varieties of them and explains many of the differences.  He explains that Cognac and Armagnac are Brandies distilled in specific regions of France.  This book also has some color pictures of the different spirits and their advertising.  An excellent book for someone who wants to appreciate fine spirits.
