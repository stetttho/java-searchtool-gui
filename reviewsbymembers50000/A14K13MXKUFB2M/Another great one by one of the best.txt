 Terry Brooks writes another great book to show why he is one of the best fantasy writers.  I really enjoyed this book and read it in one (long) day.  In this book Brooks takes you inside the mind of a Druid.  You understand that while you and Walker the Druid don't like his using people, he must.  You get the feelings of someone who is compelled to use others and yet abhores it at the same time.  Fortunately, Brooks develops his characters without overdoing it as some do. As in many fantasies, these are unlikely heros that must do more than they believe they can.  They are average people just as us.  Some of the characters live under the misperceptions of who they are just as many people.  We learn the lessons of honesty, love of companions and courage all without being preached to or knowing it. The voyage harkens back to C.S. Lewis's Voyage of the Dawn Treader or even probably farther back to Jason and the Argonauts or the Voyages of Sinbad.  As any good fantasy Brooks appeals to the myths of humankind. This book also has one of the neatest covers with a translucent dust jacket.   This is one of his best so step aboard the Jerle Shannara and join the Voyage.
