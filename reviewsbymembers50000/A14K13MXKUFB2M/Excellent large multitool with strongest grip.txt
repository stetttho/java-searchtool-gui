 This is an excellent large multitool.  I own seven of them (Gerber Legend, Leatherman Wave and Juice XE6, custom Gerber 600, Shrade Tough Tool and Bucktool) and this is the largest.   With the compound leverage on this size tool it has outstanding gripping power.  The handle covers make this a great feeling tool with none of the pain one might feel while clamping down on a traditional Leatherman.   All of the tools lock well with the exception that the drive socket and bottle opener can come loose.  This is the only reason I gave this tool four stars and I am not sure that it is not particular to just my tool.  If someone wants a large tool with the best gripping ability than this is the one to get.  This tool also has a great price for the size.
