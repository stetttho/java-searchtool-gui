 It appears as if a flood of the Black Sea region happened.  Robert Ballard, the discoverer of the Titanic, recently found evidence of habitation 300? feet under the Black Sea.   This book provides the interesting story of the theory that a former lake under the Black Sea was flooded by the Mediterranean Sea.  This flood could have provide the basis for the flood mythology in many cultures including the Deluge in the Bible.   While likely, the Deluge will be difficult or impossible to prove without a doubt.  I believe this book is best used from a scientific standpoint and not as proof for a religion.  Yet, many parts of the Bible appear to be supported by recent archaeology. The section of the book that describes a diaspora of the peoples that lived on the shore of the former lake is more difficult to prove.  I read this book in conjunction with the Mummies of Urumchi by E. J. W. Barber, Elizabeth Wayland Barber.  I found them complementary on the subject of the Indo- European language group in Western China.  To ever prove something such as this diaspora requires the combination of linguistics with archaeology among many other disciplines.  While the authors are not experts in those fields, I applaud them for attempting this study.  Science more and more requires a consilience of disciplines.  I recommend this book as a thought provoking book.
