 This book is a very comprehensive pictorial guide to the world's spirits and I understand a labor of love for the late author.  This book has all of the major categories such as Brandy, Whiskey, Rum, Gin, Vodka, Tequila and Liqueurs.  There are beautiful color pictures of the lands in which the spirits are distilled as well as the distilleries.  Many, of the literally hundreds of, liqueurs are broken into their subcategories and covered.  One can truly see that this was a labor of love for the author.  This even makes a beautiful coffee table book while still an encyclopedic guide.
