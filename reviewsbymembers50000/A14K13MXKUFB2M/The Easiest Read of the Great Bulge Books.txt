 This is considered one of the four great books on the Battle of the Bulge.  The others are John Eisenhower's The Bitter Woods, Hugh Cole's official US Army History:  The Ardennes: Battle of the Bulge and Charles B. MacDonald's A Time for Trumpets.   I have read all but Hugh Cole's book and will review each of them.  Of all the books, Toland's is the most approachable for the general reader.  For starters it is about 1/2 to 2/3 the size of either Eisenhower's or MacDonald's book.  While Eisenhower has special emphasis on the senior leadership and MacDonald emphasizes the battle from the most junior soldier's perspective, Toland strikes a good balance between them.    Toland's book was written first in about 1959 and both Eisenhower in 1968 and MacDonald in 1984 cite his book.  Toland is not only a good historian but also an excellent writer.  His book is written to show events in chronological order.  One can read about the events all across the battlefield day by day.    Like all of these books, one must refer to the maps often to keep track of what was happening.  The Bulge was a huge battle.  It has been described as the largest battle American troops fought in based on numbers.  Any of these books will require the reader to keep careful track of the events.  Of all of the great Bulge books, Battle is the easiest with which to do that.  Like all the books except for a Time for Trumpets, Battle does not address the intercepts of the German Enigma communications as regards the German deception operation.  This information was not released until years after the book was written.  Still, Battle gives a good account of the German deception.  Battle also discusses the rivalry between American generals and the British Field Marshal Montgomery.  Battle is the easiest to read of the great books on the Battle of the Bulge.  Toland writes well and his research shows.  He covers the senior leadership to the average solder admirably.
