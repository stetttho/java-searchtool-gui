 This book is an outstanding guidebook by the world's expert on whisk(e)y.  Unlike many whisk(e)y writers, Jim Murray does not just limit himself to Scotch or Irish.  Mr. Murray has been to all of the Canadian, American and Irish distilleries beside Scotch distilleries.  Mr. Murray has an appreciation for fine whiskies of all type.  He does not directly compare Bourbon with Scotch and has an appreciation for each.  Bourbon drinkers rejoice, someone who also appreciates Bourbon.  Mr Murray also gives one a feeling for each distillery. One note:  Do not buy this book if you already own his The World Whiskey Guide as the text is essentially the same.
