 I'm starting to think that Harry Turtledove is beginning to churn them out.  He is writing four series's at the same time and this series doesn't seem as appealing as they used to be.  Even the last book had the new plot twist of the alien colonization fleet with female aliens joining their conquest fleet.  Now it seems old hat.   Also the introduction of famous people in history seems to be lacking more lately.  Sure we hear about the same leaders but they are not as interesting.  Maybe that is because the leaders during WWII seem more compelling than the people after the war.  Kennedy and Krushchev are on the cover but I can't remember them in the book.  If they are, they were not at the same level of leadership.  Neither lead their country in the 1960's. These books really develop average characters but the links to historical figures seem to be getting less.   Not bad just not as good as the past books and without the aliens it would not be worth it.  I will read the next volume to see how it stands.
