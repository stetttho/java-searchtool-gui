 It's high time Tony Shaloub made it big. His role as unhinged-movie-producer-from-hell in the Coen brothers' movie Barton Fink was exhilarating. As was his performance as superlawyer in The Man Who Wasn't There (the Coens certainly know talent when they see it).  The only negative thing that can be said about Monk is that it's long overdue. The writing's good. It's very good actually. But some episodes are better than others. In Monk Meets Dale the Whale, for example, the dialogue is badly dubbed and the continuity is choppy and hiccupy. The storylines are mostly standard TV show plots, some even seem recycled from old episodes of Streets of San Francisco or Scooby Doo. So you shouldn't watch Monk for the ingenious plots - it's Monk's phobia-intensive behaviour and case-solving talent that we're after. Well, that and Sharona's great legs. And the theme tune is great. I sure hope those two get it together at the end; Sharona has appalling taste in men.
