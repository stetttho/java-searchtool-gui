 Curious album, this. Listeners and critics disagree about King Crimson's second offering. Many call it a sub-standard copy of debut, Court of the Crimson King (1969); others, erm, didn't.  There are admittedly quite a lot of similarities between the tw o, both musically and stylistically. In fact each song on Court... has a sort of sibling on In The Wake of Poseidon, though I cant possibly imagine why that should be seen as formulaic music making. For King Crimson beginners, this particular incarnat ion of the group (Lake, McDonald, Giles, Fripp) was no-holds-barred, meat-and-potatoes progressive rock plain and simple: storybook lyrics, pompous orchestrations, classical influences and - just discernible - a smidgen of late 60s psy chadelia. Oh, and a lot of Mellotron. I love it. Most importantly the songwriting is for the most part, spot on. Cat Food and Cadence and Cascade are superb, while the title track is, like its counterpart Court of the Crimson King, a glorious piece of work (they REALLY don't make them like that anymore). It's Side 2 which taxes some listeners' patience to breaking point. An instrumental 5-part epic track the Devil's Triangle is modelled on the theme from Holst's Planets (Mars), and it rocks big-time. A great, dark, brooding drama depicting scenes of a scale limited only by your imagination. And theres quiet, gentle bits, too, to restore sanity and give you the chance to wipe the sweat and froth from your anguished, contorted features.  To sum up, Wake of Poseidon may not have had the commercial impact of its predecessor but its an album with bucketloads of personality and ye-olde-curiosity-shoppe charm. The musics quite good, too..
