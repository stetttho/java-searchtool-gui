 Pomme Fritz is classically the "bete noir" of Orb's back catalogue, having reaped dismal reviews basically everywhere. And admittedly, there is a lot of aimless electronic noodling on 2 tracks. The  trick is this: look at it like an EP with a couple of dodgy  "B-sides" rather than an uneven album. Disregard the 2nd and 3rd  tracks, the rest is far too good to be ignored.
