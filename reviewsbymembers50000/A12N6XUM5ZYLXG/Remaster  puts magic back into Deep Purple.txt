 I got so much enjoyment out of this band when I was a teenager and now (twenty five years later) playing the digital remaster is like hearing Deep Purple for the first time! You can enjoy Ian Paice's brilliant drum-playing like never before (!), Jon Lord's distinctive organ sound is crystal clear, and I can for the first make out what Ritchie Blackmore's wibbly guitar is actually doing! Ironic, isn't it, that advanced technology may prove to be the main cause behind the revival of bands like Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, etc? Not a bad thing. Listen to Highway Star. It positively cooks, while Demon's Eye, Smoke on the Water and Never Before sound as fresh as ever (which is more than can be said of most of Led Zeppelin's output). Some of these songs sound like they were recorded yesterday. Points off for the inclusion last few tracks which in my view don't quite cut  it. The rest is Rock n Roll Rolls Royce. Take my word for it. Deep Purple were, in their heyday, absolutely brilliant. This is the proof.
