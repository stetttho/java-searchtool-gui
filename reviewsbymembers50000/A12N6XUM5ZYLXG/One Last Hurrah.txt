 And Then There Were Three is Genesis' last great album. With the departure of Steve Hackett, the band began to distance itself from its progressive rock roots and adopted a more single-oriented, radio-friendly sound. Not a bad call, it seems, judging by the sales figures that soared on the back of this new direction.  And even though And Then There Were Three can still be essentially classed as a classic Genesis album (with wide-screen anthems such as Deep in the Motherlode, Ballad of Big, and Lady Lies) the songs are a bit shorter, the lyrics more "accessible", the tunes more car stereo-friendly. A far cry from Nursery Cryme.  Skip the execrable "Follow You Follow Me", however, and you have a highly listenable album; very keyboard-heavy, wall-of-sound, which isn't a bad thing, if you ask me.
