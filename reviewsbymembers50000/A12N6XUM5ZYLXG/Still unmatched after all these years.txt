 In 1969, Black Sabbath single-handedly created Heavy Metal with their self-titled debut album. And the people rejoiced and saw that it was good. "Let there be a follow-up", boomed the band members, and wangled a bank loan to take them back into the recording studio. And so, 'Paranoid' saw the light of day and remains to this day, one of the greatest Heavy Metal album of all time. It has everything. The guitar...well...look up 'Power' in the encyclopaedia and you'll find a picture of Tony Iommi playing his Gibson SG, There are lyrics depicting scenes of unparalleled misery and carnage ('War Pigs'), insanity ('Paranoid'), gothic terror ('Iron Man') and drug-induced hallucinations ('Fairies Wear Boots'). Importantly, there's a sense of humour that can sometimes be lacking in some metal acts (notably northern European ones). And how can you resist an album with songtitles like 'Rat Salad' and 'Hand of Doom' (this was 1970, remember). For my money, 'War Pigs' is the best metal song ever: long, slow, heavy, epic, beautiful. Ozzy is in fine form, heralding the imminence of our destruction with authority and panache. Sabbath made a whole string of top-flight albums in the 70s but Paranoid is the crispest. And has the best cover.
