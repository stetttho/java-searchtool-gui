 I picked this up in the bargain bin of my local record store (they were literally giving it away). so I wasn't really expecting much.  Indeed at first listen this seemed to me to be bog-standard, blippy, squeaky, bouncy, percussive electronica of the type the Germans seem to excel at. Mr. Beige (one Oli Braun) does in fact come from Cologne, which is home incidentally, to many other like-minded artists. The music is based on perky, feather-light beats (a la Autechre) but is tongue-in-cheek and quite cheerful, a mixture of Prince, Richard D James and Pinky and Perky. It has a high ambient factor, too - stick it on at work and it won't intrude on your concentration. Beige sounds a bit like Mouse on Mars, but he is not a pale copy but a highly innovative musician in his own right. Good music, shame about the cover, though, which is enough to banish any record straight to the bargain bin..
