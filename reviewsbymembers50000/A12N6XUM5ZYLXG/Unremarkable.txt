 As a bona fide electronica buff, I really wanted to like this album having heard so may good things about it. To me, however, this was a major disappointment. It's perfectly listenable, but a bit too cheesey, predictable and well...Euro for my taste. It's competent but falls short of being remarkable, inspring, or intriguing. Its all a matter of taste, of course. No doubt many of you will love this: it's just not original or adventurous enough to stick out from the crowd.
