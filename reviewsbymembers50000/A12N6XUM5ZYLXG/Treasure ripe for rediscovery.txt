 I played Katy Lied all the way through the other day (which is something I very rarely do to records nowadays) and was knocked out by how good it is. And what songs! Slick, witty and sophisticated at the same time - a fantastic record from start to finish. Some interesting and entertaining new sleeve notes have been added too, written by the Dan duo themselves. The remaster has breathed new life into this landmark recording and I can safely say that Dan fans and newcomers will be delighted. Katy Lied has a more down-to-earth feel than, say, Aja, and is jam packed with great songs whereas Aja is much more expansive and aloof.
