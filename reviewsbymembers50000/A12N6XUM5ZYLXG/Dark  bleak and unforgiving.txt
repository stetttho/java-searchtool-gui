 While Talk Talk offered up some inspired moments (Colour of Spring) and endeavoured to break down traditional musical barriers (see Spirit of Eden), this solo offering from Mark Hollis - the band's singer/songwriter - is blacker than black. It continues in the same vein as Laughing Stock, and indeed is an introspective, intriguing record as you'll likely to find. BUT, there's something about this record that sends the spirit spiralling down into deep depression. It's dry like a gravestone, it creaks like an old coffin, and is completely bereft of any kind of kind of humour. I don't know whether anybody out there agrees with me. This is the only record I've ever heard that has had this effect on me. This to me is music that is the closest thing to unhappiness in sound I have ever heard.
