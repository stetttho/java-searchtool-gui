 Focus were one of the standard-bearers of progressive rock in the 1970s. They were best known for coming from the Netherlands and having a hit single, Hocus Pocus (1972) which featured yodelling. But, dear reader, there is so much more! Now that that it is finally safe again to mention Progressive Rock, I would like to take this opportunity to introduce you to an absolute stunner. Focus crafted a blend of classical, jazz and rock that is so elegant, so beautiful that it makes me weep to think that this gorgeous music currently languishes in obscurity. Many people have a problem with instrumental music (which Focus mainly is) but the music here is so articulate and expressive that you in fact forget that there are no vocals.  What does Focus sound like? Well, think Hammond organ, flute, superb bass and drums rhythm section, and a guitar that dazzles with an all-round performance one minute jazzy, the next rock n roll. Let's put it this way. If you like early Genesis, Pink Floyd circa 1971 - 1973, Jethro Tull, or John Abercrombie, Jan Hammer or even Pat Metheny, give it a try. Or perhaps one day the nice people at ... will provide listening samples. Live at the Rainbow is the sound of Focus bringing the show to the London in 1972 and taking the notoriously picky English public by storm. The atmosphere captured on this recording is great. You get the hits - they're tagged on at the end - and some of the best moments of the band's earlier output. It would be pointless naming highlights - it's all fabulous, but keyboard player Thijs Van Leer's (new and improved) yodelling performance on Hocus Pocus is a scream. Other good albums by Focus? Moving Waves, Focus 3, Hamburger Concerto are all extraordinary. The long-awaited, Prog Rock comeback starts here.
