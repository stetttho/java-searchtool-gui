 Great film in which all the component parts come together to form one of the best thrillers of all time - the music, the directing, the writing, the performances - with special mention for comic acting genius Richard Dreyfuss and a masterful, larger-than-life Robert Shaw. This was, remember, before the days of Discovery Channel, when sharks still relatively little-studied animals.  This may help explain the least impressive support performance in the film " the model shark " which by todays technical sta ndards comes across as a bit limp (in one scene the shark drags a person under water but his jaws are nowhere near the victim " what did it use, his fins??). But dont let that put you off, this is a 5-star film, everything else in this movies so well done that the shark thing pales into insignificance. One of my favourite movies of all time.
