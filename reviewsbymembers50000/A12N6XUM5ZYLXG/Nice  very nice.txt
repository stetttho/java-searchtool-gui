 The 1980s was a decade of costume dramas, with Merchant Ivory as the quality benchmark.  Surprisingly perhaps, it was the Edwardian era (1900-1920-ish) that seemed to be the most popular period. Award-winning TV series Brideshead Revisited pioneered the movement but it was Oscar-winning Chariots of Fire that opened the floodgates, and suave young men in stripy blazers and floppy haircuts reigned supreme for ten years. Merchant Ivory of course pretty much cornered that market with  Howard's End, Room with a View, etc. but there was no shortage of contenders to the English Costume Drama throne. A Month in the Country capitalised on the seemingly neverending demand for soft-focus costume movies, and indeed, the usual crowd of young, arty film-goers of the mid-80s, me include, lined up for tickets. The story - based on the novel of the same name - sees shell-shocked World War I survivor on an assignment to a remote (and of course idyllic) Yorkshire village to uncover a mediaeval mural in the local church. So far so good. Colin Firth puts an tastefully understated performance as the well-spoken Charles Birkin, while Kenneth Branagh, Jim Carter, Patrick Malahide, Natasha Richardson and just about every other ubiquitous British actor add their own special touches.  To be brutally honest, however, nothing much really happens. Passions are thwarted, loose ends are left untied and feelings slowly simmer underneath phlegmatic British exteriors but everything remains unresolved.  In short we are left with an overwhelming feeling of anti-climax. Even the drama is deliberately toned down, suggesting perhaps that Month in the Country would have come across better on television - perhaps as a series.  A very nice movie, but a blockbuster this most definitely is not.
