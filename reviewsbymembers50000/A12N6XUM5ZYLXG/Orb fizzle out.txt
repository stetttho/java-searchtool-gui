 There's really not much to cheer about with this album. Time seems to have left Orb behind. Gone is the long, spacey ambient flotation and we are left with music that is more dub with female vocals more than anything else. I don't like the feel of this record though there seems to be plenty of other reviewers who disagree. Can anybody really say they like the cover?
