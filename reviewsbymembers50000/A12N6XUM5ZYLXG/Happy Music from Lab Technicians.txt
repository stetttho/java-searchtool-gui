 Stereolab is a group that has created, perfected and refined its own genre (file under lounge/pop/alternative/experimental). All their albums are minor variations of the same style and can seem fairly samey, but every good record collection should have at least one of their albums. Dots and Loops is about as close to mainstream respectability as Stereolab will ever get, i.e. it's less experimental and more polished, though still a far cry from the likes of Air or Groove Armada. This is good because experimentation is at the heart of this group, hence the name. The sound? Swirling 70s pornflick cheesy organs, 60s B-movie (read Groovy) rhythm section, breathy girly vocals signing in French (think Nico or Jane Birkin), strange experimental synth sounds adding a touch of weirdness. It's like a cross between Sergio Mendes Brasil 66 and Velvet Underground. Stereolab may be narrow, but their style is timeless, ensuring that they will be around long after the Retro movement has become a semi-colon in the annals of pop history.  And any group that has album titles like, "And the Band Played Groovy Bachelor Pad Music" gets the thumbs up in my books. Dots and Loops is more accessible than their earlier records but in my opinion slightly less engaging. A good record for all groovsters to start with. And dig that cover!!!!
