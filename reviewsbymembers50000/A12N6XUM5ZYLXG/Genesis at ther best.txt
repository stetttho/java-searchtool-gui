 Wind and Wuthering is the second of two albums recorded by the band without Peter Gabriel and with Steve Hackett. Many missed Gabriel for his arty edge, but most fans had to admit that Genesis never sounded better when Trick of the Tail came out in 1976. Phil Collins proved a more-than-able replacement for the former songbird, and the band had found a homogenous, pastoral sound that was still classic Genesis without being overblown and pompous. Wind and Wuthering (1977) continues in the same vein but is not as understated as its predecessor. There's a more wide-screen, adventurous feel to this record that is best appreciated at high volume. Wot Gorilla? and All in a Mouse's Night are a mighty din, while One for the Vine and Your Own Special Way showcase the band's gentler side.This is my favourite album because it is the only Genesis album (yes, folks, the only one) where all members get to stretch their wings to the full. There's rock, there's fusion, there's classical, all beautifully packaged in the Genesis (wall of) sound. With the exception of And Then There Were Three, it was all downhill from then on.
