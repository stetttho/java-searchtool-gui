 Not one of Soderbergh's best, this. This is a bit of a disappointment. All the techniques he uses to such a great effect in movies like Traffic (8mm clips) come across here as pointless exercise in arty filmmaking. It seems as though The Limey was for Soderbergh just a practice run for Traffic. The docu-style camera work for the action scenes does not work. There is simply no tension. Another mistake in my opinion was to cast Terence Stamp for the lead role. He's a great British actor and has notched up some great performances since the 60s, but he's maturing in years and doesn't quite have the edge. There's nothing wrong with the story, British hardened ex-con flies to LA to get revenge on the killers of his daughter. I would venture to say that in the hands of another director and casting expert, the Limey has the makings of a first-class thriller.
