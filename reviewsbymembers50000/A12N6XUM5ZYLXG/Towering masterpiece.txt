 Sing to God is, I think, Cardiacs' pinnacle of achievement and definitely among my 10 favourite records ever.  A double album of unparalleled brilliance. Its not easy-listening, of course, but on the other hand its not as difficult as many people make out. Give it a few listens and you'll see why the Cardiacs is one of rock's best-kept secrets.  It's bold, beautiful, progressive, punky, nostalgic, avant garde all at the same time. It's fast, furious, rocky, poppy, quirky, arty, catchy, totally unique and - most importantly - it is music with a BIG HEART and lots of SOUL. To sum up the Cardiacs as quirky English pop doesn't do the band justice - the influences I can hear are Gabriel-era Genesis, Sex Pistols, Gilbert & Sullivan and the London Symphony Orchestra after someone's poured half a kilo of angeldust into their lunchtime beers. All the tracks are great, though the suite of songs ending Disc 1 soars to hitherto unscaled heights of creative genius. Alas, the Cardiacs will never reach the MTV big time, simply because pop music nowadays is no longer about quality, originality or uniqueness. The music industry wants products that appeal to the mass market. And the mass market's tastes have, of course, been fashioned by the - surprise, surprise - the MUSIC INDUSTRY. But I digress. This is an amazing record. Please buy it.
