 I remember Relayer used to be regarded as something of an aberration: not at all what the fans had come to expect from the band that yielded such lush works as Fragile and Close to the Edge. Rick Wakeman's departure seemed to signify somethnig of a stylis itc U-turn. Gone are the pastoral shadings and delicate soundpoems. Instead what we get is jazz-rock workouts. Gates of Delirium, for example, is a 20-minute assault of mind-bending time-signatures and jazz-rock pretension. To Be Over continues this trend.  Not even the great looking cover or the groovy songtitles fail to fend off the feeling of slight disappointment. It is not until the very end, when the storm clears and normal service is resumed. I realise that Relayer seems to have garnered many favourable reviews, and indeed, fans of jazz-rock will find something here to enjoy but those wishing to experience the Yes sound of Starship Trooper, Roundabout, The Fish, Awaken, Siberian Khatru, etc. would be wise to avoid Tales from Topographic Oceans and Relayer and go straight  to Going for the One..
