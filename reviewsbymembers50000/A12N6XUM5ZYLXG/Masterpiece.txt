 This is a landmark movie in that it is the first ever costume drama that does not romanticise the events it portrays, i.e. Merchant Ivory, etc. It depicts people in late-Victorian England doing exactly the same things we do: hold meetings, ask for pay-rises, go to the dentist, etc. In that way, and in the amazing attention to detail, the audience is actually taken back to London in the 1890s. Another important thing: You DON'T HAVE to be a G&S fan to enjoy this movie. The music, although prevalent, takes second place behind the story-telling. You can ignore the music and look at the wonderful scenery. Please see this movie. You'll never want to see another Merchant Ivory film again.
