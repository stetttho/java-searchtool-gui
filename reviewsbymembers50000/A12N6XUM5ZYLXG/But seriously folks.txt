 XTC first blessed the UK pop scene with their unique, sophisticated brand of punkpop in 1977. With New Wave on the ascendancy, Partridge, Moulding & co delivered a string of wired but precociously catchy singles, notably This is Pop, Statue of Liberty an d Making Plans for Nigel and a handful of albums oozing songwriting talent and inventiveness (now available in remastered form for added freshness!). The XTC powerpop machine went into a kind of go-slow in the late 80s/early 90s, and emerged post-Virgin-split in 1999 with this record. Apple Venus is a largely acoustic album that revisits the pastoral territory of Skylarking but is even more philosophical and contemplative. Although boasting some strong songs, Apple Venus suffers from the same disease as late 80s offerings Oranges & Lemons and Nonsuch, i.e. it lacks cohesiveness and is therefore difficult for pop-pickers like myself to digest in one listen. Compare this with English Settlement, for example, which although races through a whole bunch of different styles, manages to retain a distinctive sound all the way through.  Apple Venus is notable for two things: Colin Moulding contributes his finest XTC song to date, the album-stealing Frivolous Tonight, a touching tribute to small-talk over a pint of beer down the local pub, while Andy Partridge delivers a handful of songs, some of which are breathtaking in their scope and depth. The richly orchestrated Easter Theatre, the Arabesque Green Man', the darkly philosophical, Beach Boys-inspired I Dont Own Her, metaphysical explorations of Harvest Festival and the bleak end-of-the-world-scenario Last Balloon are proof that Andy Partridges songwriting is soaring to new creative heights (River of Orchids is a shining example of songwriting genius to be sure). There is, however, a greyness that pervades parts of this record that seems to suggest that XTC may no longer the shiny pop combo it once was.
