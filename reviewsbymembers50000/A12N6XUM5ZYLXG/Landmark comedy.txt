   The Fast Show (and to some extent Harry Enfield) was a step forward in British comedy. The post-Python years were best served by Not The Nine o'Clock News (an irreverent, smug and often viciously satirical show which put Mel Smith and Rowan Atkinson on the map) and the aggressive, nihilistic Young Ones. The Fast Show deviates from previous shows in being character-based rather than situation-based, and managing to be gut-achingly funny without being overtly vindictive. The Fast Show is quick-paced sketch comedy, but over the course of the series we become acquainted with oddball but often loveable eccentrics and archetypes (miserable old man, the Cockney thief, the obnoxious sales assistants), colourful TV personalities (coughing Bob Fleming and jazz-show presenter, Louis Balfour) and even whole TV shows (the hilarious Chanel 9). This is not punchline comedy - the smutty innuendos of 70s prime-time shows like Benny Hill and Two Ronnies are few and far between - but thanks to brilliant writing, focus on three-dimensional rather than two-dimensional characters, and a gently lop-sided look at everyday situations, Paul Whitehouse, Charlie Higson and the rest of the team have created what in retrospect can be seen as the jewel in the crown of British comedy.
