 A lot of music is fairly culture- and even period- specific. Billy Braggs debut release is a prime example. For those sitting in damp, chilly bedsits in England in 1983, Spy vs. Spy will always have a special significance. Workers rights were being systematically dismantled by Margaret Thatchers Conservative government and soaring unemployment meant little or non-existent job prospects even for college graduates. A powerful new political voice was emerging. With the immediacy of Springsteen, the passion of the Jam, and a knack for heartwrenching melodies. Billy Braggs charm, of course, lay in his unpolished, cockney delivery and low-budget production values " just him and his cheap-sounding electric guitar. But what he played was gold. And we all shut up and listened.  A New England is perhaps his most famous tune; the flagship, if you will, of a set of songs that depicted love lost or disillusionment against a backdrop of real-life, unromanticised situations ("I loved you then and I love you still/Though I put you on a pedestal I put you on the pill"). Springsteen is the only other artist who has managed this. To Have And To Have Not is a belting indictment of social inequality and the celebration of personal integrity underpinned by a beautiful melody. "Just because youre better then me/Doesnt mean Im lazy...". Busy Girl Buys Beauty tackles the dreams and needs created by the consumer industry, "A busy girl buys beauty/ A pretty girl buys style/ A simple girl buys what shes told to buy...". A great song but punctuated with UK-specific cultural references. Man in the Iron Mask is a delicate ballad about unrequited love ("For you I will be/ the man in the iron mask...") while Milkman of Human Kindness is Billy Braggs Bridge Over Troubled Water but with more down-to-earth imagery. Also check out Between the Wars and Richard. A word of warning: this is very rough and ready " guitar virtuosity and a mannered vocal delivery are not part of this mans agenda. But good tunes, great lyrics and a big heart are.ï¿½
