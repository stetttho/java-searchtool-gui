 Focus should have been massive but they made one fatal mistake. They didn't come from England. In 1970s the UK music scene was very strong and therefore self-sufficient and anything not home-grown was viewed with suspicion. Focus produced four superb albums, crafting a finely balanced blend of classical, jazz and rock n roll. Progressive rock in the purest sense of the word.  Moving Waves is in my opinion their crowning achievement. Focus III and Hamburger Concerto  are great though marred by passages of unnecessary indulgence. Moving Waves is a pristine example of musical genius. What do they sound like? Well, Ive always thought they sounded like Camel would have done had they attended the Royal College of Music for three years. Both bands have much in common, though I must say that Moving Waves is a record Camel could only have dreamt of doing. Best tracks? Moving Waves plays vfrom start to finish - yes even Hocus Pocus - although I like the beautoful title track and Eruption in particular.  Many would say Focus actually comes closer to being Fusion rather than Rock, but here I would disagree. Moving Waves is as rock n roll as they come. Or Im a Dutchman
