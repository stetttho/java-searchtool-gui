 A million miles from the po-faced, breast-beating histrionics of, say, Bon Jovi, Cheap Trick offers a more tongue-in-cheek, cerebral vision of Rock n Roll. Heaven Tonight, their third album, has all the ingredients of outstanding power pop: catchy melodies, groovy harmonies, humor and superb guitar-playing. The opener, Surrender has already gone down in rock history as a classic, while several other songs - notably Auf Wiedersehn and Heaven Tonight - that are also stand-outs. It's a slice of power pop heaven to be sure BUT two things have to be taken into account: firstly, in my opinion the band's late-seventies-early eighties production has not aged well, and secondly, the remastered CD version still sounds strangely static compared with the vinyl. To sum up, then, highly recommended fare for lovers of good guitar pop.
