 There is so much about the Shins that screams `typical indie pop' - the name, the cosy production, the scaled-down arrangements, the angularness, the lo-fi-portastudio-in-the-bedroom feel - and tragically, this may be one of the reasons I have not heard them until now, being thoroughly fed up with the genre's failure in the last ten - no twenty - years to come up with anything remotely original and exciting. But Chutes Too Narrow by The Shins demands to be listened to. The melodies manage to be at once clever and simple, earthy and transcendent and just startlingly good. The vocal of Kissing the Lipless dips and soars, tracing a glorious arc of melody that takes you back more than 20 years ago. Turn a Square is an uptempo-ish kind of song the Fountains of Wayne need more of. I know it's tempting to play Spot-the-Influence (here's there - at a guess -  Elliot Smith, Beach Boys, Neil Finn, Stephen Duffy, Elvis Costello and - yes - the Beatles) but Shins music is far more than sum of the musical parts. I've always held Andy Partridge (XTC) and Stephen Duffy (Lilac Time) to be standard bearers of pop excellence. A third name - James Mercer - can now safely be added to that list.
