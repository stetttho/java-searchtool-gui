 Live at Pompeii is a  fine music movie but also great film in its own right. There are some wonderful moments: the camera zooming in REALLY SLOWLY during the introduction to Echoes,  the slow pan along the back of the enormous speaker stacks also during Echoes, the Abbey Road footage during the making of Dark Side of the Moon, the interview with David Gilmour and, most memorably, the superb shots of figures and mosaics in Pompeii ruins, which are at times actually quite frightening (lyseric enthusiasts beware!).  It is an artistic film - the film-makers really knew what they were doing  - and one which complements Pink Floyd's music perfectly. Unfortunately some of the songs have aged rather badly, and in my opinion should be edited out before the inevitable DVD remaster. Saucerful of Secrets, for example, just about completely bereft of any musical points of interest.  The rest, however, is a real treat for early Floyd fans.
