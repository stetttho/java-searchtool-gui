 We thought it was all over in the early 90s. British Guitar pop had been rudely shoved aside by the white dance scene - a bandwagon onto which many pop bands jumped, incidentally - the Smiths were a distant memory, and the few bands that carried on the tradition were dropped by their record companies like hot bricks. Then came the American wave: Nada Surf, Gin Blossoms, Fountains of Wayne and Weezer.  Weezer did everything that UK power pop bands did but they did it better. Smart lyrics, memorable melodies, inspired arrangements and, yes folks, real soul.  Weezer's debut album is an unsurpassable achievement (witness the lacklustre follow-up album, Pinkerton), a glorious listen from start to finish. The Beach Boys-esque,  melodies underpinned by a broadside of guitars that give any set of speakers a run for their money. Buddy Holly is, of course, Weezer's commercial anthem, but any other of the songs on this record could have done just as well. For those of you who are reading this and have not yet heard this record, go straight to the song clips above and get listening.
