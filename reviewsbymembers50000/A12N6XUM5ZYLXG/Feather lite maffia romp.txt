 'Analyze This does pretty much everything it says on the tin. A light-hearted, family-friendly (think City Slickers with mobsters instead of cowboys, or Sopranos meets the Keystone Cops) escapade where top psychiatrist (Billy Crystal) ends up unwilling private shrink to gang-boss (Robert de Niro). Harmless fun with snappy one-liners aplenty and a cast of colourful characters including Lisa Kudrow and a host of familiar maffia henchmen. Unfortunately, this movie is considerably less than the sum of its parts; an only-slightly-better-than-average family movie with Billy Crystal (there is no doubt that this is his movie) in good form, although Robert de Niros horrifyingly unconvincing "crying" attacks and the endless stream of regurgitated maffia clich�s that should have been laid to rest with Steve Martins definitive 'My Blue Heaven' bring the average down to 3 stars.�
