 One of the mainstays of the Britpop tradition, XTC never really made it big, relying heavily on their small and devoted fanbase all over the world. Too angular and uncompromising for the mainstream, but - alongside Elvis Costello -  writers and purveyors of some of the best songs this listener has ever heard. Go for English Settlement because to is pound-for-pound, the bandï¿½s best album songwise. Senses Working Overtime is on here, as is No Thugs in Our House, Ball and Chain, All of a Sudden and my favourite ever XTC song. Jason & the Argonauts. The band has opted for a more acoustic sound for this album, which works great alongside the more folky-oriented tinge to some of the songs (Yacht Dance, Runaway, Melt the Guns), which makes English Settlement a great summertime listen.
