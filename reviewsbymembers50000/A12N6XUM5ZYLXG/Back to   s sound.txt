 If Dust and Dreams was a strong album with some tedious bits, Rajaz is a more consistant affair. This album sounds like Andy Latimer decided one day to record an album featuring all the hallmark 70s sounds: dry, close-up vocals; meandering melodies; an unashamedly progressive feel and guitar work that could indeed just as well been featured on Snowgoose or Mirage. I like the fact that Rajaz is not seamless like Dust and Dreams, where skipping the unwanted tracks is a nightmare.  Here too, there are weaker moments (Straight To My Heart being one) and some of the lyrics register high on the cheezometer, but all in all Rajaz is a majestic effort. One of their best, in fact.
