 In the early 80s we had chill-out music but back then it was called "come-down music": essential fare for those late night/early morning sit-ups round a friend's house, imbibing tea, smoking "funny" cigarettes, etc. Chilled Euphoria is indeed an album of ambient music, but it's a little sugary to help soothe tattered nerves and instil a sense of well-being. Perfect for come-downs or for relaxing after a particularly harrowing day. The selection is fairly mainstream and as such will undoubtedly appeal to a fairly wide selection of people. Fans of Moby will rejoice though personally I'm a little tired of slow, bleepy music with speeches by famous people recorded over the top. To sum up, then, a great relaxing CD but - call me a music snob if you will - just a little too "easy-listening" at times to be essential.
