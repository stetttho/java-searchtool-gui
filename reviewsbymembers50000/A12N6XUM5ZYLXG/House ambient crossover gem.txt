 I don't know why I haven't discovered this before, a superb collaboration between two Germans who know a thing a two about making good music. To be honest though, my expectations were moderate after hearing one of their tracks, Do the Strand, on a compilation. I didn't think it reflected the musical calibre of its makers. This record, however, reflects their calibre and then some. Alter alias Wolfgang Voigt is already a bit of a hero of mine through his Gas series, which is top-notch electronic music; a genre which, a few British tearaways aside, German artists seem to dominate with ease. Two tracks really stand out for me, Milk and Honey which is really lives up to its title. Delicate synth stabs and an insistent bass pulse puttering away beneath. Quite danceable (probably) but even better to sit back and enjoy. The Jealous Guy from Memphis is also lactic sweetener with a sublime low-key groove and some achingly beautiful keyboard work. This is as good as the best of Aphex Twin, and has the sonic sophistication of Vladislav Delay, Pole and Autechre. Experimental forays, then, firmly chained to click/house grooves.  Wonder what it would sound like the other way round?
