 I'm not a King Crimson expert but to me this sounds like a straight, no-nonsense, no-holds-barred, progressive rock album.   King Crimson have veered away from the edgy funk pop exercises of Discipline, Three of a Perfect Pair and Beat and have done a sort of U-turn, plunging back 30 years to fetch fresh inspiration. And it works. It's heavy - a great striding Goliath of sound, very typical of Red-era King Crimson. But I'll stick my neck out and say that this is even better - better songwriting, better playing, better energy, sharper lyrics but still the same unmistakable King Crimson. The music is quite complex but never intimidatingly so, and there are many moments of atmospheric respite between the pedal-to-the-metal workouts.  The Construcktion of Light is very much a rock album in the traditional sense, but there's a fierce intelligence at work here, making this a record that demands a couple of listens at least before the pieces slot into place.  Although this is a strong set from messrs Fripp, Belew, Gunn and Mastelotto, for me the album really takes off after the second track.  If I have a reservation it is the anonymous looking cover - just screaming out to be ignored in your local record store. Musically, though, this is an absolute peach, although one suspects that it will appeal particularly to the 40- and 50- somethings who will already be familiar with the musical points of reference vented in these grooves.
