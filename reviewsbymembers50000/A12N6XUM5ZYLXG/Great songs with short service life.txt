 From the very first listening, Supergrass take hold with their melodic sophistication, exuberant energy and - for such young whippersnappers -surprising maturity. Richard III, Late In The Day and Sun Hits The Sky illustrate why Supergrass have come so far since the youthful exuberance of Maybe I Should Coco. So far, so good. Unfortunately, these Supergrass songs fade disappointedly quickly. Late in the Day, for example, was heaven to my cynical ears, echoing the Beatles' elegiac Day in a Life, but heavy rotation and humming soon drove it to oblivion. The entire album , in fact, went from being a favourite to bargain-bin-fodder in just a few weeks. I don't know why. Maybe (I could be wrong) the album is overlaboured, with too much time gone into giving In It For The Money (that difficult second album) that expensive, deluxe sheen. To sum up, Supergrass are head and shoulders above many of their Britpop peers but like candy bars of an inferior brand, while It For The Money is all chunky, and brimming with goodness, it doesn't really satisfy.
