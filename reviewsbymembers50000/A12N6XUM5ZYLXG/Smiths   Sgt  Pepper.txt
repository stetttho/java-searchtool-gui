 There is popular myth, perpetuated by UK music journalists, that Strangeways Here we Come is the pinnacle of Smith's achievement and a superior recording to Queen is Dead. Well, sorry but if you use your ears rather than whatever it is music journalists seem to be equipped with, not only does Queen is Dead have better songs, it has better everything else, too. With the exception of the title track, this album is genius at work, and shows the band at its creative peak. End of story. The Queen is Dead cruises effortlessly through a variety of styles without ever losing its homogeneity, the whole record's concept being congealed by a crisp production, Johnny Marr's sparkling guitar work and Morrissey's black-humour lyrics and deadpan delivery. Standout tracks for me is the jaunty Frankly Mr. Shankly, which will indeed "go down in musical history", and the definitive Smiths tearjerker, There is a Light that Never Goes Out. Other highlights include Bigmouth Strikes Again, Some Girls are Bigger Than Others, The Boy with a Thorn in his Side and...well...take your pick. Beginners will find this album a good, accessible introduction to the UK's best band of the 80s. If you like this, Hatful of Hollow - a compilation of the best early stuff - is also indispensable. Enjoy.
