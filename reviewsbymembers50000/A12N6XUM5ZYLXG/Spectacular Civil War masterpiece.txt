 Gods and Generals is a superb follow-up to the magnificent Gettysburg - a second instalment of top-quality storytelling, gripping drama, breathtaking action sequences and haircuts that defy the imagination. This time we go back to the tumultuous opening days of the conflict.  The action spans three separate engagements - Chancellorsville, Fredericksburg and Bull Run- from all of which the confederate forces under General Robert E- Lee emerge triumphant. Robert Duvall fills Martin Sheen's shoes as Robert E. Lee for this movie and is, I feel, better cast. Facial hair enthusiasts will also have a field day- more strange moustaches and beards than you can wave a stick at - with Tom Berenger winning the Most Ridiculous Beard in a Civil War Movie award hands-down (with Jeff Daniels's handlebar moustache in the first Gettysburg movie coming in a close second) . The movie focuses on General Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson, with Stephen Lang putting in a strong, moving performance as the legendary soldier (killed by complications following a bullet wound inflicted by friendly fire fact fans). I find myself at odds with many of the reviewers below who have dismissed Gods and Generals totally. Well I've seen this movie a couple of times now and I've seen nothing that justifies the mangling this film has received below. The music, for instance, is superb - defintely a notch up from the synthy washes we had to endure in Gettysburg. But it is, exactly like Gettysburg a beautifully made, lovingly crafted Civil War movie that is highly educational too boot. It created a whole new genre with art nestling comfortably alongside education.  Gods and Generals is not just a great movie, but a major cinematic endeavour.
