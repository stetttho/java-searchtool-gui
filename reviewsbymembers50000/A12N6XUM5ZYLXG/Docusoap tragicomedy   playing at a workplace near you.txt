 The Office takes some getting used to. It manages to be hilariously funny without making you laugh, instead you cringe and squirm with embarrassment at David Brent and his 'enlightened' take on senior management. It's funny, but also painful to watch. It's hilarious but the laughs are few and far between. Maybe it's because its too close to the bone - anybody who's worked in an office environment in the 80s or 90s will most likely have first-hand experience of the buffoonery that passes for leadership.  It's a good job Gareth is there - we can all laugh at his inept social skills and lack of any kind of redeeming feature - because otherwise the Office would be close to unbearable so close is the line between comedy and blackness. Take Brent's chum Finchy, for instance. You can't laugh at a guy like that, you just pray you never have to meet anyone like him. The Office mimics the earnest mockumentary style of Spinal Tap but is less far-fetched and therefore more scary.  The Office takes some getting used to, but that's probably because it is a first-rate comedy that manages to make you want to cry instead of laugh. In fact, the shenanigans of the Office are probably being played out at this very momentin a workplace near you.
