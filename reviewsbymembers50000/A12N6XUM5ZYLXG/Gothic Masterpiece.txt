 Garlands, the Cocteau Twins' first album is a towering, gothic masterpiece. It is, I think, their best, darkest and most satisfying album simply because all the pieces - the pitter-patter drum machine; the dark, gothic basslines; the screaming monster guitar and Liz Frazer's startling, otherworldly vocals all constitute a perfect, homogenous whole - a record you can play from start to finish. "Deaf, Dumb, Blind", "Blood Woman" and "Garlands" are standouts, with Mr. Guthrie turning out guitar work that has to be heard to be believed. It may not be a sugary offering like Victorialand, for example, but Garlands is nevertheless one of the band's most beautiful albums.
