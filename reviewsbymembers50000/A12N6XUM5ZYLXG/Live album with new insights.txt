 Essentially seems to be a hybrid between a live album and a remix. In other words all these songs appear elsewhere but have been reworked, taking the drum track from live recordings and doing interesting things to the songs. Thus the haunting Public Place is reproduced here but without that evil elephantine guitar riff (a more ambient version?), Finest Drops is here but is new and improved - a bit rawer and with a most distinct, up-front vocal. Over Theirs is present and correct but is an expansive husk o f its former self. Colin Newman has adjusted the lead vocal line, making it more spacey and ominous rather than aggressive and compact like the studio original.  For me the version of Over Theirs on Ideal Copy is the best Ive heard yet. Illumination chugs along complete with repetitive spoken word sample and showcases Robert Gotobeds superbly crisp drumming. He really swings that guy. Boiling Boy is ~ambiented-up, taking the listener down a long drumless intro passage with bits of guitar tinkling away left and right. Good stuff, though should perhaps not be compared with the original.  This isnt essential but should leave fans of Wires mid 80s period nicely satisfied. A complement, then, rather than an update of studio versions.u
