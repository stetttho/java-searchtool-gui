 Supertramp were a 70s progressive rock group that enjoyed a huge worldwide following (the French in particular, loved them). With Breakfast in America they managed to bridge the gap between rock credibility and commercial success. They wrote shorter, poppier songs for this album while still retaining their smooth, luxurious sound. It worked. The album was a massive critical and commercial success. The single, Logical Song was a huge hit, but the album also boasted classic songs like Lord Is It Mine, Breakfast in America, Goodbye Stranger, Casual Conversation and the amazing Take The Long Way Home. Breakfast in America, made in 1978, is Supertramps last truly great album. It is slightly poppier than their previous stuff (it is the Supertramp album your little sister would like), and some cynics would say, more shallow. Shallow? Just listen to songs! If anything Supertramp are lyrically more focussed on this album than ever before. And dont be fooled - t he sound is great (just listen to the clips!) and like all truly great albums can be appreciated by all ages and tastes. Supertramp went on to make a number of albums after this, but they were pale compared to Breakfast. Remember them this way. *
