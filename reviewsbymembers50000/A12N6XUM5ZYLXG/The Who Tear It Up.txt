 The Who were undisputedly one of the big three along with the Beatles and the Stones. In fact they had moments when they matched the Beatles for inventive songwriting, having even been their superiors in terms of musicianship, sheer volume of output and ...er...sheer volume (that's Guinness Book of Records, fact fans).  Live at Leeds is already down as one of the definitive live albums of all time. The band is in top form but the songs! The songs are in a league of their own. Which is both good and bad. Good because you and I can enjoy a crisp remastered edition (the sound is crystal clear) and bad because it makes all those Britpop bands of today sound hopelessly inept. Substitute, played here with remarkable tightness, has to be one of the best songs in pop history. Neither Blur nor Pulp nor Oasis nor Dodgy nor Travis have never written anything as good as this or most of the other songs on this record for that matter (sad but true). Happy Jack illustrates Pete Townsend's story-telling geni us, which later found full fruition in rock-opera masterpieces, Tommy and Quadrophenia. Young Man Blues, a cover version of an old blues standard, gives Led Zeppelin a run for their money for sheer electric power. Rock n roll classics Summertime Blues and Shakin' All Over are all fire and sex. And it just gets better. I won't even begin to describe the energy unleashed in My Generation or Magic Bus. It will leave you breathless. With the recent demise of John Entwhistle, this is a perfect opportunity to sit back (if you can) and experience a superb recording of one of the world's greatest bands firing on all six. And then some.
