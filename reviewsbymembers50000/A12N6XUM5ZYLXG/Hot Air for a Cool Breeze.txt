 With the hugely successful movie soundtrack/single Dont You Forget About Me, Simple Minds artistic credibility had been severely dented. Many fans hoped that the Minds would, their bank balances replenished, return to the glacial sonic vistas of Sparkle in the Rain and New Gold Dream. But it was not to be. Departed bassist Derek Forbes showed just how vital he was to the Simple Minds sound. Once Upon a Time sees the band diving headlong into a quagmire of artless, watery, anthemic soul-pap. With the mainstream so firmly embraced, Simple Minds suddenly attracted hordes of new fans and a new musical direction was established. I disliked this record not only because of the thinness of the musical ideas contained within but because it somehow encapsulated the end of a golden era. Long, grey overcoats were shed in favour of hi-gloss tour jackets, and Simple Minds were suddenly an unstoppable juggernaut that Bon Jovi look like the Butthole Surfers. The pedal-to-the-metal bombast of Oh Jungleland; the cod-evangelical, reverb-up-to-11 claptrap of Sanctify Yourself; the blustering Alive and Kicking and the incomprehensible All The Things She Said all suggest that Simple Minds were  jettisoned the cool, glacial art-rock of New Gold Dream and Sparkle in the Rain in favour of a less demanding but more posturing sound (U2 have a lot to answer for). It was a great career move, of course, and by this time 80s production guru Trevor Horn was already waiting in the wings to produce their next, even more successful follow-up.
