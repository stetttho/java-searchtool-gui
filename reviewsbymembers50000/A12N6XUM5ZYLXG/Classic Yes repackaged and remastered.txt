 People tend to compare Fragile with follow-up Close to the Edge, and indeed they are both from the same general period, feature the same definitive line-up and both constitute the quality core of Yess back catalogue. So if you like Close To The Edge, Fragile is pretty similar. The main difference is that whereas Close To The Edge 's songs are expansive affairs, Fragile breaks down into smaller, perhaps more accessible components. Fragile is perhaps sees the band in a little more playful mode, with room for all the band members to contribute their own composition. Fragile also is I think one of Yes's most rock-oriented albums and, even if you find it hard to stomach some of the more self-indulgent pieces, it is I assure you a fun record. In short a classic of English 70s prog rock with great remastered sound, original gatefold sleeve reproduced, complete liner notes, etc. etc. you cant really go wrong with this one. And if you dont understand the lyrics, dont worry, nobody else does either.r
