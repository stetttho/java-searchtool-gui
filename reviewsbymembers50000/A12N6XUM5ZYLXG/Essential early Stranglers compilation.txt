 The Stranglers were almost single-handedly responsible for getting New Wave music played onto daytime radio in London. Stranglers had the naked aggression of punk contemporaries, Sex Pistols and Clash, but also had hummable tunes, musical savvy and lyrics that fronted a lively intellect. The Stranglers became firm favourites with the middle and upper-class youngsters to whom the mindless nihilism of the Sex Pistols was a bit too blunt and unsophisticated. After all, any band that could namedrop Sancho Panza and Leon Trotsky in the same song (No More Heroes) had to be taken seriously.  This album is a great compilation of all the early Stranglers' best moments (1977 - 1978). A couple of the tracks towards the end have curiosity value only, but that's just a minor niggle.  P.S.  Music buffs may notice the ghost of  Doors' Light My Fire raised on Walk On By.
