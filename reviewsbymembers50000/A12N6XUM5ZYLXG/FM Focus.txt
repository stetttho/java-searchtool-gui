 Mother Focus is often criticised as being an inferior Focus album, and indeed, marked the break-up of the band, when Jan Akkerman quit dissatisfied with the direction the band was taking.  There is a difference from the earlier prog-oriented sound. Gone are the long drum, guitar (and even bass) solos that characterised the Focus 3 album. Instead the band entered FM territory with snappy three-minute (but still mainly instrumental) tracks and a more loungy, sophisticated sound, fairly similar to mid-70s period Elton John (not necessarily a bad thing). Notable is also that bassist Bert Ruiter has a few compositions, one being `I Need a Bathroom' (I know the feeling).  I like this album a lot. It has a good feeling and has dated very well compared with the earlier Focus offerings. I suppose you could call it a good Sunday morning record. Play at relatively low volume and turn the bass up. Heaven.
