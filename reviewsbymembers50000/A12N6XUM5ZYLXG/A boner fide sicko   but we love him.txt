 The R. Crumb Handbook is an affordably priced (ridiculously inexpensive) treasure trove of Crumb in his own words and drawings. The artist writes simply and effectively about his traumatised upbringing, his fears and desires and his loathing of modern culture. No waffly bull or pontificating, just the basics, and hey, that's all you need (perhaps the economy of style is a natural result of all the cartoons he's done). The written narrative is punctuated by a huge selection of Crumb's cartoons, quotes, musings, ejaculations, vitriol, drugs, reminiscences, traumas, philosophy, advice, photos, posters, reviews, testimonials, album covers, pistachio nut shells and piggyback rides. It's debauched, perverted, just plain sick, actually, but we love it! And if that wasn't enough there's even a free CD of toons from his `half-assed' musical career (you almost feel guilty about the low price-tag). We also get a preview of some of his more recent work (including some `reworkings' of old oil paintings which are fab) and photos of the Crumb family. This is really awesome value for money. My only quibble is that because the book is quite small (but thick like the King James Holy Bible) some of the speech bubbles are a bit of an eye-strainer to read. In other respects this is a lovingly crafted volume to be consulted, browsed, read and cherished. Crumb is reassuringly self-effacing and upfront about his paranoias and sexual proclivities. Like a more in-your-face, less pretentious Woody Allen. But as opposed to the bespectacled filmmaker, Crumb really lets you get real close. Aloof isn't in his vocabulary. You really feel like you've made a friend. If you enjoyed the movie Crumb (1994), this is a perfect companion to that film. It also works as an introduction to one of the world's greatest cartoonist who now seems poised on the brink of major artistic recognition. I, for one, will be cheering him on from the sideline.
