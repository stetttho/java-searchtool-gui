 Jethro Tull�s Ian Anderson once wrote a song about Mick Jagger called Too Old to Rock n Roll, Too Young to Die. A sort of "story" of ageing pop icons desperately clinging to youth culture and losing all dignity in the process. That song was written in 1 975. Fast forward to 2002. Mick, Keith and Charlie are still (sort of) rocking the pants of stadiums around the world. And, unlike Jethro Tull, the Stones are credible today. But in the 70s they were downright dangerous. Look no further than 1976�s Black & Blue for the glorious slice of sleeze 'n' roll. Opener Hot Stuff is loose and dirty, with a reggae lollop straight out of Jamaica. Hand of Fate is a mid-tempo gospel/blues rocker with Jagger bawling like a tomca t on heat. Hey Negrita is sheer lasciviousness in sound, with Charlie Watts doling up a prime slab of back-street funk. Crazy Mama is a quintessential Stones anthem in the style of Brown Sugar, while Fool To Cry has joined the ranks of classic Stones ballads. And look at the cover; there�s more rock n roll right there than all Jethro Tull�s albums put together.
