 Barclay James Harvest never got the success they deserved. A shame, because they were easily on a par with their contemporaries - Genesis, Yes, etc. Live Tapes not only showcases the best songs from the Octoberon and Gone to Earth albums - the zenith period of the band's career - these songs actually benefit from the spacious live sound. Taking Me Higher is thus transformed from a cracking song into three minutes of sonic glory, while Poor Man's Moody Blues stretches the limits of orchestral grandeure. The vocal performances are spot on and the harmonies send goosebumps down my spine. Essential listening, I would say, for fans of symphonic rock.
