 For those of you who are unfamiliar with your rock history, Barclay James Harvest were one of a long line of symphonic rock bands that were swept away in 1976 when the storm broke. Once laughably unhip, it has taken 20 years or more before their name can be mentioned in polite society without being attacked with a pair of  rusty scissors. A shame, because they were not half bad. Favouring grandiose orchestral arrangements they were often compared with the Moody Blues, but whereas the Moodies' lyrics often consisted of meaningless twaddle, BJH's beautiful melodies often fronted black social comment and realism. Beneath the lushness, there was a simple, unpretentious approach to songwriting best showcased on their 70s output and before the departure of their keyboard player and one-man symphony orchestra, Woolly Wolstenholme. Gone to Earth is the last of these. OK, the production sounds a tad dated, but the fact still remains that the Barclay James Harvest was a band whose 4 members complemented each other to produce a well-balanced, homogenous sound. The material on Gone to Earth is strong, and the highlights - Hymn, Sea of Tranquillity and Higher and Higher - are beautiful, inspiring and crying out for rediscovery
