 Dust and Dreams is Camel's return to the limelight after years in the musical wilderness. And what a return it is. Even though this is the sound of a band that has seemingly slept through the 80s and 90s, this is a work of immense power, beauty and, dare I say it, dignity. The album's 14 tracks are elegantly crafted together into a seamless musical voyage through the dust-ridden epic of Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath. Inspired stuff, with Andy Latimer (writer, arranger, producer, etc) once again vying for the title of most Underrated Guitarists of Our Time. It's all very 1973, of course, but for those who are broad-minded enough to venture beyond the confines dictated to them by the music industry will find this a surprisingly good listen. Now where's that hubbly-bubbly?
