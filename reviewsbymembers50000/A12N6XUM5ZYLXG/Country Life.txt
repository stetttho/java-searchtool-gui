 Although English progressive rock was always more at home in country meadows and village lawns than the ~big bad city, Jethro Tull is about as Ye Olde Worlde as you can get. And nowhere else is this fondness green and pleasant lands stated more eloquentl y and passionately than on Songs from the Wood. This 1977 release is a veritable celebration " a manifesto, even - of country life past and present (but mainly past). And judging from this magnificent set of songs, delivered with a feisty spirit and reassuring musical dexterity, it doesnt seem like a bad place to be. One look at the lyrics should be enough to banish any misgivings about quality and depth. All the songs are good, but I would specially recommend the title track, Hunting Girl, Velvet Green and Ring Out, Solstice Bells for a trial listen (Ive always thought they sound a bit like early Kansas). Ian Anderson " who is the creative force, vocalist and flautist behind Jethro Tull, " is a bit of a genius when it comes to depicting scenarios of ru stic folklore. For novices, Jethro Tull was a major player on the British 70s rock scene alongside Pink Floyd, Yes and Genesis. They were also one of the first bands in the world to broadcast gigs live via satellite. Songs From The Wood is, I think, their best album by a long chalk. A progressive folk rock masterpiece. Also check out Minstrel in the Gallery (1974) but approach the overrated Aqualung (1971) with caution.}
