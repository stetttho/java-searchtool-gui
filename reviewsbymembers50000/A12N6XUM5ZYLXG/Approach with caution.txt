 Surprisingly, this is a topic not covered much by moviemakers before. Shame, then, that Rock Star, is such a dud. Nothing wrong with Mark Wahlbergs acting or the talented but hopelessly miscast Jennifer Anniston. The problem lies with the cheesy, cynical, unconvincing way the hard rock genre is portrayed. The conflict situations are ridiculously hammy (the rival bands face-off in the car park is particularly cringeworthy). All the way through the movie I got the uncomfortable feeling I was watching a film intended for 7 year-olds. Lovers of rock movies be warned. The only redeeming feature is Timothy Spall as charismatic road manager, the rest of the cast make very unconvincing rock stars and very unconvincing actors. If you haven't seen Almost Famous famous, I would recommend that movie instead..
