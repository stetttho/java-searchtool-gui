 Gettysburg is a fantastic movie and probably the definitive portrayal of the key Civil War engagement. Everything here is bang on the money - the action scenes are beautifully staged, the acting performances are spot on, and attention to detail is eye-candy to history buffs. Jeff Daniels in particular is absolutely fantastic as the Union officer who, against the odds, wins one of the battle's pivotal clashes. Sam Elliot adds a welcome dash of colour, too. Inexplicably, however, the film takes a sharp nose-dive in the middle when at some point Tom Berenger (GeneraL Longstreet) and Martin Sheen (General Lee) struggle vainly against a dialogue so lumpen and pompous that they both seem about to turn into marble. (Robert Duvall is in Gods & Generals a superior Robert E. Lee to Martin Sheen). And the inclusion of an observer British officer who struts around (complete with tea-cup and supercilious demeanour), is an appallingly two-dimensional, badly-acted parody of Englishness, and the movie suddenly lurches from masterful big-screen movie to sub-standard TV bilge in seconds. Gettysburg picks up again with the Little Round Top clash, when Col. Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels) first repulses a whooping Confederate attack and then, out of ammo, charges the enemy with fixed bayonets, driving the rebs from the scene and taking loads of prisoners. Hurrah! For my money, however - and I seem to be alone in thinking this - sequel Gods & Generals is a far superior Maxwell movie, with even better acting performances, less synthetic-sounding music, grittier battle sequences and lacks the stiffness and that occasionally mars Gettysburg. That said, it is abundantly clear that this is nothing less than a labour of love by writer/director Ronald F. Maxwell.
