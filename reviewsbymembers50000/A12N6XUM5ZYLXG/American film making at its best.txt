 The Green Mile can be seen as a "sister" film to the Shawshank Redemption which is, in my opinion, the best prison movie ever made. The Green Mile is also a prison film, but this time we see prison life from the warden's eye view. Like its predesessor, The Green Mile is a superbly crafted movie, powerful as anything you'll ever see. BUT, two things make this film inferior to Shawshank: the healing scenes (Spielberg time) and one particuarly harrowing botched-execution scene which is shockingly graphic and unecessarily drawn out. Certainly changed my mind about capital punishment, though. The actors, with Tom Hanks at the helm, all turn in brilliant perfomances, and...well...it's a great film - a thought-provoking blockbuster - even though the cross-genre flirtation is hard to take seriously. The perfect Christmas holiday movie, then. For adults, that is.
