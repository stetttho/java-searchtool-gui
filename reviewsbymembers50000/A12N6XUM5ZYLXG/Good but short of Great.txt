 Gangs of New York is a long, winding road of a movie, depicting urban gang violence in New York slum district during the Civil War period. It also tells the story about the first tentative steps of municipal democracy. That's the big picture. At closer range, Gangs of New York is a tale of a young man seeking revenge for his father's murder (yawn). As usual with Scorsese, we get attention to detail, lavish sets and costumes and an engrossing story. But whereas Scorsese's mafia classics such as Casino and Goodfellas flow (fairly) smoothly and cohesively from beginning to end, Gangs of New York comes across as a somewhat unwieldy affair and seams to run out of steam about half way through. What upset me most about this film is Leonardo di Caprio's flat and undynamic performance (come back Tom Cruise, all is forgiven), and not even a colourful effort by Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher or the comfortably assured contribution from Cameron Diaz, manage to inject spice and zest into the flagging brew.  While not a complete disaster, Gangs of New York is more of an `interesting' historical document about a key period in America's history than a riveting popcorn kind of movie.
