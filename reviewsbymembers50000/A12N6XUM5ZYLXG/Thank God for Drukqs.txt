 It would seem as though Aphex fans have been harsher on this record than other music fans. This is probably because Richard D James, (Mr Aphex himself) has been deified to such an extent that expectations of his work have soared beyond a reasonable level. If taken for what it is, Druqks is a great recording mainly showcasing two sides of the Aphex sound: the rapid-fire drum n bass stuff which is like watching fireworks going off in your kitchen, and a quieter, piano-based music that works great alongside it.  Most of the negative reviews are based on Druqks showing a lack of progression, though I think the problem may be more that the genre in itself is growing old - many established Warp artists seem to be repeating thmeselves. I think that electronic music will soon get its deserved shake-up.  I think that this record will grow on most people. It's classic Aphex: old, beautiful and has a heart. Give it a chance. It is also a GREAT introduction to the work of Richard James. And anyway, who knows what's coming next? Methinks I hear a demonic cackle coming from the depths of Cornwall.
