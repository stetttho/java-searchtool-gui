 This album was my first taste of Mr. Metheny, and I was very pleasantly surprised, not being much of a jazz fusion buff. For a live album the sound is incredible, the aural equivalent of sitting down in a comfy armchair and being whisked away high over mountaintops.  The music is highly accessible, relaxed, harmonious, sweet and enlightened. This is a PERFECT chill-out album, guaranteed to restore even the foulest of moods. An excellent buy.
