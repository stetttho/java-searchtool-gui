 Youll notice the words ~underrated and ~overlooked popping up at regular intervals in these reviews. But despite the blatant profit-making orientation of the music industry (independent labels excepted), there are usually good reasons why some bands ne ver rise beyond the confines of their limited fanbase and break into the mainstream. King Crimson is a good example. This does not mean that King Crimson is a sub-standard band. It merely means that while competitors Genesis and Yes deliberately courted m ainstream success by ~soulifying or ~modernising their sound, the Crims doggedly stayed true to their artistic vision. With the benefit of hindsight I would say that King Crimson probably have probably been a stronger artistic force than Yes, Jethro Tul l and ELP put together. You only have to look at their output and the consistency of quality the band has sustained over the last 32 years. Genesis made about 5 classic albums " King Crimson have notched up at least 25. And counting. But although King Cri mson are a rock historian's wet dream, music fans have been more discerning. Crimson is not easy listening. Covering the darker terrain of progressive rock, Robert Fripp and co have always been good at scaring and enthralling rather than comforting and so othing. Red is a classic. Fallen Angel and Starless head up a set of songs that are so impressive in their scope and instrumentation and seriousness (a good thing), that other groups of the period are put to shame. King Crimson combine uniqueness, strength, and vision integrity and artistic. And they are criminally underrated and overlooked.
