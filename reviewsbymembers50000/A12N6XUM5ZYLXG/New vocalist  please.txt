 On no other record is the importance of the lead vocalist as effectively illustrated as with this album. Deserters' Songs comes out fighting on all fronts. Great arrangements, strong tunes, good lyrics, crisp production. But what's this? What's that irritating whining? It can't be...no....NO...NO!!!!!!!! it's KIM CARNES. I tried hard to get used to Jonathan Donohue's whiny, wafer-thin song delivery, I really did. but let's face it; Donohue makes the likes of New Order's Bernard Sumner sound like Luciano Pavarotti. You think he's going to break into Bette Davis Eyes at any moment. Those boys should seriously think about changing vocalist for their next album. Even Shaun Ryder would be an improvement. There's nothing wrong with the music, mind.
