 Even if you don't understand it, Mulholland Drive is an intriguing, gripping, beautiful movie. I should know. I sat through it twice - and enjoyed it - without really knowing what is going on and why - especially when the film seems to change. Now I finally understand the basic plot, I must say that Mulholland Drive is nothing less than a revelation in modern cinema, soaring straight into my list of top 10 movies ever. I'm not going to give anything away here, but I will say that there is a meaning with exactly everything that happens, and the clues are there. If you still can't figure it out, do what I did. Find a web site that explains the plot and imagery and then go back and watch the movie again. You'll be glad you did.
