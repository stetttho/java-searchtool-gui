 Donnie Darko, though a very good film, did not live up to the expectations built up by the press/friends, etc. For a start it has an uncomfortable number of similarities with American Beauty: the suburban family scenario, the out-of-place awkward but sensitive teenage boy (here played by Toby Maguire lookalike, Jake Gyllenhaal), the low-key portrayal of everyday life, the hunk/guru success merchant (Patrick Swayze), even the marimbas in the ambient incidental music. But whereas American Beauty chugs along at a nice steady tempo, Donnie Darko is weighed down by leaden pacing and the superfluous gaps and pauses. Extra points, however, for the groovy 80s soundtrack featuring the newly-hip Duran Duran, Echo and the Bunnymen, Tears for Fears, etc. Donnie Darko, which is Richard Kelly???s debut movie, is a fiercely ambitious and intelligent movie, the arrival of a major talent. It is also a very funny movie in places but, as opposed to American beauty, does not probe quite as deeply into relationships and troubled psyches. Donnie Darko flirts with the sci-fi/horror genre, with weird hallucinations and slow-mo/ffwd shots galore. In fact Donnie Darko is a bit like American Beauty meets Matrix meets Breakfast Club. Star performance comes from nutty teacher, Kitty, played by Beth Grant.
