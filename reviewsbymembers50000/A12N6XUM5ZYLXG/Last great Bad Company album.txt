 Run with the Pack (1976) is the third and last great Bad Company album. The formula of high-octane blues-rock, deployed so successfully on the band's two preceding albums, Bad Company (1974) and Straightshooter (1975) is reproduced here with convincing results, although there are signs that the band is weakening in one or two departments. Paul Rodgers' masterful vocals, for example, are starting to sound a bit laboured in some places. The band also seems to be running out of ideas on the lyrics department, with songwriters - mainly Mick Ralphs and Paul Rodgers - filling the gaps with words that are a very parody of the rock genre. We're talking Spinal Tap territory here. That said, Run with the Pack is a good, consistent hard rock album, with the band rolling out some really first-rate ballads (Love me Somebody and Simple Man) tucked in between the obligatory uptempo rockers (Sweet Lil Sister and Honey Child). One more thing: the musos among you might like to have a little listen to Boz Burrell's bass playing. That guy swings.
