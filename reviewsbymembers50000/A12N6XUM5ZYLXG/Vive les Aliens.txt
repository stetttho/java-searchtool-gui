 Alien 4 has garnered some rotten reviews. Unfairly so.  I suspect that one of the reasons why many people dismiss this film is that it simply doesn't take itself as seriously as either the brilliant but rather po-faced Aliens 2 and the atmospheric and even more po-faced Aliens 3. There's more comedy, more snappy one-liners and a cinematic dexterity that seems to come so easily to French filmmakers such as Marc Caro, Luc Besson, Jean-Jacques Beneix to name a few. This was perhaps what made people turn their noses up at Fifth Element; they were peeved that Besson had not quite been reverential and serious enough. And indeed at times the tone in Aliens-the Resurrection veers towards light-heartedness (even flippancy), but there's also breathtaking action scenes, stunning photography and a climax that kicks bottom, although not perhaps on the scale of the James Cameron masterpiece. The aliens are there, present and correct (they're back and this time they're really upset!)and there are loads of genetic experiments-gone-wrong to make you go: "OOOh! Urrgh! Look at That one!". The film's main weakness is some of the acting performances. Some of the thespians were perhaps chosen more on the strengths of their looks rather than acting ability, but for every Winona Ryder there's a J.E.Freeman who is once again typecast as the Dickensian bad guy, but does it brilliantly as usual. Sigourney is looking a wee bit tired (I don't think she'll be back for the fifth) but does the Ripley thing with the required - if uninspired - gutsiness. To sum up, Aliens 4 doesn't quite reach the heights of Aliens 2 - what can? - but is nevertheless miles better than Aliens 3. (Someone should talk to Paul Veerhoven about doing no. 5.) Good fun. Highly recommended.
