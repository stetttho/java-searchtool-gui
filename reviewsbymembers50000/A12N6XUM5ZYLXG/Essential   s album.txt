 Wire - an important though unsung new wave group (in other words they were musically and lyrically brilliant but did not sell as many records as, say, Rod Stewart) that made an impact with the release of their debut, Pink Flag in 1977. They were jaggedly new wave but also sophisticated and had an ear for melody. After three albums, they disappeared for a while and resurfaced in the mid-80s with a string of stunning records and a more polished sound. The first of which was the celebrated The Ideal Copy and the second, the even more refined A Bell is a Cup.  A Bell received a lukewarm reception from the music press who complained that the band was becoming diluted and commercial. This is a tragedy because I believe it is their best record, their crowning achievement, and one of the best albums of the 80s, right up there alongside Depeche Mode's Black Celebration, and XTC's English Roundabout etc.  The sound is deep and dark and sometimes bleak but always beautiful, thought-provoking and immensely rewarding. All the songs are great, but in my view, Free Falling Divisions, Queen of ER, Kidney Bingos and Public Place are masterpieces of melody, arrangement and wordsmithery. And on this splendid CD version you get extra toons to take the running time up to 74 minutes. Good value!!
