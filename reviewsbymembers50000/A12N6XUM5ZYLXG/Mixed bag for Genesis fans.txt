 Genesis Revisited is, as the title explains, Steve Hackett's own reworkings of early Genesis material, performed by an array of top musicians. The idea is promising and indeed, some of the songs, including instrumental Valley of Kings, Watcher of the Skies and Firth of Fifth (vocals courtesy of John Wetton) are worth the price of the CD. Unfortunately, 2 of these tracks are absolutely awful: I know What I Like is an abysmal, easy-listening revamp of a song that was pretty dire in its original form. Los Endos has been massacred beyond recognition, with the glorious climax of the original ruined by an incongruous plodding drum beat. Embarrasing.  The cover is poor; a morbid effort featuring two anguished pre-Raphaelite figures being attacked by flying saucers. The good bits: Dance on a Volcano perhaps has the edge on its original in terms of power and intensity. Dja-Vu is an old, Peter Gabriel-penned ditty that never made it onto Selling England By The Pound. A beautifully orchestrated For Absent Friends, and of course, Steve Hackett's potent guitar-work is a treat. For genuine Genesis die-hards, then, this is a journey through Heaven and Hell. But just imagine what Phil Collins would have done with this material.
