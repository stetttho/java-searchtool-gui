 This 1978 solo effort from Pink Floyd keyboard man Richard Wright is an album which, although panned by the anti-prog critics upon its release, is today a crucial down-tempo album. Floyd fans will be delighted - Wet Dream is very much in the spirit of Meddle or Dark Side of the Moon-era Pink Floyd, but smoother and without the doom-and-gloom.   But the album's appeal is much broader than that. Wet Dream is a treasure trove of chill-out/lounge-friendly grooves, with Floydian piano meditations (Mediterranean C, Holiday), excursions into smooth funk (Funky Deux), pop (Mad Yannis Dance) and inspired instrumental soft rock (Waves). Notwithstanding the puerile title and the ridiculous cover, this is a much better record than the heavy-handed Broken China. A lazy late-night listen for all tastes. Wet Dream proves that Rick Wright can pen a tune equal to anything Waters, Gilmour or Mason ever put out. His limited output suggests, however, that unlike his industrious counterparts, Mr. Wright prefers to laze in the St. Tropez sun, which is exactly where this record takes you. Enjoy.
