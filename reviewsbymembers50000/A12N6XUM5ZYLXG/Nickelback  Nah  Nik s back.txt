 Good old Nik Kershaw. Those over 30 will remember him in the 80s ripping up the singles chart with family-friendly teen anthems like ~Wouldnt It be Good?, ~I Wont Let the Sun Go Down on Me', etc, etc., his small but cuddly frame the object of many youn g girls' dreams. By the sound of this record he threw away his ~How To Pen a Super Pop Hit manual and retreated to a dark place with only a batch of Beatles and Crowded House albums for company. A good move, for To Be Frank is one eyebrow-raiser of an al bum, absolutely brimming with catchy, heartwrenching and - be warned - addictive songs. Two things are clear here: he can write a tune as good as any Neil Finn composition, and hes also a fabulous guitarist, lyricist and arranger. He is not one of natures vocalists, however; his nasal, reedy voice can irritate at times, especially when he tries so darned hard. And quite what the record company were thinking when they came up with the cover - a sort of 70s Hipgnosis reject heavy metal album - and the stupid title, lord only knows. Still, this is a marvellous little record for lovers of good FM pop.  ~Jane Doe, ~Already There, ~Die Laughing and ~Show Them What Youre Made Of receive regular rotation on my home stereo and always have the same uplifting effect. I wonder what Howard Jones or the Thomson Twins are up to nowadays...-ï¿½
