 I must confess when I saw the MTV logo hovering ominously in the opening credits alarm-bells started ringing. But my fears were unfounded. This is a highly entertaining comedy about a teenage boy who decides he wants to be writer and applies to Stanford University with disastrous consequences, thanks to the well-meaning but spectacularly counterproductive efforts of an overprotective mother, neurotic father (John Lithgow), druggy brother (played by the fantastic Jack Black), an incompetent careers officer (Lily Tomin) and other assorted misfits, airheads and cheerleaders. Amiable, family-friendly farce with a star-studded cast including cameos by Ben Stiller, Kevin Kline and Chevy Chase and high feelgood factor. It???s Jack Black that gets the best laughs, however. There???s a bit where he summersaults over a bed in his underwear that has to be seen to be believed. If people are really like this in southern California then I???m there, dude!!
