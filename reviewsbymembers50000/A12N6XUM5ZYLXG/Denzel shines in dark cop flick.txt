 Training Day is a hard-hitting, no-holds-barred movie where idealism meets corruption in the LA police force. A brutal portrayal of narcotics detectives' approach to crime fighting. Denzel Washington is spellbinding as the experienced, cynical detective who takes rookie cop (Ethan Hawke) on his first day at work in the big bad city. There???s not much to laugh about here ??" comic interludes are few and far between ??" and if this is any indication of what goes on in LA, then its citizens should serio u sly consider moving to Alaska or Australia. I won???t spoil the movie for you but it provides an interesting look of moral codes and the whole good guys vs. bad guys schtick. Ethan Hawke is in my opinion a bit too blue-eyed and academic for the part. I would have liked to have seen Brad Pitt doing it, but maybe he???s too old. Keep some beer handy. You'll need a drink after this...
