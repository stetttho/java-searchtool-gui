 With a tidal wave of 70s remasters now hitting the "streets", what better time to rediscover some of the true greats? The Pink Fairies were English early 70s underground. They were true rock n roll idealists, which basically means they had a high street-cred factor, gave a lot of free concerts, smoked a lot of dope, didn't give a damn about industry success AND they had things to say about (gulp!) society. Needless to say, bands like that tend to take second prize to, say, Guns n Roses or Jon Bon Jovi. A shame because the Pinks had the songs, the talent and - importantly- the feck-you attitude to make a real impact. They were, for example, much better than Hawkwind, who ended up as the standard-bearers of the underground rock movement. Kings Of Oblivion, their third and last labum, is a PUNK rock beauty. Listen to City Kids: if that doesn't pre-empt the Sex Pistols I don't know what does. I Wish I Was a Girl is a soaring rocker in the mould of the Who, Chromium Plating is all  Alice Cooper sneer and Keith Moon drums and Larry Wallis on guitar who positively shines. Raceway is a proto-speed-metal instrumental and  Street Urchin sounds like T-Rex after way too much whiskey. Fans of studio slickness should stay away; the Pinks fire all on all six but are more Garageland than Hitsville. Sound?  Stooges, 13th Floor Elevators and the Who jamming at the all night sinsemilla party. Extra points for the interesting sleeve notes, one of the best covers in rock history and tasty bonus tracks (including single Well, Well, Well). The Pink Fairies may not have been the most successful band in the world, but they were definitely one of the hippest.
