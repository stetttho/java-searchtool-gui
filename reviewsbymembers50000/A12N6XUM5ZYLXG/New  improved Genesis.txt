 Released in 1971 Nursery Cryme is Genesis third album and sees the band finally playing with its definitive line-up. Mr. Phil Collins makes his first appearance on drums, new guitarist Steve Hackett helps fatten out the sound with his potent fretwork, ke yboard virtuoso Tony Banks and bassplayer Mike Rutherford reach new heights in songwriting and arranging while Peter Gabriel is a veritable fireworks of singing ability and deft phrasing. Nursery Cryme is not quite as good as Foxtrot or Selling England By The Pound - the band was still deveoping its sound - but has its fair share of strong moments. Return of The Giant Hogweed is an epic tale of giant predatory plants escape captivity to wreak a terrible revenge on the human race, and features that tradema rk Hammond organ sound that characterises early 70s music, Nursery Cryme (a live favourite) is probably the flagship song here - Genesis' Stairway to Heaven - although for my money, Fountain of Salmacis steals the show, a dazzling piece of songwriting and musicanship (Genesis still played this song live in the 80s), To sum up, Nursery Cryme is a varied and thoroughly enjoyable record, although Foxtrot I think has the edge when it comes to Gabriel-era Genesis.   oo
