 Lets face it " guitars are here to stay, and guitar pop is showing no signs of going quietly into that good night. So fans being raised on Strokes, Travis, Coldplay etc. are hereby advised to check out Britains best guitarpop ever, with perhaps the exception of the Smiths. This is as good a place to start as any. With the singles. A peach every one.  I really wish more people would give XTC a try. Fans of Britpop Elvis Costello, Squeeze, etc. will find plenty to cheer about. XTC have always been considered  just a bit too quirky for mainstream consumption, hence their relative anonymity. But lets face it, no one does ~quirky quite like the English, and no English band does quirky quite as well as XTC.  ï¿½
