 Advance word on this film was that it was really, really scary. It isn't. Not even remotely. The overriding emotion provoked by the Village is - besides a lingering a sense of unease - irritation and, to be quite frank, boredom. I won't spoil the plot but then again, there's not much of a plot to spoil. Even a blob of jelly could guess what the ending is. The Village is slow-paced, but lacks the tension and bite to counter balance it. William Hurt talks real slow - even slower than usual - and the rest of the cast wonder about the set like extras out of Little House on the Prairie. When the 'twist' at the end comes it is surely one of the biggest anticlimaxes since Y2K. So, if you want scary, check out The Grudge `cause this will most likely send you to sleep.
