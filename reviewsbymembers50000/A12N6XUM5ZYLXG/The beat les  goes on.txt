 Jason Falkner is one of the torch carriers of the Beatlesian pop ethic crafting clever, sophisticated nuggets in the tradition of Paul Mccartney and Elvis Costello - a far cry from the back-to-basics, amps-up-to-11, trash 'n roll that is in the ascendant. Classically-trained JF left cult combo Jellyfish to go solo. Which he's done with convincing results, not least on Presents: Author Unknown which is a more grown-up, expensive-sounding affair than previous hi-octane workouts Bliss Descending EP, for instance, which has the wonderful They Put Her in the Movies. With his last few records, Jason Falkner is, one senses, trying to bring this kind of pop aesthetic to the mainstream audience (I'd rather listen to him than Bryan Adams, for example). He certainly has all the tools at his disposal to carry it off. Talent seems to ooze from his every pore. His main weak selling point is his self-effacing profile; his records lack the kind of homogeneity that all major-selling albums are expected to have. It's top-of-the-line music but doesn't scream `Choose me!' when you browse through your CDs.  Typically with an artist like JF, you immediately try to spot the influences. His is a slick mid-Atlantic sound, not at all like the jangly but shambly Brit indie bands. Highlights include Miracle Medicine and She Goes to Bed but the whole record is pretty good.  The key word here is quality: it gleams with sheer quality - the songwriting, the arranging, the lyrics, the tunes are all quality personified. But trying to find the JF personality or soul in the music is a frustrating endeavour.
