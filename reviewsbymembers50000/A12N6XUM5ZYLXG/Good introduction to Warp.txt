 "We Are Reasonable People" is a compilation introduction to the wacky world of Warp. As such it is full of good, inventive, "cutting edge" (do we still use that term?) electronic music that flits across a variety of styles, From the avant-retro drone of Broadcast's `Hammer Without a Master" through Jimi Tenor's zany funk work-out, "Wear my Bikini" (er...fine) to an early Autechre piece "Stop Look Listen" that chatters like an old typewriter. No doubt all you groovy listeners will have your own favourites depending on which side you like your musical toast buttered. For me, the best track awards go to...........(cue drum roll) the spooky Squarepusher/AFX collaboration, "Freeman Hardy & Willis Acid" and a soothing Plaid track "Ilasas". Don't ask me to describe those tracks, just take my word, my word being `fabuloso'. One does wonder however, why those nice people at Warp couldn't have priced this CD like most samplers. i.e. not full price. No beef with the quality, however which is high, high, high. That Broadcast number does go on a bit, though. (There's no pleasing some people).
