 The Flashman books are a rip-roaring read. First-hand accounts of real historical events portrayed through the eyes of Flashman, everybody's favourite scoundrel. Flashman, a British cavalry officer, lies, fornicates, cheats, pleads and abuses his way thro ugh battles and uprisings and other major historical events always emerging the hero. But Flashman is no hero - he is a self-confessed coward with the morals of an alley cat. You'll love him! This, the first of the series, is perhaps the best. Flashy take s part in the first Afghan War with hilarious results. You also get the full background in the Flashman character. I've recommended this book to a few people and they all became instant converts, although I think men will find it more directly appealing t han women. Sexy, thrilling AND educational. British military history was never this much fun at school. ï¿½c
