 Moonmadness is the creative peak in Camel's career and one of the definitive progressive rock records of the 70s. The album's success can be attributed to a number of factors; fantastic songwriting, inspired production with Rhett Davies stripping down Camel's sound to just the basic instruments rather than building up complex orchestral layers like Genesis. This approach really works, creating a smooth, slightly ambient sound. Typically there are no hits to speak of (although Another Night was released as a single). The quality is high throughout, however, and there are no fillers. The highlights are numerous but Camel really soar on their instrumental outings like Lunar Sea and Chord Change, where Andy Latimer really lets rip on some dazzling solo guitar work, and showstopping ballads like Spirit of the Water.  The artwork too is sublime with a beautifully designed album cover, graphics and band photo. The remastered CD has some extra toons thrown in including a corking live performance of Lunar Sea, a wonderful demo version of Spirit of the Water, and an alternate version of Another Night. This is an album to love. I remember the radio commercial for this on Capital Radio when it first came out in 1976, to the strains of Aristillus a woman's voice saying: "Moonmadness, the dreamy new album from Camel..." Amen to that.
