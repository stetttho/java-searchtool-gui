 What a great project! Definitely one of the better ambient electronica releases of recent times. As professional and classy as you would expect from a Brian Eno project, but Drawn from Life is also clearly the work of two men who complement each other per fectly. Schwalms inventive beats and percussive figures forming a perfect bed of sound for Enos rich sonic tapestry. This is ambient with a beat " think a high-gloss Arovane or Dntel " and a superb music to snuggle up to on a Sunday night. But as opposed to Music for Airports, for example, this works best with active listening, preferably in the dark to soak up the brooding, nocturnal, lush atmospheres. Dont expect miracles: this needs at least one or two listenings to kick in. The rest, as they say, is plain sailing. Why only 4 stars? I don't like the vocally bits. I find them unwelcome, unecessary accessory (cheese alert) to this kind of music, regardless of whether its Laurie Anderson, Terrence Mckenna or Martin Luther King doing it. ��
