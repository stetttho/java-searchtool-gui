 The Blue Nile got their break when an Edinburgh hi-fi company, Linn Products accidentally heard a demo of Tinseltown in the Rain (which is on this album), and was so impressed it gave the band money to record an album. Everyone who was fortunate enough to hear this debut album, Walk Across the Rooftops, in 1983 became fans for life. Alhough Stay was a minor hit, the Blue Nile were never really a singles band and their fanbase remained small but devoted. The Blue Nile are particualrly good at slow ballads. The rhythm section is just a steady pitter-patter of drum machines, on top of which beautifully orchestrated horns, strings and synths spiral upwards, lifting the listener to new heights of musical wonder (yes its that good). This is not rock: think Sim ple Minds circa New Gold Dream or even  Frank Sinatra (with Nelson Riddle) or the soundtrack to a really classy 40s movie - lots of strings, low-key ambience and the jewel in the crown, Paul Buchanans achingly beautiful vocals. I predict Blue Nile will u ndergo a revival - Walk Across the Rooftops and the follow-up, Hats are just the kind of thing people today would think was great ~trip-hop or chill-out music.  Some of the tracks are more ambient pieces than songs  (Automobile Noise), but for my money Stay, Heatwave, Walk Across the Rooftops and the astounding Tinseltown in the Rain are four defining musical moments of the 80s.
