 I think a good way of differentiating good artists and exceptional artists is to see if you find yourself listening to the lyrics. Springteen passes this test, and so does Neil Young, who with this mellow 1992 release has never been better. It's a gentle album; cosy and relaxing. So relaxing, in fact, that I could quite happily drift off to sleep. The songwriting is top-drawer, the musicianship competent witout being flashy or pretentious and the backing vocals are gorgeous. Highlights? The opener, Unknown Legend is wonderful song about a girl who has never been able to grow roots anywhere, while Hank to Hendrix examines cutural attachments to the past. Harvest Moon deserves the five stars simply because it is everything that a Neil Young record should be and then some. Best not to play it in your car when night-driving, however, or you might wake up with a steering wheel wrapped round your head.
