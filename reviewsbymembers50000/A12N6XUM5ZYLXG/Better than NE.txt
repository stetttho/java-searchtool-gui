 Northern Exposure West Coast is the second in the distinguished series by Digweed/Sasha partnership. I was rather disappointed with the first Northern Exposure (the one everybody raves about/to) because at times it is rather like listening to uptempo new age music: high gorgonzola content but very little meat. The West Coast CD is another matter. Deep and danceable, but still with that trademark smoothness and dreamy ambience. I wouldn't call this trance, it's just a seamless of mix of superb instrumental dance music. It rocks. It also sounds as good with your morning coffee as it would down a sweaty club... I suppose this kind of music is getting out of date now, but Northern Exposure West Coast will still sound good for a few years.
