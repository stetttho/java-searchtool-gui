 While many 70s bands are mocked for their fantasy-inspired approach to rock music (Wishbone Ash, Yes, Uriah Heep), Led Zeppelin got away with it. Why? Simply because they were one of the few bands since the Beatles who could do no wrong. They were untouchable. Proof? What other band could make an album as weak as Houses of the Holy and get away with it? Led Zep III and IV saw the band veering away from their power blues style showcased on I and II and dusting off their mandolins and folk songbooks. In my opinion - and I seem to be the only one that thinks so - the folky songs and the blues numbers do not go well together. III has two absolute scorchers: Since I've Been Loving You and Immigrant Song. The rest is (and always has been) thoroughly overrated, and that includes Tangerine, Gallow's Pole, etc. And I hate the cover. But it's a matter of taste, after all, 8,000,000,000,000 rock fans can't be wrong, etc. etc.  ï¿½
