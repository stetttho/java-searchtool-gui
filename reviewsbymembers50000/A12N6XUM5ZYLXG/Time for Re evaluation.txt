 The popular view among  electronic hipsters seems to be that Orbital's golden period was Orbital 2, Snivilisation and In-Sides, a time during which the duo did indeed add remarkable depth to their sound. The time is ripe to re-evaluate this view, however. While I agree that the last two releases - Middle of Nowhere and the Altogether - veer more towards "serious" music and fail to capture the excitement of Orbital 2, the inventiveness of Snivilisation or the sheer scope of In-Sides, Orbital 1 towers above them all in terms of sheer musical power. Don't believe me? Just listen to it with fresh ears. In 10 years time, the 'Green' album will be regarded as Orbital's best album, with the brown album (Orbital 2) and In-Sides jostling for second place. There's a musical sheen and homogeniety to this album that is comparable to Beatles' Sgt. Pepper. And like that record can be enjoyed in a single listen from start to finish, which, in my opinion, just isn't possible with the sprawling Snivilisation or In-Sides. In short Orbital 1's strength lies in its homogeneity, purity and excitement. Not just a cult rave album, then, but a must in any CD collection.
