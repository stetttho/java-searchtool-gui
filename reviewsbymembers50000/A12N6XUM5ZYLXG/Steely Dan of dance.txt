 I don't know how I got around to buying this. I'm not really a dance music fan. And I'm at least two generations clear of the whole house/trance scene. Anyway, I'm glad I did.  The Global Underground concept is, as I understand it, to provide high-quality seamless progressive house mixes - by the world's top DJs - that are great for either dancing to or listening to at home. If European dance music had been this good in the 80s, New Order would have never stood a chance. The sound is magnificent, the grooves infectious and tasteful, and the transitions between songs silky smooth.  I've got the Sasha Ibiza record too, which seems to be the most popular GU, but Nick Warren's Amsterdam is EVERY bit as good. Trance/house can get a bit Euro-cheese sometimes (which teenagers like, apparently) and in fact the GU sampler, `Arrivals' has quite a lot of it for some strange reason.  Nick Warren seems to be more, shall we say, "adult-oriented" in that respect. The Steely Dan of dance.  The CD 1 starts mellow and builds up to a chugging groove. CD 2 starts out pedal-to-the-metal and keeps going sending you to beat heaven. I've never quite mastered the difference between 'trance' and 'house' (if someone could explian that to me I would be grateful) but whichever it is that Nick Warren does, it works for me. It's all instrumental too which I like, except for the odd spoken sample.  This is a great buy. Highly recommended.
