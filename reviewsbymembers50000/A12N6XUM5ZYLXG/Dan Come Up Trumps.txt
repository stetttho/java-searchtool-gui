 Listening to the remastered Steely Dan CDs, I am struck with an overwhelming feeling that the early albums have aged better than the last few. The Royal Scam, for example, was meticulously crafted and painstakingly produced. Like Aja, it's something of a behemoth, an overpolished diamond, but lacks the rough 'n ready but sheer cavalier brilliance of Countdown to Ecstasy. Right from Bodhisattva, the gleam is in the eye, the pedal is on the metal, you can almost smell the smoke and empty take-away cartons in the studio, while Aja sounds like it was recorded in a bank vault under the supervision of men in white coats. Paradoxically, it is often the most expensively produced albums that age the worst (this applies particularly to some records cut in the 80s). Countdown's timelessness lies in its off-the-cuff, humorous and rootsy feel (I don't know what 'rootsy' means but it sounds about right). It doesn't take itself too seriously. That said, Razor Boy, Boston Rag and Pearl of the Quarter are gems of sophisticated songwriting and arrangement, while the hits My Old School and Showbiz Kids still sound great. Like Katy Lied, Countdown is a record you can slap on, make a cup of tea, roll a cigarette and sit down and listen to all the way through and have a smile. The new sleeve notes, courtesy of Messrs. Fagan and Becker are a great read, and the kind of thing that keeps a great relationship between band and fans burning for generations to come. Thanks guys.
