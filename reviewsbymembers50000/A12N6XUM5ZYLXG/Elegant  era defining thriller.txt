  Play Misty for Me sees Clint Eastwood (who also makes his directorial debut here) play a DJ at a west-coast jazz radio station. One night he attracts the attentions of a female admirer whom he duly beds. Big mistake. The girl turns out to be a total psycho, and the consequences of one night's rumpy-pumpy are described in full. Recognise the concept? Of course you do, it's Dangerous Liaisons with less graphic violence and more charm. OK, some of the early 70s schtick dialogue occasionally grates ("How was your coffee?" "Too much!") but all-in-all I enjoyed this trip back to 1971 with all the trimmings. What I like about Play Misty for Me is that it doesn't try to scare the audience into submission like its bunny-rabbit-bothering counterpart; it has plenty of suspense but relies more on Hitchcockian tension than heart-attack-inducing shock tactics.  Clint Eastwood has a great look in this movie (the sideburns alone are worth the admission fee), some of the music is first rate and the rocky California coastline (much in evidence here) is a perfect counterpoint to the unpleasantness of the main plotline, the jagged rocky cliffs mirroring perhaps the mental state of the lady stalker. This is by no means the towering masterpiece that Dirty Harry was, but a seductive little thriller that fits snugly onto the Highly Recommended shelf.  This is my second-favourite Clint Eastwood movie after Dirty Harry, and if you're planning on a Clint Eastwood movie night I would recommend these two and perhaps The Beguiled as a third choice.
