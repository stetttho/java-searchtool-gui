 This is a film that can be divided up into 2 main sections: the sunny romantic half and the watery disaster half. All my friends advised me to fastforward the first hour and enjoy the action at the end. Actually I rather enjoyed the love intrigue section (Kate Winslet is wonderful), and found myself yawning towards the end. Visually this is a fantastic film. No complaints here. At times Titanic dips close to TV movie territory with wooden acting, and high cheese content, and will therefore disappoint a lot of people who have high expectations. Another 'Gone With the Wind' this is not. I was surprised because James Cameron usually delivers the goods when it comes to a thrilling cinema experience. Still, a lot of people , mostly teenage girls, really liked it so you'll have to make your own mind up. Girls should bring kleenex and boys coffee.
