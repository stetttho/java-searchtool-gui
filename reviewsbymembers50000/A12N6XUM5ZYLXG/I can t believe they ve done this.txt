 The concept of Pink Floyd's greatest hits is encumbered with two key flaws. 1) Pink Floyd never had any hits. They were an albums band. This endeavour is therefore a bit like trying to release Mahler - 20 Golden Greats or the Brian Eno - the Ultimate Collection. I suppose the good thing is that this release might help turn younger people on to the band, but this purpose would best be served by re-releasing the best albums in a cut-price  version. 2) The selection is dodgy. In my opinion they should have skipped EVERYTHING after the Wall, as artistically there is nothing that even comes close to the band's 60s and 70s output.  What's more I believe that some of these songs can only really be appreciated in the context of their albums. Money, for example, relies on the rest of Dark Side for its impact, so does Wish You Were Here. And...ah what the hell. I could go on until the cows come home. I would heartily recommend you getting Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and Piper at the Gates of Dawn.
