 Surprisingly good album, this. I say surprisingly because normally this kind of prog/pop crossover endeavour is a complete waste of everybodys time (see "supergroup" Keats). Battle Lines sees former King Crimson/UK/Asia vocalist/bass player tackle a more radio-friendly set of songs with surprisingly good results.  Wettons foghorn tenor is, as always, a delight.  One of the strongest rock voices in the world I would say, and definitely the main reason for listening to this album.  Theres nothing wrong with the musicianship on this record, either, or the mighty production, or, for that matter, the glorious harmony vocals. The drummer is majestic, for example, and the Wetton plays a mean bass as always. Which is more than can be said of the guitarist, whose uncontrolled soloing on the fade-out to Jane is an abomination. John Wettons voice, however, is highly suited to this kind of  poppier material, which leans towards Totoesque synth-driven rock. There are exhilarating highlights (Jane, Walking on A ir, Hold Me Now) and filler (Sand in My Hand " great title...NOT!), but all in all Im really glad I heard this. But more than anything Battle Lines is a strong indication that, with the right songwriting and production help, Wetton could be a major playe r on the commercial rock circuit. Which wouldnt be a bad thing. uu
