 Nursery Cryme was Genesis's first album with Phil Collins on drums and Steve Hackett as guitarist. It is a radical departure from the pastoral Trespass, but signalled a new, tighter, more aggressive era. Nursery Cryme may not be as consistent and as successful as its successor, Foxtrot, but it has moments of sheer genius. Fountain of Salmacis and the awesome Return of the Giant Hogweed are classics while Harold the Barrell and Harlequin showcase the quirkier, more eccentric, English-whimsy side of the band. One thing: get it on vinyl if you can - the CD does not do the music justice.
