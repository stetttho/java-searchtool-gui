 There seems to be two kinds of Wire fans - lovers of the punky, jagged early Wire (Pink Flag, Chairs Missing) and fans of the 80s synth-art-rock Wire (Ideal Copy/Bell is a Cup/Manscape). I prefer the synth-art-rock Wire; the austere, glacial soundscapes provide the perfect backdrop for the band's dreamlike poetical lyrics. I couldn't help noticing that the average rating for Ideal Copy among other reviewers is low. This is I think a misleading indicator of this particular oeuvre. Not only is Ideal Copy regarded in many circles as being the best Wire album period, being preferred to the more polished A Bell is a Cup..., it is songwise an absolute stunna. All the Wire hits are here in their original versions: Over Theirs - a titanic, unstoppable juggernaut of a song "Something snaps/Over and over/Just below the skyline/Just out of sight"; Ahead  (voted by the fans at the best Wire tune) a fast-paced anthem with severe hit potential; Public Place is a truly harrowing experience - in a good way - but too mesmerising to turn off (Wire later did a more airbrushed version on their live album IBTABA). Things cheer up a bit with Ambitious - a foot-tapping (shades of Depeche Mode here) number complete with driving, rock-solid drum rhythm courtesy of ace sticksman Robert Gotobed. Madman's Honey and Point of Collapse are rich in swooning melody but the gothic, enigmatic public-sector greyness keeps it from going gooey (my kind of recipe). If you've never heard Wire before think Cure without the whining singing or a more polished, happier Joy Division. Apparently post-punk is coming back in style - if so the Ideal Copy is going to be getting some serious rotation. Impress your friends by staying one step ahead.
