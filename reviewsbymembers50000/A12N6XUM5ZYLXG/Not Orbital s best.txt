 Orbital's third full-length release sees this pioneering duo veering away from pure dance euphoria of Orbital 2 towards the murky waters of social comment. While it is laudable that a genre such as techno progresses and develops, this does not always mean that the music becomes more listenable. This album's diversity is also its main weakness. Experimental tracks such as Science Friction, Philosophy by Numbers and Kein Trink Wasser actually become more irritating after repeated listening. Even the two concluding tracks, the ever-popular Are We Here and Attached, come across as somewhat...well...unsuccessful, mainly due to the indiscriminate use of samples vocal snippets in the former track. Forever and Sad But True are more conventionally ambient/techno style and definitely the best I think. Which is more than can be said for the cover - an unappetizing grey mess of surreal social "commentary". I've yet to hear In-Sides, but if it continues in this vein I think I'll pass and go back to drooling over my Australian import Orbital 2 CD.
