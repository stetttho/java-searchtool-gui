 This is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. It is I think quite different from US movies in that the comedy does not come from a witty script but from slapstick and absurd situations executed with real flair. The actors are marvellous, Jean Reno in my opinion taking second prize to Christian Clavier who plays both his roles with jaw-dropping skill. There is so much comic detail in this film that it works best second time. And this is a great family film: the nippers will be as delighted as I trust you will be. A treasure.
