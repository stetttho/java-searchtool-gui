 While theres no doubt that Saving Private Ryan made an invaluable contribution to the war movie genre, utilising new technology and an up-close, in-your-face approach to deglorify war, the movie still lurches uncomfortably close to the clichï¿½ zone towards the end when comic-book scenarios and stereotypes abound. I know too little about the politics of Hollywood to guess why this happens " studio pressure? US vs. European film culture? Still, its miles better than the former D-Day benchmark movie, The Longest Day, and shows the sheer scope and depth of Spielbergs vision. Nothing wrong with the acting performances either, with Tom Hanks as always superb and ably supported by a cast of young actors (bizarrely, some last seen on TV sitcom Friends).
