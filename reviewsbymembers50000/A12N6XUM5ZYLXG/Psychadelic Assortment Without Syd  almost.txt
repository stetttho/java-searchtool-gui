 Pink Floyds second album, 1968's Saucerful of Secrets had the odds stacked against it. With main songwriter Syd Barrett out of the loop, the compositional chores were left to Waters, Wright, Mason and new guitarist (and friend of Syds) David Gilmour. Th e result may understandably not be quite as consistent as its predecessor Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, but it is an intriguing record nevertheless with some great moments. Gone with Mr. Barrett is the whimsy and two-minute splashes of colour. Pink Floyd se t the controls and headed into the direction which would see full fruition on albums such as Meddle and Ummagumma. The title track - a colossal experimental piece in three parts - is the flagship of this new direction; an often atonal, eerie escapade which culminates in the concluding hymn-like passage of unparalleled cheesiness. Personally I prefer the humorous jab at military pretension, Corporal Clegg (~Mrs. Clegg you must be proud of him/Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin?), the pastoral ~Remember a Day, the languid, sun-drenched ~See Saw and the definitive version of ~Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun complete with those excellent seagull sounds! Syd Barrett makes a brief appearance to contribute the closing number, the truly cosmic, ~Jugband Blues which is probably the most compelling conclusion to any album bar Sgt. Peppers ~A Day in a Life. To sum up, then, Saucerful Of Secrets is a hotchpotch of dark, ambient experimentation and catchy 60s psychaedelia. I like it simply because it is a great document of a band tearing up its roots and heading for pastures new. And clearly loving every minute of it.ï¿½
