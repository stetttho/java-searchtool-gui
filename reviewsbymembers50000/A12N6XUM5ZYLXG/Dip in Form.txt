 While Countdown to Ecstasy and Katy Lied are direct hits, instant classics, Pretzel is (although I seem to be the only one who thinks so) a trickier proposition to get to know. I have only listened to this record a few times, but find it more uneven than either Katy Lied or Countdown. For me none of the songs on offer here stand out in their own right, and stylistically the Dan seem to become temporarily dislodged from the songwriting perfection and sleak sound of the other two albums mentioned above. Of all the Dan albums I own, this is the least played.
