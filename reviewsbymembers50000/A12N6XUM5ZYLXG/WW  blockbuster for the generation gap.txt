 The importance in Battle of Britain lies not in its special effects nor its graphic depictions of aerial carnage, but in the fact that it remains - after 33 years -  the definitive movie about this pivotal event in British history. Furthermore those who have seen it before can enjoy the crisp digital remaster - no crackles or pops, guaranteed. There's something to appeal to everyone here, there's love interest, comic relief aplenty; an understated, semi-documentary feel to the scenes where top-level decisions are taken and a James Bond-like slickness to the action scenes. The Germans are, of course, portrayed in time-honoured fashion, ugly brutes or fancy, jackboot-wearing cissies, but if you get into the sprit of the film you soon forget that and just enjoy it. And here's a great chance to see the great Sir Lawrence Olivier ham it up beautifully with the few lines he has. Robert Shaw is really good as the in-your-face squadron leader who don't take no bull from no one. I can really recommend this movie, it will appeal to young movie fans, history students and the old fuddies who saw it the first time around in 1972.
