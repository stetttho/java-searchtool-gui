 Judging from the trailer, I thought this was going to be another film in the mould of Saving Private Ryan, except with the action taking place on the eastern front in Stalingrad. I should have known better. With heart-throb duo, Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes heading up the cast with their dreamy looks, Enemy at the Gates is not really war movie at all but a far-fetched, wafer-thin romantic "chickflick" with a few battle scenes thrown in to provide the historical setting. They shouldn't have bothered. I was bitterly disappointed. It starts promisingly enough but after about half an hour leaves you fumbling for the vom bucket. I hope Pearl Harbour isn't as bad as this, which is the kind of thing that makes you want to watch the entire Sam Pekinpah back-catalogue in one sitting.
