 As most of you know who have skimmed through various Autechre reviews, this group has generally been classified into early "accessible" Autechre and late "difficult" Autechre. Understandable since the band's early output was generally a bit quieter than recent material and less concerned with "noise". Personally I find some of the later stuff, EP7 , for example, just as good as Amber: my problem is one of concentration. I often find it hard to sustain any kind of concentration for more than about 35 minutes, before my ears want a change of music. That's why Anti EP is probably the most often-played Autechre disc. Its three tracks are all great, although the fade-out to Flutter  is a thing of extraordinary beauty. Musically, Anti EP also fits somewhere between the early and late Autechre, which means it's a fairly lively affair but is stilll pretty laid back. A good. consistant release, then.
