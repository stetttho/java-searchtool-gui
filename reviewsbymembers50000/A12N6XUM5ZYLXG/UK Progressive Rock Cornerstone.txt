 Many Genesis fans seem to agree that Selling England By The Pound (1973) is the best of the Gabriel-era albums. And its hard to disagree, with live favourites Cinema Show and Firth of Fifth heading up a solid set of songs. After this, Genesis would delve into post-modern conceptual experimentation (Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, 1974 ), after which Gabriel left the group for solo pastures green. This, then, is the last of the holy trinity of early-Genesis albums, the others being Foxtrot (1972) and Nursery Cryme (1971).. Selling England is an ambitious album whose key theme " the destruction of traditional English values at the hands of advancing corporate and industrial forces " is expressed in songs as diverse as they are eccentric. Thus we get epic satire on gang-war (Battle of Epping Forest), a 3-minute pop song (I Know What I Like) and theres even time for a rare, early lead vocal by Phil Collins (More Fool Me). On the other hand, Ive always thought I Know What I Like an abomination in the Genesis catalogue, and personally prefer the Seconds Out versions of both Firth of Fifth and Cinema Show (except for the gorgeous piano intro on the former). On the other hand, this is definitely one of Genesis most accomplished albums and is listenable from start to finish " which is more than be said of the Lamb Lies Down, or any Genesis record made after 1980, for that matter. To sum up, one of the top UK progressive rock albums ever.8
