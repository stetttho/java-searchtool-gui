 Probably the most interesting record I have heard in a long time. This is a must-listen for anyone interested in ambient music, simply because it is primarily a work of texture rather than melodies or grooves, (see also Brian Enos Music for Airports) In ot her words, Pop has a tactile quality that gives rise to a different kind of listening experience. On the surface, Pop is a pretty smooth ride. Think: a string section of a huge symphony orchestra playing the same chord repeatedly, forming a sweeping expanse of noise. Think: Wagner with severe short-term memory loss. All the tracks on this album are just variations of one theme: beat, no beat, slowed-down, speeded-up, different instruments coming in, but always the same steady orchestral pulse (and white noise?), which makes this good to have on while you are working, for example. Repeated listening, however, reveals superstructural details - harmonies, fragments of melody, a constantly evolving sound picture. Gas, incidentally, is one of German electro nica pioneer Wolfgang Voigts (Mike Ink) aliases .Vorsprung durch teknik, indeed.
