 Bitter Moon is one hell of a ride. A sizzling hotpot of[]jealousy, desire, revenge, wanton cruelty and lust. And that's just the opening credits.  It's a great story, well told, with the kind of black humour situations where you don't really know whether to laugh or cry. I bitterly regret not having seen it before - as usual the trailer put me off. Bitter moon is a[]film which is great to watch with your partner (well, I thought so anyway). Peter Coyote puts in his best ever performance as a frustrated American writer trying to be Henry Miller in Paris. And failing. Hugh Grant is in it, but don't let that put you off the gorgeous Kristin "English Patient" Scott-Thomas makes up for it. Polanski has a talent for putting the knife in and twists it around some. And we love him for it. Get the disk. Hit play. And hold on.
