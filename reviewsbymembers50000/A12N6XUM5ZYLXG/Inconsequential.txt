 In my opinion AHM is not a classic Pink Floyd album. Musically it's just not as sharp as its successors, Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here. It is very similar to Meddlein  its understatedness but lacks its consistency and strength (Roger Waters himself does not speak very highly of it at all). It is however, an important record in that it bridges the gap between early, psychedelic Floyd and the mid-seventies, FM-friendly period. It is the sound of a band leaving the 60s behind and consolidating their success with  more....ahem...mature fare. The title track is highly unremarkable, with a brass band parping away at some inconsequential melody while the massed choir does its thing to equally negligible effect. Highpoints include Summer '68 and Fat Old Sun - the rest is filler. I know. Criticising Pink Floyd records is a very risky business but I genuinely believe that Pink Floyd's winning streak came with Meddle and ended with - at a push - Animals. oink, oink.
