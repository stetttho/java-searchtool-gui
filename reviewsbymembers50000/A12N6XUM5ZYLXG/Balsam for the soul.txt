 West Coast music never really caught on in Britain in the 70s. In the US, on the other hand, Anglo rock behemoths like Led Zep, Stones, Bad Company, etc. didnt stand a chance next to the seductive charms of Linda Ronstadt, Eagles, Carly Simon, Fleetwood Mac, Joni Mitchell, etc.  James Taylors Gorilla is one of the best mid-70s soft rock albums. It comes from the period when Mr. Taylor had hit a purple patch songwriting-wise and was consolidating his position as one of USAs top recording artists. Like so many of his albums from that period like In The Pocket, it is a filler-free zone. Here we have mid-tempo nuggets like Mexico (check those harmony vocals!!), bitter-sweet confessions (I Was a Fool to Care, You Make it Easy), a truly glorious cover of a soul classic (How Sweet It Is), and sad, quiet interludes of unmatched tenderness like Wandering and Sarah Maria where Taylor in troubadour mode is transcendent, displaying a vulnerability and humanity that warms the deepest recesses of the soul. As backing vocalists, Taylor engages the services of friends and lovers (David Crosby and Carly Simon respectively) and the best musicians in town like Steve Gadd ensure that the whole thing swings like a mutha. Simply put, Gorilla is accomplished but relaxed, polished but sensual, sophisticated but almost painfully human. Gorilla is a slice of West Coast paradise. Come as you are and bring your own Margaritas.
