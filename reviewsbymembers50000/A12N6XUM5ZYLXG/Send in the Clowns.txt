 With Mark Hollis' debut album having driven me half way to suicide it was with some trepidation that I approached the Talk Talk back catalogue. After the commercially and artistically successful Colour of Spring, Tim Friese-Green-produced Spirit of Eden s aw Talk Talk abandoning traditional songwriting techniques - to the horror of their record company - and taking a big, brave step towards dry ambient soundscapes of eloquent silences, single notes left to resonate and improvised musical noodlings. Largely a return to acoustic instruments, Spirit of Eden introduces a world of remarkable softness (soft is the new loud?) and quiet moments followed by sudden explosions of released tension. It's intriguing, groundbreaking stuff. The standout track, I Believe in You is a song of rare beauty (check out the boys' choir coming in at the end), while closing number, Wealth is a gentle piano piece with Holliss fragile and pleading voice soaring over the top. But Spir it of Eden is not a feelgood album and does not make for good post/pre-party listening.  It's a work full of sadness, despair and introspection, meticulously crafted (it took two years and god only knows how many miles of tape to complete), beautifully played but very, very serious. It's an album that demands to be taken seriously. Hollis himself makes a reference to heroin addiction in I Believe in You, which may help explain the innate bleakness of the music. But, incredibly, Spirit of Eden is like Weird Al Yankowitz compared to what came later.  I w ould advise novices to try Colour of Spring first, and then Spirit of Eden, and if you like that direction, go for Laughing Stock and Mark Hollis. T
