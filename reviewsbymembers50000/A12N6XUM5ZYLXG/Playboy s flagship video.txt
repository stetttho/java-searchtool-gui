 Naturals is one of the best Playboy video productions out there. You can tell they've really tried with this one; the footage is tastefully edited together for seamless viewing and you get a lot of content for your money. The music is - unusually for Playboy - perfectly acceptable; Hef, it seems, has finally seen sense in using musicians and artists that can actually write, perform and sing in tune (the music on some of the playmate profile videos, for instance, is execrable). Many of the songs sound like Black Velvet as guitarists fly up and down the fretboard and try to sound like Jimi Hendrix. The show's hosts include Daphne Duplaix and Rachael Jean Martin - a good choice; both the aforementioned playmates are naturals in front of the camera and do not come across as the vacuous blondes that normally dominate the magazine's pages. Many of the segments are taken from previous Playboy films, this actually works quite well because the selection is reassuringly competent and, as I said before, beautifully edited. Playboy videos are on the whole fairly uneven but this is one of the good ones.
