 Despite his fiery guitar-playing, his stunning live performances and his single-minded adherence to the true spirit of rock n roll, Rory Gallagher (from Ballyshannon in Ireland) never made the big league, never getting the full backing of his record comp any. A shame, because here is a guy who liked his blues rough and raw. Add passionate fretboard work; songwriting savvy;  a high-octane, souped up Stratocaster to the formula and you have rock heaven. The keyword is energy. It literally oozes out of the speakers.  Follow Me is impressive by any standards. When the rhythm section of Gerry Macavoy (bass) and Ted McKenna (drums) kicks in, the energy and power is extraordinary. Keychain, Wayward Child and Bad Penny are other highlights, with Rory laying down the blues as though he invented it, and adding to the blistering blues licks an unmistakable Celtic tone that makes Rory Gallagher a truly unique blues/rock artist. Although not all the songs on the album live up to Follow Me (and points off for the unecessary bonus tracks), and Rorys vocals are more rough and ready than accomplished, those who want an introduction to one of the worlds top blues/rock Strat-toting guns, who died just a few years ago long before his time was up,  should check out Top Priority..
