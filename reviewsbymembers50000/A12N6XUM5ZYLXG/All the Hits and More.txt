 With XTC's back catalogue now consisting to 99% of compilations and demo versions, it is quite clear that the band is content to pursue its relationship with its small but keen and devoted fanbase. Those of you who have not heard XTC before, would do best to check out their late 70s-early 80s output, a period when the band was a relevant, creative and era-defining musical force alongside more established artists such as Elvis Costello and Joe Jackson. This kind of music is generally described sing words like "poppy", "quirky", "quintessentially English", etc. And it is. But, XTC are not really that far removed from US alternative rock acts like Toad the Wet Sprocket, Sixpence None the.....Weezer, Three O'Clock, Elliot Smith. Music that owes more to Beatles, Beach Boys and Noel Coward than Elvis Presley and Motown. This BBC live album a essential for lots of reasons: you get the band at its very peak (1980) and the songs are played with incredible energy but there's a still a crystal clear sound, a great atmosphere (it's like you're there) not to mention blistering live versions of Life Begins at the Hop, Making Plans for Nigel and This is Pop. As a seasoned XTC fan I love this record, but I heartily recommend it to lovers of good guitar pop in general.
