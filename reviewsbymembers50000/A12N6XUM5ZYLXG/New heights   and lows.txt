 Steely Dan soar to new heights of sonic perfection. Gone is the swagger of Katy Lied and Countdown to Ecstasy, instead you get crisp FM hits such as Haitian Divorce and remarkable epic journeys like the title track. Don't Take Me Alive, Royal Scam and Kid Charlemagne are worth the price of this album alone, even though a couple of the songs (Caves of Altamira, Sign in Stranger) come dangerously close to polished anonymity. More expensive-sounding than its predecessors but slightly lacklustre in places, Royal Scam can be said to belong more to the Aja, Gaucho end of the Steely Dan sound than the earlier stuff. The cover is dreadful - what were they thinking of? - but once again the Dan duo turn in a set of newly written sleevenotes that are interesting and entertaining, although at times a tad grandiloquent. The musicianship is, as on every other Dan record, pretty tight to put it mildly. The backing vocals on Don't Take Me Alive are absolutely mind-blowing.
