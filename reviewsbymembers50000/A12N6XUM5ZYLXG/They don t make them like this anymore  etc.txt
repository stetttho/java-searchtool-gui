 John Huston's big-screen take on an old Rudyard Kipling morality tale has achieved cult status in many quarters (due largely to poor availability) and has been bit of a well-kept secret, a movie that connoisseurs and speccy alternative types can truly call their own. But not for much longer, however. A larger audience awaits. Which is a good thing. Why should a movie this good be kept out of the public eye? Sean Connery and Michael Caine, then at the top of their trades, play off extremely well against other, like old friends who seem to be having the time of their lives.  The old Ghurkha soldier who appears half-way through is a real comic tour-de-force. This is an epic movie, in the same mould as Ben-Hur and Spartacus, but without the overacting and the self-importance. In fact, the lead role here is the story (the actors just do their bit to move things along) and the breathtaking scenery. Load up on pop-corn, assemble the family and then irritate everyone by saying that they don't make movies like this anymore.
