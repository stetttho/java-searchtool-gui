 The most important album Genesis ever recorded. And in my view their best bar none. Left in the lurch  - or so they believed - by Peter Gabriel, the boys went straight back into the studio to write new songs. New writing teams emerged, Banks and Rutherford in particular shouldering the compositional responsibility. Meanwhile, a new vocalist had to be found, and auditions were duly held. When a suitable replacement singer failed to materialise, Mrs. Collins suggested to Phil that he might take over as chief songbird, as he already was the bands chief backing vocalist, and a very good one at that. Phil was initially reluctant but eventually put the idea to Tony, Mike and Steve who, after much scepticism and discussion, put Phil to the test. Needless to say it all went splendidly and critics and public alike warmed to the new-look Genesis, heralding Trick of the Tail as a triumphant return to form.  Keen to try his solo wings, Peter Gabriel had sensed for some time that pastoral progressive rock was a thing of the past. This partly explains the very un-proggy urban distopian imagery he concocted for ambitious and somewhat unwieldy The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974). Messrs Collins, Rutherford, Banks and Hackett did not agree. Thus the return to English fairy-tale whimsy and storybook fantasy that Trick of the Tail (1976) heralded. This album is largely acoustic, with 12-string guitars, flutes mellotron, harpsichords and silky harmonies weaving a gentle sound that seduces and caresses and shows that Genesis had never been better. There is absolutely no filler here. My only complaint is that the version of Squonk is vastly inferior to the live one that subsequently appeared on Seconds Out. Tony Banks two compositions, Mad Man Moon and Trick of the Tail are absolute stunners, the former an epic saga that dips and weaves at every turn and the latter, perhaps my favourite Genesis song of all time.
