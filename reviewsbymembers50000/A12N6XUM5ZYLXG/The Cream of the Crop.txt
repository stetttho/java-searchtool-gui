 Novices to Hawkwind have the Herculean task of deciding which of the 113 or so releases (of which around 80 are compilations and live albums) clocked up by the band they should start with. Well look no further. QS&C is widely recognised as Hawkwind's masterpiece. The "All Killer, No Filler" tag certainly applies here - all the tracks are outstanding  The music, Rob Calvert's lyrics, the sound - all top drawer. In fact, I would venture to suggest that Hawkwind was not quite the same without Mr. Calvert as he added a degree of intelligence and wit to the band that, without him, could at times sound a bit moronic. Compare the brilliant sci-fi clone song Spirit of the Age ("If you had ever seen us, you'd rejoice in your uniqueness and consider every weakness, something special of your own") with, say Silver Machine from the earlier Calvert-less line-up ("I've got a silver machine, and I'm feeling mean"). I know a lot of Hawkwind fans like the mindlessness of the early stuff but I would strongly advise anybody starting out with Hawkwind to check out this album. Don't take my word for it, listen to the Amazon.com samples.
