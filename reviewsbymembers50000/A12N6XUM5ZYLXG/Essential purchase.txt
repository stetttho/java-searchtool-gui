 The first Alien movie is a sci-fi/horror crossover classic. And sequels generally suck. But not this one. Aliens upped the ante in most departments: more blood, more guns, more action,  more...er...aliens. Sigourney Weaver's back as the talented Miss Ripley, but this time it's personal - she knows what these aliens are capable of. So when there's alien trouble on a distant colony she's all for nuking the whole planet into eternity. But it's not to be: slimeball corporate civilian type wants to trap one of the aliens and smuggle it back to earth and make a killing. Ripley advises him that he will make a killing, all right, but it won't be the dollars and cents kind. Enter the US Marines: band of mean muthas with the kind of weaponry that would make any terrestrial enemy beg for mercy. And so battle commences and the US Marines take second prize. But the real enemy isn't the aliens... This is the No. 1 sci-fi/action movie. Quite how Cameron manages to squeeze so much action, destruction and nail-biting suspense (and humour - check the lift scene at the end)  into a 2-hour movie is amazing. The guy's a genius, but it's all down to formula, of course; take the original Alien concept, add more aliens, more hardware, more gimmicky inventions, and just make it all bigger and better. But James Cameron also manages to pull off a remarkable feat: every time you think it's all over and the big climax has come and gone, the action just keeps on coming. And when you think it's over, there's even more. Fantastic value for money plain and simple.  The acting performances are great, too. Bill Paxton is in good form as the gung-ho soldier who gets slightly less gung-ho when the going gets tough. And Sigourney simply kicks ass. The effects are, needless to say, absolutely stunning. Simply put Aliens is quite possibly the best action movie of all time. Kick-ass.
