 Listen Branson, Ive got a great idea. Lets send one of our best UK pop/rock groups (yeah, XTC, theyre on your label) back to 1967 under a different name to record new songs using authentic  equipment and contemporary songwriting styles. You know both Moulding and Partridge are real 60s connoisseurs, grew up listening to this stuff and are just chomping at the bit to pay tribute. They said they want to do some tunes in the vein of Beach Boys, Syd Barrett, Beatles, all those guys. Whats it going to be called? 25 OClock...and yeah itll have a groovy cover. Well it may not break world sales records but is a gem for fans of XTC and with titles like My Love Explodes, What in the World? and Your Gold Dress, for any fans of mid-60s psychadelia in general. Chances are therell be an even better follow-up. "
