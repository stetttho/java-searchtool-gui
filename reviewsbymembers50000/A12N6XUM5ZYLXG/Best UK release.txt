 Despite being lumbered with one of the worst names in rock history (apart from Bankstatement) UK were a force to be reckoned with (on the progressive circuit anyway). On this live album (in Japan, where else??) they are reduced to a trio. Ex-King Crimson vocalist Wetton contributes bass guitar and his distinctive foghorn tenor, ex-Frank Zappa whizzkid Terry Bozzio on drums and keyboard/violin prodigy and whizzkid, Eddie Jobson doing everything else. UK sounded like an English/US cross-bred progressive rock band, i.e. conventional songwriting structures, musical virtuosity, stack harmonies, and songs about (gulp) love. Both UKs studio albums are OK. Just. But live, these same songs became unstoppable juggernauts. Showstoppers In The Dead of Night and Caesars Palace Blues are high and mighty; far superior to the studio versions, with Wetton signing the roof off and Jobson making a big, fat cathedral of noise with his keyboards and violin. Newcomers to UK should get this and avoid the studio albums, which sound like farting mice in comparison. ï¿½
