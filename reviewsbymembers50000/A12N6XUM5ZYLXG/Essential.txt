 Trading Places is one of those classics that you can watch every other year or so. The story is by no means new (rich boy/poor boy situation-swop scenario) but it comes together very nicely in John Landis'  film. It is pretty much the Eddie Murphy Show, and remains to this day the actor's best all-round performance. Trading Places is also one of John Landis' artistically more successful movies along with Blues Brothers (a film which was partially ruined by butcher-shop editing), and indeed the two are from the same period.  The film is beautifully paced, the casting superb, the camerawork has some very artistic touches. The acting performances? Dan Ackroyd as always turns in an adequate performance, Eddie Murphy shines in the roll as Billy Ray, as does Denholm Elliot as the stiff upper-lipped English butler (what else?). Jamie Lee Curtis adorns the screen with an abundance curves and a brave if not entirely convincing portrayal as the hooker with a heart of gold. But that's just nit-picking. This is a truly great movie for all the family, complete with morality messages galore and a happy ending. Timeless stuff. But you've probably already seen it, of course.
