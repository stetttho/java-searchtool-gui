 Dark, slick and sophisticated drum n bass, Modus Operandi would have made a great accompaniment to the first Dirty Harry movie. A soundtrack of suspense and cool atmospherics. As one would expect from what I presume is called  "minimalist" drum n bass, there are no real songs to speak of; no vocals either for that matter. Just a pitter-patter of snare, hi-hat and bass drum, a bass and the odd synth pad, sketching the scene of a New York City streetscene late at night. . Although this would appear to be low-key enough to qualify as ambient, oddly enough this is music that needs to be listened to. And it is in fact a really splendid record that is receiving heavy rotation at home. Just four or five tracks at a time, mind you. A little of this stuff goes a long way. If you like this then I would recommend Surgeon for more upbeat fare.
