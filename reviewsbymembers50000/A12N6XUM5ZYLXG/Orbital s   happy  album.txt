 Orbital 2 - also known as the `Brown Album' - captures Orbital before they went all serious. That's not to say that successors Snivilisation or In-Sides, both steeped in social commentary, are bad albums, it's just that I believe that THIS is what they did best. Creating spontaneous-sounding, layered tracks that shape, mutate and wind their way into the listener's mind. When I listen to this record I usually picture the Hartnoll brothers recording it live, working the effects and loops in real time as I listen. And this is, I think, the essence of Orbital's music. These tracks should not be seen as the fruit of months of painstaking work in a recording studio. Orbital are more spontaneous-sounding than many of their peers (Chemical Brothers, Orb), which would probably account for their reputation as a great live act. This is not an album of peaks and dips, although many rate `Halcyon and On and On' as the best techno track ever bar none. A point off for the spoken introduction/outro which is annoying. I've always thought speech samples are not one of Orbital's fortes.
