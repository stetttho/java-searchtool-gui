 It shames me to say that I bought this album because of the cover. And the title. The reviews in Amazon.com helped, of course, but I felt that I just couldn't go wrong. I must tell you here and now that this is an outstanding album: bright, solid, shimmering and breathtakingly beautiful. Open the sleeve and uncover 15 golden nuggets of 60s-inspired glory. They tell me that Glasgow's Cosmic Rough Riders sound like Teenage Fanclub. Well that's as may be but this to me sounds better than TF. Highlights? Well, take your pick. There's not a duff track there. My favourite at the moment is Melanie, which is uplifting. If I had to describe what CRR sound like it is this: a slice of Byrds, a dollop of Beatles, a smidgeon of REM, a sprinkling of Teenage Fanclub-type harmonies et voil...you've got yourself a slice of sonic heaven. Please help yourselves.
