 Not generally being very keen on Aphex Twin's EPs - one or two have been are fairly average, i.e. Boy/Girl ep and Analogue Bubblebath 4 - this is an exception. 'On' has a good tune if you can take that dreadful pounding bass noise that comes in, is too loud and drowns out everything else. The On remixes EP is much better. Includes remixes by reload and mike paradinas. The other tracks are highly listenable. Good value-for-money buy.
