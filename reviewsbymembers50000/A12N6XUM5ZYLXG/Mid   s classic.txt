 Capt. Fantastic is for me not only one of Elton's more accomplished albums but a defining moments of the mid-70s. I remember at the age of 12 watching the commercial for the album on English TV featuring a dreamy animation sequence where Elton floats around surrounded by butterflies. Elton is one of the few commercial giants that it was OK to like. He was massive but, we all thought, a cool dude that wrote imaginative, catchy songs and released concept albums. But Capt. Fantastic was no hits album like Don't Shoot Me... or Caribou. The title track took a while to get into but is an astonishing, winding masterpiec! with soulful, heartfelt lyrics by Bernie Taupin. Other gems include Tower of Babel, We all Fall in Love Sometimes, the very Queen-sounding Better Off Dead and Writing. The overall concept is let down slightly by a couple of weeker tracks, but that's what the programing button was made for. Bare in mind Elton had hit a purple patch, releasing the soaring single, Philadelphia Freedom, which was one of the strongest songs I have heard bar none. So there you have it. Great album, great cover, great lyrics and the inclusion of three extra tunes including Philadelphia Freedom. Now that's what I call good value!
