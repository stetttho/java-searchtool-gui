 Trouble in Happy Familyville. Mrs. Yorkin isn't getting the love and attention she needs from her husband, the son is also being subjected to emotional neglect by his father, and good old Sy (the photo guy who reads Deepak Chopra, so he can't be a real psycho) has always a kind word - all while Mr. Yorkin is off porking crumpet on the side. So far, so morally ambiguous.  But hey! Moral ambiguity isn't where Hollywood is at, so good old Sy finds out about Mister Yorkin's extra-marital activities, gets fired from his job and....well, you'll have to see the movie. Let's just say things pick up. All in all this is a good film.   Robin Williams puts in a great perfomance as Sy; the camerawork is quite reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick so it's a great looking movie; the supporting roles including Gary Cole as slick, middle-managament type (flashback to Office Space) and Mrs. Yorkin played by Connie Nielsen are very good. Keep the kids away, though, there a few unpleasant surpises along the way..
