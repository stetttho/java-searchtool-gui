 After the roasting this received by the critics I was expecting a real turkey. But this is a surprisingly enjoyable romp. The script is snappy and unusually witty, Messrs. Smith and Kline seem to be having the time of their lives and Kenneth Branagh maste rs a southern accent to play the fiendish Mr. Loveless to great comic effect. Laughs abound, and there's enough action and cool effects to keep the youngsters happy, while the all-star cast adds extra sparkle and drop-dead gorge ous Selma Hayek provides female interest. Don't watch Wild West for its plot or realistic treatment of post Civil War USA. Wild Wild West is a rip-roaring action comedy - like a cross between Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and James Bond - and while it didn't win loads of Oscars I can think of plenty worse ways to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon with the family and a petrol-tanker-size popcorn.
