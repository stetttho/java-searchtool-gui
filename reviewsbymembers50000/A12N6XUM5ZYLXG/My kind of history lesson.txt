 Dont be put off by the bleetings of the pseudo-intelligentsia. This is a meaty costume high-budget production. And it just gets better with each viewing. OK, so the film ends with a whimper rather than a bang, but thats the beauty of home-watching " you can enjoy the good bits, in this case the first 2 hours of the movie, where a gruesome chain of events lead up to the young Jeanne taking control of the French army and kicking the grim-faced Brits out of Orleans. Theres something here for everyone " theres enough action and gore to keep young boys aged 12 " 99 interested, the acting performances are lively bordering on cartoon characterisation, the pacing is nice and fast (except for the ending which we wont go into), and Luc Besson spreads his magic dust over it all to provide a slab of high-quality action/drama entertainment. You might want to warn your kid sister/girlfriend/wife that there is no love interest whatsoever. But wait until AFTER youve purchased the movie. Oh yeah, and if you havent fallen in love with Milla Jovovich by the end of the first hour youre made of sterner stuff than me. 
