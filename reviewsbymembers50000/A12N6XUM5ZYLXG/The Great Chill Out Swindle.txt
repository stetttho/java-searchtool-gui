 Oh dear, oh dear...Just imagine my suprise when I arrived home after having shelled out an ENORMOUS amount of money for this and slipped it into my CD player. I thought there was something odd when after 7 minutes there was till no music. This inital disappointment gave way to stunned disbelief when I realised that I'd just purchased 44 (that's forty-four, ladies and gentlemen) minutes of sampled sheep, radios, trains... I keep reading that this "album" was a groundbreaker in its genre. Well that may be, but it's still a rip-off in my opinion. And it was recorded "live", whatever that means.
