 A dark, compelling tale of about an insomniac who works in a factory operating heavy machinery. There's an accident at work after which our hero grapples with a web of intrigues and conspiracies in his quest for the 'truth'. In a way, it's a bit like a cross between Requiem for a Dream and Memento. The movie relies more on suggestion and subtlety than the kind of full-on scare tactics common to the thriller/horror genre. Close attention is rewarded - there are many nice little visual tricks, nuances and motifs that enhance the creepy is-he-mad-or-isn't he? feeling and keeps the viewer guessing right to the very end. The non-linear plotline is also a gem. Christian Bale does a great job in the lead role and establishes himself as a screen actor of great ability. Jennifer Jason Leigh is brilliant as his girlfriend, and the supporting cast all acquit themselves admirably (the Ivan character looks like a cross between Lawrence Fishburne and Marlo Brandon in Apocalypse Now). The dialogue is well written, the cinematography inventive and the whole package superbly crafted by director Brad Anderson. This film is quality from start to finish.  BUT, although the pacing is initially tight and controlled, it looses momentum just when one expects it to really take off. many fans of the thriller/horror genre may therefore feel let down by the lack of graphic violence.  For those, on the other hand, who like movies that treat their audiences with a degree of intelligence (Memento), this is recommended viewing. But like I said before, most of the tension is in what we don't see.
