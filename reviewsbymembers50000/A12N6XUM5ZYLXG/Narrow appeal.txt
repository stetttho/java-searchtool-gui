 Breakfast at Tiffany's is a movie that seems untouchable in its high-gloss, 60s stylishness. But apart from the charismatic Audrey Hepburn who is mysterious and elegant as Holly Golightly, and the Henry Mancini soundtrack, facts have to be faced. Breakfast at Tiffany's is not a great film. George Peppard, for all his blue-eyed good looks, has the screen presence of a deep freezer and Mickery Rooney's cameo as the irate Japanese upstairs neighbour is terrible. I would say Breakfast at Tiffany's is a good movie for Audrey Hepburn fans and students of 60s style but unsatisfying for the rest of us.
