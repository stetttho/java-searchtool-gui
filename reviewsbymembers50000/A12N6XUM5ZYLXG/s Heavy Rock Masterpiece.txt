 UFOs finest hour. UK heavy rockers reach new artistic heights. Lights Out showcases the bands finely-tuned songwriting, serving up quality ballads like Try Me and ballsy mid-tempo rockers like Just Another Suicide. and Electric Phase. The addition of guitarist/keyboardman Paul Raymond to the tride-and-tested Mogg/Schenker/Way/Parker line-up added an element of sophistication hitherto lacking in the bands sound, allowing the group to really stretch its wings. The albums strongest songs, Love to Love and Lights Out are good examples of this new winning formula in action, the latter becoming an instant uptempo all-time classic and the latter revealing a sensibility and depth that put UFO firmly on the map. UFO were " are? " a good tight outfit; even so theres no denying that the real star here is guitar wunderkind Michael Schenker. His work on Lights Out is an astounding release of blistering licks and scales and no doubt helped finally elevate him to the position of minor guitar deity along with Gary Moore, Ritchie Blackmore, Pat Travers, etc. New to UFO? You cant go wrong with this one.
