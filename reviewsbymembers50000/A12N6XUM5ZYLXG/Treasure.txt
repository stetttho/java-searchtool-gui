 Oof! This album is just so good. Forget the overplayed hits like Sandman and Horse With No Name. The real stuff lies down in the soft underbelly of Sides 1 and 2 (Anybody remember sides? - Robert Plant). Three Roses - what a song; so simple, so economic, so beautifully sung and played. Clarice, which explodes into a chorus which is, like, out there. And WHAT is that he is singing on Pigeon Song? Have you checked the gruesome words on it? That guy makes Hannibal Lecter look like Big Bird out of Sesame Street. America was always an inviting band for me, promising lazy, sunny days in the grass in a place where the clock stopped in 1967. America have stood the test of time; changing trends and currents couldn't stop the indomitable messrs. Bunnell, Peek and Beckley, whose subsequent releases made the 80s and 90s a much nicer place for a lot of people. Breathy harmonies, unhurried acoustic guitars. Quite reminiscent of the Crosby, Still and Nash thang. But if I had to choose between this and C, S & N I would go with this N-E-TIME. This may be the best, but it is certainly the purest America album. The PUREST America album. Everything right down from the cover to the reverb on the snare is just so laid back. A classic album package like Genesis's Trick of the Tale, Weezer's debut album or Hunky Dory. OK. It's got its flaws, but when you're in there with the music, you don't really give a tinkers about that, anyway, do you?
