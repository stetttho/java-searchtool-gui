 Draft 7.30 must be the most eagerly awaited electronica release this year, with a lot of fans no doubt hoping for something a bit user-friendly than the, er, 'challenging' Confield and Gantz Graf releases. So, what gives?  Is Draft 7.30 Autechres lon g-awaited return to more accessible pastures? No, not really. Draft 7.30 has moments of relative calm, but with Autechre nowadays, ~calm is anything that doesnt actually shatter your windows. Surripere, for example, drifts serenely along on a wash of w h at sounds like heavily compressed distorted guitar feedback and a Miles Davis-led horn ensemble. But the mood here is claustrophobic " quite similar to Bernard Hermans Taxidriver film score, where chords and tones fade in and out, depicting bleak urban isolation. It only takes one listen to realise that Surripere is an absolute beauty, until it goes berserk half way through, that is. Talking of which, IV VV IV VV VIII sounds like fireworks going off in your hallway and then the neighbour setting a large dog on you. Reniform Pulse features intricate beats and a moment of respite from the noisy industro-shock therapy. The crunching V-PRO, however, sounds like a heavy industrial machinery with hip-hop beats in the background. Theme of Sudden Roundabout is more fast-paced drill n bass type of thing (with ~bass taken out). Hardcore Autechre acolytes will be happy, while Amber and Tri Repetae fans should approach with caution, or try other artists. May I suggest Arovane, Sutekh, Dntel or Gas? I honestly cant tell you whether you should buy this or not. I simply don't have a clue about this kind of music. Autechre seem to be communicating in a musical language all of their own. Maybe one day Ill learn how to appreciate it.g
