 I don't agree that Hannibal is poor follow-up to Silence of the Lambs. In many ways it's better: has more depth, is beautifully photographed, has a Gothic horror feel to it and is a bit more, well, relaxed. This stands up as a fine film in its own right. Long, yes, but not boring. Julianne Moore is, I think a great Clarice Starling (better I think - definitley much more sex appeal)) and her chemistry with Sir Anthony Hopkins is just right. To sum up: it's a different film to Silence of the Lambs and has a polished veneer courtesy of Ridley Scott. If Silnce was Friday night viewing then Hannibal is definitely Sunday afternoon.
