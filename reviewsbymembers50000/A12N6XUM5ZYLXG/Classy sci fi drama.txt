 Luckily not having seen the original Solaris, I could watch this film with an open mind. And two things came immediately to mind: 1) this is NOT as bad as the one-star-review folks have implied and 2) this is a philosophical, contemplative slice of sci-fi/drama - high on substance. I liked it (and I`m quite picky when it comes to sci-fi). The plot - which, has anyone noticed, bears a striking resemblance to the movie Sphere - is basically about relationships reconstructed with the benefit of hindsight.  The pacing is admittedly slow, but it wouldn't really have worked otherwise. You still get sucked in, believe me. George Clooney pulls off the non-hunk role admirably, although personally I would have cast someone a little less well-known. In any event Clooney is upstaged by Natasha McElhone, who is beautiful, strange and frightening and...just amazing. This is a great, lavish work of cinematography. The camera lingers lovingly on the flickering lamps and sterile, minimalistic environments of the spaceship interior (Stanley Kubrick`s influence is unmistakable). To sum up, this is a great sci-fi movie that is more about love than slimy, malevolent beings (your girlfriend will enjoy it as much as you will), and there are plenty of moral and ethical insights that crop along the way, making this hugely enjoyable viewing for amateur philosophers, sci-fi buffs and coffee-table intellectuals alike. I only hope the original matches up to it.
