 Apart from serving up some of the best sounds of the moment (file under ambient/lounge), the Gentle People are a great product: the album cover, the web site, the lyrics, the names all create a unique, homogenous world. In short, the music sounds like the name suggests. It's all done with tongues firmly in cheek, of course, and not meant to be taken seriously. The 70s disco pastiche, "Gentle People are Love" will bring a smile to your face but the music is too damned good to be dismissed as a loungey joke. Good fun and a great listen.
