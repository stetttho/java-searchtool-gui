 ... Her pop savvy is illustrated by a sixth sense when it comes to working with the best people - especially songwriters. I wouldn't call myself a Madonna fan, but she always does great ballads, and the best ones are all here. 'This Used to be my Playground', 'I Remember' and 'Live to Tell' are examples of classy, sophisticated songwriting and a crisp production. With the exception of her cover version of 'Love Don't Live Here Anymore', 'Something to Remember' is a great compilation of sophisticated ballads spanning the whole of Madonna's career from the mid-80s to today. A great gift for just about anyone.
