 Emerging like a brightly coloured butterfly from a 10-year cocoon of dark, ambient electronica, the FSOL duo delivers an album that has a big smile plastered all over its face.  More upbeat and technicolour than previous releases (except maybe the Papua New Guinea Translations album) the Isness is a bright kaleidoscope of sounds and psychedelic grooves featuring a wide variety of assorted instruments (sitars, guitars, organs, flutes, etc.) and some great melodies. Stylistically it is influenced by the 60s (especially that sitar) and 70s  Elysian Fields, for example, is a soundtrack of 1966 Carnaby Street grooviness (or 'Lounge' depending which decade you're born in), Divinity is an uplifting, mid-tempo 70s acoustic guitar spritual strumalong � la My Sweet Lord. High Tide On The Sea of Flesh, on the other hand,shows that FSOL still have time for a good old fashioned ambient dirge. Indeed, despite the change in direction that Isness signifies, this record is still essentially ambient, although very different from the frosty soundscapes of ISDN, for example.  It works great in the background and is ideal for laying back, listening to and immersing yourself in. I generally try to avoid using words like 'quality' when describing music but this is definitely a high-quality record and there's a big, positive vibe going on here. If this is what spiritual awakening is supposed to feel like, I'll have two double helpings, please, with extra on the side. ,�
