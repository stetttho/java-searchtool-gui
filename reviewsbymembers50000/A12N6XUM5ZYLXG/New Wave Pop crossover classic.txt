 Fashion goes in circles. Take the first Star Wars movie for example. In  the early1990s we rolled around laughing at Luke Skywalker's blow-dried 70s haircut. Watching the film today, that same haircut looks fairly modern. Indeed, the whole film looks like it was made yesterday. In music the same applies. Cheesy 70s fusion and pedestrian jazz-funk is today recycled and mass produced but today it's called `Lounge'. And then you have music which transcends fashion, purveyed by bands like Beatles, Stones, Elvis Costello, etc. Joe Jackson's first two albums - of which `I'm the Man' is the first - are classic examples. A perfect fusion of pop savvy, punk attitude and musical brilliance. Good, solid songs, simply arranged (guitar, bass, drums and the odd keyboard), and with lyrics that are at once funny, poignant and candid. There are no fillers but my favourites include the title track which is ferocious in its intensity, the wonderful `It's Different for Girls' (a top 10 hit in 1979), school geek-comes-good anthem `On Your Radio' and the reggae-tinged `Geraldine and John'. It was released in 1979, but sounded as good throughout the 80s and 90s and  still sounds great today. If you like punchy pop with an attitude, you should check this one out.
