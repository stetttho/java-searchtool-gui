 Arovane juxtaposes up-front beats and chugging rhythms against a backdrop of feathery synthscapes and tones of heartbreaking loveliness.  This approach is nothing new; Aphex and Autechre and Speedy J have all played this game. But while Autechre have recently forsaken melody and just made the scraping noises louder, Arovane continues to refine and explore and find new ways to enchant and confound without changing style. Whereas Tides - perhaps Arovane's best-known record -  has a more organic sound conjuring up images of leafy fields and summery expanses, Atol Scrap takes us back to the cold, grey slabs of functional, urban architecture. And it's beautiful (look at the cover). Highly recommended.
