 1972 was a good year for music, with Pink Floyd, Genesis, Black Sabbath all releasing landmark LPs (`Dark Side of the Moon', `Foxtrot' and `Vol. IV' respectively).  Deep Purple's Machine Head is perhaps top of the heap, and album which saw the band rocketing towards new heights of creative genius and commercial clout. The tour to promote Machine Head yielded Made in Japan - the live rock album of the 70s. What I want to talk about is the amazingly crisp. clear sound of the remaster - it's like hearing the album for the first time again. And if that's not enough for you the CD contains a version of the album which has been completely remixed from the 2" tape. Suddenly you realise how well the band's different musicians complemented each other, creating a drum/bass/organ/guitar/vocal noise which was exciting, an adrenaline rush like no other. I kid you not. The sound is fantastic.  I won't bore you with the track listing, nor will I waffle on about the fireworks of virtuosity coming from Messrs Lord, Blackmore, Paice, Gillan and Glover; suffice it to say that the album reads like a Best Of Deep Purple (Mk. II) compilation. For old Purple fans, this is an ideal opportunity to get reacquainted with a classic album...
