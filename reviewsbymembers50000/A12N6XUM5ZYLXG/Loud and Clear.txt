 Two CDs with BBC concerts. CD 1 from 1970 was recorded just as Purple were breaking. Speed King, Child in Time and Mandrake Root. CD 2 (1972) with the material from the then-newly-released Machine Head. In Concert is often compared with Made in Japan because both feature largely the same songs. Made in Japan is perhaps the best for concert hall ambience and atmosphere. In Concert is, however, because of the crystal clear sound quality, the choice who want to focus on the musicianship. The playing is very tight; the band gels together superbly, but with each member his own little fireworks display. Ian Paice is phenomenal.  Keyboard fans should like this as Jon Lord seems to be top of the musical pecking order taking up prime soloing space. Highlight for me are Mandrake Root, Space Trucking (rockiest version ever) and Highway Star. For overall quality, CD1 has the edge, this is the dictionary definition of a band which is exploding onto the scene. You can alsmost touch the self-confidence and raw energy. The 1972 concert has versions of songs that have still to be perfected (Smoke on the Water fans, take note!). This is Deep Purple in full flight during their hottest period. I regret not having bought this the first time round. Maybe it's the packaging which isn???t happening. ??
