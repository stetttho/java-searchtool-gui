 Not much to add to the other comments except to say that Kenneth Branagh turns in a masterful performance as Nazi head honcho Heydrich.  The film also avoids the usual pitfalls, i.e. stereotyping all the Germans as bloodthirsty monsters (see Saving Private Ryan). A film, in other words, that doesn't treat the audience like total idiots.
