 4-Way Street is an album that I've come back to after 20 years. I was curious to see what it sounded like today. Well, this album is divided into an acoustic set and an electric set. It was the acoustic side of the band that I have the fondest memories of, particularly David Crosby's 'Traid', the spine-tingling 'Lee Shore' and Graham Nash's 'Right Between the Eyes'. These songs still sound great - worth buying the record for alone, not forgetting Neil Young's acoustic contribution, 'Cowgirl in the Sand' (Neil comes off the best actually. His voice and style are so distinctive). The electric set is rather loose and some of it consists of pointless jamming so two stars off for that. The rest is superb. The stuff of really fond memories.
