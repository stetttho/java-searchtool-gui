 The story is a highly promising. Adventure-prone young man seeks adventure in Thailand, finds it but it all goes pear-shaped on him. He ends up on a paradise island hippie commune made up of other beautiful young people with exotic European accents and simply bulging with street-cred. But there's trouble in paradise as good old human nature, here symbolised by sex, intrigue and corruption rears its ugly head. Sounds great, doesn't it?  I'm told the book is a fantastic read. Which may explain why this movie is unforgivably cheesy adaptation, with di Caprio turning in a flat, uninspred performnace. Unsatisfying and disappointing.
