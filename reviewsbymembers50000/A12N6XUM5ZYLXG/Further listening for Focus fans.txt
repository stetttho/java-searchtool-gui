 One of the best progressive rock bands ever. Easily up there, if not better than, Genesis, Yes, ELP et al. An effortless fusion of the classical, jazz and rock esthetics. Musical perfection in a nutshell. For my money, Focus second album Moving Waves is the perfect starting point for those interested in prime 70s melodic rock/retro-classic fusion, but Hamburger Concerto, although not quite as pristine as its predecessors has its far share of breathtakingly beautiful moments. Hamburger Concerto borrows heavily from the previous albums: Harem Scarem revives the Hocus Pocus potential hit formula by pitting Jan Akkermans fuzzbox-up-to-11 guitar against Thijs van Leers quirky wordless vocal acrobatics. Musicae Delitiae is a quiet guitar (or lute, I'm not sure) interlude reminiscent of Elspeth of Nottingham, while most of the title track revisits pastures already covered in earlier albums with Akkerman and Van Leer showing impressive musical diversity and instrumental prowess. The standout for me is La Cathedrale de Strasbourg. The bit where the drums come in the middle is sheer heaven.  To recap then, get Moving Waves or Live at the Rainbow first and then, if you like that, move on to Focus 3 or Hamburger Concerto. The great progressive rock revival is close at hand. Impress your friends by being one step ahead.
