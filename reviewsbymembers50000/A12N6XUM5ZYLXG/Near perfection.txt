 The Fountains of Wayne fit comfortably into the niche, carved out by Weezer some years ago, of high-octane, melodic pop; the music made by sensitive, broken-hearted boys with loud guitars and a pile of Ramones and - dare I say it - Smiths albums strewn about the garage floor. No macho attitudes here, just good. solidly crafted songs, uplifting harmonies and a smidgeon of naivet that I myself thoroughly enjoy. This, their debut album is choc-a-bloc with nuggets: Radiation Vibe - a cronking masterpiece of feelgood rock n roll, Joe Rey - a foottapping bagatelle about a friend from Spain, Leave the Biker - hilarious send-up of guys whose beards smell bad because of the Seafood Special that's trapped in them. There are some tender moments, too. Sick Day, a a touching ballad about a girl who's slowly cracking up, and She's Got a Problem, about a friend who...well, just listen to the song. The Fountains of Wayne are pretty near the perfect pop group - immensely talented, first-class lyric-writers, and - most important of all - they make music with a big heart. BUT...I personally have trouble with the way they overdo the whiney, wimpy singing, therefore the 4 stars. Otherwise this is as pretty near a masterpiece as you'll get in this genre. Now, where's that Vocoder...
