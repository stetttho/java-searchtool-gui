 The retrospectively released Protest Songs is a shy beast indeed, lurking in the middle of Prefab's initial purple patch of albums, notably Swoon, Steve McQueen and - at a push - From Here to Langley Park. After the crystal gloss production provided by Thomas Dolby helped give the album a leg up to recognition and acclaim, Prefab opted to produce Protest Songs themselves and the difference is humungous. Gone are the warm, semi-kitschy digiscapes  la Dolby. Instead the results sound sometimes veer closely to Demo City. The label refused to release it and forced Prefab to do another record, this time more commercial, please. Which they duly did, but that's another story.  Protest Songs is definitely worth checking out if you're into the band's earlier stuff - there's a devastatingly beautiful ballad called Dublin which must surely rank as one Paddy Mcaloon's top 10 songs. Trust me, it's a blinder. Diana (yes, it's about her adding poignance after her demise) is also a treat, which, though undermined by woeful production - has more hooks than Mike Tyson. Opening song World Awake is way too subtle for instant titillation, and therefore perhaps not the ideal choice of first track. The end of World Awake is fabulous, though, with a slow fade of the type which was so successful on Jesse James Bolero off the Jordan: the Comeback album.  Life of Surpioises surfaced on Prefab's greatest hits package and is accessible fare but bordering on musical facileness. Protest Songs doesn't gleam like some of the other albums (Andromeda Heights, some tracks of Jordan) and indeed is rough and ready (sort of) but there are enough ideas here to keep any devoted Prefab Sprout fan ecstatic.
