 Song Remains the Same " a double live album and soundtrack to the film of the same name " is rather a lopsided listen. While the Led Zeppelin back catalogue (mainly I, II, III, IV and Physical Graffiti) has been remixed, remastered, reappraised and praise d throughout the 90s and beyond, Song Remains the Same has been rather overlooked in comparison. The actual songs are great, but the lengthy solo passages have aged rather badly. Take Whole Lotta Love, for instance, nothing wrong with the tune, but wherea s before people used to sit in religious awe as Jimmy Page took self-indulge to new limits (later parodied by Spinal Tap diva guitarist Nigel Tufnel), these lengthy passages of seem a bit unnecessary nowadays.  And Moby Dick. No disrespect to a great rock drummer, but I wonder how many people today would actually sit through the entire track " solo and all " except at gunpoint. Sometimes this approach works " the 23-minute Dazed and Confused has a number of inspired moments but there's far too much empty spaces. But then theres the good bits: Celebration Day rocks (great Jimmy Page solo), Rain Song is heart-melting loveliness and No Quarter shows what an invaluable songwriting and instrumental contribution to the band John Paul Jones made. And Stairway is there too so the fans are taken good care of. Robert Plant has I think, said that the gig from which this recording was made was nothing special, but if this is Led Zep on a bad day, then weve truly been missin g out.  n
