 In AFoxtrot In American Psycho, unhinged killer Patrick Bateman loves Genesis. But dismisses the band's early work as far too clever and intellectual, preferring the chart-topping soul/pap they put out later. This is, of course, a good way of saying that early Genesis has all the artistic merit and late the 80s stuff is as emotionally and spiritually bereft as he is. That's not to say, however that Foxtrot will be in everybody's taste - 70s symphonic rock is still officially a dirty word - but it is a landmark album of that genre and I love it! It has Supper's Ready, a towering, 20-minute epic of sheer genius and showcases the band at its most innovative and inspired. The lyrics alone, penned by Peter Gabriel, are a fountain of references and allusions, and are at once humorous, satirical, soulful and serious. Behind them, meanwhile, the music soars, dips and struts its way towards the majestic finale. The other tracks, Watcher of the Skies, an up-tempo rocker with its now-classic Mellotron intro;  the up-tempo Get `Em Out by Friday where Gabriel acts out an array of different characters; and the acoustic Can-Utility and the Coastliners, which is one of my all-time favourites and the kind of thing that makes me wish it was 1972 again.  A great album which, when the progressive rock revival starts, will be on everybody's lips, or at least in their CD players.
