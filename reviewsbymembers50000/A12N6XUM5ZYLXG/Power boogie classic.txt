 Piledriver is very different proposition from the family-friendly, knees-up Status Quo outout of the 1980s and 1990s. Heavy rock was just hitting its stride in 1972, and Quo abandoned their lightweight, twangy pop, bought distortion pedals and let rip. And what songs! Paper Plane, Big Fat Mama and Don't Waste my Time are pedigree up-tempo rockers that really satisfy (Paper Plane was a hit single). Even the ballads are bluesy and highly listenable. The only really weak track here is the cover of Doors' Roadhouse Blues. Power-boogie has never been as good as this.
