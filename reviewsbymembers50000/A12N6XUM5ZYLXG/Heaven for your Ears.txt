 Albums are rarely just about the music. There's the songtitles, the choice of songs, the length of songs, the album cover art, the album title...all these factors have to be in harmony with one another to provide an exceptional musical product - a classic album. Genesis's `Trick of the Tail' is one example, New Gold Dream is another. Look at the cover. Golden shimmering visions are promised within. And indeed the music lives up to the cover, the title, the songtitles, etc. etc. New Gold Dream catches the band on the cusp between its artpop, avant-garde beginnings and the vacuous stadium-fodder it turned into. It was all Bono's fault, of course. After having met him, the Minds decided it wanted to be U2 and changed direction accordingly. New Gold Dream is last of the great Simple Minds recordings. The opening number, 'Somewhere in Summertime' encapsulates the album's style - sophisticated, romantic, shimmering, uplifting, and that's just the intro. 'Promised you a Miracle', which was the hit from that album, is streetwise, sassy, clever, funky, everything the band was NOT just three years later.  The titletrack is a great, pumping, driving beauty of a song (play loud) that will have you gyrating wildly around the room.  Glittering Prize is sheer inspiration...words fail to describe how wonderful that song is. But don't take my word for it, check out those sexy real audio clips at the top of the page and let your lugholes decide. It will show you - and remind us - that the 80s weren't all Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Duran Duran.
