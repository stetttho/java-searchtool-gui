 Shuttle358 follows the tradition of click techno such as Phonem, Arovane, which seems to made out of 2 components: beat and flotation. Whereas Arovane's percussive screen often sounds like an insect eating its lunch amplified 80 billion times, Shuttle358 is content to use an understated pitter-patter rhythmic pulse juxtaposed against forlorn, whispy smokescapes of sound. Definitely an ambient release - perfect post-pillow listening before your first cup of coffee. Unlike the more cacophonous German counterparts, Shuttle358 opts for track titles with real words. Which makes you wonder sometimes how these titles fit in with the music - I mean the track called Models of My Life is a beautiful haunting little piece but sounds like it might just well have been called Non-Descript Sandwich or Polish Steel Industry.  But I suppose it must means something to Dan Abrams (who is Shuttle358). To sum up, Understanding Wildlife is stylish, well-made music that is, yes darnit I'm not ashamed to say it,  very pretty. Music this good should not remain unknown.
