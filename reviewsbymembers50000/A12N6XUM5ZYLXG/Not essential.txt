 Of all the Aphex Twin albums I've listened to this one - surprisingly - is one of the weakest. The ideas are all there and there are some cracking tunes, but he then proceeds to fart all over them with his incessant drill  n' bass noise. Really infuriating. You end up wanting to twist his ear and  say: "Stop that at once!"
