 I strongly recommend Proem for all fans of electronica or to anyone who's ever had even the remotest interest in electronic music, perhaps to fans of Kraftwerk, but definitely to Aphex and Autechre enthusiasts. The nearest thing you could compare Proem to is Arovane, that tried-and-tested master of intricate, evocative ambience. Proem is in the same league, but is one step closer to accessibility. It could be argued that musically he's reaching for a line that dangles between artistic credibility and broad commercial appeal. Which brings him among artists like Biosphere, whose crystalline, environment-oriented soundscapes are echoed on certain tracks.  Proem contains some of the moodier tinges associated with early 90s ambient techno, the kind of music associated with Warp Records. Yet Proem plays with sound cleverly and displays a sensitive artistic touch in the way he builds up some of the tracks. Burn Plate is hypnotic background pulses forming a tapestry of Autechre-like beauty with beats going really, really fast but with the BEST POSSIBLE TASTE!  Subtle nuances, haunting melodies and some groovy titles!  To put it very simply, Proem's record is like all the artists I've mentioned above rolled into one package. Top-draw stuff.
