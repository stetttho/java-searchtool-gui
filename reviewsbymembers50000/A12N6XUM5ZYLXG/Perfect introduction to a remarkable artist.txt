 Maverick electronic genius, Richard D James' landmark album. Considered by many to be his best. But is it? Well  its certainly more accessible than a lot of his stuff and a record you could actually play at a party without at least  half the people going: "what the +&% is this????". And there are some great tunes, notably Xtal, a wonderful, breathy track that will have you drop everything you're doing and just listening (which means it's not really ambient, but nevermind), Delphium, which is the aural equivalent of going on holiday in Greece, and the flagship track, Tha, which is a long, subtle ambient masterpiece. Unlike its successor SAW 2, this album is less of a cohesive album and more of a jumble of tracks and styles. The sound quality is at times patchy due to the primitive equipment used to master the songs (cassette tape, which means you also get that sexy analogue compression into the bargain!). The lack of sleeve information is also irritating, and suggests to me that Mr. James could put more effort into that area. But as I prefer listening to early Aphex stuff, this is more my cup of tea than Richard D James album, for example, or Come to Daddy. Highly recommended and the perfect introduction to this remarkable artist.
