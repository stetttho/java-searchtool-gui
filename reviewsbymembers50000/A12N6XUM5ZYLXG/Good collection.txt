 I really enjoyed this film " it made me want to go out and buy records that I wouldnt normally buy. Joy Division, for example, have never really been my cup of tea. Same goes for Happy Mondays and A Certain Ratio. When seen in context, however, one suddenly begins to see it all in a very different light. As the film emphasises repeatedly, this is all about Factory Records and the city of Manchester " mainly in the 1980s, when that city was the Mecca of indie pop (Smiths, Fall, New Order). A superb collection of Factorys best moments and a must-have for fans of 80s English indie pop.
