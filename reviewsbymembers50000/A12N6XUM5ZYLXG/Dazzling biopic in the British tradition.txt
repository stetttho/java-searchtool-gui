 Shackleton is a strong candidate for Kenneth Branagh's top performance as an actor so far. Which should tell you something about the film's watchability right there. The Conspiracy movie was another acting masterclass, with Sir Branagh playing the role of Nazi top dog (Heidrich) with a smooth, efficient  politeness, commonly associated with board level executives. But this is even better. Although the Branagh's presence is one of the film's main draws, the whole production is BBC-flagship, top-of-the-line all the way. Pornography for Merchant Ivory fans. It was director Charles Sturridge, let us not forget, who guided us through the wonder that was Brideshead Revisited (1983), the benchmark against which all other costume dramas - this one included - will be matched.  Shackleton is set in 1911, at a time when polar exploration was at its most intense (with bitter rivalries, shameless falsification of logbooks, etc.), etc. This is the stuff of all boy's books in Britain throughout the most of the 20th century (fans of Michael Palin's excellent Ripping Yarns series will know what I'm talking about).  Along with Raoul Amundsen, Sir Walter Scott, Shackleton was a major player in this area, with a brace of successful arctic and Antarctic expeditions already under his belt. But this expedition was going to be the big one. Crossing the Antarctic. Unfortunately some bright spark decided to start World War One, casting into jeopardy the undertaking that was going to satisfy Sir Earnest Shackleton's vainglorious designs for ever. It's a fabulous film. Well-researched, superbly written, meticulously crafted, heartwarmingly acted and highly dramatic filmmaking; connoiseur cinema that also caters to history students, Branagh fans and wide-screen adventure-lovers. An informative blockbuster, then, you could say.
