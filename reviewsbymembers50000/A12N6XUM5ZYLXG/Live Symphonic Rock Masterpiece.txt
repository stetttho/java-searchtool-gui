 More intelligent, culturally rich and more interesting than many of their contemporaries (Foreigner, Journey, Styx), Kansas are probably pound for pound the best symphonic rock band America has ever produced. Kansass first three albums (Song For America, Kansas, Point of Know Return) culminate here on Two for the Show " the quintessential symphonic rock double live album (remember them?) along with Seconds Out. Kansass appeal can be broken down into a number of components: a strong vocalist (Steve Walsh), a great songwriter (Kerry Livgren), a sound-enriching violinist (Robbie Steinhardt), inspired arrangements and songwriting finesse that put bands like Styx to shame.  Kansas went for a full-bodied sound, not unlike Genesis (in fact Steve Walsh collabor ated with Genesis stringplucker Steve Hackett on his solo album Please Dont Touch). The bands lyrics were " are - also a refreshing change from the moronic, pre-pubescent drivel peddled by Foreigner (Cold as Ice. Hot Blooded), for example.  And any band that has the barefaced cheek to name a song Magnum Opus " and get away with it - cant be all bad.  Kansass mï¿½lange of hard rock, classical and folk works great live. Show-stopping highlights include the Wall, Magnum Opus, Song for America and Journey f rom Mariabronn, while you also get the hits (Carry on Wayward Son, Dust in the Wind) gentle acoustic interludes and a great atmosphere.  In fact, after the studio versions of these songs seem to pale in comparison. Two for the Show also sounds like a live album, rather than a live recording which theyve redone in the studio. Great cover, too. And the lyrics, did I mention the lyrics?
