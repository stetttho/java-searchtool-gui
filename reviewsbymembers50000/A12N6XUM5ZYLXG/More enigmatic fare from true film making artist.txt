 Mullholland Drive is classic David Lynch: strong images, beautifully composed shots, underlying sense of unease, slow pacing, weird background noise, lot of pregnant silences, etc. and as such is a feast for the eyes and the mind. Lots of sexiness too. Not that theres that much graphic sex, but the sexual tension between Betty and Rita gave me a ... fide thrill. A beautifully concocted maze of plots, sub-plots and red herrings that baffles, amazes, and frustrates. After half way though I had no idea what was going on but couldnt tear myself away from the screen.  Enigmatic. Intriguing. Strongly recommended.
