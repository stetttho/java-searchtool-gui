 Funny how your opinion of a movie can change on second viewing. I really disliked the Thin Red Line at first: I abhored its pretension, its indulgent poetical flights and its obvious war-is-bad imagery. I must have had a bad day. The Thin Red Line is a po werful anti-war statement that manages to combine blood, horror, beauty and poetry - all at the same time ( a difficult juggling act)! There is some gung-ho, courtesy of a vein-bulging Nick Nolte) but it is tempered by a focus on how war affects people, a nd shows how, regardless of the group nature of combat, everyone is essentially fighting their own battles. There are impressive acting performances from Sean Penn, Jon Savage, Ben Chaplin and Elias Koteas (among others), while Nick Nolte does lots of sho uting and John Cusack is, er, John Cusack wearing an army uniform. The Thin Red Line is different from most other war movies because it doesn't only cater to masculine sensibilities (like Saving Private Ryan, for example, or Black Hawk Down). The battle sequences are tempered by the soldiers' own philosophical and spiritual reflections. The film also finds time to focus on the development of relationships between the various protagonists.  The Thin Red Line a very good movie indeed in which the supporting actors steal the show and where interesting perspectives on war are offered. Just goes to show how all good movies should be seen at least twice.
