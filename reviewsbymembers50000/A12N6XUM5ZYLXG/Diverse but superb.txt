 Plaid make remarkably good electronic music. Not quite as 'rock n roll' as Aphex Twin , cerebral as Autechre or funky as, say, Jimi Tenor. Plaid occupies some middle ground that leans a bit towards AOE Adult Oriented Electronica, or if you will, a more Burt Bacharach version of Richard D James (which is meant as a compliment, by the way). Rest Proof Clockwork is stylistically VERY diverse, which I think is a bit of a disadvantage. Shakbu and Little People are all jumpy, scratchy hip-hop slices with a rich, ambient topping; Ralome is a beautiful, guitar-propelled ambient piece that wouldn't sound out of place on a Pat Metheny album. Tearisci is VERY reminiscent of Erik Satie while Last Remembered Thing sounds like an outtake from a Caustic Window album. There are also tracks that sound like loungy film music, tracks that are 'ethno' in a marimba sort of way (like a refined Orb) and tracks that simply defy description. Rest Proof Clockwork straddles a wide range of styles and influences and therefore is somewhat lacking in homogeneity. BUT the quality of the music is consistently superb. One feels that behind the gadgetry, software and men-in-white-coats image that a lot of Electronica conjurs up, there are great composers of music ready to burst out of the electronica straightjacket chrysalis like butterflies. Plaid then are probably one of Warp's more polished acts and if you are a Warpy kind of music fan, deserve your listening attention at the earliest possible opportunity. If I have any complaints it's the anonymous-sounding name and the ridiculous album titles.
