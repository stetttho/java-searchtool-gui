 A true rock oddity makes a welcome appearence on CD. The recording quality is admittedly the worst Ive ever heard on an official live album but then again, Earthbound is not about crystal clear sound. Listen to the material - the Crims plough through a succession of low-down-and-dirty blues numbers (Groon, Peoria, Earthbound), with Messrs. Fripp, Burrell, Collins and Wallace laying down the jam like theres no tomorrow full of dark, primal energy (which is what the blues is all about isnt it?). The, erm, unpolished sound quality kind of complements, even enhances, the music. It works for me, anyway. Theres a positively unhinged rendition of 21st Century Schizoid Man with manic vocals/shouting by Boz Burrell (later bassist with Bad Company, fact fans) and a creepy Sailors Tale with a great little sax run by the wonderful sax-player/flautist Mel Collins. To sum up, then, the untidy sound actually adds to the listening experience endowing it with a peculiar atmosphere and dark charm (a King Crimson trademark) - an album that is quite simply greater than the sum of its parts. Great cover too.
