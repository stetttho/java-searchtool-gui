 David Lynchs debut was an instant cult classic.  A startling film that falls outside any frame of reference you can think of, except perhaps Fritz Lang movies of the 1920s. Shot in grainy black&white, a minimum of dialogue and constant wash of industry a mbient noise pervades the whole film. The events are driven forward by a series of obscure left-of-centre images like the Man Inside the Planet (what the heck is that all about?).This seems to suggest that Eraserhead is foremost a visual spectacle for its own sake rather than an exercise in storytelling. Thus a plot that slips out of your fingers like a wet fish at every turn; the surreal, dreamlike imagery that intrigues and baffles rather than  explains and embroiders, and the editing which in some places seems to have been done by Godzilla. This is fine for stoners and film students but not the kind of thing youd want to put on after Thanksgiving dinner to which family members have driven half the way across to continent to attend. There are some wonderful scenes, like when Henry the geeky hero (great haircut) is invited to dinner at the in-laws and things go horribly pear-shaped. Eraserhead is not for everyone, but it is a film I would strongly recommend to those who are into independent cinema, surrealist art, gothic cinema and of course, for all David Lynch fans.
