 From the opening drum-roll music, we can tell that this is going to be a good-old John Wayne war film. From the first minute we are in no doubt whatsoever that Mel Gibson is going to kick some serious ... over in 'Nam. While all around his soldiers get bla sted into oblivion, Mel and his trusty, battle-hardened, wise-cracking lieutenant survive and win in the face of overwhelming odds (not in the air, of course, where US planes barbeque both enemy and friendly infantry with napalm). Mel Gibson gives a workm anlike performance as Colonel Hal Moore, the other actors (including helicopter pilot Greg Kinnear and war-widows' heroine matriarch, Madeleine Stowe) do what is expected of them.  We Were Soldiers is much less arty than Thin Red Line, for example, or Apocalypse Now. The focus here is on group heroics rather than individual struggle. It is a primarily a tribute to the resilience of the helicopter-borne US 7th cavalry division which was the first American unit to engage the Viet Cong and the wives who wait at home dreading the official telegram. This is a patriotic war film in the tradition of Black Hawk Down. Do not, therefore, expect Oscar-winning performances, painstaking character studies or high drama. This is, in fact, a patriotic, semi-propaganda war movie with the semblance of a liberal conscience - the Viet Cong soldiers are portrayed as humans with real feelings, etc. The battle scenes are well done, however, and it is at the height of the fighting that We Were Soldiers shows some sort of cinematic quality. As soon as he guns fall silent, however, the movie lurches back into a parade of clichï¿½d phrases and comic-book dialogue. Kid's stuff, really, although the gruesome detail makes this fairly unsuitable viewing for the youngsters..
