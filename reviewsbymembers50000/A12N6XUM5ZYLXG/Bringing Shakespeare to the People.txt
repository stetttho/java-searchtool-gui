 An exuberant Shakespeare movie adaptation courtesy of Kenneth Branagh, who by now knows how to do Shakespeare movie adaptations in his sleep. This is one of the best of the bunch, with an all-start cast featuring thespian talent from both sides of the Atl antic. Filmed on location in Italy we get to drink in the lush Tuscany scenery, even though the set-piece nature of Shakespeare is sometimes comes across as rather undynamic in the motion picture format. Overall this is a highly successful endeavour, wit h Branagh once more proving that Shakespeare " in the right hands " doesnt always have to be lofty, intellectual and about as interesting as watching the tide come in.  Much Ado About Nothing is nicely paced and is a good movie for the whole family. Typi cal Sunday afternoon watching, in fact. Denzel Washington, Richard Briers, Emma Thompson, all do their stuff with great results. Extra points for Kenneth Branaghs acting performance which is inspirational, Michael Keaton who adds a whole new dimension to the conc ept comic relief and Kate Beckinsale who, in addition to being a talented thespian, is just plain drop-dead gorgeous. The only real question mark is Keanu Reeves who looks uncomfortable in his role as the villain.  In all, a good movie, and just right for Christmas viewing. p*
