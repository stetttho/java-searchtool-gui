 Like the previous reviewer, Landon, I had read (or at least tried to read) the previous edition of UML in a Nutshell, and I thoroughly slammed it.  And I too was contacted by O'Reilly to see if I would like to receive a free copy of this new edition.  I must say I'm impressed by their commitment to their readers - I wrote that review YEARS ago, and they were thoughtful enough to follow-up with some of us.  Anyway, about the book.  It's much, much better than the first one.  The preface and chapter 1 are the only required reading.  They explain some important changes from earlier versions of UML and also tell you how to navigate this book.  Granted, you could read it cover-to-cover, but that would be pretty boring.  Instead, like other good "In a Nutshell" books, it's designed to let you hit the ground running, applying specific portions of the book to your current needs.  For example, if you're trying to learn about UML because you work on business processes and do a lot of whiteboarding, you can go directly to chapters 9 and 10.  If you're a programmer working on protocols, you can go blah.  If you're planning software configuration and deployment, you go to blah.  Very handy.  So, in summary, a very good improvement over the first edition.  And a handy guide that lets you hit the ground running.  The only reason it's only 4 stars is that it's not the author's style is kind of dry.  Nowadays I reserve my 5 star review of technical books for titles like Head Start Java.
