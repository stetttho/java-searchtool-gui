 If you want to talk about visual quality - and that's one of the big reasons to buy a DVD version of a movie even if you have a VHS copy - then this is superb, deserving 5 stars.  You will notice that the colors are much more saturated and, it seems to me, color has been added in some scenes.  I never found it to detract from the movie, it was always an improvement.  Two scenes I like to point out are both in ESB:  1) Training with Yoda  The whole environment looks much more earthy and alive with vivid hues of brown and green everywhere.  Even R2D2 looks noticeably different, almost organic as if he is molding-over in the soggy environment.  2) The carbonite room  In the original film and subsequent VHS releases, the colors in that scene are really saturated and the lighting is low, making VHS versions appear to bleed color between areas.  Here the DVD really shines as the colors are even more saturated and do not bleed at all.  So why just 4 out of 5?  I wasn't blown away by the audio.  Heck, this is from Lucas - the guy founded the company that owns and licenses THX.  Naturally I was expecting really (...) audio.  But, alas, it was only "okay".  I have a mid-range 6.1 surround sound setup, and it's correctly tuned for my living room.  I was expecting to be surrounded by sound - something that doesn't always happen with surround sound encoded movies.  I mean, often it seems that the surround channels are only used for the occasional directional audio effect.  I was expecting to hear tie-fighters, xwings and the Falcon swirling around me, but that really wasn't the case.  It may not be fair for me to knock it down to 4 just cuz I expected crazy-good audio for no reason other than my own imagination, but hey, that's how I feel about it, reasonable or not.  Anyway, I still think the DVD is worth owning.
