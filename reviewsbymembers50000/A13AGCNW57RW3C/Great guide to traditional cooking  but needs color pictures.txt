 I'm American but my mother grew up in Korea, and I bought this book hoping it would show me how to cook dishes "like Mom makes".  This is definitely the right book for the job.  Other Korean cookbooks I've found tend to focus on more recent trends (fusion dishes) and don't include many of the really time-consuming traditional dishes.  This book is about as "old-school" as you can get- it even tells you how to make your own soy sauce (get some charcoal and clear-out a couple weeks of your calendar). Besides the recipes, the book contains many anecdotes and other bits of the author's family history.  Besides being interesting in their own regard, they really help you understand why things were done in the traditional way.  I've really enjoyed this book, I've made several great dishes thanks to it, and I later gave copies to my brother and my mother as gifts. Still, I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the recipes REALLY need color photos or at least clear illustrations of some of the stages of food preparation.  The pictures that do appear are small and black-and-white.  Traditional Korean cooking places a lot of emphasis on the shape/size/color of ingredients, a point the author acknowledges, which makes me wonder why better photos and illustrations weren't provided.  Still, a great cookbook and you really can't find some of these traditional recipes any place else (unless you have a Korean mother or aunt).
