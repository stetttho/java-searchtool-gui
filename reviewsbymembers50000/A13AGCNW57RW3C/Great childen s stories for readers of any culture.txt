 I first saw this book in a small bookstore in Berkeley, CA.  Flipping through it, I actually recognized a few of the stories as ones my mother had told me when I was a little kid (she's Korean).  I hadn't heard those stories in at least 20 years, and I immediately thought - "Wouldn't it be cool if I could tell those stories to MY kids someday?"  The author is a well-regarded expert in Korean folklore, and this book represents tales from all over Korea.  The lessons conveyed are similar to what you get out of western folklore, but as an American, it was really neat to hear stories that revolved around Korean family values, history and mythology.  For instance, there are several tales about rabbits and tigers, and it's neat to see how those animals represent certain personality types in their stories.    I think that many non-Koreans will find these stories novel and interesting simply because of their Korean "flavor".  And for people who grew up hearing Korean stories, it's a nice reminder of those tales and a chance to learn some new ones.  I've already bought copies for my brother and mother so they can read these stories to their kids and grandkids respetively.  I highly recommend this book.
