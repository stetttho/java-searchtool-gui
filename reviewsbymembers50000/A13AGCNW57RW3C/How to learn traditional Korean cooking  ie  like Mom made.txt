 This isn't just a cookbook, it's a good book in general.  The recipes become much more meaningful thanks to the author's explanation of how traditional Korean cooking methods are entwined with Korean culture.   I've looked through many 'Korean' cookbooks and never bothered with them because they really covered modern Korean-western fusion dishes, or referred to dishes by their traditional Korean name but gave instructions for very non-traditional preparation and presentation.  If you're like me, you want a book that tells you how to make Korean food like Oma and Omanee made.  This book fulfills that need 100%.  It even goes so far as to tell you the tradional method for making your own soy saunce :) I'm a complete novice cook (single guy) and, thanks to this book, I was able to make Ox Tail Soup correctly on my first try.  The ONLY negative comment I have is that the pictures are not in color, and none of the recipies show step-by-step pictures or illustrations.  Still, the instructions are very clear so it generally is not a problem.  But if you really want pictures for reinforcement, I'd recommend buying this book and another one with lots of pictures as a companion.
