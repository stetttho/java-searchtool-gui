 Many people continually tell me "OMIGOD!!!  THIS IS A GREAT ANIME!!!  WATCH IT, IT'S SOOOOO AWESOME!!!"......it's not that I "don't" respect their opinions, I just have my own.  Personally, I find "Outlaw Star" to be an unwelcome anime in the "future western" genre.  Why?  For the following resons: 1). For a "future western" anime, it has nothing to do with anything western in it.  The galaxy seems as if a wealthy Hong Kong entrepeneur bought out every planet and branded it "wild west."  Almost had me fooled. 2). The characters are lame.  Gene can't fight his own battles, and doesn't have ANY redeeming qualities; Aisha is a typical cat girl; Melfina lacks anything interesting in her; Sazuka uses the same exact move in EVERY battle; and Jim needs to be punched.  The only interesting character is Gilliam, and even he doesn't hold a candle to other talking computers in anime. 3). The villains are uninteresting and tend to repeat themselves.  Oh did I say villains?  Seriously, manequins are more interesting then these pititful excuses. 4).  The soundtrack is boring and uninspiring.  Wow, no matter how far into the future you are, you can never escape the fact that the musical score sounds just like "Gundam Wing."  And the opening song?  Don't get me started. 5).  It's a "Cowboy Bebop" rip off. In the end, don't waste your money.  Use it for "Evangalion" or even "Black Jack."  But if you need your "future western"-fix, try "Trigun," or try to find some old episodes of "Sabre Rider and the Star Sherifs" for that matter.  Avoid this one. -RW
