 Perfect for any anime purists.  You get 6 episodes for a very good price.  And seeing how most animes give you only 3 episodes on one disc this is a VERY good deal.  Besides, Robotech is as big a part in the lives of people who grew up in the 80's as lets Transformers, GI Joe, Thundercats and even Sabre Rider and the Star Sheriffs for that matter.   Buy this. -RW
