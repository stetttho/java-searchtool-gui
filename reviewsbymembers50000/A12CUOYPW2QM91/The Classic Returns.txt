 Let's first get this out of the way. *ahem* This is NOT the best DVD set ever made.  Well, that being said, I can finally get tot he good stuff.  "Star Blazers" was one of the greatest(if not "the greatest") anime of all time.  Sure, it doesn't reach up to "Mobile Suit Gundam" level, but what "Star Blazers" lacks, it more than makes up for. There isn't anything I can say about this title that hasn't been stated before.  It is revolutionary in all aspects.  Calling this "space opera" wouldn't do it justice.   "Star Blazers" (or rather "Space Battleship Yamoto" as it was called before the 70's dub) brings all the aspects of a "human" story together.   You want love?  It's here!   You want drama?  You got it! You want excitement? Look no further! You want heart-wrenching-excitement-and-character-devolpment-beyond-the-naked-eye-can-see?.......okay I'll stop, but you get the idea! Of course this series is from 70's so the animation seems dated.  But for those of you who CLAIM to know anything about anime, you should know that "state-of-the-art" animation is not always the best thing (after all, look at "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within" or "Blue Submarine No. 6"), in the end, it's the story that outshines everything else. So, if you are an otaku, old or new, buy this and you can die a happy man/woman knowing that you have watched a significant landmark in anime.  "Star Blazers" I salute you!   -RW
