 "Trigun" is a completely unuasual paradox in anime. It boasts violence and action, yet the main hero is not a violent man. In fact, he's pretty much...a dork. He never fires a shot until the fifth episode, he always runs away from battle, he never kills anyone, he doesn't like the sight of blood, and seems to be always getting himself in some kind of trouble. All of which makes Vash the Stampede one of the greatest anime character of all time. "Trigun" is the third Japanese take on the "sci-fi western" in 1998. The first being the enormous "Cowboy Bebop," and the second being "Outlaw Star." Only difference with them and "Trigun" is that "Trigun" tends to be more western than the other two. The world is basically a "western Tatooine" with five moons, no aliens, and a [lot] of bandits, thugs, asassins and whatevers. Although, at times the story can get a bit too "cliched," (it happens so few that it's hardly noticeable) the heart of "Trigun" lies within the characters. The comical and oft-harrassed insurance ladies Meryl and Milly, the gun-toting life-loving priest Nicholas Wolfwood, the impressively scary Legato Bluesummers, the multi-interesting set of side-characters (especially the Gung-Ho Guns) and of course Vash. A man who's past lays shrouded in mystery, with a heart of gold, yet is still labeled as the most dangerous gunman ever.  I cannot get too far into this otherwise I will end up spoiling this anime-classic, but take my word for it. Watch "Trigun."
