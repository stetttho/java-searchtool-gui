 Okay, let's get it straight here, I like CLAMP, I like Rintaro.  So how could this anime have gone so terribly wrong? First off, your basing a movie off of material (CLAMP'S X/1999) that was STILL IN PUBLICATION when the movie was made.  So of course A LOT of stuff was cut out. Second, the plot was reduced to a 90 minute "[fight] fest."  People appeared and dissapeared for no reason whatsoever!  And there's a lot of the "what the hell's going on" factor.  We never have time to dive into the characters, so when they die...we don't care. Third, it is poorly scripted.  The first act, Kamui spends deciding which side he should join.  The second act, everyone is offed one by one.  Where's the middle? Fourth, one of the worst endings ever. Fifth, bad BAD voice acting.  Both Japanese and English. Well, I've said it.  The only plus this movie has going for it is the animation.  Everything else is crap.  Avoid this one.  Or better yet, try to find a bootleg copy of the OVA or the TV series.  At least then you get some more substance for the style. Let's face it, this is one time that "X" didn't mark the spot. -RW
