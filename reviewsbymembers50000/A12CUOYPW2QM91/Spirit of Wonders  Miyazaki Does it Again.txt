 Hayao Miyazaki has had it rough with American audiences.  The master director has only been glimpsed briefly by American movie-watchers once or twice in the nineties.  However, he did manage to secure a somewhat small stateside followings with the releases of "Princess Mononoke," "My Neighbor Totoro," and "Kiki's Delivery Service" speckled throughout the nineties.  Finally, he has received the ultimate recognition that he has had coming in "Spirited Away."        Now, for those of yout oo lazy to read the back of the DVD here's how the story goes.  Chihiro is a little girl who is at a very odd point in her life; her family is moving to a new town.  On the way, her family decides to take a detour and winds up in a strange land that her father dimisses as an amusement park gone under.  However, night falls and the place comes to life.  Spirits of all shapes and sizes start emerging from the woodwork.  Chihiro is frightened for her life, tires to get away, but can't when she realizes her parents have been turned to pigs.  A benevolent spirit, Haku, helps her out by getting her into the Bath House of the Gods, the property of one evil witch named Yu-Baba.  She gives Chihiro a job, but takes her name as colateral, giving her the suffix "Sen."  From here she learns about herself in an alien, yet familiar, world populated by gods.   The story is very much similar to the works of Lewis Carrol, but works on a more Eastern way of thinking.  The spirits presented here are mainstays in Shinto folklore.  In this, Miyazaki provides the viewer with a world so far into the imagination yet at the same time, hitting close to home.  It's a sense of creativity in something that has been around for eons that makes them wonderous.  The spirits/gods/kame are infinitely more enjoyable than any deity that has come across Western screens.  From the spider-like Kamaji, to the inky No-Face, and (my personal favorite) the oozing Mud God.   The characters are much like Miyazaki's other movies.  His traditional heroine who grows strong through out the movie, and the wonderous side characters that support her.  Each character is used for all intents and purposes.  Not a single character wastes screen time.  If you've ever seen a Miyazaki film, you know these characters are easy to relate to and fun to love.   The music is everything I would expect from a Ghibli film.  Hisaishi Joe has been conducting for twenty years and shows no sign of losing his touch.  His melodies are a mix of emotions that add onto the action on screen.   The animation is gorgeous.  There is no doubt about that, Miyazaki's films always have an aura of perfection, especially in the art and animation department.  Even his older works like "Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro" and "Future Boy Conan" age better than most anime their time period.  The whole world in "Spirited Away" looks like one gigantic, colorful portrait.  Key word; Beautiful.   In the end, I really can't stop praising this film enough.  The fact that it garnered the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature should do more service to the film than I could.  I can finalize this all by saying that "Spirited Away" is the best film you can buy for yourself, your loved one, or your whole family.  With something for everyone this film proves once and for all, Hayao Miyazaki is truly a master of anime. -RW
