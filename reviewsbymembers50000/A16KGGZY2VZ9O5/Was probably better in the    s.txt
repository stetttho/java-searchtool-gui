 This book would probably have been better left in the '80s.  Or prehaps it could now be read as historical fiction?  The story revolves around Jill who was born a triplet.  Her brother is a work-aholic with a ninny for a  wife.  Her sister is going crazy trying to be super woman.  And every man  she meets wants to sleep with her.  Ok if you don't have anything else to  read, but seriously out of date.
