 My husband (who is Turkish) and I agree that this is the perfect little  phrase book to use when I get stuck trying to remember just the right  question.  With this little book I will be able to ride the bus, go to  market, and do other everyday tasks when we move to Turkey in a few monthes  without having to carry around several dictionaries all the time.       Not  only does it have a very easy to use layout and many vocabulary words, but  it also has many questions and (most importantly!) several common answers.   A really great book for anyone traveling to Turkey!
