 This is the first book by Dr. Yalom that I have read, but I can't wait to  read the next.  He is insiteful and helpfull.  The central theme of this  book is the fear of death and the struggle to overcome that fear.  Most  people at times have batteled with the fear of death and this book with its  ten stories of psychotherapy can give courage to us all.   The title  story "Love's Executioner" is about an older woman who had an  affair with a previous therapist.  It is full of twists and proves the  adage truth is better than fiction.
