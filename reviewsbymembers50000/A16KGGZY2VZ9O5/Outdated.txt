 The photos in this book look like they were shot in the 80's.  Hideous wallpaper, ugly paint colors, and gross fabric. Also this book is almost page by page an exact copy of the early edition entitled "Ideas for Great Kid's Rooms" ISBN 0376017546.    Yes there are a few good ideas in this book so I gave it two stars instead of one, but unless you can get it used under two bucks, don't waste your money.
