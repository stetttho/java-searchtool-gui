 I absolutely loved this book.  Then again I met the qualifications of being an eccentric on 13 out of 15 requirements.    This book is based on the first psychological study of the eccentric personality type.  I have a degree in psychology and was glad that this book didn't go in too deeply with scientific terms (that is what journal articles are for).  Instead it is written for the general public.  The reviews of historical eccentrics is very interesting as are the interviews with living eccentrics.  Yes, he started out with an hypothesis that eccentrics are generally happier than the average person and yes his research confirmed it, but that is why its call research.  Some of his hypotheses are disproved.  He never claims, as one reviewer suggested, that strange unhapy people are neurotic.  He just states that in this study many more of the participants were happy than were sad.  If you want to read and learn about something different pick up this book.
