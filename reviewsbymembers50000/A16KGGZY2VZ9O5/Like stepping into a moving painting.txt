 Arthur Golden's "Memoirs of a Geisha" is absolutely beliavable and beautiful from the first page until the last.  Everytime I picked up this book I felt immeditaley transported to the geisha's world.  Everytime  I put the book down I needed a few minutes to readjust to my proper  surroundings.  Truly a magnificient book.
