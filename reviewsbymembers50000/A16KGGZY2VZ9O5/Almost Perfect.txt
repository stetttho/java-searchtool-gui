 It is hard to believe that anyone who has a real interest in space, NASA, etc hasn't read this book, but in fact I just finished it reading it after 20 years of fascination with just those things.  I love Michener's blending  of fact and fiction.  His characters are very realistic and natural.   However, I did find that the book dragged in the last 50 pages or so as he  searched for an ending. If you enjoy reading about NASA then you must read  this book.
