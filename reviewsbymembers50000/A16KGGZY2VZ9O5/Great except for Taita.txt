 This is the first book I have read by Wilbur Smith.  I loved the backdrop  of ancient Egypt and most of the characters were beautifully portared.   However, the story teller and main character Taita drove me crazy!  He says  that he is the best artist, doctor, architect, inventor, etc, etc that was  ever seen in the Egypt.  Give me a break.  Smith has a great talent with  words and his battle scenes are spectacular.  If you are interested in  historical fiction about ancient Egypt then read this book.  If stories  were the main character are so high on themselves bother you than don't  read this book.
