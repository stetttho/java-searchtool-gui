 The first few chapters of this book were extremely interesting to me, but the more I read the more confused I became.  Prehaps it was because when I took the body type test I came out 50-50 between two types.  Chopra gives  an excellent overview to Ayurvedic medicine and does have some help for  people who are not clearly one body type or another, but the bulk of the  book is spent on helping people who are clearly a Vata, Pitta, or Kapha.   In fact some of the information for 50-50 types was contradictory which  only heightend my confusion.   I recomend to borrow a friend's or  library's copy and take the body type test first.  If you are clearly one  body type over another and interested in Eastern medicine I would highly  recomend this book.  But it didn't help me personally.
