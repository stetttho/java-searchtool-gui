 This book is so much more fun than any of the other textbooks that I have  tried that I am acutally eager to study. The sessions go by fast, but I  feel that I really have learned a lot. The only problem I have is with the  pronounciation guide at the begining which was written for British-English  speakers and was confusing for me an American-English speaker.  Thankfully  though I have my own Turkish tutor to help me with the prounciations.
