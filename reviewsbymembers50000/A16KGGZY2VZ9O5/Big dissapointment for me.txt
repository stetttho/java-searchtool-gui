 I was hoping to find new insight to me depression and PMDD, but only found the same old same old.  The book's pollyanna tone while talking about such a serious subject was annoying.  For people not already under care of a physician or who think they are alone, this book could be very helpful, but if you already know something about the role that hormones play in women's mental health you won't find anything new here.
