 This book has plans for homes from under 1,000 square feet to over 4,000 square feet.  It also includes two pages of garage plans.  Most of the houses do not have a big ugly garage sticking out at the front and their are designs for the shore, the woods, and the cul-de-sac.  If you are looking for something run of the mill or distinctlly different, this is the home plan book for you!  Plus check out how cheap it is!
