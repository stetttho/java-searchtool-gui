 I absolutely could not put this book down once I began to read.  I read almost nonstop for 24 hours until coming to the end.  Kingsolver shows with beautiful style and language a world that can only be known to those that  dare to leave the comforts of home on the strength (however flawed) of  their beliefs.  A man who believes in the conversion of spirits and a woman  who believes in standing by her man and the four girls who have no choice  but to believe that their parents are taking them on a grand adventure.    As an expatriate myself I really identified with many of the situations  in this book.  I must shamefully admit to packing my pockets with extra  poundage to make the baggage weight limits.  Everyone will find something  to love about this book.
