 Steinbeck writes the beautifull yet sad tale of two men trying to find a place for themselves durring the Great Depression.  I first read this book at the age of 13.  I read it in one sitting (not hard to do as it is only  around 110 pages) and then cried and cried.  An excellent book for young  adults as well as adults.  It will move you.
