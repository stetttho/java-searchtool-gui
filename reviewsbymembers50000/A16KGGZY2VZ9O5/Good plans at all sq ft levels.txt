 This is a good book of plans for one story homes.  One story is the trend in homebuilding now because the baby boomers are finding it increasingly difficult to get up and down stairs and are looking to a long future as they age.  The plans are presented two to a page so the blueprints are quite small and some of the type is unreadable.  The index is simply in alphabetical order so not terribly helpful if you want to only look at say homes with basements or some other criteria.
