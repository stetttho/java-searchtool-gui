 Nevil Shute uses no big scare tactics to try to make us wake up to the impending doom of nucuelar warfare in "On the Beach".  Instead he uses quiet characters doing their best to live the life they've always  wanted.  Most of the characters in this book do not face the reality of  impending death which makes it all the more sad when it does come.  A  fantastic book that should continue to be read even though the cold war is  over.
