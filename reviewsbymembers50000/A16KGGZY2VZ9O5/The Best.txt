 This is absolutely the best resource for anyone trying to conceive, pregnant, with an infant or just curious about the entire process.  My husband and I used this exculisevly with our first child.  Now that we are ready to have a second, I've tried other books (What to Expect, Girlfriend's Guide, etc) and have been dissapointed by all.  This is truly the only book you need for pre-conception through your child's first birthday.  I love that this book take a serious tone and a more professional viewpoint.  It doesn't joke or make fun of any part of the pregnancy process.  One of my favorite parts was its breakdown of labour and delivery.  I read this section many times and made notecards to take to the hospital with us.  Everytime our daughter sneezed, spit-up or had a fever we ran for this book. (hey we were first time parents!)  I was living very far from my own family in a country were I didn't speak the language.  This book was my bible and comfort.  I never thought to look anywhere else for answers.
