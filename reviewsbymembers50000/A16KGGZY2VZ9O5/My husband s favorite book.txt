 I enjoyed Cannery Row, but my husband loved it.  He rarely reads fiction, but now reads everything Steinbeck that he can find.  The characters in this novel are wonderfully bright and colorful, and wonderfully they have a  happy ending and live again in Steinbeck's sequal Sweet Thursday.  A great  book to change the mind of someone who thinks they don't like literature.
