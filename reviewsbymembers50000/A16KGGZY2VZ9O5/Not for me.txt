 I usually enjoy Alternative History, but most of this book was not good in my opinion.  The very idea of still being a British subject (even though I am an American expatriate) leaves a very bad taste in my mouth.  I have  heard Brits brag that America would be better off if we were still a  colony, but that talk is just blusster.  Also the idea that blacks would  still be second class citizens (which this book advocates) does not bode  well for a British controlled America.
