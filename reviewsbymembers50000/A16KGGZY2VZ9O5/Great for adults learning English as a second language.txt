 I am an English as a second language teacher in a small town in Turkey.  The emphasis in learning English here is usually placed on grammer grammer and more grammer.  However I believe that students also need to learn to  speak and read effectively in order to know a language.   This book  promotes "whole language" with its very interactive style.  Each  chapter begins with a black and white photo and questions to get the  student thinking about the topic.  Next is a two columned one page reading  section.  After the reading there are four pages of exercises including:  Vocabulary, context, comprehension/reading skills, understanding details,  discussion, and writing. Students are not asked just to answer questions,  but to really think about what they read and apply new vocabulary in a  different context. All my students love this book and constantly ask,  "Is this really true?".  Of course it is and that makes it that  much better.
