 Fannie Flagg is one of the best writers about the south and "Fried Green Tomatoes" is her best book.  Everytime I read this book it is like coming home to the little cafe downtown and to the sound of the old  trains that used to pass in the night.  The characters are like old friends  and the strength of spirit an inspiration.  I would recomend this book to  any woman who needs a good laugh and a good cry because this book will give  you both.
