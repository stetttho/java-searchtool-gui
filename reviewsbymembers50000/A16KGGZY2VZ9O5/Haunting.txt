 When I first read Margaret Atwood's "The Handmaid's Tale" I couldn't put it down.  I read so fast that I knew I most have missed some potent details so before the last few chapters I decided to turn back to  the begining of the book and read slowly (one chapter a day) savoring each  little haunting bit.  This book is a fantastic view of a very possible  future, and a very good reason to continue to buy books printed on paper  and not digitally transferred. People who are from the religious right  might not like this book as it will force them to question their beliefs in  regards to relationships between men and women.
