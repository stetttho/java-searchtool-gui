 This is not the type of book to read through quickly.  Though only 226 pages in length it tells a story of 80 years.  Like Quindlen's "Black and Blue" it will make you cry, but crying seems to feel so good when reading a book this momentous.    Another reviewer spoke of unanswered questions.  I would implore anyone who reads this book to do so slowly over a week or two in order to process the huge amount of information that is given in each paragraph.  All the answers are there.    Like most of my favorite books this one can best be summed up in one word, bittersweet.
