 Thorton Wilder explores chance and destiny in his classic novel The Bridge of San Luis Rey.  When a monk watches five people fall to their deaths due to a collapsed bridge he wonders why God picked those five.  However the  writer leads us through the detailed lives of three of the fallen we see  that their entire lives were leading to that inevitable fall.  A well  thought out well paced book.  It made me question fate and free choice.
