 Baedecker's is an old name in the travel guide world.  I reallylove my Baedecker's Turkey except for two minor and one major problem.The first minor problem is that Pisidia Antiocha is not metioned in the book.  I was hurt by this as it is near my home and this region of Turkey is quite proud of it.  The second minor problem is the map that comes with the book is too large and cumbersome for use while driving. The major problem is the binding.  After just two years of sparse usage the binding is completely wrecked.  I love the book so now I will have to shell out the money to have it bound but since I already paid ... for it I think the binding should have lasted longer.
