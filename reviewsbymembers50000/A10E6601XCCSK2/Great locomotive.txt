 I do not know why so many of the other reviewers have problems with this locomotive. Maybe they got an early version or something. I received mine yesterday and it runs just fine up and down hills, in and out of curves as well as with and without wagons (I have been testing it with up to six wagons without problems even on hills). The locomotive is much stronger and faster than the smaller battery driven engines. It is also easier to control than these engines as the control buttons are larger. It may be used as a traditional hand-pushed locomotive by switching the last button (this is also a feature not found on the smaller engines). And finally it generates sound whenever it starts moving (the sound last for about 5 seconds and then it shuts up). So, all in all, this locomotive has been a great investment. Check it out if you are running a battery powered Brio railway.
