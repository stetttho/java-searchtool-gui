 These supports are way better than the older Brio bridge supports. The main reason for this is the added size of the support that makes it harder to push over when your child is playing with trains on the bridge or nearby. Another nice feature is the anti-slip material on the top which gives you a better grip on the tracks. Finally, they look nice as well. Only bad thing about this development in Brio bridge supports is the added cost per support. If you want to, you can stack these supports to build very high bridges. However, if you want to build multi-level bridges, I would recommend getting the green stacking track supports instead (Brio 33253) as these supports will give even better stability and also allow for several bridges at different levels crossing eachother, etc. The green supports are a little more expensive but I think they are worth it for multi-level bridges.
