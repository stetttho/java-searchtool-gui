 This is the most expensive single piece set that Brio sells. But if you want a big and sturdy parking place for your trains, this is the piece to get. The Roundhouse set comes with a five-way switch, however, it may also be used with the 33276 Grand Turntable which is designed to fit the entries of the roundhouse. The trains inside the roundhouse may be accessed either through the five front doors but also very conviently through the large and easy to open sliding back doors. The back doors are very nice as it may otherwise have been difficult to park and get to the trains inside the roundhouse. Apart from the front doors being a little hard to open, I have found no problems with this set. It it a good and safe parking lot for the engines and it has enough room for even the very long 190mm/7.5" IR controlled engine (33221). Whether it is worth the price? Well, I think it is a bit too expensive. But when you got it, it adds a lot of play possibilities to your train set.
