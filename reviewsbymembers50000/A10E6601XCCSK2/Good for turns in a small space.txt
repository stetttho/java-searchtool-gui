 These short curves are really a nice addition to your wooden railway system as they make it possible to create small and sharper turns than you can do with the normal curved track (33342). The downside of this track is that it may be a bit difficult for longer engines (like the mighty red battery-powered engine) to drive through the curves. However, if the tracks are laid without too many "bumps" at the connecting points the larger engines will manage to drive through it as well.
