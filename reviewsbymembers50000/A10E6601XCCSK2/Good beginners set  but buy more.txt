 This set is the lowest entry point into the Brio world of wooden railway. It only contains eight curved tracks and thus the layout combinations are very limited. So, if you buy this, remember to buy some of the Brio expansion packs as well or the set will probably not be able to keep the child's interest for very long. The strength of Brio is to lay out different track designs. Actually playing with the trains once the layout is done is not all that interesting to the child (my observation). The train itself is quite nice. It is the only train in the Brio series that comes with different colored wheels. Nice collector item, I guess...
