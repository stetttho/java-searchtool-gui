 This stop & go crossing has many uses if you are running battery powered Brio trains: 1. It can be used as a normal crossing where no trains are stopped (put the control bar in the middle position). 2. It can be used as a normal stop track (put the control bar in one of the side positions). 3. It can be used to avoid collisions if you are running a multi-train railway as it can be set up to stop the traffic in one of the directions. I have not regretted buying this product. In a not-too-simple Brio railway setup it adds both fun and educational value.
