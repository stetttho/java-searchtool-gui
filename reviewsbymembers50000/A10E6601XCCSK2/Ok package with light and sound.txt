 This set contains a light house which is activated whenever the magnets of the Brio train passes over it or a button on the top is activated. The light house will produce a nice fog horn sound and turn on the light for about five to ten seconds. Unfortunately, the light house has no on/off switch so the only way to run in silent mode is to remove the batteries. Apart from the light house which has no real purpose except looking and sounding nice, a small boat is included. The boat is where the long term interest in the package is located. This is the item that the child can interact with as the boat can sail goods and people from place to place and load and unload cargo with its small crane. The crane is probably the least durable part and might be destroyed by an overly eager child. This is a shame as it would also destroy much of the set's playability. To conclude, I like the set. However, it is not for the heavy handed kids and it is a bit too expensive for what you get (but that applies to most Brio items, I guess).
