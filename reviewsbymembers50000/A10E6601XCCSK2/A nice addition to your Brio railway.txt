 This tunnel generates one of four sounds when the train passes through or the button on the top is pressed. The sounds are well made. They include an owl sound, train and mine sounds and so forth. I think the playback volume is just right. A nice touch is the steps made on one side of the mountain as well as the small bridge on the top. These features creates a roleplay area for your child to explore with the small Brio men and women you can get in some of the other Brio sets.
