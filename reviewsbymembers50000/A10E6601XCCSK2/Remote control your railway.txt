 I got two of these switches in my Brio railway system. They come with an infra-red controller that works on up to about four meters distance. The only problem with the design of the remote control system is that it can be difficult only to control one of the switches at a time if they are placed closely together in the track system. It would have been nice if Brio allowed two or more different encodings of the IR communication so that the control of the switches would not interfere with eachother. They have done this on the remote controlled train so why not on the switches? Apart from this the IR switch works great. It makes noice and lights when operated from the remote control or the buttons on top. If you want to save on the batteries, you can operate it by manual control as well. A good investment if you want to create a more advanced Brio railway system with battery powered trains, etc. Now, Brio needs to come up with a left turning version of the switch as well.
