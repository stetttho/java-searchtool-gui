 This figure 8 set is a good starting point for a Brio collection. However, as is the case with most of Brio's simple starter kits, you and your child may get bored pretty fast if you do not add some expansion kits, especially more tracks and switches and maybe a battery driven engine. What I like most in this set is the classic viaduct. This piece has been in Brio's catalogue for nearly 30 years and it is a great and robust piece of track. Not like the flimsy plastic mountains provided as bridges in some of the other starter kits.
