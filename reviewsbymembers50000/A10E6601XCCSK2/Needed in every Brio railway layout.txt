 This set of assorted short tracks is hard to avoid if you want to create a track layout of even an intermidiate size. The male-male and female-female pieces will provide a dramatic increase in the number of layouts possible as you can now overcome the problem of curves returning to the starting position. This is a must-have for any Brio enthusiast.
