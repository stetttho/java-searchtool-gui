 This Brio starter set is a little expensive for what you get. You can almost buy the parts individually for the same price as the set. However, if you decide to get this set, you will have a setup advanced enough to keep your 2-5 year old child busy for many hours. Especially the nice red bridge and the switches add many possibilities to experiment with track layouts for you child. The set has a farmer theme making providing a bit of roleplaying education as well. For expanding this set, I would recommend more straight and curved tracks as well as a couple of switches. A battery powered engine with one or two stop-and-go tracks will add great fun as well. Finally a crane could be added for stock loading and unloading.
