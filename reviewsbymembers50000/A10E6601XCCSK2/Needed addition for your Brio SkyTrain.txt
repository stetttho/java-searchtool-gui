 If you have bought the Brio SkyTrain 33925 set, then this support expansion set is a very nice addition to get more playability into your SkyTrain designs. It contains two low and two high supports. The supports are very robust and will not break unless you really try to destroy them. We have bought five of these extra support sets for our SkyTrain so now we got a very enjoyable SkyTrain setup to integrate into our traditional Brio railway layouts. Recommended...
