 This package together with the other Brio track expansion sets are essential to get after buying the typical Brio starter set. This is the way to enhance the fun and educational value of that first investment in a Brio train set as a bit of extra tracks allow for a lot of new track layouts. This is what Brio is great for - allowing your child to discover and explore new layouts. This set contains four long curved tracks, enough for a 180 deg. turn. The tracks are very robust and you would need to be pretty violent to break them.
