 This jungle tunnel makes one of three jungle sounds when either a train passes through it or the button on top is pressed. It comes with two AA batteries installed so it is ready for use straight out of the box which is nice. The mountain has a nice design and it provides a small play setup with steps to climb and a small bridge on the top. This can be used as a play area to be used with the small Brio people that can be bought with other sets. I prefer the Brio 33481 Adventure Tunnel over this tunnel. The Adventure Tunnel is of the same shape but with different colors, however, the Adventure Tunnel has four different sounds where the Jungle Tunnel only has three and its sounds are of better quality. Therefore, buy the Adventure Tunnel before buying this one. But get at least one of them as they are both good fun.
