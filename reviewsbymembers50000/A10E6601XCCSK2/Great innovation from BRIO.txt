 The new SkyTrain series from Brio is a great idea that will add new possibilities to an existing track layout. This set should be the starting point if you wish to add SkyTrain to your collection. It contains five low and five high supports to carry the 10 included track pieces as well as two passenger wagons to drive around the track. It also contains a couple of trees for your Brio landscape. As always, it is a good idea to get some of the other SkyTrain accessories if you want more playability value from the set. For our SkyTrain set we have purchased 20 additional supports and the load/unload crane. The many supports make it fun to create advanced layouts running above and integrating with our traditional Brio layout. We are now looking forward to the battery-driven SkyTrain engine that Brio has announced for late-2003/early-2004.
