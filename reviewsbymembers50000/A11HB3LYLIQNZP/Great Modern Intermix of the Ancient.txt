 Hildegard Von Bingen (1098-1179) was known as the "Sybil of the Rhine", who was one of the first women to produced major works of theology & visionary writings. She became so popular that she was able to advise bishops, popes, & kings. She also used & wrote about the curative powers & medicinal uses of plants, animals, & stones. She wrote liturgical plainchant honoring the saints & the Virgin Mary for the Roman Catholic holidays. Emily Van Evera & Sister Germanine Fritz sing Hildegard's songs with tasteful modern production from the masterful musical arrangements of Richard Souther. Together they intermix the ancient words & rhythm of Hildegard Von Bingen with modern electronic instrumentation & style. Cleverly not losing either "Time Period" producing a CD that can be played over & over. If you become tired of this semi-new age music, leave the CD alone for a while, & return a few months later for added enjoyment. If you have a good stereo, this CD will offer a vast timber with lots of background sound effects. The best I can write is that the music is very spiritually uplifting.
