 Van Morrison always wrote music about the spiritual, but the spiritual is always changing. Starting out rather earthly (Moon Dance), to off center (Beautiful Vision), to right down center (No Guru...), to over done (Enlightenment)...this CD will give years of enjoyment with the philosophy of "Just you & me, with the Father...in the garden" meaning: Love will give you the direct experience of the divine without a guru, method, or teacher. Less R&B during this period, more Celtic Folk-Rock, with a very clean & well performing back up band. Some songs deal with either a journey or someone special is coming (Foreign Window & Town Called Paradise), is this about the 2nd coming of Christ, or that we all shall become like Christ or Buddha? Are there hints of reincarnation or renewing? Most of the songs give 2 to 3 different meanings depending on your spirituality or understanding fitting everything from Buddhism to Christianity. Also some issues about being Irish, (One Irish Rover) to being oneself (Ivory Tower). This has to be my favorite Van Morrison CD.
