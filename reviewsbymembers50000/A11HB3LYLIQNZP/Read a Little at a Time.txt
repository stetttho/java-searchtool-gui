 St. Maximus the Confessor lived during the time when the eastern half of the One Holy Apostolic Catholic Church was battling a heresy called the Monothelite controversy dealing between the unity or duality of will in relation to nature. Today many think the issue was due to cultural language limitations between Greek & Arabic, political problems within the Byzantine empire, & the rapid spread of Islam. Either way St. Maximus was the champion of Orthodoxy defending the view that Jesus was fully God & fully human in his incarnation, therefore he had 2 natures, & each nature had a will. Jesus expressed these ideas when he said "Not my will be done, but thy will be done" verses "I am in the Father." The 1st section of the book deals with St. Maximus's trial before the Byzantine Emperor where many false witness accused the Saint of being against the Emperor. St. Maximus quickly & rightly goes to the source of the matter & asks for proof, of course there is none, its all hear-say (heresy). For historical note: St. Maximus was finally accused, had his tongue & one of his hands cut off, & sent into exile where he shortly died. The masterpiece of this book is the 100 Chapters of Love, where St. Maximus takes several scriptures & many writings from the Church Fathers, & explains in great detail what Love is. The 1st time I read this book, I tried to read it as a whole book, this was a mistake. The 2nd time I read it, I read a verse at a time. St. Maximus writes with such tight exact meaning, that each word is overwhelming. Therefore for maximum (Maximus) enjoyment, read this section like a poem & then pray or reflex on each line. Another section is a great commentary on the Lord's Prayer: "Our Father". Each verse gets a few paragraphs of detail. This book is not for the soft hearted or for the easy to read crowd, but for people that enjoy deep books.
