 As with other reviews I can write "What a great CD, one of my favorite" the music fits the movie perfectly. Exploring the Irish myth of Selkies; Seal's that turn back & forth into humans. This myth helps to explain the unity of nature, the call of the sea for humans to live & explore, the dangers of losing one's heritage, & so much more. The music is timeless, haunting, beautiful, mystical, & a few adjectives more...Mason Daring really knows how to write great Celtic music uniting the past with the present. Some sections like "Liam & Nuala" are rather modern, almost a "2001 A Space Odyssey" awe with angelic female singing that gives you goose bumps. In other scections you will dance with the Irish jigs, cry with the lost dreams, & yearn to return to the sea. Try out "Crab Dream" on the Window Media or Real One Player to get a hint of this great CD.
