 Margaret Leng Tan has been playing her version of what a piano "Could" or "Should" sound like for years. In the past she mastered the prepared piano with "Sonic Encounters" & piano tape loops with "Litania". This is her newest addition, & what an addition it is: "The Art of the Toy Piano". Playing everything from Classical music (Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata & Erik Satie's Gymnopdie No. 3) to Rock (Beatles's Eleanor Rigby), the semi-off tune, percussion like toy piano adds an unique edge to some tunes you may know or never heard before. Sometimes other instruments are added, including a normal piano, which softens or blends the toy piano's hard edged sound. Try the "Listen to Samples", specially the 1st piece "Mirabella (A Tarantella)" for some "Real" art.
