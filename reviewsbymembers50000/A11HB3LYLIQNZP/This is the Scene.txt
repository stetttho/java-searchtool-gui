 Very enjoyable CD that brings back the best moments of a fine funny movie. At first listen, me & my wife were picking out the scenes of the movie: this is when Anne comes to the door at night...this is when Frank...At times the music gets a little corny, (not Lawrence Welk type of corny), but hey, isn't life a little corny every so often? The main highlight is the fantastic singing of Steve Tyrell, a multi talented cross over Tom Watts meets Dr John with Frank Sanatra overtones...In fact I am going to buy a few Steve Tyrell CD's after this & give them a spin...reviews to follow. Steve sings up front, full volume with the right emotion behind the song. Good songs while doing house chores or light entrainment background music with friends. The down side: the CD is a little short in time & lacks what could be fun back up information.
