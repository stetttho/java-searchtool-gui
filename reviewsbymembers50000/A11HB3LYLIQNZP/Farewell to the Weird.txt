 This is the most classical, enjoyable, & profound of all of Gavin Bryars modern works. Yes, the 20th century needed the experiments & Gavin Bryars has done his share, but this CD returns to classical roots while still remaining fresh & modern. The 1st section "Farewell to Philosophy" is a Concerto for cello & orchestra written for Julian Lloyd Webbers who's mastery expresses deep sorrow & beauty in a world that has thrown away philosophy. "One Last Bar, then Joe can Sing" for the 5 percussionists group Nexus is an anti John Cage near tonality, enjoyable work. "By the Vaar" was written for my favorite bassist Charlie Haden, who doesn't lose his jazz expression within this quasi jazz modern classical piece. Therefore if you have heard or bought some of Gavin Bryars works in the past & felt that something was missing, try this CD.
