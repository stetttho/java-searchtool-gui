 America is so far removed from the historical homeland of humanity where all the great religions of the world were either created or have given the basics ideals of spirituality that the New Testament at times seems it was created out of mere air. No, it was written by a Church to other parts of the same Church, read in that Church during the time when Christianity was illegal & most people didn't know how to read. After 400 years the Church finally agreed what books were to be put into the New Testament, then came the legal spilt of 1054, then the printing press, then the literacy of humanity. At last after the fall of communism & fragmentation of the Eastern Church, the original authors have written their book into English for the American public. Is it an evangelical tool? Yes it is, it always was. Is it really Orthodox? Yes it is, with historical back-up notes from the ancient Church Fathers & the Church as it exists now. I can personally write that the Old Testament is also coming out, my Deacon & Greek teacher is translating from the Septuagint the books of 1st & 2nd Chronciles (3rd & 4th Kings), & the book of Proverbs. I have seen some of the pages in his computer. Yes, the Eastern Orthodox doesn't use the New Testament in the same fashion as in American Christianity, we pray the scriptures rather than study the scriptures, but the Church is reaching out to meet the modern world.
