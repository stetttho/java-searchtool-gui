 I have been collecting strange mysterious female singers such as Lisa Gerrard & Joaane Hogg to name a few, for the last 5 years. I am most pleased to add Mary Fahl to the list. This CD offers some differences then the other 2 female singers who normally stay within a certain mode: wordless Middle Eastern-like & Progressive Celtic Gospel. Mary Fahl seems to be experimenting out of her shell with Arabian "Ben Aindi Habibi", Personalized Gospel "Redemption", Irish/Celtic earthly songs "Going Home", Italian Opera "Una Futiva Lagrima", while writing & singing profound songs of her own "The Great Unknown" & "The Other Side of Time". All are sung with a deep Alto, with at times almost tenor like power, yet still having the grace to hit the normal female beauty. The CD can sound uneven to some, but grows with many listens. I can hardly wait for the next CD.
