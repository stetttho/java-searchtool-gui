 Patricia Kaas is HOT in Europe & she sings her cross Jazz Rock hits in this 2 package set. The 1st CD starts out with a semi Hip-Hop, multi-layered funk beat & you may think "What is this? I thought this was suppose to be a Jazz Rock album." Don't worry, that was just to get the crowd going, all the rest of the songs are a vast mix of good, well written POP Jazz Rock ballads. Patricia Kass sings with a rough voice, but after a few listens it reveals a passionate world wise style that fits the songs nearly perfectly. Thinking about today's American musical culture, Patricia Kaas may not make it over here, but Europe for the last 40 years has taken the edge in developing music to a finer degree. Yes, this is POP, but European POP that is well produce & just a little different to add hours of listening enjoyment.
