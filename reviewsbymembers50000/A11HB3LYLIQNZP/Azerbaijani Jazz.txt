 Aziza is a young woman with beautiful long curly hair from the ex-Soviet country now named Azerbaijan. Her full name is Aziza Mustafa Zadeh. This is her 1st of 6 CD's produced for the West. This CD intermixes Eastern European & Middle Eastern musical themes for solo Jazz piano, & on a few songs Aziza chants with the music. She is fast fingered with notes running up & down the keys with melodies never heard before. This CD is for the experimental free Jazz crowd with their feet still on the ground. Another PhiloX-JD3 hard to get, great CD, here at Amazon.com.
