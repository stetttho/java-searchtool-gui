 This is one of my favorite movie theme CD's that I play over & over until my wife tells me to turn it off...& I am one of those people that never (well, hardly ever) plays the same thing over & over again, because my co-workers play their radio rap songs over & over...you get the drill. Trevor Jones wrote the first 9 songs & this is my favorite section. He really knew how to express the crash of cultures within the time period from the French Indian war. The fast pace main theme with its sad undertow of things to come, & the ultimate Irish Jig of "The Kiss"...what master pieces with layers of cross current melodies. Randy Edelman wrote the next 6 songs, they are good, but lack the essence of the Ideal of the movie (Okay, that was too philosophical...) lacking the passion of uniting the main ideas of the movie? That looks right :) What is strange about this CD is that most people think of Clannad's "I Will Find You" as the main song of the movie, when in fact you get a very short version of that song at the very end. Almost too short because it doesn't give you time to hum along. The full length version is on Clannad's CD "Banba" at twice the time. Over all a great buy with hours of listening pleasure.
