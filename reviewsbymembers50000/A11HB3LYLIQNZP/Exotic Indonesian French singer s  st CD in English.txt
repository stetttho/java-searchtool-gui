 A few years ago on PBS Sessions at West 54th, a tall beautiful exotic Indonesian woman with long black hair entered the stage & held the microphone with her sender fingers revealing her soul. "Who is this? I got to have her CD." Luckily I found the CD "Snow on the Sahara" & every song is top notch: the singing, the words, the emotion expressed behind the words, the background music with near perfect production. Most songs are a cultural mix, intermixing eastern melodies with western rhythms & pop hooks, that you will never get tired of. Sadly it seems she didn't make it here in the American Pop scene because when I went looking for her newer music, they are all import French CD's (which are not bad). I even found a CD with the same songs but sung in French. Why is it that Europe has great Pop while we in America follow the Pipe Piper of Commercialism? Must the Exotic always end up in Europe to make a living? To find out what is great pop, try this CD.
