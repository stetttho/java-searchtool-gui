 buy this hard to get, great, fun, yet at times sad or profound CD from Marvin Etzioni. Marvin started as the bass player & founding member of country punk group Lone Justice, but when he went solo during the 1990's, he branched out to experiment with several string instruments, with this CD focusing on the Mandolin. Another CD during this period, that is out of print, but in the same outstanding class is "Weapons of the Spirit". The songs from "The Mandolin Man" sound like old ballads with rock overtones & have some great back-up string arrangements (Violin, Cello, Bass) by Sasha Matson. Highlights of this CD are "Can't Cry Hard Enough" which is about losing a love to death & prayers as tears will not bring the dead back to life. Some songs take on religious topics as in "Master of Mercy" and "My Ultimate Home" which question God about the hardships of life. The all time best "Wings of Night" should be played in a dark room. It starts out with a light storm with rain in the background, then the words "innocent day, where are you...yesterday, remember her..." I have had this CD since it came out in 1992 & 10 years later I still play it. Thanks Marvin, there is someone listening to you :)
