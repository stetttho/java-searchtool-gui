 Elizabeth Taylor with then husband Richard Burton, both in top acting form, put up the money to produce this fun & well acted adapted version of a Shakespearean comedy. Directed by Franco Zeffirelli, who did one of the best versions of Romeo & Juliet, adds his magic touch. The Time period looks correct with many well done setting with the matching fashions. The film starts out rather slow with Michael York as the young scholar, but once Richard Burton comes in as Petruchio, you will be continually laughing. Elizabeth Taylor does well through out matching Richard Burton's skill. For those that don't like Shakespeare, this will be a fine place to start. Only during the last dinner scene did I have to rewind to understand the old English.
