 Paul Dresher has written & performed multi-media modern opera/performance art theater for over 20 years. Many of his works were either never recorded for consumers or are now out of print. As a composer with his ensemble, the music is rather unique classical minimalism mixed with progressive jazz/rock. At times tape loops, sound effects, or John Cage like random sounds are used with great effect. In the mid 1980's Paul Dresher joined forces with the performance artist/singer Rinde Eckert, who's emotional inner core goes beyond mere singing. One theater piece that was recorded "Slow Fire" was about a father teaching his son to hunt with a gun. Rinde Eckert interplays both father & son, singing with great skill about the dangers of America's freedom with bare arms. This time around with the composer Steven Mackey, the opera (dare I call it this?) "Ravenhead" gives an almost Benjamin Britten's Peter Grimes rendering about Richard Ravenhead, prime number 17, who's mathematical entrapments cause him to build a sailboat to solo circumnavigate the world. The CD is recorded live, which I believe limits Rinde Eckert to shout throughout the piece, losing his normally interesting singing voice. If your a fan of either Steven Mackey, Paul Dresher, or Rinde Eckert, then add this CD to your collection because their recordings are so hard to find. If not, try to find "Slow Fire" or other works from these fine artists to discover what is happening in today's musical performances.
