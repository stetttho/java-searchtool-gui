 Enver Izmailov is a Russian ethic/jazz guitarist from the Crimea area of the Ukraine. The main folk melodies are from the Black Sea area including Turkey, Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, & Greece. He uses modern technics (multi-strumming, hits, electrical play back, etc...) like Michael Hedges sound effects, yet because of the ethic origins, creates music with its own unique sound. If your into experimental music yet want some historical foundation, try this CD.
