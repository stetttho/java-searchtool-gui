 My wife is Russian & she told me about KNHO (thats how it looks in Russian, or Kino/Kyno pronounce in English). The CD looks in English but not spelled as "Nctopht Etoro Mnpa", therefore Amazon.com spelled it as "Istoria Etogo Mir". The translation of the title is "History of This World". This is a great CD that you can listen to over & over again. The music is sung in Russian, but is very universal in its appeal. The emotions expressed can be felt rather than understood. I think Kino sounds somewhat like "The Call" but was more versatile with eastern European influences. Kino's main singer was Victor Tsoi who died in an auto accident in 1990 while branching off to become a Russian movie star. As a singer/songwriter Victor Tsoi wrote & sang about the problems of Soviet Communism & the loss of spirituality or knowledge of God. He ran into some problems with the Soviet government & my wife thought he was killed by the KGB but I have yet to find some news article to state this. A very hard to get CD but well worth the find.
