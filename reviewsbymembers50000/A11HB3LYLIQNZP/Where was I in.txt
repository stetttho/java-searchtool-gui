 I missed one of the most fantastic concerts ever, but at least I have the DVD to playback many times through many years of inmate enjoyment. No, not inmate as in reaching out, but inmate has in feeling the music completely. Rickie Lee delivers songs with no strings attach. No, you wont see her float through the air or wear outrageous cloths like Sarah Brightman does in "La Luna", or get pass around the audience like Peter Gabriel. The DVD starts in her dressing room, Rickie is sitting by a mirror putting on the last of her make-up, slips on a shirt, & walks out into a simple well lighted stage with a table for a foreground & a window frame for a background. The back up band are all professional, dressed simple, but play the music with such perfection, at times sounding like they are losing it, but no, its a multi layered time change. WOW!!! Most songs are written by Rickie, others are jazz standards, & one song was written by her father. The ultimate section is when she takes off her shirt & plays the piano with the tunes: "Coolsville" & "We Belong Together". The song "Coolsville" ends with the words "Common, I will take you back...I take you back..." & Rickie holds her hand out to the audience, waving them in, & then making a fist. Slowly she stops the song & sits in darkness with the saddest face...then she giggles & the audience goes crazy...what a moment. This is a great DVD
