 My wife is from Russia & when we first played this CD, we thought the Choir was from Russia. No, its the Holst Singers, a group from England. How did they do it? I always like James Bowman as a counter tenor, but the Angelic Soprano is the highlight on this CD, even the bass singers sound like Russian deacons chanting biblical verses or praises to God through the Holy Doors. Most of the musical sections are classic Russian choir songs from the liturgy, but the "Four Choruses From Songs Of Troubled Times" is rather folk to maybe pagan in origin. The last 3 sections are from modern composers that fit well with the older material. We listen this CD all the time, specially before church, or during Holy Days, & believe me; the Orthodox church has a lot of Holidays :)
