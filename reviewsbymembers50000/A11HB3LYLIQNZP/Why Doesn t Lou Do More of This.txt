 Always knowing the background of Lou Reed; the Velvet Underground, Andy Warhol, Glitter Rock, Dave Bowie, one of the 1st songs on the radio about sex transformations...Lou Reed was never my style (Progressive Rock, Classical, Jazz, etc...) until this fantastic, personal, profound description of losing 2 friends to cancer in the age of modern medicine. The Loss is a reference to the 2 friends, the Magic is the up & downs of taking pills & sitting through machines that try to take away the illnesses. Lou Reed writes & sings all over the map from straight rock, to folk, to ballads with such emotion & wisdom that it will bring tears to your eyes. If your like me, then don't rush out & buy other Lou Reed CD's like "New York", you will be disappointed. Lou, forget the songs about drug deals, gangsters, & sex changes...your a genius with Magic & Loss. Give us more.
