 I really enjoy these fine modern semi-minimal String Quartet pieces from Micheal Nyman. The 2nd Quartet ranges from the fast pace & danceable 1st moment to the slow & beautiful 3rd movement which almost brings tears to my eyes. I agree with the other review in regards on the 1st Quartet, this was on the boring side. But after years of being a Phillip Glass fan (Einstein of the Beach & Koyanisqatsi) before he made it famous & now just writes carbon copies of a certain single sad rift (Naqoyqatsi), Micheal Nyman does a better job (The Piano & Songbook with Ute Lemper) & only once did I not like a CD (6 Days 6 Nights). Micheal Nyman explores more emotions & has a more expansive instrumentation than Phillip Glass. Do listen to the samples in the Window Media & Real One Players, they focus on the best part of the CD, & if you like them, the 2nd Quartet is worth the price of the whole CD.
