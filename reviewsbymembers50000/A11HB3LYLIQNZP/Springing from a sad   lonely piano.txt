 Walking through our local shopping mall into one of the larger catalog stores, the TV overheads were playing the typical hip-hop "I love you baby because you dance so fine..." You know the song, one of thousands of commercialized products rehashing the same lyrics. I thought to myself "If I were to write a song it would be about the universal sufferance of humanity & the salvation of personal responsibility springing from a sad & lonely piano." Then to my surprise, that sad & lonely piano sounded from the TV overhead. I looked up & saw a man singing about human tragedy, forgiveness, & divine love with a scar on his right cheek..."That's Seal, I read somewhere that he was good but I never listen to pop radio, I got to get his newest CD..." I am glad I did, this is fantastic pop with serious & intelligent lyrics covering many musical styles from Disco, Funk, & R & B that goes beyond the normal "Formula" with jazz hooks & great production. Therefore if you want something that most will recognize but with added class, give this CD a spin.
