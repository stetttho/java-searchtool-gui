 This well written & extremely long book, over 1000 pages, was my churches spiritual manual for many years. How a 1950ish southern Californian Eastern Philosopher Beatnik named Eugene Rose, rejecting the so-called "Norm", turned into one of the most influential Eastern Orthodox monks of our time period. Later tonsured with the name of Fr. Seraphim Rose with a follow brother in Christ Gleb Podmoshensky tonsured Fr. Herman, they entered the Northern California forests to create a monastery & print shop called "St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood", writing books that have effected & enlighten Eastern Europe & Russia during the Soviet oppression. As with other reviews, the book is fantastic as long as it focuses on Fr. Seraphim Rose's mission in life, with great photographs during his short but productive life. But once Fr, Seraphim Rose dies, the book turns into a private agenda about the monastery's fall out with ROCOR (Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia). The Great News is that the monastery is now under the Serbian Orthodox Church & the book has been extremely edited, deleting this major fault. Please check out "Father Seraphim Rose: His Life and Works" for a well waited focus on this hopefully Saint-To-Be.
