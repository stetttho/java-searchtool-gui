 Now for something completely different'...No, this isn't from Monty Python, its Paul Dresher (born 1951): the modern opera...opps...experimental music theater composer who uses electric guitars, synthesizers, & tape loops. His most famous opera is a set called the "American Trilogy" during the mid 1980's to 1990. Here is a CD that may attract (Attack) your opposite; a vast musical experiment that at times sounds classical...well minimalist classical...with a little Mahavishnu Orchestra type jazz mixed in...No, that's not quite right...Nature-like musical landscapes...wait, its all done with electronics so how can it be nature-like?...forget what I am writing because I can't describe it...just buy it.
