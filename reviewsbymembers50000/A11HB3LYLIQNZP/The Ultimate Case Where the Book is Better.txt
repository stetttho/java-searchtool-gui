 Do not pick up your New Testament & follow along with this movie, the characterizations & plot move in & out of biblical history that I stop watching the movie 3 times without ever finishing the movie. Then again; we all know how the movie "Should" end. Maybe better written: How can you make a movie called "The Greatest Story Ever Told" while changing the plot of the greatest story ever told?
