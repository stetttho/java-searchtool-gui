 St. Ephrem was born at Nisibis during Roman rule, but when the Persians took over the city, he moved & later died in Edessa 373 AD. St. Ephrem wrote numerous works & for easy categorization can be listed in 3 forms: (1) Texts, (2) Exegetical, & (3) Poetical. This book is about the 3rd type, his hymns. The book is beautifully done by Paulist Press in hard back, but this listing is for the paperback edition. One of St. Ephrems Lenten prayers is normally spoken by the entire congregation with prostrations in the Eastern Orthodox Christian church (Eastern Rite) during Lent (40 days before Passion Week & Pascha/Easter). This prayer is included in the book: O Lord and Master of my life, take from me the spirit of sloth, despondency, lust of power, and idle talk; But grant rather the spirit of chastity, humility, patience, and love to thy servant. Yea, O Lord and King, grant me to see my own transgressions, and not to judge my brother; for blessed art Thou unto the ages of ages. Amen.
