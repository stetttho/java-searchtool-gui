 Christy Baron's 2nd release is one of the most refreshing & experimental quasi-jazz CD's that follows in the same steps as Patricia Barber. Both singers come from a silky smoke Jazz ballad background & each experiment with different styles almost to the point of the avant-guard while not losing the Jazz mainstream. Maybe this is the reason why some like her 1st CD better, which fits more in the Jazz standard category. Unlike Patricia Barber, who writes many of her own songs, Christy Baron takes off with songs from different artists from Peter Gabriel's "Mercy Street" to Princes's "Thieves in the Temple". Each of these songs take on an emotional uniqueness that they no longer sound as if they were from the original artists. There is even a Tibetan monk's throat chord chant in a song. Therefore for lovers of the "Something Different", this may fit to your liking.
