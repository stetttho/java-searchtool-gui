 This is the 3rd book I read from Frederica Mathewes-Green & I am sorry to write that I am very disappointed. The past 2 books, "Facing East" & "At the Corner of East & Now" were written with a clean, clear, & personal view of Eastern Orthodox Christianity in America, but this book dealt with fictional characters from the past that seem out of place. Why not write about factual characters? There is almost 2000 years of Church history through several cultural/language groups of factual people that lived & pratice this religious/spiritual lifestyle who could of been written about. Also there are many Church Fathers & Christian Mystics that have given us information on Mystical prayer (silent prayer or Jesus prayer) that could give us a more balance & fuller perspective on spiritual transformation. May I suggest studying some of the Church fathers like St. Symeon the New Theologian or St. Theophan the Recluse.
