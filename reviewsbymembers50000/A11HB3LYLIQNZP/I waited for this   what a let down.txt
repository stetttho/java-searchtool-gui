 I rarely go out to the movies these days, but I watch the film reviews on TV & listen to what most people say. If I get a good report, I do one of 2 things when the DVD comes out: rent the film if the plot is questionable (normally a R rating) or take a gamble & buy the DVD to play on my better than avg 5.1 audio/video system. I heard nothing but great things about this movie & being Eastern Orthodox (not Greek; there is such a thing) wanted to experience a family rated movie about a non-American family. Want a let down, the typical plot: shy homely old maid feed up with family gets a make over & falls in love with the man her family fears most. Then there were strange things that would never happen in a Greek church: 1. Why did the Aunt rub oil on the soon-to-be groom? That's the priest's job. 2. Why during the wedding did the father walk down the bride? That's in the western church, the bride "Should" meet the groom in the entryway, then walk down with the priest. The one & only highlight is the father with his magic Windex & references to "Everything came from the Greek". Others things started out funny but went too far; I love the screens where the the bride-to-be kisses the groom-to-be good bye every night in the car & it takes them longer each night to leave, but after that why the references to pre-marriage sex & asking for her hand in marriage when it looks like they...well, its all innuendo. Sad to say I gave this DVD away to another person that told me they thought it was a great movie.
