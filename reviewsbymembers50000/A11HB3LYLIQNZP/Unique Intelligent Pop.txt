 This is Imogen Heap's 2nd or 3rd CD, but with the electronics of Guy Sigsworth make up the group Frou Frou (a french word for the sound that dresses make). This is unique intelligent, almost philosophical POP. Yes, there is such a thing. Some of the songs have clever twists of one or two words which question love & life. This is not "I Love Baby" pop, but pop with a rock back beat with words as "Is this it, Yes. Is it? No!" Imogen Heap sings in top form with full beautiful feminine emotion. The electronic background never gets in her way & at times several layers of sound are added with great skill. Looking forward to the next CD & I hope they don't go off the edge.
