 As a child I watched way too many Saturday morning cartoons. Now as an Adult I find myself watching the Saturday afternoon cooking shows. Ming Tsai with his show "Simply Ming" is one of the most refreshing & unique cooking shows to date. He is a perfect gentleman with the confidence, politeness, & excitement to present his East meets West recipes. Normally he has a guest chief that shares a recipe, even his mother was on one show, & afterwards you can see his joy sharing the meals with the perfect glass of wine. The book is beautifully done in hard back, with a single photograph of each finished product. Some cooking books have the advantage of showing each step or at least the main steps of a recipe, which this cooking book is missing, but there are added features that make up for this. The book is section off with a certain taste, spice, or sauce as the core which Ming Tsai calls "The Master Recipe". Then meat, chicken, seafood, or vegetable dishes are shown using this core or "Master Recipe". What is really interesting is in the corner of each page is a list of the perfect wine to match each meal. Some recipes seem puzzling to me; one requires a certain tea to match with the other spices, would any normal orange tea do? Other recipes may require going to a special food market. Amazon.com is offering the hard back copy for a great price. Excuse me while I go shopping for a few of the ingredients...
