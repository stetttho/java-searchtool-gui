 Very simple & slow devolving Classical Minimalism that develops layers upon layers of sound with such passion & intensity from prayers found in the Auschwitz death camp after World War 2. The highlight of this CD is soprano Dawn Upshaw delivering with clear force the horror & terror of life before a gas camber, yet with the tears & cries before God. Though the music comes from Jewish prayers, one piece deals with a mother grieving her son which gives a picture of the death of Jesus before his mother Mary. Therefore the music is very universal reaching beyond any religion depicting humanity in the extremes. A 20th century masterpiece worthy of any one's CD collection.
