 Did you ever want a certain collection of songs, but never got around to it, or when you did, it wasn't there? At last through Amazon.com I finally got Richard Harris singing Jimmy Webb songs. Maybe I never found this CD because I was looking for "The Best of Richard Harris", which may not exist. This is the next best thing which includes the 1968 LP "A Tramp Shining" & the 1969 LP "The Yard Went On Forever" with the added 45 song "One Of The Nicer Things". All the songs are ballads with some rock intermix for effect. Most songs used rather strange if not off the wall words that have left many guessing through out the years. The master piece is of coarse "MacArthur Park", but songs such as "Didn't We" & "A Tramp Shining" still hold up after all these years. I did find "A Tramp Shining" in an used LP store because I thought this was the only way of hearing the songs I remembered, but I will now play that for special occasions because CD's don't wear down. Another issue: Richard Harris did just pass away & this will make a nice tribute or gift.
