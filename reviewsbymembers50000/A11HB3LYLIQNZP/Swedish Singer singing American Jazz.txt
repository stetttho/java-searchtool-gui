 With a sweet little girl voice, something like a younger sounding Rickie Lee Jones, Swedish singer Lisa Ekdahl does refreshing interpretations on her 2nd English only Jazz standard CD. She doesn't have the wind or power of an Ella Fitzgerald, but she makes up for it in a different way, with charm. The other major highlight is the back up trio: Peter Nordahl on piano, Ronnie Gardiner on drums, & Patrik Boman on bass. Peter Nordahl at times sounds like a wild Bill Evans, kicking on & off the melodies. He makes a very interesting listen & what I believe is the well welcome stand out. If you like this CD, try the one before: "Back to Earth".
