 Years ago I was sitting in an art class & I heard these words from a song "Lord of the Starfield, ancient of days, universe maker, here is a song in your praise..." All of a sudden I knew exactly what the song was about & the singer sounded like me. I asked the owner of the CD player "Who is singing?" & he replied "Bruce Cockburn, a Canadian folk-rock songwriter". I then asked what CD's to buy & he told me "In the Falling Dark" & "Humans". After school I bought them both & when I got home to play them in my room, my father knocked on the door "Is that you singing?"  Bruce Cockburn writes songs with such depth & spirit...even if a few songs might take 3 to 4 listens...most songs on "Lord of the Starfield" deal with praises to God (Lord of the Starfield & Festival of Friends) or life under the sea (Little Seahorse), while another song is about the fooliness of governments (Gavin's Woodpile). There is even a song written & sung in French (Vagabondage), & a very well crafted guitar instrumental (Water into Wine), which begins in a gentle flow & then ends with an up beat medley. "Lord of the Starfield" is a great place to start with Bruce Cockburn.
