 This is different stuff...but I like it a lot. In fact, I like Steve Martland's music more than Phillip Glass. Phillip Glass was great for a start but once he became famous, all the songs sound the same. At least with Steve Martland the music is always different. The 1st section called "Danceworks" is simple Classical music with a rock beat, very jumpy & danceable, almost comical at times. The highlight is "Patrol", this is what many normally think as Classical music. This piece is the most haunting, loneliest piece of music I ever heard. At times the music seems like Arvo Part with its starkness, specially with the violins, yet Steve Martland holds onto his originality. Let me write it this way; if you want something different & feel very depress, either play "Danceworks" to left your spirits or if you want to remain depressed play "Patrol" to explore the uniqueness & mystery of your soul.
