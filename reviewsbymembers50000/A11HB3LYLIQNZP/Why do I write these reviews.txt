 I am on a Roll today, finding all the odd balls that nobody has reviewed yet. Okay, get this: take the beautiful simplicity of chamber music from the London Sinfonietta; add some Rock-N-Roll rhythms with some wacky modern instrumentation, throw some of the songs off the beat just when you understand the melody, & use some strange titles like 'Yellow Pages', 'Adjustable Wrench', & 'Rust for Piano'...I think that will describe it. Some experts compare his style to the metric complexities of Stravinsky & the repeated formulae of Phillip Glass with the energy Madonna's dance music. Why isn't there a 'Listen to Samples' section? Okay, so you can't hear it for yourself. You will have to take my word on it...Bummer, it maybe out of print...never mind. This is Michael Torke's (born in 1961 & growing up in Milwaukee, Wisc.) earliest & most original work, his later work is more mainstream but still has the some of the features of this very interesting musical experiment. If you find it, grab it.
