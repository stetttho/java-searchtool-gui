 Yes, it has a cool modern design that looks great in your kitchen. It has the Kitchen Aid name stamped on the front to give you that "Yes, I am a cook, I know what I buy" appeal. It cuts fast through coffee beans into a fine grade for your morning java, but what a mess. There are only 2 of us that drink coffee at our household, making 2 cups each weekend morning, therefore the size of this machine is not an issue, but there is a big major flaw with the design. I believe the clear plastic cover cup that fits over the stainless steel container needs an EPDM or Neoprene gasket ring to stop the coffee grain from spilling unto the kitchen table. We use a simpler solution; we place a napkin under the grinder to collect the dust. When the grinder is finished, we empty both the container & the napkin into the coffee machine. Compare the other brands or models before going for just the brand name.
