 Having listen to Luka Bloom from his first great CD "Riverside" in 1990, I thought he quickly reached to his pinnacle with his 2nd fantastic CD "The Acoustic Motorbike" in 1992. "Turf" in 1994 was good but lacked the creative edge of his pervious genius. Then after a 5 year vacation the lack luster "Salty Heaven" came in 1999, which lost the universal outlook of his previous work. After writing this review I returned to "Salty Heaven" & I am starting to get into it.  With "Between the Mountain and the Moon" Luka Bloom returns to almost match "The Acoustic Motorbike" in style containing a quasi Christian/Buddhist spiritual outlook. Luke Bloom sings with great passion about lost loves & hope for the future intermixing personal reflection about Ireland, Christ, the Angel Gabriel, & the Dali Lama. At times Luka Bloom does a clean Irish rap...er...poetry talk that is very unique for those that dislike rap won't mind listening to.  At times Luka Bloom can be compared to Bruce Cockburn. Both write & talk/sing about serious subjects in a multi cultural style with excellent guitar work & back up. But un-like the Canadian Bruce Cockburn, Luka Bloom retains more to his Irish/Celtic heritage within a baritone range.  Sinead O'Connor joins Luka Bloom in a few songs & makes an amazing match in tone & timber, specially in the song "Love Is a Place I Dream Of". Give it a listen to in the sample section.
