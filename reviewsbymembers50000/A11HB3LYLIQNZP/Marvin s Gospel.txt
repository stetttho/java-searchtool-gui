 Marvin Etzioni started as the bass player & founding member of country punk group Lone Justice. In the 1990's he made 3 solo CD's with "Weapons of the Spirit" being his last. This was his Gospel CD, expressing a near universal spirituality, both Jewish & Christian. Not the typical southern black Christian Gospel most people would think of, though there are elements of that style. Other elements included an unique blend of Jewish or Middle East music intermixed with western rock ballad. Most of the songs have some comic sound effects which add to the CD. I found a web site where Marvin talks about this CD as his antithesis from his previous CD "Bones" which expresses the flesh & how this CD was a return to his first solo CD "The Mandolin Man". If you can find this CD, pick it up, & have some spiritual fun.
