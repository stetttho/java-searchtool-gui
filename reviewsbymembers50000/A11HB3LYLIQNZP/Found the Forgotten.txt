 Found this CD by listening to head sets, & I was very pleased. I notice that the song list on the browser is in a different order than the CD. The 1st song on the CD & the 1st I ever heard of Dar Williams was "Mercy of the Fallen". After playing the CD several times, I did a little history check through the web & found out that Dar Williams has been making "Folk-like" CD's for a while. Why haven't I heard her before? I love modern folk & Dar Williams is a lovely add on to my growing collection, though some of her past songs deal with subject matters I would not sing about. Reading some of the reviews, some didn't like this CD because they state that Dar Williams has lost a little of her folk, but I love the production: The up beat sing-a-long theme "The World's Not Falling Apart" to the extreme reflected ending "I Have Lost My Dreams". This is a very well rounded find, not as choppy as Mary Fahl's "The Other Side of Time" who is also branching out to explore her talent.
