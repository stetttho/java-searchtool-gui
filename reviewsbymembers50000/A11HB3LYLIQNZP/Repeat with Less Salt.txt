 Over all a great book: easy to read, well photographed, many sub topics (Rubs & Marinades are the best sections)...but how to set up the Bar B.Q. is repeated over & over again with the same photos. Is this to give the compete ABC's or was this book written for beginner cooks? I tried several recipes, all turned out great for spice minded people (the Rosemary Brick Chicken is to die for), but I learned to use half the salt, or at times use twice the meat with the same amount of suggested spice. The book is worth buying, but test the recipes with yourself & a special other before inviting guests.
