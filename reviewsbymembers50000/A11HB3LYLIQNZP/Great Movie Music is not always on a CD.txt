 I normally write reviews on "hard to find" books or music because when I find a "normal" product that is "good", there are already great reviews that state what I would. This is no different...somehow me & my wife are into "swashbuckler" movies & the DVD version of "The Mask of Zorro" we have watched many times. Both of us have fallen in love with Catherine Zeta-Jones & because of her excellent performance, we bought her earlier British TV series "Darling Buds of May". Be that as it may, the music is fantastic throughout this revisited Zorro movie & at last we got the CD through Amazon.com. James Horner writes in top form that mixes modern renderings with the classic Spanish sound of that time period (1810's to 1840's). The CD is well recorded with great depth, holding a vast timber. My front room shakes during certain low notes & I don't play my stereo system loud. Yes, like one reviewer already wrote, some sections sound like a Spanish version of "River Dance" with the recordings of dancing feet that sets the rhythm of the music, but what about the greatest dance of the movie? The part where the "Zorro-To-Be" dances a sexy tango with Zorro's daughter? It is missing from the CD!!! If this piece was included I would rate this CD a "5" because everything else is great.
