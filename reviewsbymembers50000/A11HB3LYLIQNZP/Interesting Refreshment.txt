 This CD is just a little different to stand on its own. Take a clean well balance emotional female singer with great range, add some lite jazz & pop hooks to some unique modal changes, play with mostly guitar or piano backup, & wrap within great sound production. The only thing missing is the lyrics. Sometimes you can guess what the next word will be & some songs come close to Christian Pop Rock because of the subject matter (Is she singing about God, humanity, or a boyfriend/lover in most of the songs?), but don't worry, this CD is way above that style.  Are you tired of all the gloom & doom of modern Pop? Do you want something refreshing? Do you want to smile as you drive down the freeway? Give this CD a spin to clear the air.
