 After listening to Mary Fahl's CD "The Other Side of Time" & falling for her interesting unique singing voice, I bought both October Project CD's from Amazon.com. Being a lover of the 1970ish progressive rock scene & moving on to Classical & Jazz music during the 1980's & 1990's, I thought CD's like this were no longer made. Well, there was always Dead Can Dance which is less New Age, more World/Folk sounding than October Project. The production is great, the instrumentals are well played, Mary Fahl matches well with Marina Belica in timber, but the lyrics are rather strange. They are both Light & Dark at the same time, maybe expressing the battle between light & darkness. Some songs even cause me to question what is really being said, which maybe a good thing. This type of music is best if your in a certain mood, not for a party. I agree with another reviewer that the CD starts out better than its end. As with all different music, October Product didn't make it commercially & were dropped. Another progressive group that sings about positive spiritual issues & is still in business, try "Iona" which also has a unique female singer that will cause chills down your spine.
