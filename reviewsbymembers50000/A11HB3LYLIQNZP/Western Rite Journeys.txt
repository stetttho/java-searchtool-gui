 It is with great pleasure that I review this booklet by my priest & spiritual father Archimandrite Dr. Michael Trigg who's spiritual journey started with Oxford University High Anglicanism, through the break up of the American Episcopal Church in the 1970's, a short hop through the Continuing Anglican movement, & ending as the main priest in the Antiochian Orthodox Church in a Western Rite parish.  As stated with the review before, this small booklet tells the story of 5 other priests that made the similar journey, as did Archimandrite Dr. Michael Trigg. Though containing the basics of the need for Western Rite Orthodoxy, this booklet is more of an apologetic nature rather than a historical essay.  Basically the Western Rite within the Eastern Orthodox Church is still rather small, but with the continued problems of the American Episcopal Church & the fragmentation of the Continuing Anglican movement, a booklet like this could at least show an option or a means to continue to celebrate Christianity in a form that most western Catholics would recognize: Pre-Vatican-II but in a native language rather than Latin, or High Anglicanism. Both types would have changes in the Nicene Creed without the filioque (and the son) & a stronger Epiclesis with the elements of the mass. This booklet reminds me of its bigger brother "Becoming Orthodox: A Journey to the Ancient Christian Faith" by Peter E. Gillquist.
