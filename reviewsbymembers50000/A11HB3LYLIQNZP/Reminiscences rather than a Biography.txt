 My wife was reading a Russian Biography on Saint John of Shanghai & San Francisco & told me a few things about the Saint. There were a few issues that I needed to verify in English & I knew I had the above title book in my ever growing book closet. Instead of a standard Biography with a basic outline of the person's historical life, this book contain the following:  Part I - Reminiscences  18 Reminiscences from layman, Priests, Bishops, etc...each starting & ending with their own personal experiences with the Saint when he was alive. This created no true starting point, nor a general historical flow. Some information was repeated. After reading, it's up to the reader to paste together the Saint's life.  Part II - Testimonies Concerning Archbishop John's Power of Prayer  There is about 50 pages of people testimonies about Saint John's power of prayer after his death in 1966. I can personally give praise to Saint John when he revealed his help to my wife & I while we were vacationing & visiting his relics in San Francisco around Aug 2004.   Part III - Sermons & Homilies  These are 22 written sermons that Saint John gave during his life time. Some sermons are about the Church seasons: Lent & Theophany for example. Some sermons are on certain biblical passages: "In the Beginning was the Word...". Other sermons are about famous Russians: "The Tsar-Martyr Nicholas" or about the Russian exiles: "Russia".  Part IV - Decrees & Exhortations Issued by Archbishop John  As a Bishop, Saint John had to make Decrees about how the Church should run or how people should live, help, or understand Christian Orthodoxy.  Appendix  A Troparion to the Saint & a Report of the Examination of Saint's Holy Remains  Over all a good book to read, but if your looking for a biography, this book should be used as a back-up reference.
