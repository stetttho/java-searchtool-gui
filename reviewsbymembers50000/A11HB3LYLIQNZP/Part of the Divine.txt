 Litany is one of Arvo Part's finest works that starts with the hourly prayers of St. John Chrysostom, who's last name means "Golden Mouth". St. John Chrysostom was a monk turned Patriarch of Constantinople (modern day Istanbul), who edited & shorten the Eastern Orthodox Christian Liturgy which main frame is still used today. Therefore he was a master of prayer which Arvo Part has done a fantastic job adding a quasi-ancient yet modern version of minima classical music to. The music starts quietly & reflectively for a great length, slowly building until the heavens shine forth. Psalom is a quiet yet strangely beautiful string piece that maybe best played during a dark night with candle light. Trisagion is bold with strong overtones like the Prophet Elias of the old testament, revealing God from the mountain tops. A church was named after the Prophet & Arvo Part wrote a dedication to celebrate its 500th Anniversary. Maybe not the CD to start listening to Arvo Part due to its strong religious overtones, "Tabula Rasa" would be a better start, yet the religious overtones are good for any spiritual journey.
