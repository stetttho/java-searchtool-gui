 Have you ever thought if you could write a simple piano piece that would always move you, what would it sound like? Look no further. The music from the film "Mansfield Park" is haunting beautiful, yet so simple, if you could see the notes of the score, even a beginner could play it & impress everyone. At times this simple core moves on to classic heights yet never loses its innocence. There is also the water glass harmonic section which is rather unique. Another highlight is the "lost in a dream while the Uncle reveals all your defects" section which drones you with its penning doom. The last song "Djonga (Slavery)" reveals the freedom which most of the characters finally attain. Try this CD if your a Movie Theme collector or into Classic Minimalism.
