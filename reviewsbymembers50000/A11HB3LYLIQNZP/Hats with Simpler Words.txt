 After a few years of listening to Blue Nile's first CD "Walk Across the Rooftops", it was a great joy to find this `hard-to-get' second CD. This time around the words are simpler & very repetitive in topic. Looking at the song listings the words `Lights', `Tonight', `Headlights', `Night', & again `Night' give a clue about the poetry. Therefore I was at first disappointed & thought that Paul Buchanan, the main singer & song writer, already ran out of ideas after a few years from his first stroke of genius. Yet when I told myself "Okay I will listen to the CD again" certain calmness & a sense of `traveling through life in the big city' came across which makes this CD a must when driving on the freeway at night. Reading some of the other reviews about the beauty of uniformity with this CD over Blue Nile's first CD, creates several thesis/antithesis issues for me. Thesis: "Walk Across the Rooftops" is the better CD because it has better words, poetry, & musical experiments while it holds no common topic. Antithesis: "Hats" though it lacks in strength on the poetry-musical end, holds together explaining a single topic. Thesis: "Hats" sounds great when played with a single song, but because of the lack of poetry the total CD can sound `put together'. Antithesis: Because "Hats" does have a single topic, if you are in a certain mood, this can `hit home'. Sorry, no Hegelian Synthesis is allowed.
