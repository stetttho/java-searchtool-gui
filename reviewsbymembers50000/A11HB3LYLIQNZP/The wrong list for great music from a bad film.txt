 I rented the DVD of the film "At First Sight" a few years ago. Great idea, but the movie had a slow plot & shallow characters. The music is another issue, Mark Islam writes fantastic music, this is one of his highlights. The mood is rather equal throughout; sad but hopeful. I read in other review that Diane Krall sang in the movie, but the singer Gigi Worth in the CD does a great job, rather lower in pitch, an alto. The main theme repeats like in classical music, meaning that it changes a little each time. The theme is not boring as in some movie soundtracks where the same theme never develops. The last section has some jazz standards from Louis Armstrong, George Shearing, & Ella Fitzgerald. These are recorded very well & add a classic touch to the ending. This is one of those CD's that you can play over & over again. Check out Mark Islam other movie soundtracks.
