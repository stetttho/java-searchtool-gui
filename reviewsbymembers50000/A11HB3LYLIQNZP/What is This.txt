 Is this CD jazz, rock, sound effects, or experimental music? No, its Bobby Previte, a jazz drummer who created several inconsistent CD's through the years, with the high lights being "Claude's Late Morning" & "Empty Suits". The CD Starts out with "Look Both Ways" an almost Oriental Pat Metheny like jazz-rock combo with great percussion to the haunting multi layered "One Bowl" to the almost comical "Sometimes You Need An Airport", this is a great CD for any modern jazz or percussion lover. If you like this CD, try "Empty Suits" which is more universal & mysterious. Be careful with CD's like "Music of the Moscow Circus" & "Hue & Cry", they are not up to par, lacking the intensity of "Claude's Late Morning" & "Empty Suits".
