 this newest release from Iona is more progressive with less singing & more instrumentals. Iona normally writes, or should I write "Uses" lyrics of the ancient Celtic Christian past, not the typical modern mediocre of Christian "Pop" which I never listen to. There are references to Christ, but more allegorical or universal (Catholic/Eastern Orthodox Mysticism). After studying the lyrics about silent prayer & darkness into light, Iona seems to reflect the philosophy of either "The Cloud of the Unknowing" or maybe "St. John of the Cross". Iona's music is more of a focus on certain Celtic Christian saints (this CD has some songs about St. Colombo) & their love of God, harmony of nature, & life.
