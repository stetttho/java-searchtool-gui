 Most of Karl Jaspers better books are out of print or are very hard to get. This is one of them, I had the book custom made from a computer print out & then hard bound. Written between World War One & World War Two, in 1933, I am surprised on how well Karl Jaspers understands humanity trapped within modern technology with its so-called promises yet in the end traps. The book explains the origin of modern techonolgy & how it developed into the present state of existence that humanity now finds itself. The middle secion deals with the Limits of the Life Order (Humanity as a Mass), the Will in the Whole (the State & Education), & the Decay & Possibilities of the Mind (Culture & Mental Creation: Art, Science, & Philosophy) and then the book ends with our Present existence in the fields of Sociology, Psychology, & Anthropology, & what humanity can become. A great find & here it is in Amazon.com as a special order.
