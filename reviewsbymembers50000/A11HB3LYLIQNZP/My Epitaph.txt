 This is one of the earliest Bruce Cockburn CD's, if not the 1st or 2nd release. How can one explain Bruce Cockburn? A Canadian Folk-Rock singer/guitarist with some jazz influence...No, that's not quite right...A Multi-Facet Singer Song Writer with Christian/Political overtones...No, that's not quite right. One thing is for sure; Bruce Cockburn writes songs that make you think, & listen over & over again, & each time the allegory changes meaning. I want the song "Love Song" to be my Epitaph: Though my eyes be close forever still I would find you...it explains the whole meaning of life: to find God even in death.
