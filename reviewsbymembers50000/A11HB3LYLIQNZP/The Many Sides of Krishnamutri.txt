 Having read some written conversations of Krishnamurti's (On God, On Truth, & Awaking of Intelligence) & trying to find a book that he wrote (there are a few early ones, but Krishnamurti in his later life did not believe in books), this well written but questionable biography helped fill in the historical gaps. The book starts with his Theosophical Society upbringing under Besant & Leadbeater when Madam Blavatsky had already pass away, but basic historial details of the Society are mention. I am not sure if the author was fair to each of the leaders or just over described, or focused too much on the historical "Dirt", specially on Leadbeater. Sometimes the book jumped back & forth in time, & I had to reread to sort out the chronological order. Also Krishnamurti's affair with Rosalind Williams Rajagopal, was the information from Rosalind daughter's book or was it independently researched? In the end the book revealed many things about Krishnamurti that his written conversations did not reveal. For example: before I read this biography, I looked at Krishnamurti as a forced messiah turned nihilist philosopher teaching practical mysticism, but in the end I see a man still under certain influences (entities or Kundalini) while claiming to be free (another paradox). The book was very enjoyable, but read it with an open mind & do what Krishnamutri would do: question it & find out for yourself.
