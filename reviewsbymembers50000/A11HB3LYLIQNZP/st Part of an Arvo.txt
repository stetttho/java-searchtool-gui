 This was my 1st Arvo Part experience, who is an Eastern Orthodox Christian composer from Estonia. Starting out as a Serialist, he developed his own brand of Classical Minimalism with references to Christian Mysticism with a profound loneness & Awe. The main high-light is the last piece "Tabula Rasa" (Empty Slate) set to a prepared piano, which was 1st experimented by John Cage during the 1940's, only this prepared piano sounds more like a harp. In the last section of this piece, the prepared piano sets the main pitch, then the violins add a note up & then down, then add 2 notes up & then down, then 3...adding layers & layers with one of the saddest yet beautiful melodies ever heard. When it was 1st played the musicians wondered how something so simple & empty could sound so profound? One problem is that last piece was recorded during a radio broadcast, therefore background noises can be heard from time to time (coughing, moving feet, etc...). This doesn't take away from the whole CD which is wonderful recorded via the studio. If you want to question your existence; sit down in a dark room with a good glass of wine & give this CD a listen.
