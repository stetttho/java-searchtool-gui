 Why isn't Geri Allen (born 1957) more famous? She has several CD's & has played with a lot of famous Jazz musicians: Steve Coleman, Charlie Haden, Paul Motian, & Cassandra Wilson to name a few. Is she too off the top like Cecile Taylor? No, she's not that weird, but at times her type of Jazz can be rather abstract, repetitive, or strong on the keys. One musical reviewer terms her as a Post-Bop, which I disagree. What really makes her music interesting & especially this CD is her multi styles that fade in & out of mainstream melodies. Another factor is this CD was done with great production that can reveal your stereo system's potential or use it as a test CD when purchasing new equipment. Give the 'Listen to Samples' a spin & see if it suits your fancy.
