 "What are you playing?" she asked. "It's driving me insane" as we drove down Ocean Blvd in my 1969 convertible Mustang. "It's Margaret Lang Tan playing Somei Satoh" I replied as I hit the eject button on the CD player saving the music for myself later on...Do you want to hear something different? Profound? Cosmic? er...Zen? This is the CD for you but be careful who you play it with. Somei Satoh has several hard to find CD's all in a modern multi-cultural (East meets West) minimal Classical music with tape loops & sound effects. Highlights are: "The Heavenly Spheres Are Illuminated By Lights" sounds like the western theory of Universal Big Bang meets Zen Buddhism with prepared piano in tape loops birthing the human voice. "Birds In Warped Time II" again with prepared piano in tape loops setting free Jonathan Living Seagull expressed as a violin. If you like this CD, check out other Margaret Lang Tan or Somei Satoh CD's.
