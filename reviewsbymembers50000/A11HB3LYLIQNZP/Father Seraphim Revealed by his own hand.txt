 I read this book while visiting the relics of St John Maximovitch of San Francisco, who was the Spiritual Father of Father Seraphim Rose. I wanted to know the Rebel Beatnik turned Eastern Orthodox Hieromonk (a monk who is also an ordained Priest) by his own words when he was writing a 12 year correspondence to his spiritual son Alexey Young.   The book starts in the mid 1960's with the personal remembering of Alexey Young when he was interested in Russian Orthodoxy. It was then that he met Eugene Rose, a layman working at an Orthodox bookstore, who later became Father Seraphim Rose.  Each chapter after that is each years writings, starting with the year 1970, from Father Seraphim Rose to Alexey Young. Before or after each letter is some background information from Alexey Young to help fill in why Father Seraphim Rose was writing about some issues.  We can see the development of Father Seraphim Rose thought the years becoming less overbearing to more Christ-like helping Alexey Young to first becoming a missionary in Oregon to later Priest.  Issues about Church history, the Soviet takeover of Russian Orthodoxy, problems with the Ultra-Orthodox, spiritual growth & personal discernment, as well as many other topics are expressed in Father Seraphim Rose's own hand.  If you have read "Father Seraphim Rose, His Life & Works", this book will give a more personal reflection to fill in the blanks.
