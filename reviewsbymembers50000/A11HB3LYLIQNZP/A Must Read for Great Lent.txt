 Dr. Thomas Hopko, the dean of St. Vladimir's Seminary, professor of dogmatic theology, & author of many books about the Christian Orthodox faith & practice, writes a must read for Great Lent.  These days very few people in America practice or understand Great Lent. Most see it as a time of hardship, unnecessary discipline, old fashion, from the old world, or many other negative views. Another semi-unknown factor are the different pratices of the Western Church (Roman Catholic or some early Protestant) from the Eastern Orthodox Church.  Dr. Thomas Hopko does an excellent job in clarifying what Great Lent is all about for the Eastern Orthodox Church. That this season is a time of spiritual joy to act out the life, death, & resurrection of Jesus Christ. Throughout the book, Dr. Thomas Hopko uses the church's historical tradition from Biblical, Liturgical, & Patristic writings with modern teachings to give a well rounded guide to uplift & strength ones spiritual vision.  The book is designed with 40 short chapters to match the Lenten period to help the reader to meditate on a chapter a day. I don't know of any other book that is as well thought out with this in mind. Take the 40 day path to your own resurrection with the wisdom of the Ancient Christian Church by reading this book.
