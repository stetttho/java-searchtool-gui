 Starting out with progressive rock during the 1970's, Classical music during the 1980's, Jazz during the 1990's, & World/Folk during the 2000's, I feel that I have come full circle finding the group Iona. They are not your typical mediocre Christian rock band; but a fusion of "Yes" progressive rock with a cleaner more tighter "Happy-The-Man" playing ability. Mix in some fast Irish gigs of "Silly Wizard" with the Soul & Jazziness of "Van Morrison", & sung by the main female singer Joanne Hogg with haunting spiritual (Christian Mysticism) lyrics about the ancient Celtic saints (St. Patrick, St. Brandon, etc...) before the 1054 AD spilt of the Roman Catholic & Eastern Orthodox churches. This CD is Iona's own personal production with their first 3 CD's: Iona (remixed), Beyond These Shores, & The Book of Kells (the Gospels written by Celtic Monks), with extra material that was never released: Dunes. Comes with a great inbound 60 page book with photos & the history of the band. A must for any spiritual journey.
