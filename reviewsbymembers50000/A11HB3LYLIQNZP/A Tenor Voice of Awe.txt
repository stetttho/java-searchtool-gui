 Peter Pears has the most interesting singing voice: almost counter-tenor, pure, but scary. These songs written by his companion Benjamin Britten fit Peter's voice perfectly. The highlight of this CD is "Serenade, for tenor, horn, & strings, Op. 31" which are from famous English poems, some from Shakespeare. The style of the music is almost operatic, or acting out, meaning: the words are expressed with extreme emotion to fit each word or sentence. "Les illuminations, song cycle for high voice & strings, Op. 18" are songs written for French poems that are very interesting but miss the clarity or unity of the 1st set of songs. Maybe its because I am so used to hearing Peter Pears sing English & love the emotional expressions of the words, while only knowing the basics of French, the meaning is lost. The expressions are still there, but lack the universality. In other words; I listen to a lot of non-English singing, some singers can sing any language & still cause the communication of an emotion to come across, while with these set of poems, it's not there. "Nocturne, for tenor, 7 instruments & strings, Op. 60" is my 2nd favorite section specially the last song "When Most I Wink, Then Do Mine Eyes Best See" which comes to the pare of the 1st section because of the hauntingness of Peter's voice. This is a historical recording not to be missed.
