 It has been a while since I drank a Sangria, though I did buy all the ingredients: Spanish Red Wine, Brandy, Club Soda, Fruits...& I have the music for it: "Zorro & Romantic Guitars". This CD will add a little romance to your life with well played if not overly familiar Classic Spanish guitar music, everything from Ravel's Bolero to "Cielito Lindo". Put this in your CD player, adjust the sound, sit down with the love of your life, pour the wine, & give her a kiss. Or better written: If your like me & are tired of hearing Mex-Tex all day long from your co-workers radios, but still love Spanish music, this CD will be as refreshing as a good Sangria. Drink Up!!!
