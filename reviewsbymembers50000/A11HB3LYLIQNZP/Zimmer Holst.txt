 When I first bought this CD I thought I heard a cheap copy of Holst's "Mars, the Bringer of War" with a little Charles Ives & Mahler added in. Why not use the real Holst theme? Did it not fit certain scenes or was the timing off? The composer Hans Zimmer must be trying to capture the essence or ideal of using the style of these musical themes rather than giving us a classical recording of them. Therefore the classical section is the weakness of this CD, but the haunting beautiful universal language of Lisa Gerrand with the mysterious dudak playing of Dijivan Gasparryan is its strength. Both of these fine artists capture the tragedy of this life & the freedom of death. To reunite humanity in harmony with the one's you love most. The last song "Now We Are Free" explains it all.
