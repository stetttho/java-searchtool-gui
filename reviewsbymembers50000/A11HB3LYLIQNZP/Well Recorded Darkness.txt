 This CD is so well recorded that I had to buy an entire new stereo just to hear the hidden details. Multi-layered pure jazz ballads cleaned up or expressed in a different light than Tom Watt's originals, this is a great CD. Holy Cole sings more smokey than ever, acting out rather than plain singing the songs. The main highlight is the bass player, who taps & spins his bass almost like a drum. Added playing adds extra findings. This is Holy Cole's pinnacle of jazz after this CD she "Pop"s down to mere rock star.
