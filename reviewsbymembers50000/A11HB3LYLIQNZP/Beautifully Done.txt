 Nicodemos was born with the name of Nicholas Kallivourtsis on the Aegean island of Naxos in the year 1749. He studied at the `Gospel School' on the island of Smyrna where he majored in Greek, Italian, & French. Later the Turks invaded the Island & Nicholas returned to Naxos to become a secretary to the Metropolitan of Paros & Naxos. In 1775 he left the world behind to become a monk on the Mount Athos where he changed his name to Nicodemos. He wrote many writings, his most famous were his help in the editions of the "Philokalia" (a collection of early Patristics) & "The Rudder" (a commentary of Eastern Orthodox Cannons). This book "Nicodemos of the Holy Mountain" is his own personal reflections on acquiring the divine virtues. Nichdemos died in 1809. Paulist Press does another fine job with its series `The Classics of Western Spirituality'. Makes a great gift for your Priest or Spiritual pastor.
