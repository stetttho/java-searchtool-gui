 Finding out about Steve Tyrell through watching the DVD "Father of the Bride" staring Steve Martin, both me & my wife fell in love with his singing. Right away we ordered his CD's "Standard Time" & "A New Standard" from Amazon.com. Both are fun to listen to & with great production showing off Steve's unique singing voice & style (though you can say he is a little bit of this & a little bit of that. I saw comparisons of Tony Bennet, Dr. John, & Tom Watts???). During this Christmas season (2003) we were looking for Christmas standards & therefore bought this CD. This time around Steve Tyrell's normal great production gets in the way; the background music sometimes over takes his singing, or sometimes the jazz loses the main melody. Another problem is that the songs are on the more Commercial side of Christmas missing the "Real Meaning" behind Christmas. I believe only one song deals with the birth of Jesus (though Jesus may of been born around October & December 25 is right after the solstice "the rebirth of light"). The rest of the songs are about Santa Claus or the season in general. Overall the CD is great for a party, background music, or when you want that something different.
