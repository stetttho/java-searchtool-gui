 I just love the Celtic Christian Progressive...er Jazz Rock...er...Irish/Scottish Folk band "Iona". What a mixed bag of great music that there is no way to explain it. Time to branch off & see what else they have to offer. Dave Bainbridge is one of the original members of Iona creating the band's unique blend of music with his fast & very talented guitar playing. In this CD "When Worlds Collide", he joins forces with Troy Donockley, an Irish Folk Rock musician.  Half of the CD is played live at 2 places: "The Studio" in Hartlepool on Nov. 28, 2003 & at Pocklington Arts Centre on Feb. 6, 2004. The remainder of the CD is recorded at Iona's own studio "Open Sky Studio".   Some of the songs are Irish folk classics such as "The Great Silkie of Sules Skerry" & "Merrily Kiss the Quaker", others are from Iona as in "Edge of the World" & "Bi-Se I Mo Shuil", & the remainder are either written from Troy Donockley or Dave Bainbridge that at times intermix different styles with the above.   Therefore sometimes your listening to a live Irish jig with Uilleann Pipes, whistles, bouzoukis, & guitars. Then comes an abstract modern classical piano piece, then a guitar solo...what a mixed bag. This gives a mixed impression: Should one listen to one song at a time & enjoy the obvious talent, & ignore that this certainly not a concept or a holistic CD? A "5" for talent but I give a "4" for the odd mix.
