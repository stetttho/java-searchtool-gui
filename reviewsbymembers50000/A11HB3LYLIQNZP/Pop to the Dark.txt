 After winning me over with her 1st CD "Carmine Meo" of Italian standards with a rock beat, this lastest CD enters into the dark with demonic songs about losing ones will. Gone is the beauty of romance from "Carmine Meo" to become its complete antithesis of the dangers of romance. Gone is the uniqueness of her singing voice & style to become another gothic pop star. Don't buy this CD because you like "Carmine Meo", unless your into antitheses.
