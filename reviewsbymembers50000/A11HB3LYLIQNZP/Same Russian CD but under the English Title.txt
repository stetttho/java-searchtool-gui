 Amazon.com also has this CD under the Russian title: Istoria Etogo Mir [IMPORT]. Notice that the "A" at the end is missing.   My wife is Russian & she told me about KNHO (thats how it looks in Russian, or Kino/Kyno pronounce in English). The CD looks in English letters but is not spelled as "Nctopht Etoro Mnpa", therefore Amazon.com spelled it as "Istoria Etogo Mira" in this English title section & "Istoria Etogo Mir" in the Russian import title section. Either way the translation in English is "History of This World". This is a great rock-n-roll CD that you can listen to over & over again. The music is sung in Russian, but is very universal in its appeal. The emotions expressed can be felt rather than understood. I think Kino sounds somewhat like "The Call" but was more versatile with eastern European influences. Kino's main singer was Victor Tsoi who died in an auto accident in 1990 while branching off to become a Russian movie star. As a singer/songwriter Victor Tsoi wrote & sang about the problems of Soviet Communism & its negative effect on loss of spirituality or the knowledge of God. Victor Tsoi ran into some political problems with the Soviet government & my wife thought he was killed by the KGB but I have yet to find some news article to verify this. A very hard to get CD but well worth the find.
