 Martin Heidegger concept of Dasein (Human or Being There) in relation to BEING & TIME changed my philosophical course. This is Heidegger's Opus written in 1928 should be read after "Intro to Metaphysics" or some of his other smaller easier writings. The book has many great questions & thoughts about how BEING Human is trapped within BEING (Space, Existence) & TIME, but the book gets bogged down with Heidegger's own personal language. In other words; BEING & TIME is as hard to read as the philosophers Hegel or Kant. In the end you may find the need to leave behind any form of Idealism & the many traps of western Philosophical history, or better written: "to become Authentic" & discover your own means or method of thinking.
