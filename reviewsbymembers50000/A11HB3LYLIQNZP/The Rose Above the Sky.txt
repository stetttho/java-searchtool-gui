 In another review, an author states that this is one of his favorite Bruce Cockburn CD's. I 2nd that including the 1975 CD "In the Falling Dark". I have all of Bruce Cockburns CD's as well as LPs versions. I am missing only a couple "Best Of" & some "Christmas" CD I saw out in the market about 10 years ago. "Humans" is the beginning of a new chapter in the ever changing, multi facet "Canadian Christian Mystic gone Left-Wing Political Protest, Folk/Jazz/Rock, Singer/Songwriter-Guitarist". This CD requires several listens before a general understanding takes hold & will grow for years of enjoyment. The Best is "The Rose Above the Sky" which plays a language game between spiritual growth & the 2nd coming of Christ. It holds such mystery & depth with double or triple meanings. A must for any Bruce Cockburn fan, but for more a folk feel try a few years before, for a more hard rock feel try a few years later.
