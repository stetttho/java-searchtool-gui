 During the 1950's & 1960's, Burl Ives was remembered for his unique sounding American folk music. Today most remember him for his Christmas music from the TV special "Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer". The most famous songs from that series plus a few from the 1950's are in this collection. The production does sound its age, the separation & highs are off, or to write it this way: it sounds thin compared to modern recordings. I collect many records from many periods & most are better upgraded than this CD. Most songs are done rather straight forward, with few instruments & back up singers, which may sound a little corny for some, yet revealing a time of innocence & fun. Try out the Listen to Samples & see if you remember any of the songs & then sing along with your family. The most remembered are: Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer, Silver Bells, & A Holly Jolly Christmas.
