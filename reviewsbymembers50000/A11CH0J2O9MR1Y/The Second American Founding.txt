 Perhaps the most interesting thing about Jaffa is that he wrote Goldwater's famous "moderation in the defense of freedom is no virtue" speech. If you go back and read the speech (and it is on the  web, of course), it echoes both the Old Testament ("our fathers")  and Lincoln. I suspect he would agree with the man who told me that Lincoln  is the greatest prose stylish in the English language. As for the book,  Jaffa interprets the civil war as the second, and genuine, founding of the  American republic, and precisely because the principle of the Declaration,  equality, was written not in ink but blood (Jaffa has his own brand of  Lincolnian Christianity). Lincoln, by this reading, belongs to the  "tribe of the eagle and the lion" and was neither Caesar nor  Brutus but possessed the best qualities of both. To understand that part of  Jaffa's interpretation, you would have to read his treatment of  Shakespeare. As for the Lincoln-Douglas debates, Jaffa stages Douglas as  Thrasymachus and Lincoln--surprise, surprise--as Socrates.
