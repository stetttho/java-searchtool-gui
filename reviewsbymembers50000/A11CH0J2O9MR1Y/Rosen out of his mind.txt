 Rosen says at one point that he set out to fill the gaping hole in Strauss's platonism, the entire absence of an ontology, or as Rosen calls, a technical philosophical doctrine. If for Strauss the ideas are  "fantastic, not to say incredible," Rosen rejoins: and nothing  you say changes that. Rosen is thus determined recover a true Plato, the  philosophical plato, and with the help of Heidegger's Wiederholung of the  gigantomachia, but explicitly against Heidegger. The project is thus to  save Strauss from Heidegger by using Heidegger against himself to fill in  the esoteric but hollow core of Straussian platonism. Capisce? That is the  project of Nihilism, and Rosen never shys away from confronting Heidegger  head-on. Yet Rosen, to his detriment, never learned one important lesson  from Strauss: the depths are contained in the surface, and only in the  surface, of things. For Strauss that meant, to my mind, that philosophy is  always political because it can never be technical. Rosen's 'ordinary  language metaphysics' is sensible enough, but Rosen himself (despite what  he says) is deeply impatient with politics (and philosophy) precisely  because he fails to see that politics is the surface that contains the  depths.
