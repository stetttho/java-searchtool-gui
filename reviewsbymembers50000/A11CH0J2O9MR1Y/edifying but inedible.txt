 One reviewer described this book as "reductionary humanism." I think that is a fitting description. The problem is that Kass ignores Freud and Levi-Strauss, for instance, despite the fact that both, it could be  argued, thought about nothing but eating. "Identification" and  the "death drive" are, after all, the psychological analogs of  swallowing and defecating. Levi-Strauss devoted thousands of pages to the  table manners and the rest, but Kass doesn't bother to cite him once.  And  if he really wanted to treat the hunger in the soul, what about the eating  disorder's, bulimia and anorexia and the rest. Kass takes a little too  seriously Leo Strauss's injunction that is better to understand the low in  terms of the high--he also liked to quote Hegel to the effect that  philosophy should not be edifying.
