 There are still traces of Kojeve in the Lacan's first seminar, and Kojeve mixed with sociobiology (pigeons and the imaginary) and the ego and the id. The imaginary will at this point play a larger role than it will later, as  will the ego (formed out of the imaginary and the mirror stage), but at the  same time the origin of negativity and aggression, located in an alienating  picture of ourselves. But is not negativity ultimately located in language  (and even more specifically, in the word "not"), the word  "elephant" that is more deadly to the the elephants than any  machete? The word as the murder of the thing? It is curious that Lacan and  Kojeve once planned to write a book on Freud, and Kojeve and Strauss  planned a book on Hobbes and Hegel. The intersection is the state of  nature, the humble theoretical origin of Kojeve's desire of another's  desire.
