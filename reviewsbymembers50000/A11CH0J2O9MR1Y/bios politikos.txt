 Most of the most contentious contemporary issues, like abortion, euthanasia and healthcare, welfare, tobacco, and suchlike, concern the problem of life. The argument can be made, and Arendt makes it, that the  modern state, in its care for life, has moved from the power over death  (capital punishment) to the power over life. It is Arendt's purpose to show  that modern politics, in its absorption the public by the private, turns  politics into economics (the household), where formerly the care of  "life" was located. In a world in which there is neither the  immortality of the state nor the individual, bare life becomes the highest  value. (Strauss makes the argument that a politics that begins in the state  of nature leads directly to "humanitarianism," to a politics  devoted to eliminating suffering, and the argument is the same.) A politics  devoted to life leaves no "space" (a decidedly unGreek word, used  again and again by Arendt and every hip business exec today) for politics,  for the play of concealment and disclosure, darkness and light, bright  shining words and the privacy and darkness of pain, defecation, eating,  love, etc. It is Heidegger put to good use, and Arendt reminds us that the  elimination of the politics, or its suppression, is inseparable from a  Seinsvergessenheit, but the real life-and-death issue is better grasped by  Schmitt and Strauss, who do not fall into the trap of aestheticizing  politics.
