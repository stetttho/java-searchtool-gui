 Benardete is an enormous brain, and classicists ignore him at their own peril. As for the Phaedrus, only the philosophers are guaranteed to come back in the next life in human form. Not nous and human form (Odysseus' men  are turned into pigs, but keep their minds), but Logos and the human face.  Nous and metis: nous is anonymous, it can be anyone (Odysseus' words to the  Cyclops). The famous division of the Phaedrus in two contains a problem:  how to put them together, how to put Socrates' unique self-knowledge in  writing, which is anonymous and can be read by anyone. Hence the solution  of Platonic writing, which says different things to different people. The  supposed Socratic (Platonic) criticism of writing is a canard: Socrates  puts the criticism of writing in the mouth of Theuth, a god! Socrates may  speak for Plato, but surely he does not speak for an Egyptian god. The  written law, by replacing the "unwritten law" (Antigone), is a  necessary prelude to philosophy. The anonymity of the written word, by  separating speech and thought, can save human beings from being turned into  ciccadas, like the singing men who, neglecting food and drink, forgot  themselves. That is, in part, Benardete's argument, and it is convincing.
