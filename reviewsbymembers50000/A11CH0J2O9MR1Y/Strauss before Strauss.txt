 I read somewhere that Strauss carried this book in a water-tight container when he crossed the channel to England so that, even if the ship went down, his work would survive. However that may be, it is the rare opportunity to  see Strauss genuinely struggle with a problem. The prevailing opinion, I am  told, is that Hobbes' science, or the discovery of Galileo's  analytic-synthetic method, was the origin of Hobbes political philosophy  (the analysis of the prevailing order (state of nature), the synthesis or  construction of a new order (Leviathan)). Strauss makes the convincing  argument that not the scientific method, but instead Aristotelian humanism  (in particular, the anthropology of the Rhetoric) was the  "source" for Hobbes' Staatslehre. Central to this is a critique  of aristocratism, and the aristocratic valorization of courage. Not courage  but cowardice and the fear of death is the ruling passion of the Hobbesian  bourgeois (if Bloom learned anything from Strauss, it was that). In  particular, Hobbes borrowed from the Rhetoric the treatment of anger, in  which the most asocial human passion is the desire for revenge (and  justice). Strauss later repudiated (in Natural Right) the argument against  Hobbes scientism, but the point was made.
