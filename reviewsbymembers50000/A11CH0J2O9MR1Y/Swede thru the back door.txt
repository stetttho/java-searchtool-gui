 The boring and obvious meaning of the title is that the modern conceptions of sovereignty--for instance, in the us constitution, where the sole individual is the executive and the collective of representatives is the  legislative-is the legacy or secularization (however that occurs) of  formerly religious. The simpler argument obscures a paradox: the sovereign  himself stands outside the legal order (Ordnung) that he creates. Hence:  the sovereign decides on the exception, ie, what stands outside the legal  order. The problem of repetition, and the state as machine (machina  machinarum) is solved by the heroic creation ex nihilo of the sovereign. In  Hegel's conception, the sovereign is a living, breathing human being (if  only as a figurehead) because there exists always the possibility of a life  and death struggle.
