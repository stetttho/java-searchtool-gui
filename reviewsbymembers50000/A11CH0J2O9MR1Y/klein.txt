 I am told that Klein liked to sit silently on his porch in Maryland in a white suit and sip mint juleps, as if the white Russian from Germany were some sort of Southern gentleman. That aside, there is no better guide to  the transformation of ancient to modern science than Jacob Klein. Klein  filled out many of Husserl's speculations, and Klein's essays (and Algebra  book) are a necessary supplement to Husserl's Crisis. To point out a small  gem: The ratios that constituted the harmonia mundi in, for instance,  Plato's Timaeus, were transformed by Copernicus and Galileo into the  equations of planetary movement. This is accomplished by a transformation  of the theory of proportions in Proclus' commentary on the first book of  Euclid. At bottom of the symbolic transformation is the conflation of  intentio prima and intentio secunda. And further: this is the problem at  the base of Kant's schematism, the problem of how "x" can be  "this x" and "any x" at the same time, according to  Klein. Considering that there is a straight line from this achievement in  symbolization and the computers that today run on symbolic logic, one could  more precisely specify, with the help of Klein, the precise mechanism of  Seinsvergessenheit that is the domination through symbolization of modern  science.
