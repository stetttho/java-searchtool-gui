 A lecture course that eventually became the famous Kantbuch, Heidegger demonstrates his remarkable capacity to think in complete sentences. The reading of Kant is decidedly Aristotlizing, with the priority of the  imagination (phantasia) over reason (nous) or sense (aisthesis), and the  priority of imagination cannot be separated from the priority of time, the  gift which is self giving (or in Kant, self-affection: masturbation). The  most clever thing that H does, and which he refrains from in the Kantbuch,  is to turn the categories (quantity, quality, modality, and something else)  into emanations of past, present, future. H reads modern philosophy as the  triumph of the imagination, and that is no clearer than in Kant, but for  Heidegger, the future possesses a priority, and the future is  "image-poor." The connection of imagination with manipulation  (and potentiality) leads some (like Sartre) to identify imagination with  negativity, but H wants no part of this "humanism." Imagination  and time may possess a priority that Kant "recoils" from, but H  demonstrates the reductio in Kant's argument not to valorize imagination  but ironically to resuscitate aisthesis, or the potentia passiva, the  ability or power to receive, to listen intently, or just to listen.
