 One of the clearer expositions of Heidegger's later thought is Das Ding, anthologized in this volume. You are free to read the other selections ("the essence of language is the language of essence" ad nauseum)  but das Ding begins with a phenomenological description of a Krug (a cup)  that became rarer as Heidegger got older. The emptiness in the cup is the  origin, like the hand that reaches out (from the past and the future) of  being and the world. The Krug which pours out its offering (Gift: poison  and present) from the emptiness of the Krug: the emptiness is the absent  center (the eccentric core) of being and world. The Krug offers its gift,  but not the krug, but its emptiness, and it is that gift which is the gift  of world.
