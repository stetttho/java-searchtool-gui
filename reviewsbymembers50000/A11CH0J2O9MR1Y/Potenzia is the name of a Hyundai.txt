 Potentialities, or more precisely, potentia passiva. Reception and capability go together: the hand is the gift that gives itself (handshake) and receives: catch! The chapter on Heidegger and Stimmung is for me the  most interesting. The word "facticity" is confusing because it  implies making (factum est verum), but is the very opposite of any making  (ie, thrownness). Agamben traces in the word the common root of both fetish  and faktish, and finds in the notion of Stimmung a weise, a face, or guise.  There too is a passivity, and the passivity of "affect" as both  reception and potential (the ability to receive: endexetai). Heidegger  would perhaps find there xeir-, or hand: VorHANDenheit and ZuHANDenheit).  Aisthesis as both an activity (-is) and a passivity (think of all the plays  on the word horen in S&Z). The introduction by the translator is  curious. As for the distinction of intentio prima and intentio secunda, it  is the very basis of modern science and Descartes' geometry: not this conic  section (intentio prima) but every conic section (intentio secunda taken as  intentio prima). That is the origin of Husserl's "sedimentation,"  and hence the return to the "things themselves." In sum, much can  be learned from this book.
