 Derrida, for all the supposed density of his writing, is a simplifier. Deconstruction owes much of its popularity (in America) to the fact that it says: philosophy is not all that complicated, just see how the inside and  outside collapse into one another and you can tear any text at its seams.  Derrida follows the same procedure with poor old Edmund: the entirety of  the LU shamble if Husserl is unable to maintain the integrity of silent  thought, in which no Anzeichen point toward anything. Unlike the canals on  Mars, which may point to intelligent life, silent thought is unmediated and  not supplemented (to use a Deriddaism) by a sign. The collapse (or rending)  of inside and outside by the supplement mark the presence of absence: the  word, a mere supplement to the presence of silent thought, separates and  joins the "life" and "presence" of consciousness with  absence, repetition, and death.
