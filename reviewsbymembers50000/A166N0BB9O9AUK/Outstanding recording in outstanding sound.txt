 This classic recording from 1972 is my favorite of the Rachmaninov 2nd symphony, better in my opinion than more recent ones by Mariss Jansons (EMI) and Mikhail Pletnev (DG).  Previn's Rachmaninov symphony cycle with the LSO was a landmark achievement, and the 2nd is the best of them.  It's a passionate, heart-on-sleeves performance of total commitment.  And what a slow movement!  I doubt the clarinet solo has ever sounded lovelier.  EMI's choices for "Great Recordings of the Century" have not been uniformly wise, but this one is right-on.  This (third) digital remastering has restored the gloriously warm and rich sound of the original; in terms of sound quality the Previn is fully competitive with Jansons and Pletnev, and the performance beats them both.  At mid-price, don't hesitate.
