 The Nocturnes are some of the greatest works of Chopin's output. There is always a tension, a passion under the surface dreaminess. Pires captures all the complex elements of the Nocturnes very well, at least as well as Ashkenazy and Rubinstein do in their recordings, and the sound is considerably better than either of the other two (particularly the Rubinstein, which suffers from a somewhat veiled recording with some distracting tape hiss). Buy it!
