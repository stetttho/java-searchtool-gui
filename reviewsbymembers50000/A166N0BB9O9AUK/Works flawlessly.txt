 My experience with the router has been excellent.  The wireless AP works very well and has never dropped the connection - in this regard this router has been better than Netgear and D-Link routers I've used in the past.  Of course the reason to get this router is the Vonage broadband phone service, and I can say that - as long as I have a good Internet connection - the Vonage service works great with this router, with excellent voice quality and no significant delay.  Sometimes voice quality drops because of the Internet connection or the Vonage service, but that's not the hardware's fault.  This router is capable of voice quality every bit as good as a landline, and far better than a cell phone.
