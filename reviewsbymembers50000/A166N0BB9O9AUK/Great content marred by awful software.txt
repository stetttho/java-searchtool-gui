 It's too bad that the interface is so clunky (other reviewers have already pointed out the problems, so I won't bother here).  This is at least the sixth edition of Britannica on CD/DVD, and there's no excuse for such poor software.  A shame, really, because the text is far better than anything else out there.  I'd like to see them work with Microsoft and develop an interface similar to Encarta's.  They could call it Encarta Pro, with the same interface as Encarta but with the authoritative text of Britannica.  If only.
