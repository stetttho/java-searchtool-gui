 I had an experience similar to the reviewer below, "redlinerx."  My system is running Windows XP with Service Pack 1, very clean and always stable, until I installed this thing.  The drivers are not certified by Microsoft (many wireless adapters are not, I've noticed).  Anytime I had this thing installed my system would blue-screen frequently, which has otherwise never happened with my computer.  On top of that, signal quality and connection speed were poor.  When I bought a Microsoft USB wireless adapter and used it in the same location, the connection improved a lot, and the drivers don't hose my system.  In short, I'd advise those looking for a USB adapter to get the Microsoft one, although it's not cheap.
