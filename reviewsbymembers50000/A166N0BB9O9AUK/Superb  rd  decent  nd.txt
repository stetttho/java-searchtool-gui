 The Rachmaninov Third (and everybody, please stop refering to it as the "Rach 3" or, worse yet, the "Rocky 3"!) on this CD is one of the very best; Janis was Horowitz's student, and this performance has both poetry and virtuoso fireworks. The recording quality itself is astonishing: the piano tone is excellent, and the orchestral sound is glorious. Unfortunately, the 2nd concerto is rather disappointing: it seems a bit too efficient, somewhat distant; the sound also lacks the bloom and richness of the recording of the 3rd. In any case, buy this recording for the Third!
