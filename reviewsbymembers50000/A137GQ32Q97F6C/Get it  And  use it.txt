 I have used this video for over a year.  I'm involved in sports, especially martial arts.  Before using the video, I was usually sore and injured muscles regularly.  Using this video keeps my body in great shape  and I no longer get sore or injured (as much).  Jean Goulet (I have other  tapes of hers too) obviously really cares about the viewer doing the  exercises correctly.  She explains everything just as your physical  therapist would.  In many tapes, the teacher just does the exercises and  you follow as best as you can even though you don't really know what you're  doing.  In this video, you really learn how to do the exercises properly -  and there are a lot of exercises shown.  This video will really get you  into shape and keep you there.  This video has really made a difference in  my life and greatly improved my sports abilities - flexibility, stamina,  strength etc. (And I finally got great muscle definition).  P.S.  The  exercises range from simple to really! challanging.  You can go at your own  level.
