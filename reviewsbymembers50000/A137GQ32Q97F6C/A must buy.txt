 This is a great idea for a video.  20 T'ai-chi teachers got together and demonstrated their forms, push hands, sword play, self defense applications and even a lion dance.  The video begins with an introduction to T'ai-chi  explaining what it is and the differences between the various exercises, as  well as self defense principles.  Then you see the teachers giving their  demonstrations.  As an example, for the Yang form, several teachers give  about a minute each of their form and each is blended into the next, so it  seems like a seamless form.  Yet you can see the variations in approach of  each teacher.  This is also true for the push hands, some more flowing,  some more aggressive.  A voice over explains what you are seeing and each  teacher's name appears as he or she is shown.  It is a fascinating video to  watch as the teachers are many of the most well known in the T'ai-chi  field.  It was taped at Jou Tsung-Hwa's T'ai-chi Farm in New York State.   (The farm is now gone, unfortunately, so this video is a sort of  collector's item).
