 I heard about Thai Kickboxing and just wanted to see what it was all about.  I had other tapes of Robert Lyons so I felt confident it would be a good tape. I have to say that this tape gave me a lot of new ideas and a  whole new approach to my sparring.  This is not one of those aerobic  exercise tapes like Tae Bo.  It is a real training tape in this style.   Lyons uses elbows and knees and everything else.  He has a way of  explaining the body mechanics so you can really put the techniques to use.   I like this style and I like Lyons energy and enthusiasm.  You could use  these techniques alongwith any style to make your style more complete.
