 This a great all around series of exercises for seniors.  My video was great quality and was presented in a way that was simple to understand and follow.  Mr. Klein explains each exercise with a "relaxed  patience".  You can fill your week by doing a few of the exercises  each day.  I think it's great for non-seniors like me, too, but I got the  tape for my mother and she loves it.
