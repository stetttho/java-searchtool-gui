 This was a lot more than I expected.  The teacher really goes into detail and explains how to use the other person's force against them.  There are so many techniques shown and basic principles taught.  Each one is gone  over & over again with the students until they "get it" - and  you can see how the principles work when applied correctly.  Mr. Klein  teaches well and there's a lot to learn here.  It is, indeed, practical.
