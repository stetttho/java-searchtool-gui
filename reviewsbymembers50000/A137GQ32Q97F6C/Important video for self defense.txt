 Robert Lyons demonstrates using pressure points with another guy.  You can see clearly where each point is and how to strike it and also how to combine that with your regular punching and kicking.  This tape covers this  subject well.  You do need a partner for this.  Lyons knows his stuff.  The  video is good quality too.  I hadn't been trained in pressure point  fighting before so I found this information new and very helpful.
