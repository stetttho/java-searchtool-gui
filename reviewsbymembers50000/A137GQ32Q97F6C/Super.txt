 This is a challenging workout.  This tape (together with Jean Goulet's Exercise Ball Workout), gave me a body I'm proud of.  After about four months, I got enough ab strength so I could go through the whole workout  comfortably (practicing 4 times a week).  Now I really enjoy it and miss it  if I don't do it regularly.  It's funny how you get to enjoy working out  when at first, its a struggle.  This video is enjoyable, especially the  beautiful scenery.  Also, Jean gives you exercises to warm up and loosen up  to prepare your body and to cool down afterwards.  I never thought doing  abdominal workouts could be enjoyable, but this one is.
