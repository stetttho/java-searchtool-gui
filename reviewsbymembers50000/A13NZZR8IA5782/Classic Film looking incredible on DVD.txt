 There is a tendency to believe that DVDs benefit mostly newer, action oriented films like Aliens or the Matrix.  Older films tend to get the short shrift when it comes to DVD's.  People who own Criterion Collection  films know better!   This DVD has substantial extras that will keep you  viewing over and over again.  The Bogdonavich interview, the restoration  footage, the voice overs, the photos, and the radio readings are just some  of the fascinating highlights of this loaded disc.  The actual film is  gorgeous, with the black and white film appearing to be made especially for  DVD.  The Shadows cast in the final sewer chase are just breathtaking.   I've always loved this film with its amazing views of Vienna and it's  artistic, stylistic cinematography.  After seeing this DVD, it's like  seeing the film for the first time.  For those who feel like a DVD can add  little to a black and white film, this DVD will prove you wrong.  If you  own plan to own very few DVDs, this needs to be one of them.  The sequence  where you see Welles in the light for the first time, as well as the climax  in the sewer are two of the finest individual shots in the history of film.   I can't think of a finer supporting actor performance than this one from  Welles.  Buy it!
