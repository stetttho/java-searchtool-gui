 With a new home theater system, I was in a quandary about whether to buy the DVD Dts or the DVD collector edition.  My dts DVDs I own so far... Jaws and Twister... are amazing.  After reading the Amazon reviews I went with  the non-dts and wow were you guys correct.  I'm sure the dts must sound  great because the non-dts sounds fantastic.  The extra features such as the  excellent documentary and the (2) different commentaries are completely  left out of the dts versions!  The Amazon reviewers gave me this info. and  I went with their advice.  The commentaries, one by Ronny Howard and the  other by Jim and Marilyn Lovell, give you tremendous insight into the film.   When DVD works well it gives you a film, an experience, and insight into  that experience.  This Apollo 13 DVD Non-dts collector's edition is well  worth the money!  Other reviewers give a good analysis of the film, while  I'm here to tell you that if you aren't sure which DVD to buy, read my  opinion and the reviews of others and you'll go with this version!  This  dvd, along with The Third Man and The Abyss are the best overall dvds I  own!   This will give you the full experience!
