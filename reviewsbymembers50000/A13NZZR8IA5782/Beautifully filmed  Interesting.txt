 This is definitely a beautiful, well-filmed movie.  The story stays a bit of a mystery throughout.  Ms.  Rampling is quite good. When I looked at her career and the movies in her filmography, I was surprised to see that such a fine actress really hasn't been in that many good movies.  Not a young woman anymore, Ms Rampling is still very alluring.  This film has a few erotic moments, but not to the degree that some reviewers are stating.  If you like a thought-provoking type of character study and a beautiful loking film this could be a good one for you.
