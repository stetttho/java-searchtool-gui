 I viewed this one knowing nothing about the story.  It plods a bit at the beginning, but it picks up in pace and I was a little more than stunned.  There is a good sense of foreboding right from the start, but it doesn't  give the story of these two sisters away too early.  There is something  sinister in the air, and the events are quite shocking.  Well acted,  directed and filmed!  There are moments of extreme tension, eroticism, and  then and ending I didn't see coming.  In the end, it's more than just a  little creepy!  Sometimes a family can be a little too close!
