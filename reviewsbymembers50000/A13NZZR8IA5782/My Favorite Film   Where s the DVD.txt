 This is my favorite film, and I'm eagerly awaiting the DVD.  The film is amazing because the story is so powerful and consuming.  Four fascinating, well-acted characters drive the film until all elements become one with the  incredible climax, one of the finest filmed sequences in the history of  film.  The major film element here is actually irony.  Characters act in a  manner that wouldn't be predictable, yet the director weaves a picture  where it still makes sense and upon reflection seems appropriate. Holden,  Guiness, Hayakawa, and Hawkins all deliver complex, multi-faceted  performances.  Guiness delivers one of the finest performances in film  history.  David Lean should be a household name as is Hitchcock and  Spielberg.  Incredible! The vhs widescreen edition is of very high quality.
