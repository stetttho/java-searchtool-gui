 I had worn out my video copy of this fine film.  The Whiting/Hussey pairing is just phenominal.  Two unknowns, at the time, really deliver the passion.  This sure kills the most recent version, with Clair Danes and  Leo, which is filmed like a two hour MTV video nightmare.  I think a Leo  and Danes traditional R&J would have been interesting.  The sets in  this 1968 version are delicious.  The cinematography and other technical  aspects reallly shine on the DVD's clear images.  It's always amazing to  compare the DVD to the video.  Once again the DVD presents radiant images  that really bring a film to life.  If you buy this DVD be aware that  essentially you get a beautiful, well acted, well crafted film, but you  don't get much of what we've come to expect on DVDs.  No documentary,  commentary, background information, alternate scenes are provided.  For me,  the beauty of the crystal clear images is worth the price of the DVD.  For  me, Juliet will always be Olivia Hussey...  When I read the play I still  see her face delivering the lines.  This is one of the finest Shakespeare  adaptations to film.
