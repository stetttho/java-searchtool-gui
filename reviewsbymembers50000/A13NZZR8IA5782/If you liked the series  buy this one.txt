 Some of the best episodes from the series are on this one.  A little tad of science fiction, a few provocative settings, some great looking women, good acting, and some good overall scripts.  The price is cheap!  A reviewer above made a mistake.  The #1 episode, "Caught in the Act," is wrongly decribed above.  It's actually the one with Alyssa Milano where a foreign entity takes her over and she becomes a very dangerous woman.  I've been waiting for some of these episodes to become available on DVD, and I'm not disappointed.  I forget how good the "Valerie" episode is.  My favorite episode, "a stitich in time" is on the other Outer Limits DVD featuring time travel episodes. I bought them both and highly recommend them!
