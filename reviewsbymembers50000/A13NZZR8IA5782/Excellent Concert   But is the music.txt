 As far as concerts go, this one is very memorable.  Vince Gill really does provide an incredible version of "The Warmth of the Sun"....  while Pauls Simon, Elton John, and Billy Joel are all sounding great.  On the negative side, The GO GO's give a performance that any high school band could give further proving the point that their career was pure luck and image rather than any real talent.  The picture quality is crystal clear and is all set for the widescreen format. The Dts format for sounds is great, except for the fact that it doesn't appear to be 5.1.  When people come out just to talk and give tribute sound comes out of the center channel, but whenever a performance takes place the center channel goes dead and the sound is split in the front between the front left and front right speaker.  Why was this done?  Well that and the Go go's drop the review by a star, but overall there are many great performances on this dvd.  In fact Brian, himself, gives a better performance than I was expecting.  Surf's up.... You'll enjoy this concert.
