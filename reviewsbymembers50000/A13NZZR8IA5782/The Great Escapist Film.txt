 So many people are slamming this movie for a weak script, but this isn't supposed to be Schindler's List!  Take this one out for a spin and enjoy the ride!  The DTS version really rocks.  There's room for many genres of film, and this one is a great for what it is.  The acting is fine, the soundtrack is great, the cinematography is fantastic, and the computer graphics are as good as it gets.  The sound quality is jusy phenominal (another great example of DTS at its finest).  Watch this one when you want to escape reality and enjoy the rush of great action.  This isn't the film for profound thinking, but does it have to be?  Relax a bit, Amazon reviewers, and enjoy the action side of Spielberg.  No, it's not one of the finest films ever made-- Citizen Kane is not in danger of falling-- but I watch this one for escapist cinema!  Want to think a bit?  I just saw The Manchurian Candidate (try this one for deeper thought!)  ENJOY Jurassic Park!  If you're going to buy, I suggest the DTS if you have the system!
