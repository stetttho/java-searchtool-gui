 Godfather 1 and Godfather 2 are among the ten greatest films ever made.  Godfather 2 is probably the finest sequel ever made.  Place these two with The Conversation and Apocalypse Now and Mr.  Coppola definitely takes his place, along with Capra, Ford, Lean, Hitchcock, Spielberg (to name a few), as one of the finest directors ever.  The extras on this DVD look outstanding.  The only problem is Godfather 3.  This movie is quite forgettable and was made for the cash,not because the story needed to be continued.  Coppola was asked why he felt Godfather 3 needed to be made (on a Bravo program), and he stated FOR THE MONEY!!  The movie is long, slow, and contrived.  It adds very little to the saga.  Although the collection looks great on features, I'll wait until Godfather 1 and 2 are released individually.  For those who plan to buy it, I can see why.  It may be worth the price just to get the first two installments!  I'll bet after a few months the dvd for the individual movies will be released and I'll buy the first two at that time.
