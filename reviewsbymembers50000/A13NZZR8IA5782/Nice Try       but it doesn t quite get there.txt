 It seems the art of moviemaking gets a little lost in the art of moneymaking.  I love action blockbusters, but there needs to be other films where a director takes some bigger chances than just losing the studio money.  This film takes the artistic chances, but fails.  The first 30 minutes set up an interesting realm of possibilities, but then the rest of the movie is just bad.  The last 10 minutes of the guy from "shine" explaining the plot closes the lid and flushes the toilet.  Tom Cruise is very good in this.  The story comes together so artificially in the end.  Ultimately, it looks like an American director failing in an attempt to make a foreign movie with a fine American cast.  Nice try, but it didn't work.  Three stars for effort.  This movie did have potential.
