 I've always loved this film, but I hadn't seen it for a long time.  I recalled the action, the interesting use of music, and the acting performances by Eastwood and Wallach.  Seeing it again, and on DVD, showed  me that this is an excellent film, not just a spaghetti western.  The part  I find fascinating is how very bad the character played by Van Cleef truly  is!  I didn't recall the scenes where he slapped around a woman,  tortured  the rat Tucco, nor did I remember him shooting the old man near the  beginning! Van Cleef is one BAD dude!  This film has excellent  cinematography and the story moves you through an exciting Civil War  battle.  You get all the action here, but you also get a film very  artistically put together.  Wallach really plays a great rat, and Eastwood  is Eastwood... he may not say much, but his actions do tell quite a story!   The dvd has some scenes cut out of the original screen version.  The sound  quality of the DVD is not great, that is my only complaint.  I find the  film better than I remember!  The final showdown is a classic sequence!
