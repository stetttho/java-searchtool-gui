 The complex issue of identity is a good place to start a screenplay.  Everyone trying to be someone else is an interesting human trait, but....  As Mr. Ripley attempts to become someone else I found that I didn't  especially feel any empathy for his character, nor did I feel any for any  of the others!  As people start dying, it was no big deal because I didn't  care for their characters any more than Ripley!  As the movie progressed it  had already made its point early on and the last 45 minutes seemed like  hours.  This is a beautifully filmed effort, but if you don't care about  the characters and their plight, then the movie ultimately fails.  The  screenplay, it seems to me, is extremely and falsely praised by critics.
