 I didn't buy the original DVD Director's cut because so many reviewers chopped it to pieces.  When I saw the DTS version coming I had to buy it, and I'm glad I did.  I watched it for the first time today, and I can honestly say... great movie, great DVD.  The filming of this movie is just phenominal.  The natural setting looks like painted pictures.  The cinematography is relentless, the soundtrack vibrant, and the acting is about as good as it gets.  This is a great piece of history, literature, and film all in one.  Memorable scene after scene is presented as this baby clicks on all cylinders.  This is truly one of the most under-appreciated films of the last 30 years.  It works as a romance, an action film, and a historical film.  I saw no ghost images or other problems associated with the last DVd version.  I'll leave it to others to search frame by frame for problems.  This film was noted for it's sound, and the DVD dts only enhances it.  From the first sequence (tracking the deer) to the final, exhilerating action climax (the fight on the hilltop trail) you'll watch this again and again.  5 stars!!  Daniel Day-lewis is just incredible!  Some of the action sequences (saving Cora, for instance) are examples that should be shown in film school.  This is certainly one to buy.  The aspect ratio is 1:2.35 for the reviewers who complained about the previous DVD issue.  If you haven't seen this excellent film, and you love movies, this is your next film to see.
