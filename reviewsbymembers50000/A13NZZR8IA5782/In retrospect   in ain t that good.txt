 Television shows are best judged on their quality after the show is off the air.  The classic shows Cheers, Phil Silvers, The Honeymooners, Mary Tyler Moore Show (although the clothing really dates the show), and Taxi are still very funny.  Shows like All in the Family (really locked into the time it was made), Cosby, Laugh-in (really bad), and Mash don't seem to do as well when you see the reruns.  I've always seen Mash as a show in stages.. Stage 1 - the first couple of years are excellent Stage 2 - Wayne Rogers and McLean Stevenson leave and the quality of the comedy drops quickly. Stage 3 - The Alan Alda show where characters like Klinger and father Mulcahey (spelling?) take larger roles and the show is just horrible. In reruns, stage 1 shows are still good, but not as good as I remember.  Stage 2 shows are barely watchable.  Stage 3 shows are horrendous and it becomes obvious that it's all about Alan Alda and the show should have been cancelled YEARS before it ended.   Since this package still represents stage 1, I would say there are many good episodes in here.  I'm just shocked how bad some of the episodes are in reruns.  I stopped watching years before the show ended, but I was shocked to see some episodes recently and the show just doesn't hold up as well as I would have thought.  In retrospect, it ain't that good... with stage three shows being just downright awful.
