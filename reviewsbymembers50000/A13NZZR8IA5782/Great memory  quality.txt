 I just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason.  In a quick summation, here is what I found. + the memory (40 gb) is staggering.  I had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000!  It may have taken several years to fill this up. +  I had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit + Screen was good, easy to read +/-  Sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great. - The software that came with it was tough to load.  I got weird messages about it not being ok'd by microsoft (or something like that), then I thought it failed to load, then it loaded. - The top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch.  Not good if you're taking this traveling.  the top did not fit well into the unit. (felt defective) - the cover that came with it didn't fit very well -  the flywheel you use for most of the navigation wasn't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage.  I wasn't sure how long it would take before it would break. -  this DID NOT feel like quality construction and I wasn't sure how long it would last.
