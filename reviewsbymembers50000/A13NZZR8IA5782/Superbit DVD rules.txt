 Everyone else is reviewing the movie itself, so I'll review the Superbit DVD.  In the past, whenever I had a collecter's version (with plenty of extras) versus say a DTS version (without the extras) I would choose the extras.  In movies such as Apollo 13 and Saving Private Ryan I chose the collectors versions.  I found over  time that I stop watching the extras and just watch the movies over and over.  SO, Legends of the Fall offers a great collector's version at half the price of the superbit version.  So, why get the superbit?  WEll, this is a BIG movie.  The crispness of the picture and sound are stunning.  I have over 50 DVDs and this one is right at the top with sound quality and picture quality.  The separation of the surround sound in the dts is fantastic.  A door opening, a dog howling in the distance, the battle sequence, the wind, and James Horner's music will be as clean and true as you can imagine.  The quality of John Toll's amazing cinematography is a visual jewel.  From the definition in the color of the faces to the divine imagery of the natural setting,  you won't be disappointed.  This film is as beautifully photographed as any I have ever seen.  Now, is it worth double the cost of the loaded collector's edition?  I don't know, but I bought the Superbit version and I couldn't be more pleased.  The Superbit offers none of the extras that are in the collector's edition, just a breathtaking version of a gorgeous film.  I kept finding myself thinking.. wow that's beautiful.  This is a very emotional, moving film that the super-definition of sound and picture enhances into quite an experience.
