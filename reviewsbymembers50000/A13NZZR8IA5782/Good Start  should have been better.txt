 I thought I was going to love this movie after the first 30 minutes.  The plot was moving, it was well filmed with fun and interesting characters. Initially, Cate Blanchett's character seemed fun and exciting, but you get tired of her VERY quickly.  Eventually, she and Billy Bob's character get a little old  and by the end the climax seems a bit underwhelming.  Bruce Willis is quite good in this.  With a good start, it should have been better.  The film really loses energy.
