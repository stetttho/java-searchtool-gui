 Wow!  I was reading other Amazon reviews and it's difficult to believe this movie could be that bad.  I've just rented it.  This one is that bad.  Billy Bob said he was making a film in the old style of filmmaking.  I love that style.. and folks.. this isn't it!  This film is just slow, snail paced story telling.  Matt Damon and Henry Thomas are good in this, but their acting can't save it.  The romance between Damon and Cruz is flat and not convincing.  The use of slow motion and black fade outs at the end of scenes is done poorly and is annoying throughout.  This is a real disappointment.  A real snoozer!
