 I was advised against buying the previous DVD issues, although this is one of my favorite films.  I heard how the sound was poor and the visuals were cloudy.  WEll, I'm used to watching this on a VHS tape that has been played too many times.  The sound and images on THIS DVD are first-rate.  I would agree that the dvd Collector's Edition could have had more extras.  The bottom line is the quality of the visual and auditory presentation.  According to Widescreen Review, both are improvements over the previous DVD releases.  This movie is not for everyone -- if you read the Amazon reviews you'll see what I mean! If you want to experience this film, this collector's DVd will give you what you are looking for.  I found the images crisp and the sound much better than expected.  Remember, this is a film made in the late 60's!!  The special effects still stand up to anything seen today!  I've seen quotes from George Lucas... he agrees!  If you can stay through the entire movie, you will be treated to 3, 4, or 5 of the finest sequences in the history of film!  On my widescreen TV with full 5.1 surround sound, I'm very impressed with the presentation!  The sequence from the ages of man to the Space Baby still gives me chills... and so much more to contemplate!
