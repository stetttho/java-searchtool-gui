 Well, Altman is one of my favorite directors.  I've enjoyed the big hits(Mash, The Player, Nashville) as well as the little ones (Streamers, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, 3 Women).  When I saw all the praise I was expecting an excellent film, this isn't it.   First of all, there's the dreaded patented Altman sound mix that has worked well elsewhere (especially in Mash where it accentuated the sense of chaos), that is a disaster here.  Trying to make out what these folks are saying just gets in the way of enjoying and understanding the film.  The movie is overly long, it takes too long to get to the murder, I didn't care about the guy who died, and I didn't get that longing to figure out who killed him (this kills the who-done-it).  The interwoven character studies that works so well in Nashville and Short-cuts doesn't work here as it simply meant there were more characters I really didn't care about.  Beautifully filmed? yes!  That's the only reason I can even give it 3 stars.  I had heard how this film takes you beneath the surface of intricate relationships between characters (something Altman can do quite well).  Ok, this person is sleeping with this person, and that guy doesn't love his wife, and this lady really runs the show, etc.,...  The problem is the film builds no real feelings for any of them.    Very disappointing.
