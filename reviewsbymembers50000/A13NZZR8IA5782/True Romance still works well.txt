 I remember how disappointed I was when I first heard of the selection of Streep and Eastwood for the roles.  After reading the book, I thought they were wrong for the characters.  It turns out I was wrong!  They work  together remarkably well!  Their romance is one of my favorites in all of  film.  Streep is just phenominal again!  When will the AFI give her a life  achievement award?  Eastwood shows quite a range here and he is completely  real as the photographer.  Eastwood's direction is really fantastic here as  the movie paints a beautiful picture.  The final sequence with Streep in  the truck is as good as it gets.  If you don't feel her pain, I mean really  empathize with her dilemma, then perhaps romantic films aren't your thing.   The way that scene is filmed will stick with me for a long time.  The only  negative is the casting of the brother and sister looking through Streep's  life.  When they're in a scene it's so flat and then the movie goes back in  time and the film is remarkable again.  Don't be warned off because you  think this one glorifies extramarital affairs.  It doesn't!   The woman and  man do the right thing in the long run.  As the old lady says in Titanic  (paraphrase)...a woman's heart holds many secrets..  This secret is about a  chance encounter that would help define the main characters very being...   in life and in death.   This one is very powerful.
