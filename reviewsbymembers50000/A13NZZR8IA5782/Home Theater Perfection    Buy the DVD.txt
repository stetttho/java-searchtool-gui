 When I first bought this DVD, I was very impressed with the quality of the picture and the sound from my stereo TV.  Well, I just bought a home theater system and WOW!  This is the demonstration DVD to show people who  aren't sure if they want one!  The battle sequences are just phenominal as  the bullets and blasts fly by your head from every possible angle.  It's an  excellent film no matter what, but the home theater experience will amaze  you!  Excellent direction, of course!..  Excellent acting, of course!   Excellent cinematography, of course.  You'll feel the texture of the grains  of sands falling againsy you as the explosion propels the beach into your  face.  This film is what dvd is all about... the total experience!  Wnat  you've heard is true.. buy the dvd.  I don't even have the DTS version...  all I can tell you is the dolby digital does the job and then some!    Incredible 5 speaker separation of sound!  What you've heard is true...  this is not just a movie, it's an experience!
