 Saw this dog on a plane where several people commented that it was the worst film ever seen in flight.  It might not have stunk to high heaven,  but it did stink to high altitude.  Dull and lifeless are the first words  that come to mind.  I like a good film with dance as the backdrop (The  Turning Point, All That Jazz, White Nights), but this dog could barely  walk, let alone dance.  The dramatic storyline didn't keep my interest in  the least. While a few of the dance sequences (not all!) were fine, the  story has to work first.  A total bomb! If you insist, rent it for a cure  to insomnia!  I seldom find movies of this kind this bad!  Need a good  dance film in the DVD collection?  Wait until All That Jazz is  released(hopefully soon! )
