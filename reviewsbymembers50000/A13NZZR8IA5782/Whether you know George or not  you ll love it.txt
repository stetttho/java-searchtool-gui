 This one is worth the cover price for the pictures alone.  You get all the Rolling Stone interviews, the photos, and some great tributes.  I've read this cover to cover several times.  George Harrison guitarist, songwriter, spiritualist, producer, and gardner.  You'll get a glimpse into the elements that made up the man.  This book and the huge Beatles anthology sit on my coffee table and I flip through this one often.  Enjoy it!
