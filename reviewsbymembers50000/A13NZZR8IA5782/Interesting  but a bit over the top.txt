 I expect to get blasted by Scorsese and Cage fans on this review.  Being a Scorsese fan, I'm anxious to see anything he directs.  This film tries too hard to be cutting edge.  The constant fluctuating scenes where Scorsese  alters between slow motion, then fast motion resembles an MTV music video.   At times, the scenes look amazing, but at other times it just appears like  someone in film school trying a bit too hard to be an artist.  The  perfomance by Cage, once again, gets old quickly as his intensity seems so  exaggerated and staged for the camera.  9MM, Snake Eyes, and Leaving Las  Vegas all demonstrate that Cage knows how to shake his head and body, but  it's such bad acting.  It appears so completely unnatural.  The supporting  cast - Hurt, Goodman, and Sizemore- deliver quite good performances.  In  the long run, comparing this one to other Scorsese efforts, Bringing out  the Dead is fairly forgettable.
