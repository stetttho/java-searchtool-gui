 As far as Dracula movies go, this one is ok.  We have a bit of the classic novel (Just enough to make it recognizeable).  The beginning is very good as we get some new twists with thieves accidentally uncovering the Count.  We have 3 Good looking vampire ladies ( Must have them in the story!).  The twist to how Dracula became Dracula is different ( I won't tell if you haven't seen it) and interesting enough.  The problem is that the movie just isn't scary enough.  It seems to me like there were some great opportunities for fright in this one that were wasted.  The movie itelf is 2- 2 1/2 stars.  The DVD itself is very good.  Great extras like screen tests, deleted scenes, extended scene, and commentary.  The sound quality in the Dolby 5.1 is awesome.  The back 2 speakers in the surround sound are used very well with some cool and spooky sounds shooting out when you are not always expecting it.  I found the use of sound to provide more creeps than the visuals at times.  If you like vampire movies, you should check this one out.  If you don't, this film will probably not entertain you.
