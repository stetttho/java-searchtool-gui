 Whenever I see this type of reunion concert, I tend to expect the worst... a bunch of burnouts in a pathetic attempt to rekindle any type of flame.  Fleetwod Mac, however, can still hang with anyone in contemporary music.  Lindsey Buckingham's guitar rocks throughout.  His range- from the sensitive to the harsh- this boy can rock with anyone.  His performance on go insane, big love, etc... is just incredible.  Also, the banjo on Say you love me is fantastic.  The vocals from Christine McVie and Stevie Nicks are at least as good as they were 20 years ago.  I saw them live in about 1979, and they were great then, and amazingly perhaps better now.  Mic is playing great and the drums rock and roll throughout as well.  I was surprised to find that there are several excellent new songs.. bleed to love her and temporary one.. for example.  This is a great concert DVD you'll play over and over.  Everyone seems to want to compare it to the Eagles dvd, which I don't understand..  After all, can't they both be outstanding??  The sound quality and clarity is excellent here, but it's not DTS.  Silver springs and Go your own way are my favorites.  Lindsey's guitar dominates this concert.
