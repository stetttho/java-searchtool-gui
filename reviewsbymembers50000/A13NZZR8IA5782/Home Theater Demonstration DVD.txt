 This is the first disc I bought since I got the home theater set up and this one you won't believe! Ok, I'll admit the story here is a little weak, but this isn't supposed to be a "Raging Bull" type of character  study. This is a very entertaining, state of the arts effects, fun film.  The sound from this DTS version is extraordinary. The separation of the 5.1  is incredible. The twister sequences will blow you away. You feel the sound  and the fury! The only other disc that compares is the Saving Private Ryan  one. For you home theater fanatics, this is your film.. you'll see it, hear  it, and feel it. This disc also has some great extras like director  commentary and a cool documentary of how it was made. All in all, it's not  one of the finest 100 or 200 movies ever made, but you may find yourself  watching it over and over for the experience of it! You'll love it! The  movie itself is about a 3, but the DVD DTS is about a 5!
