 This film is really quite good, not just as a cartoon but as a movie.  The ecological message is very strong, but the character's are quite amusing at the same time.  Great voices from John Candy, Bob Newhart, Tristan Rogers,  and especially George C. Scott.  As far as bad guys go, McLeach (George C.  Scott) is as bad as it gets! The character is as mean, greedy, and  otherwise nasty as one could hope for in a villain.  The animation sequence  with Cody riding the Eagle is just awesome.  The computer animation in this  one is great.  One note.... in some movie guide (either Maltin or Ebert) it  was stated to watch out for the dark-skinned features of McLeach as some  sort of denegration of dark-skinned people...  This statement is just  absurd!  The McLeach character looks and sounds like George C. Scott!  This  is a wonderful film with a positive message about the environment, helping  others, and gaining self-confidence.  I think you'll love it!   I have high  hopes for the DVD edition!
