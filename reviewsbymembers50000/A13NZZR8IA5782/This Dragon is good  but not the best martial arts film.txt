 Yes, this is a well filmed, entertaining martial arts film, but I feel somewhat let down.  The universal, enthusiastic praise this one received left me expecting a great film... instead this is a very good film.  The first few "flying" scenes showed remarkable special effects.  After the 20th time they flew, I felt it really took away from the martial arts technique.   Personally, I'll take Enter the Dragon as the best martial arts film ever made.  As a drama, the movie is good, but the story does begin to drag in a few places.  Clearly, this is a well made, entertaining film... but a candidate for best movie of the year at the academy awards?  Traffic and Gladiator are clearly much better.  If everyone hadn't claimed this to be a great film  ( a landmark in martial arts films), I would be more willing to sing its praises.   You'll like this movie, I know I did, but I do question its greatness!
