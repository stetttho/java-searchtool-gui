 Sandra Bullock as a hard-boiled homicide detective has a few hurdles to jump before the movie begins.  This is one of those Leopold and lobe (spelling?) type partner thrill-kill situations to be solved by Bullock.  Of course, all the other cops go with the trail of clues, while Bullock's hunches always see the truth.  She has some inner-demons, but it wasn't very moving. The story has that feel of we've seen all of this before... and it was done better the last three times.  This wasn't all that bad- it just wasn't all that good considering the star and the director.  The criminals' story got old fast, and the believibility was strained by the end.  Bullock's performance reminded me of Holly Hunter as a detective in Copycat where I never got over the mis-casting.  Ok for a movie rental, but if I had seen it in the theater I might be more negative.  I like the idea of Bullock trying more gritty drama, but she just doesn't cut it as a tough detective.
