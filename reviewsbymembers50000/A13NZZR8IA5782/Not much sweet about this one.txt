 It appears to me like they were trying to take advantage of the Sex in the City type of situational hype, but this one is a disaster from the start.  The comic gags (falling during the wedding ceremony, getting blasted in the bathroom, etc.) just aren't very funny and I'll laugh at almost anything.  When this was in the theatres I think 10 people saw it and if Cameron Diaz wasn't in it the number would have dropped to 3.  No problem with the actresses, just give them something better to work with.  If I want to watch Sex in the City I'll turn on the tv.  Also, the unrated warnings all over this are odd since I didn't see anything in this one that would be unrated material.  It looks like Cameron Diaz is using the same movie selection advisor as Gwenyth Paltrow.  It's hard to believe that this looked good as a screenplay.  Why would she choose to make a movie this bad?
