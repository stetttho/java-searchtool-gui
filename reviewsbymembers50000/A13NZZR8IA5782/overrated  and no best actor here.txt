 I like action police movies, but this one rings of overstated, overdone screenplay from the beginning.  Washington and Hawke are good, but once again nowhere near the hype.  The violent finale is so absurd!  And when the main elements of the plot are revealed it is also absurd.  We can stretch our imaginations to a certain degree, but this is clearly a screenplay and not anywhere close to something realistic.  As far as the academy award goes, I'm completely disgusted by the best actor award.  Denzel is good (as he usually is) but his performance isn't even in the same class as the one by Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind.  A Beautiful Mind wins all the main awards based upon Crowe's incredible, driven performance and he doesn't win best actor?  We know the academy likes Denzel and doesn't care for Crowe's antics, we know there was an incredible campaign to get Denzel the award, we know there was all that criticism that A beautiful Mind left out shady elements of the main character's life, but did the voters actually think about the 2 performances solely on merit?  Crowe's performance will be heralded for a long time to come, while Denzel's award will be seen as a make-up academy award (like Newman in The Color of Money).  I don't understand the make-up award factor since I looked back at the past times he was nominated and I'm not sure he should have won one, except for the supporting actor award in Glory.  Ultimately Denzel gives a good (not great) performance in a very forgettable, unrealistic movie.  When you see the performances 10 years from now, what will you think?  Academy voters, you are a disgrace.
