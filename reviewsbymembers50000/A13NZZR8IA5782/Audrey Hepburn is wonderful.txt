 Well, I just picked this up and it is delightful.  Real chemistry between Harrison and Hepburn.  The dvd has a cool feature where you get to hear Hepburn's actual voice in two songs and it makes you wonder why they felt the need to dub; however, it was the way of the time the movie was made.  I guess it's tough to compete with the voice of Julie Andrews, but looking at it from contemporary thought, I believe the combination of Hepburn's voice and acting ability would have really withstood all the criticism in not having Andrews play the role.   Hepburn's acting performance is just fantastic, and she really deserves all the praise for being one of the finest actresses in film history.  Place this performance with Roman Holiday, Sabrina, two for the road, wait until dark, breakfast at tiffanys... and you have quite the actress.  The combination of sound and picture make this a great dvd.
