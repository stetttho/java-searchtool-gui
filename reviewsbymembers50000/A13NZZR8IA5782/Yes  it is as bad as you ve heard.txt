 Wow, this one is right down there with Showgirls and Ishtar.  Bad script and  bad acting usually don't get you far.  Why an academy award winning actress has to degrade herself to this degree with sex scenes that are completely not neccessary I don't know.  As long as she wants to take her clothes off, I'll watch but at least choose a decent movie to "perform" in.  The lack of chemistry between Antonio and Angelina is amazing considering the explicit nature of the scenes.
