 Well, I bought the DVD dts and I think you'll like the extras such as the outtakes, deleted scenes, and especially an excellent documentary.  You'll get the behind the scenes from Spielberg, the actors, photographers, and  the producers.  In today's film world this movie could be made rather  easily, but back then you'll see the tremendous undertaking that went into  this production.  The movie itself, of course, is just amazing.  At one  point Spielberg says that the shark is the star, but the scenes on the boat  will show you 3 stars at the top of their game.  The sound quality is  outstanding and exact, but I do have one complaint.... on the 5.1 DTS their  isn't much activity from the back 2 speakers. The sound coming from the  front 3 is great, but they could have done more.  This movie is just as  suspenseful as when I saw it in the mid-seventies.  I hadn't really watched  it in awhile and I had forgotten the outstanding acting performances by  Scheider, Dreyfuss, and Shaw.  Shaw's USS Indianapolis speech is about as  good as it gets, while Scheider's everyman performance really rings true.   You'll enjoy this DVD and it's at a good price.  A good bargain.  Buy it!
