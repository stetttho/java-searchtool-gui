  Mick Foley has done a brilliant job of documenting his life story with flourishes of humor and human emotion that will touch and inspire readers of all walks of life. For my entire life I've watched professional wrestling and am now involved as a ring announcer and commentator. I was never a big Mick Foley fan, though I've always respected his ability. Now, I have been converted.   "Have A Nice Day" is hard to categorize. It isn't fair to classify this as a wrestling book. It's so much more.  This is the perfect read for anyone that needs some inspiration or motivation. Foley was turned down by the WWF more times then Elizabeth Taylor has husbands, yet he now holds the distinction of being a two time WWF heavyweight champion.   In fact, Mick Foley may become the only individual to wear the WWF crown under two separate names. He won the WWF title as Mankind and will soon challenge for it again under the moniker he started his career under, Cactus Jack.  The versatility of "Have A Nice Day" will keep you mesmerized until you finish it. one could consider it a buffet that spans an entire football field - you're certain to find more then enough to fill you up.  With the enormous popularity of professional wrestling today it seems that any professional wrestler could write a book and that would sell. Even Al Snow (read "Have A Nice Day", and you'll understand that!).   This book doesn't need professional wrestling's big push. "Have A Nice Day" and its' author, Mick Foley aka Dude Love aka Mankind aka Cactus Jack, stand on their own.  Sstop reading these reviews. Order the book
