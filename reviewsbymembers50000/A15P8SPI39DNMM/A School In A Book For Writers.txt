 I'd reccomend that writers read this book and take notes and/or mark it up with a highlighter. Nuggets and chunks of information are scattered throughout.  The main problem is one that lies in "Poetics," by Aristotle, as well. Both books were written so long ago, that they reference extremely outdated material and, at times, use long passages from these old plays. The result is a struggle and a chore for the reader to get through what is mostly boring, unuseable, and unhelpful dialogue and scenes for screenwriters and novelists of today.   The techniques and thhory behind what Mr. Egri preaches is on point and pretty sound, though I find it ironic that most people consider this book and "Poetics" to be two books that all writers should read, yet Lajos Egri disagrees with Aristotle on may points. Interesting. Very interesting.  Writing, as in any creative art, has many teachers. No one is 100% correct. You can learn something from anyone, and you probably have something you could teach to other artists too. Pick out the best from this, and other books, and use the information to write something brilliant. "That Art Of Dramatic Writing" can definitely help you do that.
