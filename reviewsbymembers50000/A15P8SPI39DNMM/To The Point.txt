 I picked this up on the reccomendation of Stephen King when reading his excellent "On Writing." Mr. King was so impressed with "Elements..." that he suggested that all writers should read it, and he did this on a page that was solely dedicated to this purpose. High praise from a man who should know a thing or two about writing; wouldn't you say?  Strunk's book cuts throught the chase and quickly points out common errors in writing. Examples are provided of good and bad writing. You'll learn puctuation techniques that are necessary for communicating your words effectively.  Mr. King was right; you need this.
