  Books that are written by people that have actually done what they write about are the best ones. This book certainly is in that catergory.   MLM gets a bad rap, but it's basically sales. We all need to sell. I don't care if you're an artist. If no one buys your art, you're a starving artist.Yhis book teaches some good, solid sales techniques.  Dave Roller has built MLM organizations that earn him in excess of $100,000 per year. Pages 109-113 explain Dave's "Farm System" of prospecting that is truly amazing. If you simply follow this one technique, it appears your organization would explode.   The rest of the book is solid, but the "Farm System" method of prospecting would be worth the price of this book alone. The day that it works for you will be a day that you will want to duplicate again and again.  Thanks Dave.
