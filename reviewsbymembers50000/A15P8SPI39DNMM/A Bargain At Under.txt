 Artie Lang certainly gives bang for the buck here. You get very good stand up, a short film of his, and behind the scenes footage. That's better than most DVDs.  This is typical Artie, he's usually pretty bombed, witty, and funny. During a skit where he expalins how he is the only white guy playing basket ball with blacks and uses a racial slur when asking one of the other players to throw him the ball, I had to rewind several times until I finished laughing. Very funny stuff.  The overall feel of the DVD is somewhat amatuerish. It is not a high quality production, but it doesn't skimp on humor. If you're looking for a slick DVD made by a huge film crew, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a few good laughs at an affordable price, pick this up.
