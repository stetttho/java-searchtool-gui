 This is the first Sidney Sheldon book I've read. I chose it simply because it was in my  mother's book case. I'm glad I picked it up.  Mr. Sheldon appears to have the ability to sum up what other author's could detail over several pages into 2 or 3 sentences. I'm not sure if this a flaw or a gift. It could be a flaw because at times it's as if you want more - but at the same time isn't that what all artists are taught; keep them wanting more?   The book moves at a quick pace and certainly does keep one interested. A few reviewers have commented that the plot is predictable. To that I say that certain parts are, but there is enough that isn't, and just when you think that you've got it all figured out; Sheldon tweaks it ever so slightly to keep you on your toes.   I won't go into the story; enough of the reviews do that. I'll simply close by saying that "Tell Me Your Dreams" is worth a read, but it isn't perfect. A few times I found myself thinking, "That doesn't make sense. That couldn't happen." I found some situations to be to coincidental or far too easy, but this was based on a real life story and some situations are like that in real life. The problem is that fiction is read to allow us to escape from real life.
