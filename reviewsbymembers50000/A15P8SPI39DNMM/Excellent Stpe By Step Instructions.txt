 Syd Field provides viewers of this "Screenwriting Workshop" with organized assignments that if followed will lead to the completion of a screenplay.   Popular and easy to find movies like Shawshank Redemption, Titanic, and Thelma And Louise are used as examples to allow the viewer to see the techniques that Mr. Field competently articulates.   One would be well advised to watch the DVD once in it's entirety before attempting any of the assignments to see what will be involved on the grand scale. This way you can see what you will be commiting to.  Writing a screenpaly is not a formula, but formulas do exist to complete one. Consider this DVD covering Syd's techniques one of the formulas, or maybe recipe is a better analogy. Most people tweak a recipe to suit the taste of the people they are cooking for. You may tweak Syd's recipe, but if you stick to his original, step by step, you will end up cooking up a finished screenplay.  Will it taste good? Well, that depends on the quality of your ingredients. Syd can't give you that. No one can. Syd does give you excellent structure. That's all he can do... and he does it well.   Worth every penny.  His final speech at the end of the DVD is also very inspiring and heartfelt.  Thanks Syd.
