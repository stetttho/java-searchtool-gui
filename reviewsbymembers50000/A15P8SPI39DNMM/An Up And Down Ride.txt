 Having only read one King book ("On Writing") before this, I was looking forward to it. Desperation was engrossing at times and tough to get through in spots. Many times it had the feel that the author was rambling to fill space. There were passages that filled pages and didn't add value to the story at all.   Desperation is a very good story that could have been better told.   In "On Writing" King recounts a lesson he learned early in his writing career; it is something to the effect of: "Rewriting is writing minus 10%." He was saying that, during a rewrite you eliminate 10% of what you have written. Desperation seems like he ignored his own advice. It was a very captivating story that could have used another rewrite.
