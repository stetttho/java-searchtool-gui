  Robert A. Lindquist was the inspiration I needed when at the age of 20 years old when I was breaking into the mobile DJ world. I met Robert at a trade show in Atlantic City and purchased Spinnin' 2000 from him. My copy is autographed!  Since then, I've opened my own DJ business, sold another, provided training and recruitment for the two largest DJ companies in NJ, wrote - self published - and successfully sold "Making Money As A Mobile Entertainer" a training course for mobile DJ/entertainers, and run a DJ related web site.  Mr. Linquist was a tremendous inspiration for all of this. Reading his book showed me that there are many avenues for Djs outside of merely being a DJ.  Get this book. It could change your life. Really. It did for me. Thanks Robert.
