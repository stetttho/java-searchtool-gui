 Aristotle's Poetics is touted as a "Must Read Bible" for writers, and though it's core principles do warrant merit, they are hard to decipher because: they were written so long ago; they reference plays, instruments, even words, that are no longer in use - and sometimes the words are not even translated; they are spelled out with symbols.  I read it, and found it difficult to follow, but it is a quick read. At least I can tell people that I read Aristotle. That is definitely a conversation starter.
