 I'll make it short and simple. If you only can afford one KISS cd, this is the one you should get. These are the classic songs that made KISS and gave them their identity. There's a lot of music here; originally released on vinyl (I've got that too) these tracks filled two records.  KISS had many more hits after the release of this compilation, but if I were on a desert island and could only bring one KISS cd, this would be it. I'd miss some of the later stuff a lot, but I'd survive happily with Double Platinum. You will too.
