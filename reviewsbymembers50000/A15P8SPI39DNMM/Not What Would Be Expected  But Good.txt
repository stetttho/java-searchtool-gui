 The only problem with Peter Criss's solo effort is that it is such a radical departure from what his fans heard him do with Kiss. Simply put; this does not sound like Kiss, and Kiss fans were the intended market for this recording. That is a recipe for poor sales.  It's a shame that more people didn't get a chance to hear this, because it is good. It's just not a good Kiss record. When it first came out, I listened to it once. It wasn't what I expected. Years later I put it on without the expectations of hearing the Kiss sound and I enjoyed it.  "I Can't Stop The Rain" is a song that should have been a hit then, and could be a hit today.   There are a few numers that appear jazzy and bluesy at the same time. If Paul Stanley were with Peter when recording these, they could have easily fell into the calssic Kiss sound, but apparently that wasn't what Peter was after, and the results are interesting.  All in all, this is a good choice for Kiss fans to pop in whe they feel like getting a fix of Kiss and you want something just a little different.
