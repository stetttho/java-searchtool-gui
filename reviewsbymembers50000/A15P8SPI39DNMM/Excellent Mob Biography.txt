 It's very interesting to see how this extremely entertaining biography reads in comparison to the classic movie it served as the catalyst for. Wiseguys is engaging. You really begin to feel as if you come to know Henry Hill and the various Gumbas he introduces you to throughout the pages.  If you've seen Goodfellas you will certainly find the combination of certain characters from the book into one character for the movie interesting also. Screenwriters will enjoy how Martin Scorcese altered aspects of the book to make the story flow on screen.  Many pieces of Henry Hill's dialogue were magnificently voiced over word for word in a brilliant performance by Ray Liotta. A credit to Scorcese and Liotta. Many alleged "gurus" shun voice over in movies. But when used properly, as in Goodfellas, the results are classic. And we wouldn't have that classice if it weren't for Mr. Pileggi documenting the life of Henry Hill here in Wiseguy.
