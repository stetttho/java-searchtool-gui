 Quentin Tarantino delivers the goods in tall order, along with with one of the most talented casts ever assembled and a brilliant story.   This is a movie that requires full undivided attention from the viewer from beginning to end. It is a complex weave of smaller stories that are told in a non linear fashion which actually makes for a better story then if they were laid out in thier natural order. Presenting them out of sequence affords us some brilliant directing by Tarantino - who also provides some good laughs, and proves that he's a capable actor alogside these heavyweights, in his portrayal of Jimmy from Toluca Lake - and allows the award winning director to end the movie at a more interesting spot in the natural timeline.  This movie literally grabs you from the beginning. Even the opening credits, which occur after the first scene, hold your interest, and they are simply words over a black screen, set to music.  To enjoy Pulp Fiction: turn the phone off; pause if you go to the bathroom; don't talk during the movie, and prepare a snack beforehand; it's a little over three hours long.  I've noticed that anyone that has said that this movie didn't make sense, or that they didn't like it, didn't watch the whole thing. They missed entire sequences by talking or leaving the room. Every part of this movie is necessary to tell it's stroy. And that story is excellent.
