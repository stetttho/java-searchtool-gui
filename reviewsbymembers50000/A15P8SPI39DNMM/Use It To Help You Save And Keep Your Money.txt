 I must say that Gene Simmons is a very entertainig author. Whether you agree with his views and opinions or not, you will come away from reading this book with the feeling that you understand his point of view and that he is not just spewing garbage without any basis.   The demon bass player from the supergroup Kiss consistently gives reason upon reason for every opinion in this finely written book. He's not afraid of being controversial. In fact, there is more then a fair share of controversial material contained in Sex Money Kiss but the reader does not ever get the feel that Simmons is trying to be controversial simply for the sake of generating publicity. These appear to be his real feelings and all of them are sound in the fact that they make sense.   Simmons gives his take on women and marriage which he is certainly out in left field on compared to the majority of people, but does that make him wrong? I say, "No." It makes him intellegent enough to realize that just because most people do the same thing that has been done for generations, that doesn't make it the right thing to do.  This concept can, and should be, applied to the many people that have children by a certain age because they think that is what they are supposed to do. Many of those people become stressed out, unfit, unprepared parents who should have waited a few years.   Gene doesn't sugar coat anything. He's brutally on the nose with his comments and opinions. That may make him abrasive to some.   I took his advice literally and saved some money by returning Sex Money Kiss after reading it. The book is worth the money, but I felt compelled to do it after finishing it. I felt like that's what Gene would have done.
