  As a ring announcer & commentator for professional wrestling matches, I have first hand experience of what transpires "behind the scenes". Dwayne Johnson aka "The Rock" does a fine job of taking fans into this once highly secretive and restricted area. One complaint would be that the book is written in the Rock character at times. That aspect took from what could have been a captivating book.  I, as well as millions of other people, find the Rock to be an incredibly entertaining personality, but the most interesting parts of this book are clearly when the author speaks freely as Dwayne Johnson. The Rock is all over TV, magazines, cds, and nearly everywhere we look. The man behind The Rock is what makes a biography intriguing.  Dwayne Johnson surfaces on the pages for approximately 75% of this wrestling literary buffet. And he provides some great insight into his character and family history.  Some great highlights are when Johnson tells how he prepares his fantastic promos (promos are when wrestlers talk on the microphone). He also provides a few of his favorites while giving in depth insight as to what the situation was that led to the promo and what state of mind he was in at the time.   Dwayne Johnson shares his unique entry into the world of professional wrestling while explaining exactly how he constantly worked and improved in the WWF's farm wrestling league. Yes, the Rock literally wrestled in barns!  The Rock comes from a bloodline that is undoubtedly legendary in wrestling, yet he has eclipsed all of their fame. This book will provide fans and outsiders to wrestling with enough of this electrifying entertainer's life story and family history to make it a very worthwhile read.  I would have liked it to have been longer. It took me only 18 hours to read it from cover to cover, though I'm a quick read.   Maybe when the Rock's schedule lightens, he will pen another book entirely on his own. I look forward to it.
