 Since this is the first, and only, Stephen King book I've read, it is my first exposure to his written work. I chose "On Writing" to see what a commercially successful writer does, and what he recommends writers do.   You will learn enough of King's background to see why he may have developed the style and traits he employs as a writer. He delves into many specifics that you can immediately adapt to your writing: pet peeves, favorite books, grammar, punctuation; all of these are given attention in no specific order, but are covered when the author feels they are relevant.  Though "On Writing" is far from an instructional manual or tutorial guide, there is an exercise that Mr. King proposes to readers, and I must say that completing it will help you to grow as a writer, regardless of your level. This goes for published authors also.  All in all, "On Writing" is a book that all writer's will enjoy and benefit from. Immediately after reading it, I picked up "Gun Slinger," and after reading 5 or 6 pages, I found myself bored and unimpressed with the writing. I noticed several passages that seemed to directly conflict with what King wrote in "On Writing." "Gun Slinger" appeared to me to have been written by someone else. It was amatuerish in comparison.   I intend to read Stephen King's novels, because I very much enjoyed his writing style in "On Writing," but I will probably never pick up "Gun Slinger" again.
