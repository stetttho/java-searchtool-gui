 Jeffrey Dobkin is an expert on marketing. That's not an opinion; it's a fact. Experts do; Dobkin does. Experts are recognized in trade publications; Dobkin is written up frequently.  The articles that this man has written for publications throughout the years could probably fill a small home. Suffice it to say that there are quite a few angry forests out there that have seen many a fallen tree be used to make the paper used to print the brilliance of Jeffrey Dobkin's marketing techniques.  This book is small but concise; easy to read but informative; inexpensive but preciously valuable.   I would have to go on to long to tell you all of the good that you will find in here, so instead I'll just tell you two things that you won't find in here: no cooking recipes and no tips on how to change your oil. Aside from those two things, Mr. Dobkin gives you everything you need to know to market your product or services effectively.  I couldn't reccomend this book higher.
