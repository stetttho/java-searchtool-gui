  Zig Ziglar once said that motivation isn't permanent. He was right. Motivation will wear off just like spraying yourself with cologne will eventually wear off. You need constant fixes of motivation. But, even that is not enough.  Using motivation without a goal and a plan is like spraying yourself with cologne without having a date. You won't accomplish too much.  Think of Hills "Think And Grow Rich" as your cologne, but as an added bonus, he's lined up a date for you also.  In the cologne (the book :-) Hill gives you the address of your date - and she's your perfect match. You just have to get out a map (Hill tells you where to get it) and get to her house.  The author is brilliant in the way he provides all of the information necessary to patterning out your goals with exact plans on how to achieve them.  You'll learn how to prepare a statement that describes exactly what you want to achieve along with two important factors - when and how.  If you read this book and don't avhieve what you want in life, it can be summed up in this short analogy...  Imagine going to Macy's and just buying any bottle of cologne at the counter. You may hate the smell when you get home. You like a mild cologne and this one is very strong. Get it?  If not, you REALLY need this book.   If you do get it, you are ready for this book.  Good luck to you regardless of what side of the fence you are on.
