 Mark Evan Schwartz has delivered a powerful and effectively entertaining way to present the proper steps involved in completing a properly formatted screenplay. First the talented author briefly provides the reader with enough information on preparing to write the screenplay.   Before delving into actually writing the screenplay Schwartz guides you by the hand and eases you into writing a logline, synopsis, and character descriptions. He may use different terms then you or I use, but after following his instructions and viewing the examples, you will have the necessary information to charge ahead and write your screenplay.   The brilliance of "How To Write A Screenplay" lies in the fact that the examples that the author provides are used to support the book itself; which is indeed a screenplay.   You actually learn to write a screenplay by reading one that is about a character who needs to write a great screenplay to save his relationship. Throughout his journey, he is given examples of how to write better dialogue, create strong characters, build effective conflict, and all the while you learn also with the added advantage of the information being provided in screenplay format.  "How To Write A Screeplay" is a quick read. Shouldn't take you more then 2-3 hours tops. That time is well spent.   My only warning is not a flaw in the book, it is simply a fact that the author eludes to also. Some parts of the sample screenplay show you how "NOT" to do certain things. Schwartz even explains in the dialogue that this screenplay could never be made into a movie. That shows the true talent that this witty author posseses. You learn by good example and bad.  One would be well advised to read this excellent book a couple of times and then read screenplays of movies that you have seen. You'll get the format down in no time.
