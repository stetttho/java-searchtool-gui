  An extremely informative and fun book to read Jeffrey Dobkin is incredible. Not only did he personally respond to my phone call to him after I read his incredible book, but he dropped a note in the mail to thank me for reading his book and used some of his personal contacts to help me market my disc jockey training materials. I was able to generate a 73% response rate on a lead generating direct mail letter that I crafted straight from the step by step easy to understand directions in this brilliant printed marketing seminar. This letter was to potential wedding clients for my companies' DJ services.  We booked 5 sales from it which resulted in $2,000 in deposits and $4,975 in gross income. Not a bad time investment.  I definitely consider myself knowledgeable in the copyrwiting area, but I became extremely knowledgeable after reading Mr. Dobkin's book.  The reason that I'm writing this review is because I am preparing to read the book again. I'm sure that I will pick up many more new ideas that will help me market even more effectively.  If Jeffrey Dobkin writes another book (it could be on harvesting avecodos) I'll be in front of you in line to get it. Though I would like it autographed Mr. Dobkin!
