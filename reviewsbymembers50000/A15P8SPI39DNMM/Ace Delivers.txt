 Never before have the members of a supergroup remained together and put out solo projects, under the band's name, at the same time. Well, never before has there been a band like Kiss, and most certainly, there never will be; so they decided to do it.   Here is the most commercially successful of the four paint-faced rocker's individual releases.  Ace Frehley, Kiss's lead guitarist, proves himself an extremely capable front man on this classic rock 'n' roll masterpiece of an album. The Spaceman stays where he should be and plays to his strengths, vocally and musically, and the results are a thoroughly entertaining listen that is worthy of multiple replays.   Very few artists can remake a song and do it better then the original version to the point where the song is now identified with them rather then the original artist. New York Groove, the album's only remake, is a number that does just that. This song is unquestionably Ace's now, and provided him with the only song from any of the Kiss solo albums to hit on the radio charts.  The album starts out strong, continues through, and ends with the excellent mellow instrumental, "Fractured Mirror." Ace would continue his Fractured theme on his solo projects later in his career.
