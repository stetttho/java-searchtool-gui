 John Grisham takes readers deep inside the lives of law professionals and provides a level of vision that only someone with personal experience can. Grisham, a former, attorney proves that he is up to the challenge, steps up to the plate, and shares what appears to be personal experience at times. If it's not personal, then that shows how good this is, because it feels personal, and that's good writing.  Characters are developed throughout the story, slowly and completely. Mr. Grisham gives you just enough information on each character to keep you feeling as if you know the character, and then you learn more of their past; what makes them tick; little personality traits that reveal more of who they are.  "A Time To Kill" is John Grisham's first novel, and the only one of his that I have read. I hear he's gotten even better. Looks like I'll be busy for a while.
