 Ben Peller demonstrates a competent knowledge of human emotion and feeling that he uses the backdrop of professional wrestling to get across.   The main character of this well written novel is quite a complex character who grows and evolves throughout a very entertaining and satisfying journey in this seemingly autobiographical story.  Michael Harding, grows from a picked on child, to an aspiring artist who rarely, if ever, creates art, to a professional wrestler. His journey is up and down. It is a great pace that keeps the reader involved and eager to get to the next page, or screen...  Yeah. I downloaded (paid for ;-)an online copy and actually read the entire book on my laptop. This is quite a compliment to the author because I detest reading online. In spite of my hard copy reading preference, I was easily able to speed through "Living The gimmick" in two days.   After completing the online version, I went out and bought a hard copy, mailed it Mr. Peller, and just a few days later, I had an autographed copy. How cool is that?
