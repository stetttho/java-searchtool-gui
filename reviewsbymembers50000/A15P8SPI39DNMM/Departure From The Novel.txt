 The movie version of Dean Koontz's novel contained many changes; that is to be expected. A novel won't translate to the big screen verbatim. The problem here is that many of the changes were ineffective in that they didn't help to develop the characters or progress the story. I don't think that I would've liked the movie at all if I hadn't read the book and that should not be required protocol in order to enjoy a film.  This movie had the feel of a made for TV movie, and by that I mean one of the older B rate TV movies, kind of like a cheesie Lifetime movie. It was a combination of unknown actors spewing bad dialogue -written simply for the sake of exposition - while wearing horrible wardrobe filmed in overdone lighting. The actors, who seemed pretty credible, never had a chance.  This could have been good, actually it could have been very good. Some of the changes from the novel should have translated excellently on screen. The screenpaly would have benefited from a rewrite. Too many scenes were repetitive. How many times do we need to see gunmen sneak up on the boy? Eliminate a few of those scenes and develop some backstory. How about some character development?   If you read the book, it's worth it to see how it translated to film. It only takes up 90 minutes of your life.
