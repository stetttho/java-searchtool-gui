 Paul Stanley proves why Kiss would never be Kiss without him. It seems that to pick a least favorite song from Paul Stanley one would have to resort to flipping a coin. Everything that he does has enough merit to warrant a listen.   This release covers it a all. Stanley delivers: a ballad, acoustic guitar, blazing rock, mellow type jazz; it's all here.   As always, the vocal performance is top notch. When he belts out "Tonight You Belong To Me," you believe it.   Simply put, here is the best voice in Rock, ever, and this is his first solo effort. How can't it be good?
