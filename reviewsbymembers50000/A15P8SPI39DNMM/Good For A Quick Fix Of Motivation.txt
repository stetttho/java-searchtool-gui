 Good For A Quick Fix Of Motivation, January 16, 2000 Art Williams is truly amazing. From a career as a high school football coach to the owner of his own insurance company Williams went from pauper to millionaire.  This book is an incredible story of success in spite of tremendous odds and obstacles. Art Williams grew his insurance company, A.L. Williams (now Prime America I believe), when Prudential and other companies dominated the market.   Nearly everyone was telling Art that it couldn't be done and that he was nuts. They laughed at him.  Who's laughing now? Well, Prudential is still around, but Art Williams is certainly able to laugh or do whatever he wants now. Maybe you can too if you follow his lead. The first step is to get this book and read about this amazing individuals' life.
