 Any resemblance to the Daniel Clowes' graphic novel upon which 'Ghost World' is based is purely cosmetic. The quiet essence of teenage angst that Clowes captured so brilliantly in his monochromatic drawings is lost somewhere in the translation. Not that the movie can't be assused of not trying...director Zwigoff just tries so hard he almost belittles his audience's intelligence. Its as though he used Clowes' basic characterization and plot structure to present his own frustrations with society, art, and cinema. Zwigoff uses the relationship between characters as a foil to the frustration of the creative individual in such a regimented market-driven country. I don't have issue with this per se...it just follows the trappings of the 'American Beauty' syndrome: soulful frustrated characters drifting through mediocrity with convenient typical ultra-liberal Hollywood plot twists.  Parodied situations in this vein are throughout 'Ghost World'. In the end, the two main characters are so good-looking, you have to wonder if they would really be so angst-ridden. It eventually gets so repetative, it borders on the tedious towards its own anticlimactic conclusion.
