 When I first came across this CD I dismissed it as amateurish college rock. Fortunately, I grew up, had my car stolen, became unemployed, moved 3000 miles away from anything familiar and popped this CD in again. It profoundly touched me.  'Angst-filled' only half-describes this CD. Its endless endless energy and general anger focused at everyone in all directions not only gets your attention but forces you into a universe where everything is wrong and thats the way its always been. Its a cry from a post-adolscent post-modern generation sick of the lies bred from the collective think-tanks of religion, patriotism, and marketing. Its an existential 'mea culpa' for a lost world. Enjoy.
