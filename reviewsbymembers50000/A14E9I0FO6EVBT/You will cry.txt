 The honesty of this novel through its fierce imagery and changing narrative left me with a lump in the back of my throat. It has the effect of passing through a car accident: you are captivated and horrified at the  same time as events unfold themselves to you. His juxtaposition of the  disturbingly dangerous erotic encounters of one main character and the  almost sterile sexlessness of the other provides a wonderful balance and an  insight as to how two human minds are affected forever by a common  childhood molestation. The almost polar obsessions that form as these two  boys grow up don't pit one character as the moral superior of the other,  but creates an empathy from the reader for these two souls as they drift  through events from which they consciously or subconciously are looking for  answers. The climax of the novel is almost anticlimactic in that their  meeting again is inevitable but Heim's magic of language, metaphor, and  imagery creates a powerful scene as these characters finally look to each  other for the truth. For the author to weave a story around such daring  subject matter was bold enough, but to create such dualing forces  throughout the novel (desire vs. love; reality vs. fiction; Kansas vs. New  York) without going to extremes or stereotypes drew me in.
