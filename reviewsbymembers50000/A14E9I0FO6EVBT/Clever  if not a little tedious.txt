 The Triplets really made an impression on me when I first viewed it a few years ago. The animation is flawless and colorful, but more it struck me as to what the potential of hand-drawn animation can still do (though major studios feel that it is a dead medium). The caricatures are hilarious and grotesque at times and the humor ranges from the esoteric to the trashy. Which is what makes Triplets such a standout... animation for adults that creates an alternate universe complete with nostalgia for 1930s animation. Belleville itself is a hybrid of New York and Paris with a wine mafia ruling the underworld and overweight masses fumbling through the streets. The plot is a little thin, though the visuals more than make up for its slow parts and (at times) annoying soundtrack. As an animation enthusiast, I loved the film... I'm not sure how the average movie-goer will get it though.  It's a great film and is certainly up there among the best animation of the past ten years.
