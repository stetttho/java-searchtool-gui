 The content of the 1988 film is not at question here. Its blend of live action and animation in unprecedented to this day. (Space Jam? P-P-P-Please!) While the plot itself is choppy and cliche, the acting and animation direction (by animation great Richard Willaims) makes it a great film. The DVD has much to be desired with no film notes, director's commentary, nor trailers. I was especially hoping to see the deleted scene in which Eddie Valiant breaks into Jessica's dressing room only to get knocked out by the bouncer and has an early dreadful encounter with Toontown that has only been shown once on a CBS airing of the film. Animation has been edited and redone in several places. Disney really needs to realize that they truly have a film gem here and stop placing it in the back burners of their achievements. Its truly more innovative than anything they've done in recent years before they fell into formula and saccharine characterization.
