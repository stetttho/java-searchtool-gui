 The craftiness of this film weaves broad social issues (globalization, capitalism, class struggle) with the transistion from childhood to adulthood with great subtlty and believable characterization. The hedonistic nature of  the two main adolescent characters is the nature of men, countries, "and your mother too" the film seems to say.  Where the film falters is in the female lead character's fatalist tendencies that sends the film into a predictable spiral towards the second half of the film.... The film is dead-on in its portrayal of Machismo excess and the phallocentric lines it draws between various social contstructs as well as forming a fair criticism of  the Mexican economic and political machine.
