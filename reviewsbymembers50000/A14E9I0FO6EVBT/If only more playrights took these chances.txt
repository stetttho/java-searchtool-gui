 There's a quiet moment in "Cloud Tectonics" when Celestina, the lost pregnant innocent recites a love poem to the more worldly, slightly jaded male lead.  She pours her love out to him in Spanish which, in true tragic fashion, he cannot understand. Each of these plays are about love, but not cliched. Its about sex, but not graphic. Its about art, but not pretension. He cries out to let us know New York, L.A., love, hope, and miracles exists outside of the facade of Hollywood and places dominated by collective commercial thought.  Rivera seems angry with how race relations, interpersonal love, and culture in general is malformed by the intrusiveness of corporate agents. His anger never rants though and is carefully interwoven into the structure of the play. Having never seen one of his productions, I can only imagine his alternate worlds.  Viva la imaginacin, Jose.
