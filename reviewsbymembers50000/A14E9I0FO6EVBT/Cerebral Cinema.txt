 Waking Life is a problematic and beautiful movie but not for the reasons that most people have with this film. I am relieved whenever I come across a movie that takes an interesting idea and allows itself as a film to become wrapped around its content. The challenging aspect of Waking Life though is that the content varies from the completely cerebral to the sophmoric. Which I suppose is the challenge of making a stream-of-conciousness take on the dreamstates of life, cinema, and art. The use of rotoscope throughout the film makes it seem like a  dream-state of the movie 'Slacker'.  For those who dismiss it simply as a hashing of 'Philosophy 101' concepts or a forum for Generation  X rants, they are missing the point entirely. At its best, Waking Life is a compelling call to action for the re-awakening of the collective and individual senses of wonder and imagination that have been bastardized by the market-culture.  If its guilty of being a little too gimmicky, its completely redeemed by providing a challenge to the audience, art, and the cinematic medium.
