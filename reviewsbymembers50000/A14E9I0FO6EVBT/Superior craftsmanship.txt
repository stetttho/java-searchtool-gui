 Ross' handling of figures tends to be a double-edged sword. On one hand, his craftsmanship is superior and his compositions rival those of any great cinematographer's. On the other hand, the marriage of near-photorealistic technique and the superhero genre doesn't always mix well.  Its hard to think of Batman, Superman and Co. as fully-realized three dimensional forms when the works of Frank Miller,. Tim Sale, and others have allowed for the reader's imagination to fill in blanks through their less-realistic styles.  Thankfully, there's enough room within the comic medium to allow for this work to shine when its at its best. While the writing is imaginative and thought-provoking, it leaves some gaps in key areas particularly in Batman's involovment with Lex Luthor. The battle scene at the climax is where the writing and artwork truly come to form. Also interesting is the critique of contemporary culture and eenui which makes superheroes and the human population mutually disinterested in one another. That the conclusion of the novel takes place in a 'Planet Hollywood/Hard Rock' parody based on superheroes is fitting indeed. A nice sentimental trip for those wanting to revisit characters from their youth as well as an interesting take on classic characters and an often repetitive genre.
