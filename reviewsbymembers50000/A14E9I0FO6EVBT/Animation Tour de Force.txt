 Hayao Mayazaki's stunning work takes the boundaries of traditional cel animation and stretches it to a point no Western animated movie has in quite some time now. The film owes a lot to Lewis Carroll as much as it does Osama Tezuka. Chihiro is a reserved apprehensive girl who is transported to a world of large fuzzy gods and old Japan-style theme-parks turned marketplaces and bathhouses. Transformation is a large theme in the film: river gods transformed by human pollution; humans transformed into pigs; Chihiro transformed by her domineering employer into 'Sen'. Like Mayazaki's eco-fable 'Princess Mononoke', this film's Romanticism allows for morals to play through in very clever ways. Characters are more complex than first glance and each has a redeeming side no matter how grotesque. The imagery is stunning at times. Rich Mannerist color schemes with elaborate set designs unfold for the nearly flawless animation to take place in.  Having said that, the only flaw in this DVD package is the credit Disney tries to take for some of it in the Bonus Footage. As usual, the Mouse talks down to their audience in their sophmoric and superfluous explainations. English-Version Producer John Lassater comes off like a big dope that (thankfully) Mayazaki can see through. Who cares about Kirk Wise or any of the other Disney directors that had almost nothing to do with the film itself? Skip instead to the Nippon Television documentary that takes you through Studio Ghibli and the final tense months of production. This segment where the animators and staff work round the clock offers a candid view of the animation film process. The film itself transcends its Western distributor and shines as something very distinct and touching.
