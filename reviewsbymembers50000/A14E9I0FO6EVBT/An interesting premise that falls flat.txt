 Palahniuk's unique prose that first came to light in "Fight Club" seems to wear out in the first few pages of "Choke". The main character, Victor is a stand-in for Jack from "Fight Club" it seems. Same frustration with commercialism and corporate power, same working class drudgery, same quirky angst. Yet the gentrified universe that Jack reacted against that Palahniuk created in his first novel seemed plausible through its absurdity. Victor never achieves that "everyman" status that creates strong empathy from the reader. His lonliness which manifests itself in the need to be sexually compulsive and to fabricate a false sense of closure for elderly people is not done well enough to hold interest.  The book has its moments and they are usually on a chapter by chapter basis. Palahniuk's style forms a short story of sorts out of each chapter which, if taken as such, is extremely well written. However the story is not successful when each chapter is woven together. Story elements are either not taken far enough or just do not make sense. That Victor might be the Messiah or that his love interest might be from the future (a point brought up way too late for the reader to even care) never solidify and contribute to the haphazard construction of "Choke." Palahniuk clearly has something to say. If he could only mold less repetative characters and maintain that kick in the teeth that he is capable of.
