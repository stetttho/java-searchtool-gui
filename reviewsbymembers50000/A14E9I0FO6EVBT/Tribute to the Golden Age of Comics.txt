 Chabon's novel is a formidable attempt to capture the essence of the Golden Age of Comics. Indeed the world of Jack Kirby and his contemporaries, their greedy publishers, and a generally indifferent readership is captured with his well-paced prose. However, there seems to be a clash of styles when Chabon is faced with fleshing out his characters which fall into archetypes especially toward the last part of the book. His characters often fall short of the grandiose situations they are often placed in and the great  "escapes" become almost outrageous characaturish situations. The large scale of the novel serves its characters well though and makes for the most unbelievable situations to seem plausible. Chabon seems to have set out to pay tribute to the American spirit and in doing so made a highly entertaining, surprising work.
