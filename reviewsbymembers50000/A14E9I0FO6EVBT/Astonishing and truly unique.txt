 The emotional impact of this film and the means by which it achieves its portrayal of three lives in their search for meaning and how we assign meaning within spaces of time is nothing short of beautiful. Its a dramatic contrast to Western films with loaded dialogue, camera gimmicks, and superfluous music scores.  Using the humble film technique of restraint., director Tsai Ming Liang presents a narrative (and an homage to 'The 400 Blows')  that unfolds over simple 5 minute or so shots with a camera fixed into position. Perfect timing and stunning compositions contribute to making this film very aware of itself and the sequential nature of both time and film.
