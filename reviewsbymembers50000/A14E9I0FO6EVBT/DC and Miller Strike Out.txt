 Perhaps Frank Miller was unaware of how highly anticipated his sequel to DK was; perhaps he was completely aware and to prove he's moved since the first, just blew off the second. Either way the first installment to the Dark Knight is everything that its predecessor was not. Gone are the psychological asides within the main character's heads that gives the reader a sense of their anguish. Miller's Batman mythos is reduced to flat dialogue and even flatter art panels. Indeed the greatest let-down is Miller and Varley's handling of figures and colors. Gone are Varley's memorable gritty tones and in their place is art-student Photoshop Day-Glo colors. She purposely bit-maps and streaks colors to no other end but to come off as sloppy and amatuer. Its probably the worst example I've seen of digital inking since the process was made industry-standard. Miller's forms are stiff and lifeless and seem to just float in background-less voids. The story itself is the only saving grace to DK2 so far, but Alex Ross did the whole cynical-world-turned against-superheroes thing much better in "Kingdom Come". Okay, we know the world of the future will be an angst-filled mess. Miller does little to present this idea in a new way. Bats + Co. led by a perky Catgirl free some superheroes trapped and misled by the government. A government, in turn, being controlled by Lex + Co. who makes it clear to Superman + Co. that he is in charge. Miller proved to us before in his great previous works (300 / Sin City) that the world is eager to sell out. Never before has one of his works been so obviously on the other end.
