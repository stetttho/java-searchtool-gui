 Jeanette Winterson's strong command of the language combined with a concise, confident direction make Art and Lies a pleasure to read. Filled with allegory and farcical situations reminiscent of Jean Genet and William S. Borroughs she tells of a sexually ambiguous surgeon named Handel; a mentally and physically molested woman artist named Picasso; and the poet Sappho who shares a train ride with the other two. What ensues is a history of each carefully developed character and how they intertwine with the others, unbeknownst to themselves. In turn misconseptions of literature, art, sex, and poetry are placed on the slab to be dissected with each of their lives. Art, she says is not meant to reflect life; a life which cannot help but reflect our own escape from adolescence. Rather, art is a product of imagination which creates its own rules and laws. The conclusion is so satisfying I was disappointed only that Winterson's fantastic imagery and play of light, color, and depth had to come to and end.
