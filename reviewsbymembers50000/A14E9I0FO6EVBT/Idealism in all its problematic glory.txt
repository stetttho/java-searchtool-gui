 Naomi Klein's well-meaning, well-researched overview of corporate control reads well enough but follows the usual trappings of idealistic academic research. The system is flawed but her call to action is never fully realized outside of a Romantic notion that Marcos-like figures will rage against their respective machines. Branding spans across all aspects of life from art to religion to sex and books like Klein's help to bring to light the trappings of seductive market campaigns. Klein, however fails to show an economic model, contemporary or otherwise that is neither corrupt nor flawed. The book fails to feature any realistic goals about re-shaping culture that circumvent violence, destruction, and inevitably useless juvenile antics. (WTO Seattle riots were a long-deflated 'victory' for whom? The powers that be who can now easily justify 'protest zones' or the well-meaning far left activists who feel they have won some sort of battle?) A lofty goal such as this needs research like hers but with more consise arguements.
