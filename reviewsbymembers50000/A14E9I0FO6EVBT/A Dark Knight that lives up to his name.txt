 The bottom line is this book is a mess, but Miller uses that to his advantage. A scaled-back version of 'DK', Miller modified his color schemes and character designs to mimic the A.D.D. design elements of the market culture. It asks a lot for a reader to delve into Batman the Killer Cynic as Miller pens him here. Maybe that's the most frustrating part of DK2 is that the story centers around Superman and his growing realization of his being manipulated for political gains. Its great to see Miller's revised Atom, Flash, and Plastic Man as well. DK2 is not Miller's best work with the social commentary a little too blatant at times like in a scene where Batman crashes the Batmobile into a federal building and goes on a killing spree. The work stands up though on its own and in hindsight of 'DK' which was social commentary in the Reagan years. Almost thirty years later, the world has changed and -hey...Miller's Batman doesn't live in a vaccuum sitting in the Batcave waiting for some signal. Batman's call for action is Miller's own and its not to be overlooked.
