 Jed Purdy sees irony as the blight of our American time and his well-meaning but ultimately sophmoric treatise on the subject skims the surface on some subjects and downplays the importance of irony (a word which is misused throughout the book) in art and other reactionary forces.  Purdy's grandiose thesis falls apart when his targets become sitcoms and the prevelence of pop-belief. It wouldn't be so bad except the arrogance of youth and an Ivy-league education kicks in. He paints a nice picture of a West-Virginian ideal childhood and his post-'60s raising to show where he is coming from but why should the reader care? Experience and age bring if nothing else diversity. I'll wait for the sequel in which Purdy has had a chance to experiment with drugs, live in poverty and oppresion, write for 'Adbusters', intensively study art, reject his privilidge and education to go on a cross-country hitchhiking spree.  The book falls apart in the end because, ironically, it stems from the same privlidged White voice that it always has come from. Ignored is the actual source of the problem...corporate America and the market culture which has succeeded in creating the visual and sensory superflousness in the Western world.  If he were to have gone after these guns, he would probably not have had to go any further than his West Virginia backyard.
