 The really charming thing about Amelie is not the nymph-like Audrey Tautou's quiet characterization of the highly-imaginative if not self-martyring title character. Its not the stylized "magic realism" that sweeps through the film from the beginning sequences. The charm of this visually remarkable film is in its ability not to get overwhelmed in itself. Before the cynic in me wrote off the film as overly-Romanticized ennui, the script and pacing kept the film in check. The closure for each of the characters was not always a happy one and the film did not feel obligated to patronize the audience in that way nor was the "cuteness" dominating.  A great contemporary romance story and an homage to the highly sensitive.
