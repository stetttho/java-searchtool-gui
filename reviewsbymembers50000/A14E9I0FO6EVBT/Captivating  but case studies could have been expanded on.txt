 Chasin's analysis of the relationship between capitalism and civil rights movements (particularly the gay movement) is long overdue. It is intelligently researched and well-thought out. However I am not interested particularly in economic theory and at times the book feels too academic, like Chadrin just transposed her college dissertation to book format. If it had been better edited to perhaps weed out some of the more theoretical parts and if she had expanded on contemporary case studies the book would feel more readable to a non-business-oriented reader. I was disappointed that there was no mention of 'Gay Day' at Walt Disney World and how this very corporate commercial venue is a summer mecca for (often upper-middle class white male) gays across the U.S. as it seems like an ideal study for the subject. The author is to be commended however for her writing about the drawbacks of the 'mainstreaming' of the gay movement and how commercial gains are not necessarily positive ones.
