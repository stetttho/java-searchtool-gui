 'Mother Come Home' certainly deserves praise for its writing. The tragic events viewed through the eyes of a child cleverly unfold through a simple color scheme and a world that mirrors our own but stripped of detail. The lack of detail works both for and against the book. This is not the superior craftsmanship level of Chris Ware and it can't help but feel like an imitator. Toward the last part of the book, even the final tragedy feels forced. Chris Ware was able to inject empathy throughout his masterwork 'Jimmy Corrigan' and its something Hornschemeier never quite accomplishes. Its as though he felt compelled to drive the plot points to their most extreme existential end which leaves the reader feeling, well...nothing.
