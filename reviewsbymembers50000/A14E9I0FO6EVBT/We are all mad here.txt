 To view individual cels from a Tex Avery cartoon is like a brief stop into an insane asylum. Fortunately, this book is chock full of film stills from vintage MGM cartoons such as Screwy Squirrel, Red Hot Riding Hood and lesser known but just as noteworthy cartoon shorts from the Golden Age of American Animation. The text by John Canemaker is just as light as it needs to be with some helpful intros. Avery changed how directors think about pacing, sight gags, and characterization while knocking off layers of the sugar-sweet Disney-stigma and this book does a fitting job paying tribute to that.
