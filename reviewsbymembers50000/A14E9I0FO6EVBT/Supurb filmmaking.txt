 Donnie Darko is one of those rare suprising films that takes all your expectations and throws them in a blender. This whirlwind of teenage 80's schitzo-angst is a treatise on every adolescent "outsider" and their own self-discovery. It takes the idea of justifying ones existence through self-sacrifice and blows it up a hundred-fold to very unique ends. The acting (aside from Barrymore) is subtle and carried through with great care so as not to burden the audience with the state of being that these suburbanites are burdened with. Donnie himself as the center of the film (and later, the universe) is bit player to his own demise and the careful development of his coming to terms with death is like nothing I've ever seen on film. The script and pacing allow for real empathy especially in his therapy sessions where he uncovers the source of his dilemna. Sure, the film is flawed (again, Barrymore's character and some wierd plot devices) but the ride is one of the most original takes on that awkward point in each of our existences. Stunning in every way a film should be.
