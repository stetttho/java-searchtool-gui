 Barbara Ehrenreich's overview of the seemingly impulsive nature of humans to violence is a real eye-opener in that it brings points to the discussion table that academia seems to have easily dismissed. The author simply has a respect for both human psychology and geological time: two things that seem simple enough but are often overlooked by researchers.  Her research led her to link killing and war to ritual and sacrifice and how religion and the sacrificial nature of war continues to act as a legitimaizing agent pitting the proverbial "us" against "them". Using texts such as Gilgamesh, the Bible, ancient Japanese and Greek poetry and other texts she points out a common link of fear of the unknown as viewed by the ancients in beasts, women, and nature. A flaw though in her tone is that it gets a tad repetative and it seems as though she uses the old academic trick of pulling from a variety of sources to make smaller points that coincide with her overall thesis. You eventually see what she is getting act but when she goes back and forth, say from the Inquisition to the Aztecs to Aborginies in each paragraph it tends to be cumbersome. Don't overlook this one. It brings together recent texts such as 'A History of Toture' and 'Male Fantasies' with a concise passion for the subject matter.
