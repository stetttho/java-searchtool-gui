 Ware's exquisite masterwork unfolds itself with subtle, almost quiet techniques that when ran together form a concise history of an insecure middle-aged loser. This book is a perfect blend combining techinques from cinematic storyboards, existentialist literature, morality plays, and contemporary prose to form Jimmy's world which is obvious from page one that he has no control over. Its unsettling charm lies in the pseudo-academic, turn-of-the-century advertising lingo with which the world is unfolded to us. We see how Jimmy's world is sold to him, all ad-jargon and little substance:false promises from adult figures, condesending salespeople, and patronizing co-workers and siblings.  In turn, the reader is re-sold the book, and in turn the contemporary world, with cut-out activity pages laden with the same ad lingo and an early Anglo twentieth century sense of 'discovery' likened to manifest destiny. This points out interesting subtexts of consumerism, power, and spiritual void which makes Jimmy all the more a delicious read.
