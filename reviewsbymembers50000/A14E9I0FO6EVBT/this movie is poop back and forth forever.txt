 This movie is art fluff with corny dialogue and the worse kind of look-i'm-not-pretentious pretentiousness. I've heard Miranda July's sound pieces before on the Whitney Biennial 2002 CD so I was kind of prepared and a bit excited to see the film. The dialogue just fell flat in many places like when July first speaks to the shoe salesman on the sidewalk and she points out that their walk is like  a metaphor for their relationship until they die. There's a cuteness around this and much of the other ideas in the film that just stick around for their own cuteness. The consequences of everyone's actions is predictable and trite. What is presumably July's take on the art world turns out to be  not unlike many artists' take on the art world in movies of the past ten or so years. (Ghost World, Basquiat) Its a little hard to swallow given that a.) July's character's work in the film isn't really all that interesting and b.) July's own real-life success in the art world makes her take on it feel a little smug. If it were a lot less contrived it might have been interesting. As it is, its a pretty forgetable slice of 'adult' cuteness.
