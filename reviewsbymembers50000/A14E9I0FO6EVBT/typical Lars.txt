 The premise of the movie is simple enough: a young woman with a secret is being sheltered by a small secluded town. The acting and the decision to use an old stage device throughout the film do well to add to the mystery of it all (or to add a certain gimmickry to an otherwise loaded script). The writing, particularly the narrator's dialogue invokes heavy nostoglia for times past and the notion they were simpler than our own. That sentiment quickly wears off and the film begins to flounder though when good ol' Lars von Trier bring out heavy allegory that allows him to bring on his trademark misogyny and misanthropy. In fact when the absolute worst is  repeatedly happening to Nicole Kidman's character (with the not-so-subtle name of Grace) she remains forgiving almost up to the end which in true von Trier fashion only allows for worse things to come.  There's nothing very quintessentially American about the town at all and the sparse art direction only emphasizes the universality of the film's larger themes on 'arrogance'. The film works better as a morality play on Western Capitalism as a whole than on American hypocrisy. I think von Trier even saw the film's inability to hit that specific mark so he tacked-on a slide show of American shame to the tune of David Bowie's "Young American" as the end credits roll by. I wouldn't really call that particular stroke transgressive as much as it is a cheap shot.   As it was, Dogville was sufficiently dark but I was hoping that von Trier wouldn't have had to rely on his usual plot devices. Its all too easy for him to have women characters humilated over and over again to the point that it takes on a sick porn quality. By the time we see Grace in a medievalish device the contrived nature of her character begins to parody itself to the viewer's disadvantage. Trimmed down and maybe re-working the ending a bit (especially a lame interaction with Kidman and James Caan in the car) could have saved this film.
