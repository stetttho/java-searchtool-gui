 Witnessing Tim Levitch's New York unflold in his honest, artful, poetic monologues is like watching the universe spit out its greatest secrets. The city becomes a living metaphor from the grid system of the streets to the terra-cotta cornices running up a building. Even familiar landmarks such as the Empire State Building and the Crystler Building take on new personas in the eyes of Levitch. He champions a simple beauty which holds high above all else individuality which he calls a "beautiful lie".  Challenge yourself and everything you think. This is a must-see.
