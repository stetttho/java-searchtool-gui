 The Cheese Monkeys is a crack at writing a very personal manifesto using the framework of a freshman at a state art school. At his best, Kidd provokes mild enthusiasm for design and design sensabilities. Placing the story in the context of the 1950's serves to avoid him any criticism of contemporary design issues.  I believe Kidd consciously did this to avoid alienating any of his contemporaries and to avoid issues of the current oversaturation of design both visually and market-wise. On one hand, it seems like a cop out; on the other, it provides him the opportunity to critique historic graphic design figures.  His devices fail though when he actually has to flesh out his characters. The pacing and development over the course of the first half of the book almost makes it almost impossible to keep reading.  Highly amateur, esoteric writing that lacks both wit and charm and the pretense that it is all a thoroughly designed package make the Cheese Monkeys a mediocre first novel.
