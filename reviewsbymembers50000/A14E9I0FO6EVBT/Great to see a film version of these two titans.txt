 Its great to see just a hint of some of the animosity between Bats and Superman evident in comics and graphic novels. The design is sleek and the plot is well formulated (even pitting Bruce Wayne as a suitor for Lois Lane). Not a disappointent for fans of the acclaimed Batman series and the less successful Superman series.
