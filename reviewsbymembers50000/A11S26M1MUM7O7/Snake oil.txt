 This book is an example of "conspiracy medicine". This area of "alternative" belief appeals to those who always prefer to believe that there is a great secret that could save all humanity, and which is being kept from us by the Powers for their own nefarious reasons.  In this case, the conspiracy is due to the "fact" that, if we all swallowed our own weight in vitamin C daily, we could put the entire medical establishment out of business. But, although vitamin C is important for good health, it is not a miracle cure. Repeated, carefully constructed studies show that it does not prolong the lives of people with cancer. It also does not prevent the common cold. And how's this for a conspiracy theory? The Linus Pauling Institute of Medicine's largest corporate donor is Hoffman-La Roche, the pharmaceutical giant that produces most of the world's vitamin C.  (It should perhaps also be pointed out that, despite ingesting vast quantities of vitamin C for many years, Dr. Pauling died of cancer. I recommend the curious to search the archives at quackwatch.com for more information on this and other dangerous "alternative" medical beliefs.)
