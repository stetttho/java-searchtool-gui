 (...) This is the best of Burroughs's novels. Unfortunately it seems to be a forgotten masterpiece, with superficial fans tending to prefer his earlier, better-known stuff (Junkie, Naked Lunch, Queer), the stuff that's in print and more notorious than his later, finer work. I'm so glad that there's been a reprinting of this book - I would absolutely recommend it to any Burroughs fan as compulsory reading, and to anyone else who wants to read a lost 20th century masterpiece.
