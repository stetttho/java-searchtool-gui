 The P/Kids are an inconsistent band, and the strange thing is that there isn't much difference between their average tracks and their really great tracks! This is definitely one of their best, up there with Daisychain Reaction and Flower Plower, but listeners expecting their old rough-and-ready sound will be disappointed, because this is a much more "professional" presentation. But it still rocks. The opening track is surprising but immediately catchy, and 6X6 is an instant classic. Ankh and Planet Earth are another step in a different direction for the PCs, but both are rockin' and pretty funny too. My only quibbles are (a) the closing song is a depressing end to an otherwise upbeat album, and (b) the over-use of tamborine (yeah, I'm kind of a production-geek). I'd recommend this as the best CD with which to introduce the PCs to a friend with more mainstream tastes.
