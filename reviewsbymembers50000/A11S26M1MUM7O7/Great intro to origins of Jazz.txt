 This CD (and its sequel, volume 2) is a good sampling of jazz during its first decade. Included are representative tracks from the greats of the 1920s, including Louis Armstrong, Red Nichols, Bix Biederbecke & Duke Ellington, plus early tracks from Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller and the Dorsey brothers. Not all of the tracks here are great. Some of the early tracks are quite without swing, and occasionally the inadequacy of the original studio leaves the music sounding desperately thin. However, with 50 numbers to choose from, there are still a number of good tracks (my own favourite is "Paducah" by the Chocolate Dandies). The recordings have some crackle and hiss from the source disks, which is usually preferable to having the sound "cleaned" to the point where half the musical frequencies disappear. I find the "noise" of these early recordings to be very evocative of the period. (If the noise bothers you, turn down the treble. For more "oomph", turn up the bass.) If you're interested in early jazz history, or would like to hear the music that was produced in this revolutionary period, you should enjoy this comprehensive and expertly produced collection.
