 This, the original British movie, is truly great (also very funny, very scary, very prophetic) - it is archetypal cyberpunk, and was hugely influential, even outside the sci-fi/hacker/geek world. It could perhaps be described as Blade Runner meets Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The music video series that preceded it was weird and funny, the interview show (which I haven't seen) sounds intriguing (especially the William Shatner interview!), and the US series actually lived up to the movie. But - I've searched all over the internet for Max Headroom on DVD, and all I can find are choruses of people wailing "Why isn't this on DVD?"  When the big brains who own the shows actually put them out on DVD, they're going to make a mint. (Taps foot impatiently...) Meanwhile, this will do as a stop-gap. Watch and wonder.
