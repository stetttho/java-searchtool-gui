 I bought this CD because my previous copy of this symphony, recorded by the Royal Philharmonic in 1992*, had a scratch or flaw that made the last movement almost unplayable. I've a number of Point Classics CDs in my collection, because they are so cheap that, if it turns out that the piece or the performance is unsatisfactory, the loss can easily be dismissed. In fact, a number of the performances are very competent, and occasionally excellent.  However, this CD is very much below par, so as to be practically unlistenable. Some of the woodwind are distinctly out of tune, and the strings sound very rough. The conductor hurries the orchestra along with minimal subtlety, either through incompetence or embarassment. I wouldn't feel right about selling this CD on, so it is now in my wastepaper bin. Be warned.  * Conducted by Michiyoshi Inoue; ASIN: B000003VOW, or B000003VOR.
