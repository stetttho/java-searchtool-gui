 My previous theory was that Mr Scott changed his movie because he wants to be taken seriously as an Artist, (hence the over-blown, bombastic style that made Hannibal a lesser film). I was heartened to read below that this "director's" cut was actually assembled by the studio, and that there may be a more developed version that retains much of the narration. As good as this cut is, THAT'S the version I'd like to see... I think people like the version without the voiceover because it's more mysterious and arty, and it disguises that fact that Blade Runner is basically a sci-fi version of a 40's detective movie. Sure, the voiceover grates a few times, but cut that out and you STILL get the police chief saying "Talk about beauty and the beast - she's both," which is probably the worst line in the movie, and you still get the superfluous and awful dubbed dialogue in the snake shop. You also get one important piece of new footage: the unicorn dream. The problem with this insertion is (1) it is stuck seemingly at random into the middle of what was originally a smooth tracking shot with continuous soundtrack, and (2) the insert makes no sense in context and has nothing at all to do with the rest of the film...This scene would have been originally been excluded from the film because it doesn't fit the overall structure - sure, the added meaning makes some people feel deep, but on the other hand it invalidates what would otherwise be the main problem of the movie, which is Deckard's grappling with his feelings about killing creatures who might be "human". Instead it's a trick ending: "Turns out he was a robot all along!" which has nothing to do with the rest of the film. As you can tell, I have mixed feelings about this version, but of course it's still a great movie - it's Blade Runner, for God's sake! And it'll do until something even better comes along...
