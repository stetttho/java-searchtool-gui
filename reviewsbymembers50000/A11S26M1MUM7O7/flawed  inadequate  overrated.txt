 I came to this book having read many glorifications of it; it's supposed to be one of the capital-L Literary works that saves science fiction's reputation from the gutter of genre hackwork. Given this endorsement, I was disappointed. The book starts well, with an interesting character in an intriguing situation, written in excellent prose. The prose remains consistent throughout, but the novel is unable to adequately explore let alone live up to its themes. The radical effects of boosted intelligence (this being the basis of the plot) are presented in eliptical form, so that, for instance, a revolutionary play is written but we never get to read a sample of its genius; a mind-transfer machine is built, with no information given about its theory or construction; and encyclopedic knowledge of alchemy is acquired, but we see only one unexplained mystical diagram and a vaguely-described "egg" (alchemical cauldron). The narrator, we later discover, has undergone the same intelligence boost as those he observes, but there is no sign of this in his prose style or his understanding of his situation. We have to take the author's word for this change, which is hardly sufficient given its importance. The greatest disappointment is the ending, in which, without warning or foreshadowing, it is revealed that the plot we have been following is a sham, which our super-intelligent narrator failed to divine. The angst of this camp of dying geniuses, and the constant theme of alchemy, these, which seemed to constitute the story leading to a cathartic synthesis, were a shadow-play. A story about the consequences of boosted intelligence becomes a pat escape thriller, and discards what was left of its promise. This overrated novel is perfectly adequate for an enjoyable, escapist read, provided you expect nothing more.
