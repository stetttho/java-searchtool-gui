 This is a terrific compilation of hot jazz tracks from the 1920s, including a number I have never heard before. The sound has been cleaned but is still very clear and balanced. A great addition to your collection. (A word of warning: the first track is the exception to the above praise. Its sound quality is poor, as indeed is the performance itself. Also, this CD is exceptional in the output of publisher ABM (Audio Books & Music). The majority of their CDs of old jazz are of very poor sound quality.)
