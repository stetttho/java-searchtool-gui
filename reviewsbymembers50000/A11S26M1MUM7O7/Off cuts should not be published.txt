 This very short book will dissappoint all but the most blindly fanatical Burroughs fans. A series of sketches inspired by the Nourse novel of the  same name, it simply repeats well-worn themes dealt with more effectively  elsewhere in his work. It seems to be the collected results of an aborted  attempt to write a novel or screenplay, and from these insipid, lifeless  scenes it is easy to see why it was aborted. The only question is: why  display the lifeless corpse to the reading public? Methinks his manager was  behind this unwise decision$$$ For completists only.
