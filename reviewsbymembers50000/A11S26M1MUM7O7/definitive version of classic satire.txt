 How on Earth can this be explained to someone who has never encountered it before? Let's start by saying that a show like this could never be produced in America (although Futurama gets pretty close). The Hitchhiker's Guide was never meant to impress with flashy FX and future tech. It is, rather, a satirical allegory of modern life - the stupid fashions, the crass commercialism, the much-touted state-of-the-art gizmos that don't bloody work. Briefly, it is the story of Arthur Dent, who is rescued from the Earth just before it is blown up to make way for an interstellar highway. Still wearing his dressing-gown, he is forced into a series of adventures ranging from the merely humiliating to the frightening and pointless. The result is a unique comedy that mixes satire and farce, sci-fi and mock-umentary, into a memorable and funny experience. The presentation of this 6-part series in DVD format (in its uncut entirety) is ideal for the careful viewer, because there's a lot going on that can be missed on the first (or second, or third) viewing. The 2nd disc has a lot of interesting background material, although the completists might have prefered a more in-depth coverage of the radio series and the books of the same name. (Rejection of this series by hardcore fans, in favour of the radio and book versions, is somewhat pointless in that all were written (and closely supervised) by the author, and each format contains material not repeated elsewhere.)
