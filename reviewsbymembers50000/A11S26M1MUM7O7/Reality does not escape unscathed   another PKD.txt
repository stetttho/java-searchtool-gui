 Dick is often accused of: weak characters, careless prose, illogical plots. Let's get this issue out of the way at once and say that these charges are often true. In "...Electric Sheep" I was bugged by Rachael turning from innocent into conspirator between scenes, and by the potential hinted at but then dropped in Deckard's meeting with the other bounty hunter (this idea was eventually realised in the director's cut of "Blade Runner"). However, this is no reason to dismiss him immediately. It is only after reading "...Electric Sheep" that I finally "got" this writer. His books are snapshots of a mind at the point of snapping, as reality collapses all around. This is the persistant feature of his work, and goes some way to explaining his books' imbalances. His stories are obsessive nightmares that play out in his head, rather than conventional realistic narratives. The trappings of reality are present, but in distorted form (in this post-apocalyptic world all the animals are robots, and fallout is gradually rendering the population sub-normal), and, as the story progresses, reality is alarmingly invaded and undermined by dream logic (in this case the real-world appearance of a fictional religious figure). This entropic pattern, reproduced in most of his books, may be due in part to Dick's personal history of hallucination and mental disturbance, but has a wider interest to us: he shows, in allegorical form, how weak is the foundation for our faith in the world's knowableness. (The easiest introduction to Dick's work is probably "A Scanner Darkly"; for an interesting look at Dick's techniques, see the essay in Stanislaw Lem's "Microworlds")
