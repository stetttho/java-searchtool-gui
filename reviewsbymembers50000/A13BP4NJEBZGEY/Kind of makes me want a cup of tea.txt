 I didn't like the Stripes initially, but a coworker played this CD constantly at work and it won me over. Now I can listen to the entire CD. The weakest tracks are "In the Cold, Cold Night" (Sorry, Meg!), and "Ball & Bisquit" which is just too long. Sure there are songs that are longer on many CDs, but this one just is too repitious. After the first few minutes, it offers nothing new. I usually skip it, although sometimes if I'm in the mood, it's worth a listen. The intro to "Little acorns" can also get annoying with repeated listens, although the rest of the song is pretty rockin. Major thumbs up for "Seven Nation Army," and "Black Math." Most of the rest of the CD is also really good, although "Hypnotize" sounds a little too much like "Fell In Love With a Girl." Overall, probably my favorite album of 2003, although admittedly, there wasn't much competition that year. The only other truly great release was Jane's Addiction's comeback album "Strays." But that's a story for another day!
