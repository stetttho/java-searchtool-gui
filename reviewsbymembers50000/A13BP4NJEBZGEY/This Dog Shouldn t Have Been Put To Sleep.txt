 A supergroup consisting of members of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog wasn't meant to be a debut CD. It was a tribute, a one-time deal. As a much bigger fan of Soundgarden than Pearl Jam, this CD appeals to me greatly as Cornell fronts just about every song, though Vedder's vocals in Hunger Strike are actually the highlight of the album. Still, I personally think this CD is better than anything that would come from Pearl Jam (though I don't mean to mislead you-this is my opinion and mine alone. MANY would disagree). If I had to compare this album to anything, it would be Cornell's solo album Euphoria Morning. Both show a softer side to Cornell's vocals. If you're like me, you love Cornell's voice whether he's screaming or singly softly and if that's the case, you'll love this CD. If you prefer the louder side of Cornell only, maybe you should stay away. It boggles my mind that there wasn't more acclaim for this album. I've been a Soundgarden fan for a long time, and I hadn't even heard about this CD until last year. Anyway, back to the album, the first track "Say Hello 2 Heaven" was the other single from this album, and it's quite good. Other highlights include "Call Me a Dog" and "Reach Down" though there isn't really a bad track on this album, except for maybe "Wooden Jesus" and I just don't really care for that one. In any case, buy this today. If you don't have any money....well, don't steal the album....maybe steal the money to buy the album???? I'm kidding. Any readers who may be associated with the law, I kid! I kid! Except about the buying the album part. That part I meant. Seriously. I guess I could suggest a solution to the not having money thing that wouldn't be....you know, illegal. Put in some overtime. I know it'll be painful because your job sucks and your boss is always making passes at you, but trust me, this CD is worth it! Seriously.
