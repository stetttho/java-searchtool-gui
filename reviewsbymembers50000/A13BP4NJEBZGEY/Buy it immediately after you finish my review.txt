 Okay, just to get this out of the way: I'm sick of people slamming this album because it isn't "Blood Sugar Sex Magik." This CD is completely amazing, and in my opinion an equal to Blood Sugar in every possible respect. I've had this CD since shortly after it's release, and I'm still not sick of it. The radio singles are catchy, and yet not your typical pile of pop garbage. But even the songs that weren't big hits are great. I especially love "Easily." I never really watched MTV, so parden me if one of these songs I mention wasn't a hit, but I think the hits include "Around the World", "Scar Tissue", "Otherside", "Californication", and "Road Trippin'." Also AMAZING is "Parallel Universe." "Get On Top" is funky as hell, and "This Velvet Glove" is a nice song. GO BUY IT NOW.
