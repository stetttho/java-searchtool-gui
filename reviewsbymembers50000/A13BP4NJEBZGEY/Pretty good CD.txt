 I've been fortunate enough to have known about this band for time since I lived about fifteen minutes outside of Cresco while I was in High School. This album is really good, and I think everyone should give it a listen. But since this album's release, the band has gone through some tough times. I don't know exactly what happened, but somehow the band lost their record deal and drummer T.J. Krammer was either let go/fired or quit because of creative differences. At any rate, they have a new CD out that's pretty good, but it's a hard find since the band doesn't have the record deal anymore. If you are looking to buy, "All Lights Off" go ahead and do it. You won't regret it. However, consider buying their new self-titled album too. You can't get it here, but visit www.rvmonline.com and there will be a link to buy the record. It's different, but still really good. If you really like the band, they also have an older small time release entitled "Blown Out." I don't believe it's for sale anymore, but there's a site where you can download it for free. Just go to the forum on the official site and you'll find the link to Rearview Mirror source. Anyway, spread the word. This band is great, and they need your support.
