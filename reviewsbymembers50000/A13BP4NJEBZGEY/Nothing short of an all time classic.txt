 Nevermind is a classic. Still, I'm finding it difficult to write a review that can express just how truly exceptional this album is for several reasons: first, I usually list stand-out tracks in my review. This simply can't be done with Nevermind, because quite frankly, every track is a masterpiece. Second, I'm not sure what exactly you'd call this record. Is it simply a rock record? Is it a pop record? Is it simply grunge, and nothing more? The fact is this album truly rocks, but there's nothing especially alienating about it, so it's also a pop record. And of course, this album has come to define grunge itself. In the end, it probably doesn't matter. If you haven't heard any of Nirvana's music, chances are you have been dead for some time. I'd get that checked out if I were you. Anyway, if you like anything you've heard by Nirvana even remotely, I can promise you that you'll love this entire album. And don't be fooled by the negative reviews. Even a classic album isn't for everyone (is there a single record in the entire world that is universally loved because I can't think of one). Fact is, this is one of the greatest albums ever made, and the only proof I can offer is that 14 years after it's release, it's still hugely popular. I still hear kids listening to Nirvana, and the band has never left my CD player for an extended period. This is the album of the 90's and thus far, nothing to come along in the 00's can dethrone it.
