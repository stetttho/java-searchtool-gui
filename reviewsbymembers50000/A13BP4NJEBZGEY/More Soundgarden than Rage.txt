 One thing that must be said about this album is that it is an incredible display of talent. That said, not everybody is going to like it. Two bands have come together. And while Cornell may be the only one representing Soundgarden, he's also the frontman which means his influence cannot be questioned. This album is without a doubt much more similar to Soundgarden than it is to Rage Against the Machine. That's either a good thing or a bad thing depending on which band you preferred. I've never liked rap music, so for me it's a great thing. I always loved the instrumentals on the Rage albums, but Zach's rapping just didn't do it for me. So for me this album was like cutting out the fat. All that remains is goodness! If you were a big fan of the rapping (or the politics) of Rage, this album may not be for you. However, it's still worth a listen. I do know a few Rage fans who like it, though most of the fans I know preferred Soundgarden's work. And Morello's genius is still very apparent on this album. The first single "Cochise" truly sounds like a cross between the two bands, making it a superb choice to open the album. "Like A Stone" is something to behold, though I liked it more when it hadn't become a single and it was like my buried treasure that no one else knew about. While the other singles ("Show Me How to Live" and "I am the Highway") are both really excellent, I think perhaps my favorite song on the album is "Shadow on the Sun." It seems so calm and peaceful, and then loud and powerful, accessible, yet not poppy. It's truly perfect. This album has some filler though, particularly in the latter half. Still, this is a debut album and the next one promises to be even better. Enjoy!
