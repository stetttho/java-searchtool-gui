 The reviewer on Amazon thinks the music is the star of this??? Nothing could be further from the truth. Fact is the first No Doubt album in which one gets the impression that there is no band. Just one pop singer, and background noise. Whereas their last effort had a mature theme and a lot of emotion, this album cannot come up with anything better to say than "I'm Feelin' Hella Good." Good to know. I'm giving this CD two stars to be nice, but it really isn't enjoyable at all. It sounds like it was thrown together in five minutes, and the band clearly didn't care about alienating it's older fans. If pop/dance music is your thing, by all means buy it. If you prefered the ska/rock side of No Doubt, don't bother because not a trace of it remains to be seen here.
