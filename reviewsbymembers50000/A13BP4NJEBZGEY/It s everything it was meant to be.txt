 True this collection may not have every great song the Pumpkins ever recorded, and a lot of people are complaining that some great non-radio songs don't appear, but I believe those people are missing the point of a Greatest Hits album. This album is meant for people who are casual fans of the Pumpkins, or for people who've heard little of them at all. By placing the singles on one CD, people are introduced to the greatness known as the Smashing Pumpkins. And if you look at it from that perspective, this album suceeds brilliantly. I'd heard very little of the Pumpkins before this album came out, and after having heard it, I wanted to go out and buy all their records. This is what a good GH album does. If it included every great song ever recorded by the band (it would take a lot of disks...), there'd be no point in purchasing the other albums. It's called marketing, people. Anyhow, why would a hardcore fan settle for a GH album anyway? For new listeners however, this collection includes "Bullet With Butterfly Wings", "Disarm", "Cherub Rock", "Ava Adore", "1979" and other gems that span the Pumpkin's career. It got me into the Pumpkins. Give it a listen. You won't regret it.
