 Okay, so many thrash-metal fans bash this album simply because it wasn't what they expected. Call these guys sellouts, inspired or whatever you want to. The bottom line is if you listen to this album without thinking, "man, the only good music is extremely hard" you'll probably find it's one of the best albums you've ever listened to. These days people think they need to belong to one of two extremes: the mainstream who only like what they're told to like and the underground who only like bands that get no exposure and will turn on them if they do. Why belong to either group? Judge music by what it is. "Enter Sandman" is a hard, but not heavy song that's thrilling to listen to. "The Unforgiven" is slower, but still excellent, and the same goes for "Nothing Else Matters." Other highlights include "Sad But True" and "Whever I May Roam." The only real low point is "Don't Tread On Me" which just doesn't seem to belong on this album. I've also heard complaints from former fans that the songs on this album aren't as long as the ones on previous albums. In my opinion, that's a plus. No matter how great a song is, if it goes too long it becomes boring. Short and sweet is how it should be. But you can't take my word for it or those of other listeners. As I've pointed out all throughout this review, this album is what it is. Take it or leave it.
