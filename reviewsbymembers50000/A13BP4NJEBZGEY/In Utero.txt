 This album is pretty much a five star album, but I'm giving it four because there are a couple of weak tracks. When I first heard this album, I didn't really care for it that much. The songs (with a couple of exceptions) were not ones you could hear and immediately love like those on Nevermind. However, I gave this album more than one shot (because I think a lot of music gets better with repeat listens) and found that many of the songs really grew on me. Some have held up much better over the years than anything on Nevermind. The album opens with "Serve the Servants" which is a pretty easy listen and an excellent track. It then moves on to "Scentless Apprentice" which upon first listen, seemed awful. There's just something weird about Kurt Cobain's screaming in this track. It doesn't sound like anything else I've heard. Eventually, that became part of this track's charm. "Heart Shaped Box" is the third track, and one of the album's bigger hits. It's easy to see why. One of the poppier tracks on the album, this track would have fit nicely with Nevermind. This is one of Nirvana's best singles. Over the years, I've grown tired of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" but still love this one. "Rape Me" is an anti-rape song, which everyone knows now, but at one point caused contraversy. Great song, the riff is a little too similar to the one in "Teen Spirit" though, but I think that was intentional. "Frances Farmer Shall Have Her Revenge on Seattle" is another excellent tune. I don't think it was a single, but it easily could have been. "Dumb" and "Pennyroyal Tea" are both fine tracks, though not favorites. "Milk It" and "Radio Friendly Unit Shifter" are moreless filler, as is "Very Ape." But the closing number, "All Apologies" is one of the finest songs you'll ever hear. Great lyrics by Cobain, powerful delivery. All in all is all we are.  An important album, one of the most important of the 90's, even if it ultimately never achieved quite the status of Nevemind.
