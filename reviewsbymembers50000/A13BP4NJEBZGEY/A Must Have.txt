 I can only tell you what I hear and what I hear is magical. This album is absolutely incredible. I'd place it alongside Nirvana's "In Untero", the Pumpkin's "Siamese Dream", and Soundgarden's "Superunknown" as one of the best albums of the 90's. What makes this album so special is the replay value. I can listen to it over and over again and never get tired of it. And while we've all said that about one album or another at some time, this one has been getting played to death in my CD player since 1996. Most of the time when I play an album this much I burn out on it in a couple of months. I'm not sure if I prefer this one or "40 Oz. To Freedom" though. For me, it's a tough call. But both are five stars in my book. Includes "Garden Grove", "What I Got", "Wrong Way", "Same in the End", "April 29, 1992", "Santeria", "Caress Me Down", and "Doin' Time" among others.
