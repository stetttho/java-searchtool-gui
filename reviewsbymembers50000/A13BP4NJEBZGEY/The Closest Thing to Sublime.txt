 So you've listened to all of your Sublime CDs to death. You still love it, but you want something new that gives you the same vibe. That's when you discover Slightly Stoopid, a band that upon first listen sounds like they're a lesser Sublime. You listen to "Longest Barrel Ride" a few more times however, and discover that this music grows on you more and more with each listen. Eventually, you realize that this band is similar to Sublime, but very much brings something new to the table. Sounds range from mellow ("Castles Made of Sand") to straight up punk ("Johnny Law," strangely enough the next track). You'll be amazed by this band the more you listen to this CD. Other great tracks include "Struggler", "Too Little Too Late", "Mr. Music", and "Living Dread." Well, really they're all pretty good. Also worth checking out is "Live and Direct: Acoustic Roots." It would be difficult for me to pick a favorite between the two. The band's latest release "Everything You Need" is also good, but it's a step down from the band's previous work, only because they went in a rappier direction, which frankly doesn't work as well for me. Also that one borders on over-produced, where this one has a raw quality, even if it isn't a live release.
