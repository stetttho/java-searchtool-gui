 So often I hear people bash this album. Whatever is so "terrible" about this album, I'm sorry, but I'm missing it. This is certainly different from the Pepper's other work, and I think takes a few listens to get used to, but once you do, it is sooooooo completely worth it. It may simply be that it isn't popular amongst Peppers fans to support Navarro because he isn't Fruciante. I love both, and there's nothing wrong with that! The album gets off to a good, but unexpected start with "Warped." "Aeroplane" is one of the Chili Pepper's best tracks, in my opinion. "My Friends" is the closest thing to a hit on this album, and it's pretty good. "Coffee Shop" doesn't sound like the Chili Peppers, but it's interesting. I like "Walkabout" and "Shallow Be Thy Game." And last, but not least, the great "Transcending." I love that song, and if you give it half a chance, you will too. Some hate this album, but don't let them deter you. Only you can decide.
