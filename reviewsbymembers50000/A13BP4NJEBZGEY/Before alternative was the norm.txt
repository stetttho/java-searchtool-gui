 Before alternative was the norm, there was a little band called Jane's Addiction. They had a loyal following, but were not by any means the in music of their day. I've heard Jane's compared to several bands. Some mention Zeppelin. You can definitely hear Zeppelin's influence in the guitar work at times, but not so much in the vocals. I've also heard some mention the Chili Peppers, but I don't hear that at all. All I can gather is that this idea came about because Dave Navarro was the Chili Pepper's guitarest on their underappreciated One Hot Minute, although even on that album there's little similarity to what you'd hear from Jane's. I guess it doesn't really matter who you compare them to, this is a band that can really rock. This album contains "Jane Says" which is one of the band's best known songs, but also many other gems. In their first few albums, Jane's Addiction had a tendency to really get experimental. Sometimes it pays off, other times it doesn't, but it always makes for interesting listening. Still, some people may never be able to get into a song like "Ted Just Admit It" no matter how hard they try. Others will find it an odd work of genius in it's own way. This album was released in 1989, but sounds nothing like the music of that era. This band has always had a style of their own that transcends what you'd expect from a certain time period of music. They always just sound like Jane's Addiction, and nothing else.
