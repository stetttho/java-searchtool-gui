 This album is great, especially if you love Sublime, but it isn't nearly as good as either "40 Oz" or the Self-titled. All the people giving it five stars are doing so because they love Sublime, but don't be mislead. This album isn't one you can just pop in and enjoy. It takes some getting used to, because much of it is WEIRD. My friends hate when I play this album, but for a ... like me that's just motivation to play it more. There are a few really excellent tracks on this album including "Greatest Hits" and "Boss D.J." Also worth note are "S.T.P." and "All You Need." And I can't forget "Mary." The Raleigh tracks are funny the first time you hear them, but they get old. There are a couple not-so-great tracks on this album, namely "Cisco Kid" which is just a bad sample, and "I Don't Care Too Much For Reggae Dub" which I just don't care much for. Overall, a highly enjoyable album that just takes some getting used to. Start with the other albums though. ...
