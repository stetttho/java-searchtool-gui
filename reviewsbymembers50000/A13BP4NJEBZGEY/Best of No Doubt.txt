 My favorite No Doubt album, and one of my favorite albums of all time, which speaks well for this album because I had always considered No Doubt just another pop band with no real talent. I gave this a listen because I'm a fan of Sublime, and had some people on the Internet tell me to give it a chance. I'm glad I did. Aside from the songs you'll hear on the radio ("Just A Girl", "Spiderweb", "Don't Speak") this album includes many gems such as "Different People", "Sixteen", "Sunday Morning" and "The Climb." This is the definitive No Doubt album, and if anyone is looking into buying anything from them this is it. Whereas "Return of Saturn" is especially mature and beyond some listeners ability to relate and "Rock Steady" is especially immature and practically an insult to the band's talent, this one is just where it should be. Somewhat playful and easy to listen to, but also expresive and interesting. Plus there's a great ska feel to this album that is somewhat lost in the others. This one is a must have.
