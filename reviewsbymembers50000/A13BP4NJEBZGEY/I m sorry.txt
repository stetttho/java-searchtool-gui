 First, let me just say that I normally don't review albums by bands I don't like. This is because these reviews are meant to help people in determining if an album is for them or not, and thus, the opinion of someone opposed to the band isn't going to be helpful.  Still, I just have to critisize this album. I'm sick of hearing the singles on the radio, and in people's CD players. This madness must be stopped!! Okay, I'll take a breath. This album sounds EXACTLY like Hybrid Theory. Sadly, it sounds even more like their first album than their remake of their first album did. I have to give this band credit for releasing the same songs over and over again with different names, and somehow selling records. You know there's no real talent when a band releases a remix record immediately following their debut and then creates an exact copy of said album and slaps a different name on it.  If you like Linkin Park, that's fine. Buy one of their albums. But please don't buy more than one, because one is all you need because there's no difference between the albums. By buying multiple versions of the same thing, you're only encouraging them to produce more of the exact same garbage. Demand more! Oh, and by the way, yes I noticed that I repeated myself many times in this review. I basically said the same thing over and over again. I couldn't quite get away with blatantly repeating myself, I guess. Funny how it works for some people.
