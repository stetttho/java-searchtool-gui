 And while I liked the first album a lot, I don't mean that as a compliment. This album sounds so much like his first album that buying it is simply unnecessary. I already had a copy of Brushfire Fairytales and I want my money back!! There are generally two types of complaints that follow the release of an artist's sophomore CD: (1) It's too different! I wanted it to be like the first CD or (2) It's too similar. I want to see some musical growth! These kind of complaints make it difficult for an artist to produce something that's not going to earn some critism. But some artists slightly alter their formula, but make it similar enough to be accessible. Not true with Johnson. He didn't change his sound at all. And the second time around, it's just not as entertaining. Although I like "Times Like These," for the most part I want to fall asleep listening to this, and normally mellow music makes me feel all right. Go with Brushfire instead, or try listening to Dispatch's masterpiece "Bang Bang."
