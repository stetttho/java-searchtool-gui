 What a great show! Too bad it didn't last. I'm really surprised they bothered to release this show on DVD since it was never very popular and has been off the air for many years now. I'm really glad they did though! Now I can forever cherish the zaniness of Jay's father, the bitchiness of his ex-wife, the constant smoking and coughing of Doris, and the fat, witty antics of Jay Sherman. If you liked the show, I'd say get the DVD while you can. I'm sure it won't be returning to television any time soon, and I don't even think they're showing the reruns on Comedy Central anymore. There are also commentaries on this DVD and several other interesting features. The set is worth buying for the "clip" of Rabbi: P.I. alone!
