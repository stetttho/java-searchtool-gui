 This is the Bicentennial edition of a book that was first published in 1953 as It All Started With Columbus. In fifty five hilarious chapters, Armour has written a very funny parody of an American History textbook complete with Test Questions, Mid-Term Projects, and a Glossary of Terms.  It covers the period from Christopher Columbus to Gerald Ford. Too bad he stopped updating the book and missed the opportunity to chronicle the comic adventures of Reagan, Clinton, and the Bushes. Fortunately, our generation has Larry Gonick's Cartoon Histories which are the closest modern writings that compare to this book. Armour's style is based upon puns at which he is a master. Like Gonick, he is a Ph.D. scholar. While Gonick was a scientist, Armour got his Ph. D. from Harvard and is an historian. His approach is humorous but is well grounded. Take a look at this satiric commentary on the classic American textbook and enjoy a good laugh.
