 When John R. Neill died in 1943 after writing three Oz books, the manuscript of this book was left without illustrations and unpublished. Preserved by Neill's family for over 50 years, Eric Shanower finally  editing it and provided his own marvelous black-and-white drawings to bring  it to press.  At the time of his death, Neill had illustrated all but the  first Oz book and his illustrations have come to define the people and land  of Oz to generations of readers. Shanower's illustrations follow in Neill's  style, improving, if that is possible, on the work of the master.  The  story evolves around the theme of anger and its effects as Scraps, the  Patchwork Girl, in a fit of anger decides to run away. Upsetting many of  the people she runs into, Scraps still manages to befriend Popla, the Power  Plant, who is possibly the most unusual character in a land known for its  strange inhabitants. Popla is the strongest plant in the world and grows  alone on a windswept mountaintop. Scraps, finding a flowerpot, takes the  Power Plant, who has never left the spot where she first sprouted, on a  exciting and enjoyable journey. Together they travel on Scraps spoolicle, a  bicycle with wooden spools for wheels, and through their adventures a  lasting friendship is created that dissolves Scraps anger. Anyone whe has  ever enjoyed an Oz book will love this unique contribution to the Oz  corpus.
