 A series of 8 essays published in 1960 on Marian apparitions from Guadalupe to Fatima and beyond. The most recent sightings covered are Banneux and Beauraing from the 1930s. If you want some basic background on these earlier visits of Mary and don't mind the official Catholic version this is a very useful book.
