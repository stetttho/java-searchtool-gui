 Erma Bombeck was the best humorist of the domestic American scene. This book, focused on her best subject - mothers, is a gem. Both humorous and wise at the same time, it will give you valuable insights one minute and have you rolling with laughter the next. If you are a mother, planning to become one, or want to gain some insight into your own mother, this is the book for you. While reading this book, I heard two people quote from it. One was a radio food guru and the other was one of those heart-warming emails that someone I know decided to forward to everybody in their online address book. Read this book and you may find yourself quoting from it someday.
