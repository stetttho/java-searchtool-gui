 Having been the state's Commissioner of Agriculture for 36 years, Jim Graham knows more about North Carolina food than anyone else. During these past 36 years the state has moved from a land of small family farms to one dominated by industrial and technologically advanced cities. This gave Mr. Graham the idea of publishing a book of recipes of the cherished country cooking from the state's past for the NC urban dwellers of today.  The recipes were gathered from all over the state by NC Cooperative Extension and the NC Farm Bureau as a tribute to this great man and his contribution to the rural residents of North Carolina. The true authors are the residents of the state who submitted their favorite recipes. Jim Graham wrote the Introduction and submitted one recipe to the anthology, his mom's Brunswick Stew. Many of the entries include notes by the contributors that give them a truly personal touch. Proceeds from the book's sales go to the James A. Graham Scholars Endowment at N.C. State University. If you have one North Carolina cookbook in your kitchen, this should be it. Now that the small towns of the state are hosts to fast food restaurants, and rural citizens spend hours commuting to city jobs, this book will long preserve a fading heritage for future generations. It is a labor of love to be cherished by anyone who loves North Carolina foods.
