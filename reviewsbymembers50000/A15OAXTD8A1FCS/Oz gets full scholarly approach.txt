 This collection of nine essays published by the Childrens Literature Association takes a scholarly approach to L. Frank Baums popular childrens books and the 1939 MGM movie. Written primarily by college and university professors in English, Literature, History, and Film, these well-written and insightful articles provide detailed analysis of the Oz phenomena in American culture.  The book divides the essays into three sections: Origins of Oz; The World of Oz; and, Oz On Stage And Screen. There is also an Introductory review article which looks back on the first one hundred years of Oz criticism called Analyzing Oz: The First Hundred Years.  The essays look at Baums frontier days in South Dakota, the origins of his vegetable characters, the meanings of home and humor in Baums works, different schools of Ozian criticism, Fred Stones portrayal of the Scarecrow, Baum as the first filmaker of Oz, and Dorothy as a cultural icon. The text is illustrated with black and white drawings and pictures and each essay has a bibliography of sources.  Reading criticism of Baum and Oz is no where near as much fun as reading the original works themselves. But after you have read Baums writings, it is useful to see how historians and academics view the cultural phenomenon that is Oz.
