 This is one book to take with you if you are visiting the Czech Republic  and don't speak the language. The introductory material is a great guide to  pronunciation and grammar. The major part of the book is an English-Czech,  Czech-English phrasebook and dictionary in alphabetic order which is  excellent. Pronunciation guides follow most words and are well done.  Dialogues and Feature Boxes throughout this section are wonderful. I didn't  get fluent enough to make much use of the dialogues, but the Feature Boxes  were a great help in understanding an unfamiliar culture. I went through  the book reading them all to get a quick overview of Czech customs and  found it extremely helpful. There is also a large Menu Reader in the back  to help with eating out. Don't leave for Prague without it.
