 Faithfull follows the life of Marianne Faithfull from the mid-60s London rock scene through the 1980's punk scene. She tells her side of her love  affairs with Brian Jones, Keith Richards and Mick Jagger. Each of them are  portrayed with sincerity and honesty. You can feel the love she had for  each of them in her descriptions of their times together. Her descent into  years of drug addiction takes up most of the book. To hear her description  of it it is surprising that she survived. So it is a miracle that she has  been able to live to tell the tale so well. There is a wonderful account of  her comeback musical career in the 80s. The book is full of the famous sex,  drugs and rock n roll of the period. Yet Faithfull doesn't dwell on the  details of any of these three. I came away with the image of a strong woman  who talks honestly and directly of a life that took a sad turn into drug  addiction.
