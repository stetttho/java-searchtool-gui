 Bill Cosby brings his talent for humor to this series of essays on the father's role in raising children. Starting with the initial desire to have children, and following the child-rearing process to the eventual hope of the "empty nest," Cosby takes us on a humorous trip through his experiences parenting his five children. Underlying the humor is his positive approach to parenting that will be a welcome support to both fathers and mothers. He models the flexibility and sense of humor needed for successful parenting, as well as the loving closeness with both spouse and children essential to a happy family. An Introduction and Afterword by a child psychiatrist points out the fatherhood essentials humorously treated by Cosby in the text.  I read this with Motherhood by Erma Bombeck and I can highly recommend them both to stressed-out parents looking for a grasp on parental sanity in hard times.
