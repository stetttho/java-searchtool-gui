 This is an outstanding book in the classic Oz style with Dorothy, the Cowardly Lion and the Scarecrow going on an adventure. Along the way they meet Knot Boy, a living doll made of wood, and Princess Trinkarinkarina,  who feels she has outgrown her childhood friend/toy.  Of course there is  excitement and danger as they explore under, over and through the Secret  Island of Oz. Eric Shanower is at his best in the delightful and  outstanding drawings, beautifully colored, that bring this graphic novel to  life. A lasting treasure that never gets boring.
