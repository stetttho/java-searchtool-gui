 A wonderful documetary on the life and music of Klaus Nomi. A blend of interviews, rare footage and photographs brings this unusual singer back into the limelight for one more song. I brought my teenage daughters to see this film and they were enthralled by this non-conventional artist. Sadly, his life and so many others were cut short by the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s.
