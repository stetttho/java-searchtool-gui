 Although this book is already eight years old, it is a new favorite to me since I just bought it. Being a vegetarian, until I found this book, my experience with Cajun cooking has been limited to an occasional Red Beans and Rice. Now I am happily preparing Jambalaya, Courtbollion,and Gumbos that are vegan and low in fat.  Never having been pleased before with recipes for vegan cakes, I have to caution the reader that I haven't ventured into the dessert section at the back of the book. Some vegans may find the use of honey as a sweetener a problem and want to make substitutions. The breakfasts, main dish and side dish recipes are wonderful, and have given me the courage to read non-vegetarian Cajun recipes with an eye as to how to adapt them to my diet.
