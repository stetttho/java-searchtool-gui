 This is truly a wonderful cookbook to have for elegant vegetarian cooking. It is for ovo-lacto vegetarians and the emphasis is on fancy dishes and exotic ingredients. A wonderful book to find recipes for entertaining or special events, but I found it a little difficult for the routine three meals a day. Throughout the book are sidebars on ingredients and techniques that make this book entertaining and educational. The author's introductions to the recipes also help bring each one down to a personal experience. A great cookbook for ovo-lacto fancy dining.
