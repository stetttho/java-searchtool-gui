 Rome is the second book of a trilogy that started with Lourdes and concludes with Paris. Often called the Three Cities trilogy, the books could also be called Faith, Hope, and Charity. Rome picks up the story of a  disillusioned priest as he goes to Rome to defend his book which is to be  placed on the Index of Prohibited Books. The story explores his hope for a  new Christianity that will meet the needs of modern society and his  confrontation with a religious organization unable to change with the  times. Zola's critical description of Papal bureaucracy will not endear  this work to devout Catholics, but his description of the inner workings of  the Vatican is informative and fascinating.
