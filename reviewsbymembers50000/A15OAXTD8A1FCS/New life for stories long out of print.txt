 Jack Snow wrote horror stories and Oz books in the 1940s and 1950s. This collection brings together seven of his previously released horror works and an Oz story that has never been published before. Included is a two-page Afterword on the life of the author. This is a good collection for fans of the horror magazines of the 40s, like Weird Tales. At his best, Jack Snow has a style reminiscent of H. P. Lovecraft. The illustrations by Eric Shanower are wonderful. They capture the horror style of the 1940s very well. My favorite stories are Midnight, The Dimension Of Terror, Seed, and Murder In Oz. The stories: Midnight - A chilling tale of a spell gone terribly wrong. The Dimension of Terror - A new way for a honeymoon to go bad. The Rope - What happens to the people who climb the rope and disappear in the Indian Rope Trick? Seed - A beautiful African explorer returns from the darkest jungle with a strange wasting disease. The Super Alkaloid - A scientist develops the ultimate [chemical] for getting high with no bad side effects... Or are there? Second Childhood - A childhood imaginary playmate returns to an elderly woman with startling results. The Penhale Broadcast - At midnight, singing is heard at the grave of a dead singer. Has her voice come back? Can a radio station broadcast it around the world? Afterword - A short biography of Jack Snow by David Maxine. A Murder in Oz - It is impossible to [end your life] in the fairlyland of Oz. So why is Ozma, the fairy ruler of Oz, dead?
