 I was all set to dislike this mystery that matches up a retired Sherlock Holmes with a 15 year old orphan girl. However the book, told from the point of view of the young Mary Russell, is totally captivating. I have fallen in love with this odd couple team of detectives. The author, Laurie King, does a wonderful job of showing the developing relationship between these two brilliant people separated by a generation and gender, and at the same time tells a great detective story. I look forward to more books in this series.
