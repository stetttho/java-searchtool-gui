 The story of 16 Carmelite nuns guillotined during the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution. Olga Marx's 1933 translation does not hold up well to the passage of time making the book less accessible to the modern  reader. A fine, but one-sided, portrayal of the nuns' story, their  motivation, and faith. Interesting use of a fictional character, the nun  Blanche, to contrast the fear an average person would feel in this  situation with the conviction and courage of these historical martyrs.
