 This 15th annual edition of Uncle John's Bathroom Reader is actually a combination of two previously published books: Uncle John's Great Big Bathroom Reader & Uncle John's Ultimate Bathroom Reader. This allows the Bathroom Readers' Institute (BRI) to deliver 768 pages of little known facts, pop culture tidbits, weird news items, and intriguing origins of everyday things. Articles in the text are not arranged in any particular order so an eight page Contents section at the front of the book is a great guide to your reading pleasure. Thirty three subject categories are used to group the articles which are then subdivided by length. Short articles are one page long. Medium ones are two pages. Long articles are either three or four pages, and Extended articles can run as long as eight pages. Two articles are so long they are broken into several Long parts. One on the history of Miss America is seven parts long, and the World's Tallest Buildings has eight parts. Some of the articles in the book are brainteasers, puzzles, or quizzes. The answers to these are grouped together on the last eleven pages of the book. There is a footnote on each page that contains an interesting fact. E.g.: On page 347 we are told that the shortest performance to win an Oscar was Anthony Quinn's 8 minutes as Gauguin in the movie Lust For Life. Every U.S. president with a beard  was a Republican is on page 399. On page 605 the note states that King Louis XV bathed just three time sin his entire life. The BRI claims to gather the most interesting and little-known facts from many sources and they encourage readers to suggest additions to future volumes. Perfect for the bathroom, this book would also go well on a nightstand, but is too heavy for your backpack. A joy to read.
