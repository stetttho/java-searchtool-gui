 Fascism and Nazism have always seemed so horrific to me that I have put off learning about them. I picked up this book to get past that. It is a brief introduction to European and Japanese fascism that covers the basic history, philosophy, and politics of fascism in the 20th century. The stark black-and-white illustrations by Litza Jansz bring the book to life and are well integrated into Stuart Hood's text. The book covers the origins of fascism in the 19th century through to the re-emergence of neo-fascism at the dawn of the 21st century. This is a well-done entry in the Introducing series and recommended as a first book on the topic.
