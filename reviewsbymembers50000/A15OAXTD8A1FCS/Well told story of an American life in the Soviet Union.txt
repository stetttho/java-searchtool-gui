 Mary Halasz is an American woman who has spent the last 63 years in the small western Ukraine city of Uzhhorod. Her Hungarian parents moved with the infant Mary from newly-formed Czechoslovakia to Trenton, New Jersey in 1921. While growing up she visited Uzhhorod with her mother a couple of times. On one of these visits she met her future husband and started a correspondence.  She moved to Uzhhorod in 1938 on the eve of World War II to marry the Hungarian man she had fallen in love with. Mary had two children and lived through World War II, the Holocaust, the transfer of Uzhhorod to Soviet Ukraine and her husband's imprisonment in the Siberian Gulags. She is kept apart from her American family by Soviet bureaucracy until her mother is finally allowed to visit in 1962.  The story of her life will give American readers a very accessible point of view on the history and society of the Soviet Union and western Ukraine. Her experiences as a single parent in a small regional capital in the Carpathian Mountains will be of interest to students of women's studies, Soviet history, and Ukrainian life.  My parents are from a small town just outside Uzhhorod and I have visited the city four times. I found her story to reflect the charm and mystery of this remote corner of the world very accurately and completely.
