 Blue Angel tells the story of a creative writing class at a small private college through the point of view of Ted Swenson, a middle-aged professor. He got his job 20 years earlier on the basis of two successful novels. The deadly routine of academic life, however, has drained him of any remaining creative ability. Now, as his own daughter has left home to go to college, he becomes infatuated with the creative talent of Angela Argo, a pierced and tatooed student, who he feels has a rare gift for writing. While the campus struggles with the concept of sexual harrassment between students and their teachers, we follow the thoughts of Professor Swenson as he and Angela interact in a drama that could ruin his family and his career. The point of view approach makes the story intriguing to read as we see the events play out in Ted's mind. However, the ending is limited by his own developing understanding of what has actually happened to him. Francine Prose is excellent at portraying the world as seen through the eyes of a middle aged married man going through a mid-life crisis.
