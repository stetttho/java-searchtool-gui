 The emphasis in this book is good nutrition with a vegan approach. The author teaches a whole type of cooking based on whole foods, dairy & egg substitutes, texturized vegetable protein (TVP), and a low-fat diet. I found the recipes simple and rewarding. This is a really good book to use as a main source of recipes for a vegan household. Each recipe provides calorie, fiber, sodium, protein, fat, and cholesterol analysis for people on restricted diets. A 20-page section at the end of the book on General Nutritional Information is useful for basic information. This is followed by a Glossary of Ingredients and Remedies which will explain some of the more exotic vegan foods to the uninitiated.
