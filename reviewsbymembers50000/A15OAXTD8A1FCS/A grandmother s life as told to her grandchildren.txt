 This is the autobiography of an East European Jewess who lived through the Holocaust in a small Transcarpathian city called Uzhorod. She does not experience life in a concentration camp or a prison, but is hidden by a Ukrainian family who tries to convert her. After the war she moved to Canada and then the USA with her husband and child.The story is told as if she is writing her memoirs to her two grandchildren. This adds a warm and personal touch to the story. The book is illustrated with eleven black-and-white photographs of family members. This is a moving tale of good people living simple good lives in exceedingly difficult times and surviving. It is a joy to read. Recommended for Holocaust scholars and those interested in the history of Transcarpathia.
