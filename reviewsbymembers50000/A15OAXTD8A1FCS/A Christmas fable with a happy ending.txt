 Written at the end of the 19th Century, this short inspirational fable tells the tale of a fourth wise man, or Magi, who, like his three colleagues, bears gifts in search of the baby Jesus.  The back flap of my edition states:  His purpose was the highest -- to find the King. With much torture of soul, he turned aside time after time to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to heal the sick, to comfort the captive. In one last impulse of love, he denies to himself his great desire, Then wonder of wonders, and joy of joys, he finds that his great desire is accomplished in this very denial. This story has the happiest ending that any story could ever have, a story and an ending that can become true in the lives of every man and woman.  The language is a bit formal and the moral of charity to strangers is basic. Yet there is a charm and wonder to this simple story that makes it an enduring classic. I particularly like the beginning where the practice of Zoroastrianism is described.
