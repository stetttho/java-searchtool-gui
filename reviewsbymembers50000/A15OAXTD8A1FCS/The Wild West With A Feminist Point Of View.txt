 Unlike mystery writer Nevada Barr's other novels, her first novel Bittersweet is a  historic novel set in the 1870s United States. I fell in love with the two heroines, Imogene, a teacher, and Sarah, her student, who ends up in a loveless and brutal marriage. They love each other and are persecuted by narrow-minded people who claim their love is unnatural and sinful. This hostility forces them to bond together, to hide their true feelings, and to move from place to place. The author does a great job of presenting this relationship in the context of the 19th Century, and yet provides a deeper look into the daily lives of these women than would be possible from historic sources of the time.  Truly an inspiring story of the power of love and the strength that comes from a loving relationship.
