 This is an amusing look at adolescent sexuality from an age before birth control, the Sexual Revolution, and AIDS.  In this 1962 satire a group of five girls at a British boarding school decide to do something about their sexual inexperience. One of the girls, having read a sociological study of prostitution, suggests to the others that a more structured approach is needed. So they start a business of satisfying the needs of the students at the boys school down the road. They call themselves The Syndicate, and their business they name The Passion Flower Hotel. Their mottos are: "The Syndicate Will Meet Your Needs," and "Actions Speak Louder Than Words." They develop a list of charges based on three categories of services: Vision Only, Touch, and Nothing Barred. Business is thriving until the school starts to get wind of their activities. Will they "go all the way?" Will they get caught?  Rosalind Erskine was actually Roger Erskine Longrigg, an author who wrote novels under other pseuonyms as well as his own name.
