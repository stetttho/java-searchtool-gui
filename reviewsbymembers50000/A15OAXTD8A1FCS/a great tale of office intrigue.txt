 This is a book told from the point of view of Vig Morgan, a young woman working at a popular magazine called Fashionista in NYC. She is a wonderfully real and engaging character who can see the foibles of the people around her and even has a healthy view of her own strengths and faults.  At the time of the events in the book she is an assistant editor and has been at the job for five years. Her original awe has been replaced by a cynicism for the trivial nature of the formulaic output of the magazine. She seeks a better life but is afraid to leave the safe comfort of the known.  One day she gets invited to take part in an office plot to overthrow the editor-in-chief. Her involvement in the plot takes her outside her comfortable shell and she metamorphises and grows into a whole new level of professional and personal life. This is a well-crafted and tightly plotted work with great characters, lots of humor, and a light-hearted perspective on life. Vig Morgan is a bright, witty and engaging character who tells a great tale of office intrigue.
