 This book publishes the works of an exhibit held to celebrate the first 50  years of Polaroid photography. The works are from the Polaroid Collection  that was started by Edwin Land to involve professional photographers in the  development of his technology. Eventually this collaboration developed into  a formal collection. This book gives us a wonderful glimpse of the great  works that have been created using this medium. The photographs are  arranged by decade which allows the reader to see the development in  technique and technology.  Each picture is accompanied by the name of the  photographer, their country, the title of the work,the date, and the type  of film used. The only thing I felt was missing was a some description of  the works by either the photographers or the editors.
