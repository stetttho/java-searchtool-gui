 This is a sumptuous portfolio on Islam based on the principle of a picture being worth a thousand words. The book captures the complexity of Islam by looking at the world of Islam in four geographic chapters: North & West Africa, Near & Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.  The photographer has a great eye for color and character. He captures color in backgrounds to set off the rich detail of his pictures. The character is revealed in his portraits of the Islamic people. From children to the elderly, and even in the eyes of the women behind their veils, his camera searches for and finds the character of the people he photographs. Some of the landscapes have a graininess that detracts from their composition, but this does not detract form the overall work. There is a five page Introduction by Robin Ostle that provides a general background on Islam. Also each chapter starts with a brief half-page discussion of the particular aspects of Islam in the region. Sadly, the author doesn't have a chapter on Islam in the West.  The book will be a welcome addition to any Islamic cultural collection. It is a visual treat for any Westerners wanting a good book that goes beyond the simple stereotypes of Islam.
