 Bill Peet is a wonderful children's book author and Kermit The Hermit is a great example of his work. It is a 1965 story about a Hermit Crab who starts out the story as a selfish shellfish. Through an act of human kindness, he learns the emptiness of a self-centered life. Kermit devotes himself to repaying the favor and finds satisfaction in doing for others. The book is a long rhyming poem with delightful color illustrations surrounding the text. This is a story that children and those who read to them are sure to enjoy.
