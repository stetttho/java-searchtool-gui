 Written almost 15 years ago, this is, though dated, still a very funny book. Of course none of the humor inherent in travelling post 9/11 could be included or even conceived of, which makes this book a prime target for a second edition. Also, much of the fun Mr. Barry has with the different European currencies and their value is now history with the appearance of the Euro.  All this said, it is surprising how little the travel experience, and the insane humor if it, has changed in the past 15 years. His state-by-state and country-by-country mini-guides, as well as his general travel advice,  contain some great insights. I read this book while waiting in airports and on airplanes during a business trip, a perfect setting for this type of literature. It made me very happy that I wasn't travelling with any expectation of getting pleasure from the experience.
