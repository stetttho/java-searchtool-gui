 Just finished Miss Loneleyhearts, a wonderful 1930s parable of the American Dream gone wrong. Written in 1933 during the Great Depression, it is a gritty look at the hopelessness of the average person looking for meaning in a materialistic world. Although West is the son of Jewish immigrants, he writes convincingly of the Christian answer to hopelessness, faith in God. Wonderful characters portrayed in a Noir-ish style reminiscent of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler deal with the big question of the Meaning of Life yet find no easy answers.  The Day of the Locust is much more fully realized than Miss Lonelyhearts. If Miss Lonelyhearts is a parable, The Day of the Locust is a novel. Characters and plot are more developed and West spends more time developing the setting, which is a bleak mid-century Hollywood.  Tod Hackett is a Yale graduate who has been hired to work for a Hollywood studio as a set and costume designer. He falls in love with Faye Greener, a woman who seems incapable of love, but knows how to use her beauty. Sadly, she lacks the talent to achieve her goal as an actress. Tod is just one of the men drawn to Faye's charm. There is a fast-talking midget, a slow talking cowboy, a Mexican who raises fighting roosters, and a lonely retired motel clerk. The novel is more about the dark side of the Hollywood of dreams. West uses his characters to paint a bleak and lonely view of a city of lost angels driven by hope.
