 I found this book to be surprisingly enjoyable. With simple black and white illustrations and a humorous first person voice, the author outlines her attempts to develop loving relationships with the various men in her life. Starting when she was 15 in 1950, we see her grow and develop, but never quite connect. Yet she never looses her sense of humor. We get to laugh and cry along with her and, hopefully, the reader will come away with a better understanding of male-female relationships as I did.
