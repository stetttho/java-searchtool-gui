 Paris is the third volume of the Three Cities trilogy that began with Lourdes and continued with Rome. Published in 1898, Paris is Zola's summation of the 19th Century and his predictions and hopes for the 20th  Century. In this work Zola gives a splendid portrayal of social life in  Paris at the end of the century. He takes us into the lives of men and  women of the upper classes, the working class, and even revolutionary  Anarchists. This work is of particular interest to readers today who face  the future of a new Milennium since Zola looks at the accomplishments of  his century and projects his hopes for a new century ruled by Reason and  Justice. We can see how we of the 20th Century have failed and succeeded in  bringing Zola's vision of the future to life. Zola spent his career  portraying the 19th Century France through the lives of his characters. In  this final work of the Century, he uses his story telling powers to create  a portrait of the time through the lives of his characters.
