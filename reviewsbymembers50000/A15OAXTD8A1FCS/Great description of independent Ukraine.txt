 From the Carpathian Mountains to the Black Sea, a great description of independent Ukraine. Ania Savage has written a wonderful book describing her journey to Ukraine during the time Ukraine was gaining its independence  from Russia. The story of her family fleeing Russian persecution when she  was six years old and her growing up in the USA with her mother's fond  memories of home adds depth to her visit to the towns of her youth. Her  description of her visits to both Western and Eastern Ukraine gives the  reader a great sense of the cultural and geographic differences in this  large Eastern European country. She works in a urban university and a rural  school and her descriptions of the people she meets are respectful but  insightful. She provides a lot of historic background to the places she  visits and her bibliography in the back of the book is a valuable resource  for further reading. This is a great book to read if you want to find out  about Ukraine at the moment this great country gained its independence. It  is a shame that almost eight years have passed between the events described  in the book and its publication. The last chapter tries to bring the reader  up to date, but it is only able to update us on the characters. It only  briefly covers events in the last eight years of Ukrainian democracy and  left me yearning for more.
