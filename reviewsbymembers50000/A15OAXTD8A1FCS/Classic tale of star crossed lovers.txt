 This classic American poem is a great story about French Canadian newly-weds, Evangeline and Gabriel, caught up in a tragic moment of history. On the day of their wedding in 1755 in Nova Scotia, all the French men are summoned together by the commander of the British troops. They are told that all their lands, dwellings, and animals are forfeited to the crown and that they will be transported to other lands. The villages and farms are burned. The people are loaded onto ships. Evangeline and Gabriel are separated onto different ships. They are scattered throughout the continent in what is called by French Canadians "le grand derangement." Evangeline searches endlessly for Gabriel hoping to renew their lives together. The history is true; the lovers are legendary. This monstrous crime of history is brought to life wonderfully by relating it through the lives of separated young lovers.  The poem is written in unrhymed hexameter which gives it a timeless appeal. It almost reads like a short story rather than a 19th century poem. I got interested in this story after visiting Nova Scotia this summer and meeting the French Canadians who live there. After learning their sad history, I wanted to read this book.  This edition has a 31 page Introduction by C. Bruce Ferguson that recounts the historic events portrayed and the story of how Longfellow came to write about them.  It also explores the historicity of the main characters who have become legends on their own. There are 12 pages of black and white illustrations from books and movies which help to bring the setting and characters to life. This is a wonderful edition of a classic of American literature and is highly recommended.
