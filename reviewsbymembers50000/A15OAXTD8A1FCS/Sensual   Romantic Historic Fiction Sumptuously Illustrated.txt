 Humanoids is a French publisher and they have taken a 19th century erotic novel by Pierre Louys and divided it into four Books, each illustrated by a different artist. In Book One Demetrios, a famous sculptor of ancient Alexandria, met and was smitten by Chrysis, a temple prostitute he met. She challenges him to commit three specific crimes to win her love. As he ponders the situation the next day, we see him struggle between his emotions and his reason as he faces his challenging tasks. The overpowering desire is strong and he seeks to understand its hold over him.  In Book Two the illustrator is Georges Bess. He is an excellent choice and his eighteen full-page color illustrations are exceptional at setting the mood for the sensual nature of the text. All are of women in various stages of arousal and done in shades of red and saffron.  Unlike Manara?s illustrations for Book One most of these do not illustrate particular scenes in the book, but rather illustrate the time period and the costume of ancient Alexandria. Louys? writing in this English translation from the 1920s captures well the pagan sensuality he wants to portray. The Bess illustrations compliment the text and make this volume of the series a success.
