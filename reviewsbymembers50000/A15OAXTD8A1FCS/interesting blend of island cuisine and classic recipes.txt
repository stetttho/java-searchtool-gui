 Being a vegetarian cook, I have very special needs when I look at cookbooks. This book is not a favorite of mine. If it had better vegetarian recipes i would have rated it higher. The author does have a 2 page section on Suggestions For Vegetarian Menus, but she basically says that a strict vegetarian diet "gives little scope for planning meals."  However, for someone seeking some authentic Caribbean recipes, this book may be just the thing. Also, the book is filled with lots of basic recipes like hot cocoa, waffles, and white bread. Like most island cuisines there are lots of recipes for fish and chicken, and there are lots of dishes that rely on tropical fruits and vegetables. I have found one recipe so far that I am enjoying called Pineapple Drink. I love pineapple but seldom buy it because it feels so wasteful to trim so much of the pineapple. This recipe males use of the pineapple trimmings and turns them into a refreshing beverage. It has changed my attitude towards buying pineapples. Here it is: Pineapple Drink Ingrdients: peelings from one pineapple plus two sliced of the fruit small piece of dried orange peel 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg a few cloves 6 cups of boiling water sugar to taste Put peelings, clove and orange peel in a jug and pour on boiling water. Cover and leave for one day. Strain and sweeten. Sprinkle in nutmeg and stir. Use at once or bottle and keep for 1 to 2 days. Serve with ice. For the two slices of fruit, I use the very top and bottom slices and I also use the core in making this beverage. Also I have found that fresh orange skin works just as well as dried.
