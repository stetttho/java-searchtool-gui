 Dave Barry uses his vast knowledge of Miama Florida to bring this comic thriller to life. A tightly plotted tale that includes homeless people, parents and their teenage children, Russian arms dealers, New Jersey hitmen, the FBI, a poisonous toad, and a herd of stray goats. In the process there is a series of attempted murders, three love stories, and a tribute to the wacky people of south Florida. This is his first attempt at writing a novel and it succeeds in being a very funny and well-crafted work. I can't wait to read his next novel.
