 Shandor tells the modern history of a section of Ukraine now known as the Zakarpatskaya Oblast. This is the fascinating story of a country that has been a part of five different nations in the 20th Century and whose people  today live in six different countries. It was a part of the Hungarian  Empire until the end of the First World War. After the war it was promised  autonomy as Subcarpathian Ruthenia, the third part of Czechoslovakia, but  this was never realized until the break-up of this country in 1938-39. Then  for three days in March of 1939 it was the independent country of  Carpatho-Ukraine, until the Hungarian Army crossed the border to reclaim  it. In 1945 the Czechs and Russians agreed to make it part of the Ukraine  without consulting its people. Shandor was the Ruthenian delegate in Prague  between the two wars and has quite a tale to tell. Occasionally, the reader  is swamped with names and details mentioned to prove Shandor's point of  view. The presentation could have been more balanced, but overall it is  fascinating reading.
