 March, 1993 - A boy is born in a Swedish hospital. Instead of cuddling the baby, the mother turns away. She doesn't want to touch it. She feels nothing but animosity towards the tiny creature. She considers suffocating it but can't stand the thought of another death. Her mind goes back in time to May when she was a school teacher in a Bosnian village.  In short, terse sentences she relives the horror of the Serb soldiers emptying the town and her life in a prison camp. Thus begins months filled with humiliation, torture, rape, and murder. The uncertainty and helplessness of the victims of "ethnic cleansing" and the selfishness that is essential to survival are related in chapters whose titles are locations and months. The book reads like a journal with each chapter being a month, but is told in the third person with occasional thoughts in the first person in italics. People and towns are reduced to initials. The Serbs are not even given initials - they are just a nameless death-dealing terror that surrounds the women of the camp.  This is a story of the horrors of war as it is experienced by women, but it also tells the tale of the courage and resilience of the human spirit. Hard to read, but important, this is a great piece of writing that will be appreciated by students of the Balkan tragedy and by those who can stand to face the stark realities of war.
