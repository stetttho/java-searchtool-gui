 Mr. Peabody's Apples is the second of five children's books written by Madonna. The story is a retelling of a 300 year old classic from the Jewish tradition of Ukraine. Set in a small American town in the 1950s, it uses a misunderstanding and rumor to show the importance of a person's good name and the ease with which it can carelessly be destroyed.   Mr. Peabody is a school teacher who is also the coach of the local little league team. One day a boy sees him take an apple from the green grocer without paying. How does the child react when he thinks this respected member of the community is a thief? How does Mr. Peabody clear his name? This is a tale that will appeal to the young at heart regardless of age.  The book is beautifully illustrated in a Depression era style by Loren Long. Full page color illustrations alternate with pages of text that are boxed in with monochrome drawings. A sumptuous treat to the eye as well as the soul.
