 Larry Gonick is famous for his cartoon approaches to education, especially his books on history and science topics. In this book he teams up with sex educator Christine DeVault. The combination produces a good introductory text on sexuality that is lots of fun to read.  Narrated by a cartoon Mother Nature and a cartoon fairy called The Etiquette Elf, the book covers reproductive biology, sexual anatomy, developmental biology, gender roles, gender identity, interpersonal communication about sex, romantic love, the sexual act, birth control, health issues, STDs, non-consensual sex, and sexual function problems. All of this is done in delightful cartoons that are clear yet not overly explicit. Although the book is cartoon in format, the information provided is professional at an introductory level. The end of the book contains two pages of further readings, a list of journals devoted to sexuality, and eight resource organizations. An index allows you to find just what you need when you need it.  This is a valuable addition to the library of anyone who is sexually active or has plans to become so. Readers who expect Gonick's humor to dominate this book may be disappointed, but people who are looking for a good introductory sex manual will be overjoyed.
