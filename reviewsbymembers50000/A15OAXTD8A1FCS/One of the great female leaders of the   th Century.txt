 Tonga is a unique place in being the only Polynesian kingdom to maintain its culture and government through the colonial period that brought down similar cultures in Hawaii and throughout the Pacific. Queen Salote adds to  this uniqueness by being the ruling queen of Tonga in the first half of the  Twentieth Century, an era dominated by male chauvenism. This story of her  life and reign provides a wonderful view into the culture and history of  this island kingdom. For papalangi (the Tongan word for people of Western  society) this is not an easy book because there is a lot of Tongan names,  geneology, and customs necessarily involved in the biography of their  queen. Yet the very things that make it difficult also make it a rewarding  book to read. What makes the book most enjoyable is the portrayal of this  marvelous woman who ruled Tonga for almost 50 years. She ruled without use  of force during a time of dissent from rival nobles and emerged one of the  most revered leaders in Tongan history. She convinced her British advisors  of her ability to rule and her island adversaries that their independence  depended on her rule. I can recommend this book without reservation to  anyone interested in women's studies, international biography, Polynesian  history, or British colonial history.
