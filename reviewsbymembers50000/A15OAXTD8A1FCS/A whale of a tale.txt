 I just finished rereading Lucky Bucky and found myself laughing throughout the text. Neill does not write as tight a story as L. Frank Baum, but he does create characters as delightful as any developed by Ruth Plumly  Thompson. Davy Jones, the wooden whale who befriends Bucky Jones and starts  him on his quest, is one of the best. As with all Oz stories, getting there  is all the fun. Bucky and Davy have a great time and so will you. Neill was  the illustrator of Oz books for 40 years and this book contains the last  views that he gave us of this magical land. If you love reading Oz books,  this one will not disappoint you. From the Volcano Bakery to the Emerald  City, go along for the ride. You won't regret it.
