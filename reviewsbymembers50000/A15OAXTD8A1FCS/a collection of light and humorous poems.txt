 This is a collection of light and humorous poems with a rhythmic and rhyming structure. Many are illustrated with simple pen and ink drawings. Some of the poems take a stand against war, but most are fairly whimsical.  One of my favorites is about a romantic meeting between Snowman Frost and Lady Thaw. Here are a couple of lines: "As their passions rose in a heat, off he melted from the seat."  now  "Snowman Frost no more will hug, she must keep him in a mug."
