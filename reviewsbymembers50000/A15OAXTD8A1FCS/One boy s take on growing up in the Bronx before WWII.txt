 As an overweight, lethargic, intellectual child with an overactive imagination, Herbie could have been an inspiration for the 1960s comic book anti-hero Herbie Popnecker. Taking one year of Herbie's life in the east Bronx of the late 1920s, Wouk portrays the adolescent perspective of life in all its timelessness. Herbie's infatuation with Lucille Glass, his struggles with the school bully, Lenny, and his encounters with the Creek Gang are all lovingly portrayed. The summer in Camp Manitou is an extremely well written part of the book. Good character development and plot help make this an enjoyable novel to read.
