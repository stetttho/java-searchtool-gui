 This reprint of an old Classics Illustrated comic book has a new section of Notes that turns this book into a study guide as well as a graphic novel. The study guide is a good introduction to anyone who wants to know more about the original Odyssey by Homer. The small size detracts from the original graphic novel with details being lost in the size reduction. Classic Golden Age of Comics style and classical literature wed into an enjoyable reading experience.
