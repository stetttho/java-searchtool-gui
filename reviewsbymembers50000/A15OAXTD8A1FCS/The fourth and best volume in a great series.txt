 In this, the fourth volume of a five volume series of graphic novels, "founded on and continuing the famous Oz stories of L. Frank Baum," Eric Shanower tells us the story of Nelanthe, one of the wood-nymphs of the  Forest of Burzee. Burzee with its wood-nymphs is one of the most magical  places ever imagined by L. Frank Baum. And Eric Shanower exceeds all his  other work to bring this forest to us in all its primordial majesty. His  artwork also breathes life into the underground kingdom of the trolls as  the trolls and the wood-nymphs go into battle over Nelanthe. When Dorothy  and the Scarecrow are drawn into the drama, they help save the day with the  help of the Wooden Sawhorse. Oz doesn't get any better than this!
