 I read this book because the author writes about his experience before and during the Holocaust. he comes from the city of Mukachevo in western Ukraine. My parents are from this region and I have a strong interest in this area and its people. His description of Jewish life in this area before the war is wonderful. This is also a well-told and powerful Holocaust memoir. He and his six siblings miraculously all survived the death camps of Auschwitz.  The majority of the book, however, is about his post-Holocaust experiences and his family life up to 1983. He was a moderately successful businessman in the United States who was involved in partnerships with his brothers. He talks about his wife and four children and his business successes and failures. These are hardly memorable topics. However, he brings such a sincere and ethical perspective to his story and makes these simple things of daily life interesting to read about. As a non-Jew, I find this book a wonderful outline of the positive ethical values of the Jewish religion as revealed in the life of one Jewish family.
