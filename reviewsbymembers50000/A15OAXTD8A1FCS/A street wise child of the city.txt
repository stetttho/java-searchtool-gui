 Jules Feiffer was a cartoonist who became famous in the 1960s for his work in New York's Village Voice and Hugh Hefner's Playboy.  This first volume of his Collected Works brings together his earliest work from 1949 and 1950 based on a child character Clifford, who predates both Peanuts and Dennis The Menace. It is a wonderful book, not only for its early form of Feiffer's distinctive humor, but also for a look at cartooning in the post-war years following WWII.  You won't find in Clifford the sharp political satire that marks Feiffer's later work. You will find a street-wise child of the city who will charm you with his antics.
