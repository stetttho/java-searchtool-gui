 Tired of self-help books that take themselves too seriously? Hate reading mindless drivel that passes itself off as serious advice? Then this is the self-help book for you!  With a delightful blend of insightful research, tongue-in-cheek sarcasm, and laugh-out-loud humor Arthur Bloch takes a wide-ranging look at self-help techniques that will keep you in stitches while providing a basic introduction to New Age thinking. In 23 brief chapters Bloch manages to introduce and poke fun at Meditation, Visualization Techniques, Spirit Guides, Chakras, Inner Child Therapy, Positive Thinking, Past Life Regression, Alternative Medicine, Shamanism, Angelic Guides, Channeling, and some techniques new to this book like Wishful Thinking, Blame-Fixing, and Positive Forgetfulness.  Even if Wishful Thinking is not your idea of the solution to your problems, the delightful humor of this book will go a long way towards giving you a happier life.
