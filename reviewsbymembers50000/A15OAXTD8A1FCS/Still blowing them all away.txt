 Hothead Paisan is not your two dimensional superhero, but superheroine she is. She boils all that is wrong with the world down to white guys who oppress everyone else. In a rage that has no equal she takes on the white male establishment with guns, grenades, chainsaws, baseball bats, and any other lethal weapon she can find. Spurred on by enormous doses of caffeine, this urban terrorist roams the city as the body count goes ever higher. Her holy rage is beautifully counterpointed by her cat Chicken, her blind friend Roz, and a deity in a table lamp that calls herself Donna Summer. These three try to bring love and peace to Hothead's tortured soul. The illustrations perfectly portray the highly emotive Hothead and her range of feelings. This second volume contains #s 10-18 of the comix and a 22 page introduction to people who don't have the first volume. But why settle for part when you can have the Complete Hothead Paisan (#s 1-21) published by Cleis Press in 1999?
