 This book is written from the point of view of an idiot savant, a person of limited intelligence who is yet extremely smart in specific areas. To capture this point of view, the author writes in a semi-literate first person. Here is a sample sentence. "My daddy, he got kilt just after I's born, so I never known him." A whole novel in this format is difficult to read. Yet once the reader adjusts to the style, the story is a very touching one of true values. The book is different from the movie in details but not in theme and both have their own charm.
