 Eric Shanower is the best contemporary narrator of Oz and a worthy heir to authorship in the body of works started and defined by L. Frank Baum and John R. Neil. In this series of graphic novels Shanower is at his best!  Others have done Oz comics with more edge and in a more contemporary style,  but none have been truer to the spirit of Oz. His color illustrations bring  the land and its characters to life as no other illustrator has ever done.   This volume introduces the Ozophile to four new enchanting inhabitants of  this magical land who are truly memorable: Valynn (the Guardian of the  Enchanted Apples), Bortag (the love-struck but inept Magician), Drox  (Bortag's friend the flying swordfish), and the Evil Witch of the South.  How these four interact with other well-known inhabitants of Oz makes for  an enchanting story.  A special added treat is an introductory essay on the  importance of Oz by the master fantasist Harlan Ellison. Get it today;  you'll love it for the rest of your life.
