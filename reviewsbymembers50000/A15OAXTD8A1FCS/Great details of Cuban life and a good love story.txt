 This is a delightfully insightful look at life in communist Cuba and also a love story between an international photojournalist and a young Cuban woman. Told in the first person from the photographer's point of view, we slowly see the complexities of Cuban life unfold as he becomes more involved with this woman and her life in Cuba. The contrasts between the needs of men and women in relationships and capitalism and communism are well presented. Although written during the early 1990s, the portrayal of life in Cuba and the Cuban people is still valid.
