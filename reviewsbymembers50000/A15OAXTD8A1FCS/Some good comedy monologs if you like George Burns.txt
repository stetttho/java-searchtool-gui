 What does a man who is 88 have to be happy about? Well at 88, George Burns finds enough to be happy about to fill a book with jokes and tongue-in-cheek advice on happiness. Don't read the book to find the secret of happiness because most of his advice is simplistic and written to get a laugh rather than to enlighten. However, if you like George Burns as a stand-up comic, then you should find plenty in this text to amuse you.  There are over 40 full-page black and white photos of George Burns with famous friends, his staff, stills from his movies and nightclub acts, and photos of him with four female models posing as either patients or nurses. These cheesecake photos are the worst part of the book. At the end of the book he names all the people, including the writers and models who helped him with it. Since everything he says is a joke, you can't count on the book as a reliable memoir, so read it only for its amusement value.
