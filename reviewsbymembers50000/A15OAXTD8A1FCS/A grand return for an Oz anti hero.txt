 L. Frank Baum introduced the world to Queen Ann Soforth in his novel  TIKTOK OF OZ where, bored of ruling her insignificant land of Oogaboo, she  decides to raise an army and conquer the whole world. At that time, Tiktok  and the Shaggy man of Oz prevent her from getting into too much trouble and  help her safely back to Oogaboo.  This time she leaves Oogaboo to find her  missing parents whose mysterious disappearance had put the teenager on the  throne. The Shaggy Man and Tiktok help her in the search. Along the way,  Ann and the Oogaboo youths who volunteer to come with her have a lot of fun  and learn some important lessons about relationships. Although they go  through some interesting places in Oz, this book deals more with  interpersonal relationships than wacky adventures in curious places. It is  not one of the best Oz books. The artwork is basic. Although the characters  are well developed, Oz just doesn't seem as magical in this story. On the  positive side, the author tells not only the hidden history of Oogaboo, but  also reveals some of the mystery of the Shaggy Man's past. It is a good  book for children and a great addition to the reading list of die-hard  Oz-ophiles.
