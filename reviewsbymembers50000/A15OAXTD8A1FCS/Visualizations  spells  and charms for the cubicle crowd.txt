 If Wicca touches your soul and visualizations are helpful in changing your inner harmony,  if you want to get in touch with your inner Wild Woman instead of your inner child,  if you seek empowerment from within and ways to achieve it,  if you are seeking spells that will help you with the problems you encounter in the modern office,  then this is the book for you.  Filled with a sense of empowerment and whimsy, this book will inspire and amuse at the same time. Each chapter covers a day of the week and provides advice on the energy of the day, colors and fragrances to wear and surround yourself with, crystals, stones, and herbs to have with you, and a special Goddess for each day and its energy. Included throughout the book are spells to promote cooperation and solidarity, protect or recover property, receive raises or promotions, promote or prevent office romance, ward off sexual harrassment, and for many other common office situations. Although written for women, this will be enjoyed by any male who seeks harmony with the Goddess and her energies in his life.
