 Scraps, the Patchwork Girl, is one of the most loved  and lovable characters ever created in the Oz series. This is the story of how she came to life and became the loyal friend of the little Munchkin boy Ojo who helped make her the unusual character she is by increasing the attributes of her brain. We also meet in this book the famous Dr. Pipt who is the creator of the marvelous Powder of Life that brought the Sawhorse, the Gump, and Jack Pumpkin head to life in the second Oz book, The Marvelous Land of Oz. Together, Ojo and Scraps, with the help of the Glass Cat, set out on a quest to save Ojo's uncle and Dr. Pipt's wife, who have been accidentally turned to stone by another magical invention of Dr. Pipt's, the Liquid of Petrifaction. Along the way they receive help from the Foolish Owl, the Wise Donkey, the Woozy (a strange creature based on cubes and rectangles who breathes fire when angry), the famous Shaggy Man, Princess Dorothy, and the Scarecrow (who falls in love with Scraps). They spend an evening with the raucous Tottenhots, escape from the giant Yoop, help the Hoppers and Horners negotiate a peaceful resolution to their war, and take a ride on the most unusual river in the world. Just when they seem to be within reach of their goal, they are blocked in achieving success by the caring heart of the Tin Woodman.  Will they save the victims of the Liquid of Petrifaction? Read this marvelous book and find out. You will be enthralled by the characters, the story, and the beautiful illustrations of John R. Neill. The Books of Wonder edition is the only one that includes all the original color plates as well as the black and white illustrations and is by far the best edition in print. This is the seventh book in the series and was written only when the author realized that his readers wouldn't let him stop writing books about Oz. Baum would continue to produce Oz books until his last book was published after his death.
