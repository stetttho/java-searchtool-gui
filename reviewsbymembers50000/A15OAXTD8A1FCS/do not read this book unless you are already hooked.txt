 If you are someone who has become addicted to Anne Rice's beautiful style and/or her Vampire characters, you should read this book! However, if you are not this type, not having read Rice's earlier work, I would advise against wasting your time or money. I say this because this book follows Anne Rice's formula for her later books, which is intolerable to anyone but her already loyal fans. It consists of a good introductary sequence, enough to catch the reader's attention, followed by an 100+ page boring life story, told in this book by the jerk of the century, David Talbot. Although at times amusingly unrealistic or even mildly exciting, David Talbot tells a story which is liable to put you to sleep! The only reason for anyone to read this book is for the breathtaking ending scene. Not only does this scene make up for the monotony of the entire book, it also astonishes the reader to the point of crying (on my part, anyway)! I guarantee some sort of emotional response to this book's late coming climax to any fan of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles! If you are not a long-time fan, however, pick up one of Rice's earlier works. Don't invest your time in this book, or any other installment of the Vampire Chronicles following Memnoch the Devil.
