 This pocket guide to Ukrainian was indispensible to me during my two week  visit to this country. I carried it with me everywhere I went and consulted  it almost constantly. In all that time it was always helpful and accurate.  The only time it let me down was in drawing a distinction between a wild  rabbit and a domestic one. Each word is given in the Ukrainian Cyrillic  spelling and then in a phonetic transliteration with accented syllables in  bold. Each section has an introductory piece that gives general background  information. Useful phrases and sentences followed by a list of major  relevant words complete each section. The end of the book has an  English-Ukrainian vocabulary. A Ukrainian-English vocabulary would also  have been useful, but would have repeated the vocabularies in each section.  I can't recommend this book highly enough. Truly invaluable to the clueless  traveler.
