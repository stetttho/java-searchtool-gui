 This is a strange genre - an autobiography of a fictional character. Add to this that the fictional character is Larry Sanders, a paranoid, insecure, and egotistical host of a late night talk show! Fortunately, the large print face, copious white space and 82 pages of pictures contribute to making this a quick read. The humor would be the sad type of laughing at some obnoxious, insensitive bore, except we are saved from feeling bad about this by the fact that the object of the joke is fictional. This is supposed to make laughing at him acceptable. If you can get into the premise there are plenty of funny jokes.
