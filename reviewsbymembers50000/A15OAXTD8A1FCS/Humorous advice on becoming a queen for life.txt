 I am not one who normally likes Southern Writers, but when they are as positive and funny as Jill Conner Browne, I will gladly make an exception.  This book kept me laughing from first page to last, while it dealt out such a self-affirming attitude about life that I came away from it feeling much more empowered than I went in.   I would have to say that the Sweet Potato Queens are not for everyone. Teetotalers, Bible-thumpers, and prudes will not be pleased. But if you want to be a Queen, not just for a day, but for the rest of your life, and you can stand a little raucous good humor, then this is the book for you.
