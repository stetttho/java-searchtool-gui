 This is a wonderful summary of the latest findings and theories on Corvidae behavior and intelligence. I read the book because I wanted to find out why crows acted the way they do and have come away with a deep  appreciation for this wonderful family of birds. In addition to the  fabulous text, the book is filled with large, gorgeous pictures that are  awesome. This must be read by anyone interested in birds.
