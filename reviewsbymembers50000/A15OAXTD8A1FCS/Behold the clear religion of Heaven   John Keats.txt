 If books are food for the mind then this book is a box of candy - sweet but not nourishing. It is a small book, as tall as a paperback, but square. Forty seven of the ninety five pages have color reproductions of artwork, including 16 full-page and 6 double-page illustrations. The book attractive to look at, but light on text. It is divided into twenty four chapters that range from 1 to 4 pages in length. With small pages, short chapters and lots of illustrations each topic is treated quickly and without depth. Yet it is fun to read. In 9 pages you can learn the differences between Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islamic, and Jewish concepts of Heaven. Another 12 pages takes the reader through 5 chapters that compare the ancient Heavenly concepts of Asian, Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Primal Peoples. The authors know their topic and chose highlights well. So if you are looking for fun and a brief introduction to the topic, this is a great book. There is a one page listing of Further Reading, but only one book is specifically about Heaven. The rest are either classic texts of major religions or books about death and dying. On the negative side, the illustrations, though beautifully colored, often suffer a loss of detail from their small size. The full-page art is better than the postage stamp sized reproductions on some other pages. Also, although the text is good at treating all cultures equally, the majority of the art is from the Christian tradition.
