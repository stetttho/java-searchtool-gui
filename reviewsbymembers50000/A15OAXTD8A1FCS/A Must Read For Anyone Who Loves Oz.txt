 This is the perfect book to end the first century of books written about the magical land of Oz. It is by far the best book written in the Oz genre since L. Frank Baum, the founder of the series, died in 1919. Paradox in Oz is Edward Einhorn's first novel and first book about Oz. It is wonderfully written and carefully plotted and does something that even L. Frank Baum had a hard time doing. It tells a wonderful story with Ozma, the fairy ruler of Oz, as the main character.  At the beginning of this work, the enchantment that keeps people from aging in this fairy land has ended and the people are starting to age again. Ozma must travel through time to find out what went wrong and restore the enchantment. A new character - the Parrot-Ox -  who is half parrot and half ox and who is always around but only noticable when one is confronting a paradox, helps Ozma.  Eric Shanower is the best living illustrator of Oz books and this book contains his best black-and-white illustrations, a delightful color dust jacket, and Escher-like endpapers of interlocking parrot-oxes (parrot-oxen?). The book is produced by Shanower's own press, Hungry Tiger, and is an artistic triumph. It is easy to see who won out when the artist and the publisher disagreed. My favorite drawing is one of six Ozmas chasing each other through a forest. Oz is an imaginary land that is full of paradoxes. Some exist because it is a magical land, and others were created, often unintentionally, by the authors. Einhorn explores and exploits these many contradictions to create a story that is amusing and entertaining. Readers who are familiar with the original Oz books will find the book covers a lot of Oz history. However, people who have only read aone or two Oz books will still find the story enjoyable. It is a rich story that stands up to many readings and a beautiful book that would be a lovely gift.
