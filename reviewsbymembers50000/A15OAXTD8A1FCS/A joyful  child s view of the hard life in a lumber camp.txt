 Opal is a musical comedy script. The play won the Richard Rodgers Award for its music. In the play we get to see the world through the heart of a seven year-old girl. Francoise d'Orleans is an aristocratic French girl who is orphaned after losing her parents in a tragic shipwreck. When she is delivered to a forest lumber camp she is taken in and made to earn her keep by a strong-minded, practical woman who renames her Opal Whiteley.  The characters in the play are as Opal names them so there is The Man Who Wears Gray Neckties who falls in love with both The Girl That Has No Seeing and The Thought-Girl With The Far-Away Look In Her Eyes. Opal befriends the animals in her life and names them also. They are not physically present on the stage but are portrayed by Narrators. These include Peter Paul Rubens the pig and Felix Mendelssohn, a mouse.  Based on Opal's childhood diary, the story comes to life as Opal paints a picture of the people in her new-found community. The diary was originally published in the Atlantic Monthly and has since been republished as The Singing Creek Where The Willows Grow by Benjamin Hoff and as Opal, The Journal Of An Understanding Heart, by Jane Boulton. The rough life of a turn of the century lumber camp in the Pacific Northwest is magically portrayed through the eyes of a mystical child. If you like the play read the full journal as presented by Ben Hoff or Jane Boulton. Both books are gems.
