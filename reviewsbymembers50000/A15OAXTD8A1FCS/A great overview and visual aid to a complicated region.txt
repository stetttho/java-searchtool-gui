 This book was designed by university professors and their main goal was to create a set of maps to accompany a course on Eastern European history. The region depicted is the area between Germany and Italy on the west and Ukraine and Belarus on the east. My first disappointment in this book is that although described as an atlas of Eastern Europe, the authors leave out Ukraine, Belarus and Russia as well as Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Thus I feel the title is misleading. The two-color outline maps are a little bit of a disappointment in their simplicity, but they meet the instructional goals set by the authors and admirably illustrate the historic events described on the facing pages. Four Introductory Maps (Political, Physical, Demographic, and Cultural) help the reader to interpret the historic maps that follow. Also, a two page Selected Bibliography provide ample English language resources for further study. The book is divided into five broad historical eras with from six to twelve maps in each. Each map is accompanied by text on the facing page that describes the historic events of the period illustrated. I can see this as being a very valuable reference tool for anyone reading a history of this region. Rather than use it as a reference to other readings I read the book straight through and found that the progression of text is well done and readable. It makes a very good introduction to the history of the region. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a broad historical survey of the region.
