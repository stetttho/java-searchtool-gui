 I bought this book to get ideas on renovating my 1930 bungalow kitchen. Although the book focuses more on restoration than renovation, I still found it a wonderful source of ideas. Filled with lots of full color pictures of restored and well-preserved kitchens, the book is worth its price for the pictures alone.   The text covers both historic and current issues and is a wealth of information. Each section of the book has a chapter called "Obsessive Restoration" for those serious about historic integrity, but also offers a "Compromise Solution" for those of us who need to balance 21st century demands.  We found the book extremely valuable in picking layout, hardware, appliances, cabinets, and flooring. It really helped us to design a kitchen that meets the needs of a modern family, yet which blends in with the historic values of our home.
