 Like so many, I was excited for this book, since I buy the basic concept (at least from the Google angle) and I enjoy Surowiecki's NEW YORKER column. I suck at math and econ, but he's a good writer and his article on Enron's brains was great. Anyway, when this book came out the group blog Metafilter asked if it was going to be the new new TIPPING POINT, which is, of course, Malcolm Gladwell's brilliant book on memes. (THE TIPPING POINT and LEAVES OF GRASS are the only books I can claim "changed my life," and TP much more so than LoG.) Sadly, Surowiecki is no Gladwell. I made it about halfway through before irreversible boredom and disappointment set in. Too many numbers, not enough fun writing, not enough personal encounters and interviews, and did I mention there were too many numbers? As a lay reader and a fuzzy, I found Surowiecki's emphasis on the mathematical models illustrating the wisdom of crowds to be deadening. I know it's probably an intellectual weakness on my part, but the few-and-far-between anecedotal proofs of Surowiecki's hypothesis were far more compelling than the bits about corporate raiders. Just read through the part about how the average guess of a jelly-bean counting crowd is usually correct and you'll pretty much got the gist of it.
