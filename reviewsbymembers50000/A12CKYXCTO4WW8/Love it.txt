 I've had this mug for 6 years, and it's still in perfect condition. It's completely dishwasher safe and very easy to clean. And in regards to heat retention, I've had occasions where I've made coffee for work and then accidentally left in the car. When I came out 8 hours later--still warm! I'm about to buy two more as gifts.
