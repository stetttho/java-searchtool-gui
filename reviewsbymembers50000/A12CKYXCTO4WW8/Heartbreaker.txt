 I purchased this kettle in Citrus because I fell in love with the beautiful color, but unfortunately, the bottom began to rust in relatively short order. I thought it was just me, as it was my first teakettle, but it looks like I'm not alone. Someone said it was enameled but the bottom of mine was metal (aluminum looking?) and it had quite a few rust spots on it in time--too many to ignore! It's a shame, because otherwise this kettle stayed in very nice condition. No chips, easy to clean (bottom got a little messy, but visible parts remained gorgeous) and otherwise well-designed. I sold it at a garage sale a few months back. It's a shame it's not functional, considering it's so pretty.
