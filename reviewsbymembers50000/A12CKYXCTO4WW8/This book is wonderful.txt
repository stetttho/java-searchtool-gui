 I found Barbara Stanny through David Bach's (*The Automatic Millionaire*) recommended reading list, and I'm pretty sure her books are changing my life. Ignore the whiners who complain "There's not enough investment advice in this book!" because that's not what *Prince Charming Isn't Coming* is about--and it's not at all what it *claims* to be about. It's about realizing that YOU, and only YOU, are in charge of your financial life, and that controlling your money and owning your future is actually much easier, more gratifying and less trouble than NOT enriching your life and understanding your money. Barbara Stanny is like an Abraham Lincoln for women--she sets us free. Her communication style is impeccable, and I want to give a copy of her--okay, her books--to everyone I know. HIGHLY recommended.
