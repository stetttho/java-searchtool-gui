 I would have given this product a 4.5 stars if I could, but only because the "time keeper" thing is just silly. As mentioned above, it's not a timer, just a bunch of numbers (hash marks, almost). It seems like a design afterthought or something. And it's actually doubly useless, because there's no magic number for any of the yogurt. Somewhere between 6-8 hours for milk yogurt and about 12 for soy yogurt (which turns out to be disgusting, btw).  I purchased the device for three reasons: yogurt is a superfood, the woman who wrote "French Women Don't Get Fat" recommended a yogurt maker in her book, and because yogurt is supposedly still quite digestible and non-irritating for people with milk allergies.   So glad I did, too, because the product of this yogurt maker is just exquisite. I used half-and-half last night, and the resulting yogurt is simply delicious. Creamy, a little tart and so fresh! Top it with a little fresh fruit, and YUM!  I haven't scalded the milk and just used about a teaspoon of yogurt in the bottom of each jar as starter, plus the contents of one "probiotics" caplet from the health store. I don't know if the probiotics have any effect at all, but with those two ingredients, plus milk, the product is just excellent. This is very low-intensity food, as far as production goes!  Recommended. You'll be so happy to have jars of fresh yogurt in your fridge!
