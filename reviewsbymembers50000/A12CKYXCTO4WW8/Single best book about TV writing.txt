 I collect books about TV writing, from way back in the '50s (Paddy Chayefsky, et al.) through today, and Masello's is the funniest, most informative, most well-written, most encouraging and most useful of them all. I hope he continues to revise and update A FRIEND IN THE BUSINESS as the years pass, in order to keep it current, because it really is an invaluable reference.
