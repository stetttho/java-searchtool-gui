 I'm just start to get into frugality and, oh hell, let's just call it common sensibility. Most books on saving money seem to be oriented to evangelical Christian moms who homeschool their kids and live on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and not that there's anything wrong with that, but it's for sure not my life. I knew this was the book for me--and a book that really grokked Life in the Big City--when I saw that there was a whole chapter on "finding furniture on the side of the road," which is pretty much how I've furnished my whole house. Her expenses and her world (name-dropping Restoration Hardware and "Tar-jay") are very up-to-the-minute, and it's a relief! Recommended. I wish someone had given me this book when I first graduated from college.
