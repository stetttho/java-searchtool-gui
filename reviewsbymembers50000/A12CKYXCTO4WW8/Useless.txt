 I picked one of these up at a thrift store for $5, and it *still* wasn't worth the money. Don't get me wrong, it's a pretty little set made with decent quality parts, BUT it's not any fun to use because it's just so small and slow. My friend and I set it up while watching *Napoleon Dynamite* and I'll swear we got four S'mores done before the movie was over. Basically, a can of Sterno just doesn't generate enough heat to really melt the marshmallows and the chocolate. If you get everything really, really close to the flame, you might make some progress, but then everything starts smearing all over the metal and making a mess. Also, for any kind of party, even one with two people, the little ceramic containers for the chocolate, marshmallows and crackers are quite small. You can only fit four crackers in one of the two rectangular dishes, and maybe two or three bars of chocolate in the other, which means a lot of refilling over the course of the evening if you're really trying to feast on S'mores. I WISH this had been a fun party set, but it's just not effective for making S'mores indoors!
