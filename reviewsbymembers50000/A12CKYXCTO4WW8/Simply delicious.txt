 I'm a beginning-intermediate cook and I think I'll be able to make about half of the recipes in this book, but no matter what, it's totally charming--the writers really care about food, seasoning and eating! In particular, I'm so happy about the "Dutch baby," which is what my mother always called a "Dutch pancake." She makes it in a pie plate, but I have the feeling it's going to be amazing in my new old Griswold skillet. Mmmm!
