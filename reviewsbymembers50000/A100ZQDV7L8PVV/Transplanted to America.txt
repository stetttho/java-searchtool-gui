 This is a wonderful sequel to the Outlander series.  Claire and Jamie Fraser by chance and necessity set sail for the New World in pursuit of Jamie's nephew Ian.  They end up in the ridge country of North Carolina, where a band of transplanted Scotts, many of whom were Jamie's mates at Ardsmuir, soon come to settle.   There are hints of books to follow:  at least two stone circles or places of power are discovered, and gemstones acquired for the return, but Jamie, Claire, her daughter Brenna and her fiance are firmly rooted in the 18th century. As an herbalist, I especially enjoyed Claire's attempts to practice medicine blending her modern knowhow with ancient practice.  Aside from an ahistorical reference to ephedra (the Utah species doesn't work the way the Chinese species does and neither would be in 18th century North Carolina,) Gabaldon betrays a good sense of American and European herbal medicine.  I loved the attempts to grow penicillin from mold and the manufacture of a hypodermic using a rattlesnake fang for a hollow needle, while a diningroom hernia operation had me in stiches.
