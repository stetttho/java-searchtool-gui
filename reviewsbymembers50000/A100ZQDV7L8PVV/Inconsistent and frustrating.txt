 It is a shame that Myers doesn't write fiction as well as he does screenplays (notably the wonderful McGee and Me series.)  This book was more disappointing than even his religious sci fi.   Conrad Davis slips into a parallel universe where Christianity hasn't happened yet and a new messiah named Eli is born in a laundry room in Santa Monica.  Somehow the world had evolved as if Christianity had occurred however:  hotel rooms have Bibles including only the Old Testament, not Talmudic tracts, the non-Jewish characters do not worship Greek gods but are monotheists, there are crystal cathedrals and evangelical theme parks celebrating Old Testament figures and a monotheist God- but they are certainly not Jewish. Did the Reformation happen anyway?  While the idea of a Messiah ploped down in contemporary life has potential, this book doesn't achieve it. The concept is half-baked and the interspersing between realities and memories is confusing.  None of the characters is fleshed out- maybe Myers is better when he writes for actors who can add personality. It's a shame.  In religious fiction Myers is certainly no Madelline L'Engle and not even a C.S. Lewis.
