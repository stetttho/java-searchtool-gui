 When I first moved to new York City to work in the corporate world I came across Lisa Birnbach's Preppy Handbook.  Suddenly everything made sense.  I could understand why the blonde vice president in the elevator had the "executive look" and I didn't.  I understood the vague references.  Coming from somewhere where no one ever had tailgates, much less parties on them, it introduced me to a whole other way of life.  I needed to understand preppies if I were to achieve success in the East and Lisa let me know the code.  The book is a wonderful piece of cultural anthropology. I routinely recommend this book to talented kids from other classes and other places who are trying to make it in the Northeast.  Along with John Molloy's Dress for Success, this book made it possible for me to adapt to corporate life.
