 Although this information is very useful, it is manufacturers' self-reported data.  It doe not necessarily post studies that are actually done on target populations - children for Ritalin for example.  So you cannot rely upon the information as if it were done by objective third parties.   Nonetheless it is very useful to have.  It is a shame that we don't have much objective information on drugs, particularly after so many recalls and recent problems with shaded data.
