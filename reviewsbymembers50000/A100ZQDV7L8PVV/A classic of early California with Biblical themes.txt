 I first read this book 38 years ago and the characters in this book remain as vivid as the California landscape that Steinbeck masterfully details.  Who can forget Cathy's innocent-faced evil, Adam Trask's flawed goodness, Lee's dual identity as undeucated coolie in public and intellectual in private, Cal's pain at being rejected by his father, Kate's murderous duplicity or Samuel's strength in friendship?  The dry foothills of California's Salinas Valley, the rough side of Salinas (the town where Steinbeck grew up), Monterey, even San Francisco's Chinatown are lovingly detailed in this portrait of the California of Steinbeck's early years.  Members of the Steinbeck family including John make cameo appearances in the book, although a reader would need to have that fact pointed out. Curiously Steinbeck allows no motivation for Cathy's (Kate's) evil- she appears to be simply bad seed, whereas Caleb's greatest sins are seen as understandable reaction to Adam's failings as a father.  But is Caleb doomed to evil?  As Adam says on his dathbed, "Timshel", "Thou mayest" triumph over evil.
