 I have seen numerous slides of essential oil distilleries from ancient Judea, Pakistan and other places in the Near East, which vary significantly from distilleries for alcohol.  The distilled oils were floated on water before exiting the drum. Essential oils were certainly available, although it is likely that common  folk used infused oils because of their lesser cost.  Dr. Stewart has put together some excellent information on the use of oils in Biblical times.
