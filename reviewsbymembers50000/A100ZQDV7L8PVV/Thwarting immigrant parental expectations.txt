 I loved this film, which would be of interest to anyone who ever came of age, regardless of ethnic background.  Sureel, an Indian-American (Desi) college student with very strict parents who only want him to study medicine or pharmacy is living a double life at college, playing in a rock band and dating a white girl although the relationship is stalled because he won't introduce her to his parents.  At an Indian cultural conference he meets a young Desi woman who is trying to synthesize an authentic Indian/American modern dance style.  Sureel must come to terms with not rejecting everything good his parents stand for (desipte his father's active opposition)while finding his authentic path.
