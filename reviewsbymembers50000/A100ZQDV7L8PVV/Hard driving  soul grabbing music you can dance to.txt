 I love this album.  It's an organized musical suite (don't hit "random play" on your CD player) that tells the story of the Gospel and how it affects Daniels. The "Crucify Him" piece of the Jerusalem trilogy chills my bones, while the "Glory Halleluliah" part makes me jump with joy.  Who can't relate to "Two out of Three"  ("Oh, Jesus how could you love me...When I have a choice between good and bad, I pick bad two out of three.")  "Protected by Prayer" celebrates God's intervention in the scary parts of our daily lives. The music is focused, hard driving and soul stirring.  But be warned.  You can't easily sit down and listen to this.  When I hear this music, it makes me dance!
