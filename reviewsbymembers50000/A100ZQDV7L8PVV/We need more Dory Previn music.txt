 I remembered Dory Previn only for her 70s song "Midnight On the Oasis" which tragically has not been reissued on CD.  But the memory of that song was strong enough that when I saw this Dory Previn album listed on an Amazon list of underrated artists,  I ordered it at once.  Wow!  Her song on the two lovers is fabuous and the suite of songs occasioned by the death of her father plays regularly through my mind.  Everyone I've played it for has gone away impressed. Dory, if you are listening, we need more of your music!
