 After reading good reviews, I bought this machine sight unseen.  Big mistake.  Filling the reservoirs was cumbersome and you couldn't see the water level on the coffee and trying to make a half pot was very difficult.  The espresso coffee holder didn't fit easily on the machine and sometimes it took five minutes of fiddling to get it to seat.(doesn't help that you can't see what you are doing).  So soon we stopped making espresso, thus getting around the fact that a coffee mug won't fit under the espresso head.  The coffee maker was mediochre. The lid over the basket fit poorly and was difficult to seat.  It easily clogs and leaks all over the sink, even right after a cleaning.  Today I'm off to Zabars to buy myself a new coffee maker.  And it won't be a Briel.
