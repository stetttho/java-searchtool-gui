 Mmany women who experience the natural waxing and waning of breastmilk feel that they must be drying up and needlesly wean their babies too early.  Hilary Jacobson shows how foods and herbs can increase milk production through natural cyclic changes as well as those brought about by medication, illness and stress.  She doesn't simply present lists of galactogues (breatmilk enhancing foods and herbs) she talks about the energetics of them.  For instance nigella seeds, used in the Mideast to enhance breastmilk, may be too warming for regular consumption unless a woman runs cold, and fennel may be a better choice. She discusses ways of determining what allergens may go through the breastmilk and bother the baby- even showing how they can be detected prenatally.  Finally she covers foods that mother the mother.  This is an excellent resource and I have no trouble recommending it to my patients.
