 This book is one of very few that list the nutrients found in common western and Chinese herbs, allowing one to find which herbs are good sources of, say selenium or beta carotene. As such it is an important  addition to any herbalist's library.  However like most food science  analyses, the book lists nutrients found in the plant, not nutrients which  can or will be absorbed by the human body.  For example, aluminium intake  is closely regulated by the gut flora and excess aluminum is normally  excreted unless that flora has been decimated by antibiotics or unhealthy  diets.  Its presence in an herb does not automatically mean that an herb  like echinacea, which rates moderately high in aluminum, should be  avoided. The actions of herbs often go far beyond their constituents.   Yellow dock, for example is not especially high in iron, yet yellow dock  tincture (which contains very little iron at all) can in low doses allow  the body to overcome anemia far faster than iron supplements. However  with those caveats, the book is highly recommended.  It also lists actions  of herbs, the body systems affected, folk history and use of the plants,  medicinal properties, chemical constituents, nutrients of note and typical  dialy doses in various forms.  Of particular note are traditional  combination formulas which are analyzed like the single herbs for their  nutritional profiles. A worthwhile reference for those seriously  interested in herbal medicine and nutrition.
