 I'm not enthralled with it, but it is a decent materia medica with somewhat dated information.  (The German Commission E was some time back.)  It will doubtless be used by MDs as an authoritative source.  Tends to be a  bit conservative in application, warning against many good herbs which need  to be used knowledgeably.  The photos are all segregated from the text  (like the drug pictures are in the normal PDR.)  For general use, the  illustrated Holistic Herbal by David Hoffman, Penelope Ody's Complete  Medicinal Herbal and Andrew Chevallier's Encyclopedia of Medicinal Plants  are better values.  If you are a herbal practicioner who needs to interact  with MDs, the Herbal PDR is useful.
