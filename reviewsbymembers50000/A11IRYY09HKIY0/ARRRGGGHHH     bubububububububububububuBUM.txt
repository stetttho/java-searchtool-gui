 A great album through and through, but also in possesion of rock's great "side one, track one," a la "High Fidelity."  You put the CD in your CD player.  You turn up the volume, 'cause they, it's Alice In Chains!  You press 'play.'  You will then find yourself in the midst of a violent heavy metal torture session of strange beauty and power.  Hearing that first primal scream, was I surprised to hear that vocalist Layne Staley was hopeless drug addict whose life was filled with psychic pain, who ended up lonely and dead?  Sadly, nope.  An amazing, essential album for all fans of immense, hard rock music.
