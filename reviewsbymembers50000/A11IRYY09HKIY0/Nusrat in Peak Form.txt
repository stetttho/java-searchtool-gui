 This ranks as my favorite Nusrat CD.  The songs are great (though I usually skip the light and happy track #2), and the sound is perfect, with just a little natural reverb.  Every vocal and instrument voice is perfectly mixed.  My only complaint revolves around the too-brief "alap" sections.  I would enjoy more time to savor the clashing harmonies before the tabla fell into the mix.  Still, that complaint is almost irrelevant; it's one of the very finest Nustrat CDs still available.  Vol. I is pretty darn good too.
