 The world of psychedelic literature is seriously lacking in quality fiction.  Much of it works to serve the ideological purposes of its authors, rather than simply telling stories that happen to incorporate psychedelic mindviews and drugs judiciously.  This is not one of those books.  The story of a man (a loner of course), his life, and his near-symbiotic relationship with visionary fungi, it can be enjoyed by anyone who likes first-person narratives, spiritual and psychological writing, or anyone looking for a quick, well-written, not terribly demanding read.  It's especially relevant if you've ever fantasized about living a semi-hermetic/ascetic lifestyle revolving around the ritual ingestion of visionary plants.
