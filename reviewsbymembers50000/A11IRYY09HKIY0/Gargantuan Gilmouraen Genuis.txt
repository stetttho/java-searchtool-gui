 There's obviously been enough said about the songs themselves amidst all these reviews, and it goes without saying that "Meddle" is truly an awesome album.  I wanted to take this space to nominate David Gilmour as one of the all-time great, consummate musical voices on Earth.  "Echoes" exhibits his visionary abilities as well as anything else he's ever produced.  First, there's the "Shine On..."-like introduction, bringing to mind barren landscapes of ancient ruins, followed by the rollicking guitar solos that sound like ever-falling and rising dimensions of time and space, then a strange floating soundscape that seems to remove the aforementioned scene from Earth to the surface of Venus, where creatures straight out of H.P Lovecraft howl and swoon, all courtesy of whammy bars, volume swells, a metal slide and minimal effects, topped off by the cool-a** multi-tracked guitar orchestra that brings us back to the song proper.  David Gilmour is a true musical genius.  Bow down before him.   Check out "Live @ Pompeii" to see how effortlessly and brilliantly the Floyd can pull this kind of stuff off.
