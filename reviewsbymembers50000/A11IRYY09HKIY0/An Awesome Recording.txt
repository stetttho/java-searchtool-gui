 I saw Jim Black perform some years ago with sax-player Assif Tsahar and violinist Mat Maneri, and he absolutely blew me away.  When I found out that he had his own band I immediately rushed out to get this CD, and I wasn't disappointed.  While it obviously owes a great deal to free jazz, that's only one point of departure.  If you could imagine free jazz spiced with ambient, heavy metal, Morphine and "Moving Pictures"-era Rush, it would probably sound something like this.
