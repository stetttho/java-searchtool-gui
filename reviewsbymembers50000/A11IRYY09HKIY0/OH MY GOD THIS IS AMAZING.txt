 I've loved music from the "Middle East" for many years now, and perhaps when I started out I had an idealized "sound" that I was searching for.  Over the years my tastes have broadened, as well as my knowledge base, so I can understand the music a little better.  Nevertheless, I've always wanted to find that one IDEAL Mid-Eastern music.  THIS ensemble is it!  This obviously isn't Arabic classical music.  This is fiery, energetic, downright gorgeous music of the highest order!  Hammered dulcimers, huge frame drums, bowed instruments, plucked instruments, a huge chorus of men's voices echoing a brilliant solo vocalist.  I swear that this sometimes sounds like music from some long-forgotten shamanic tradition, the likes of which hasn't been seen in that part of Asia for many, many centuries.  Have you ever wondered why orthodox Islamic theologians and scholars sometimes describe music as an intoxicant?  Well, listen to the Kamkars and you'll know why.  I can't say enough about this recording.  If you're at all curious for any reason, you MUST hear this CD.  YOU REALLY MUST!  ARGH!  IT'S SO DAMN GOOD THAT WORDS REALLY CAN'T DO IT JUSTICE.  I laugh and laugh.  I don't know why...
