 I've been a lover of this album since I was in junior high school in the late eighties.  Floyd was my first concert, at RFK Stadium in SE Washington DC.  "The Final Cut" takes the sonic, decidedly non-Floydian stamp of "The Wall," and uses it to explore the betrayal of ideals, alienation, paranoia, rampant free-market capitalism, and the futility of war.  As a "concept album," I think it's far more effective than "The Wall," insofar as that album was intended as a quasi-narrative, while TFC explores topic in a non-linear fashion, and it's easier to wrap your mind around.  Also, it's not 1.5 hours.  "Two Suns in the Sunset" is perhaps my favorite cut off the album.  I mean, how could you not love a ballad of global nuclear apocalypse?  You gotta love that Roger Waters.  He's sunny guy.
