 This album, and its live companion, represent - for me - the pinnacle of John McLaughlin's career.  Virtually everything he has been involved with is microcosmically encapsulated in his two trio recordings.  McLaughlin possesses an very unique style that is an absolutely perfect combination fusion, jazz, Indian, blues and flamenco.  Combine his slinky rhythmic playing and  lightening fast melodic work with the amazing percussion work of Trilok Gurtu, and it's like Shakti meets the avant garde of NYC on Mars.  If you're pondering whether you should buy this album, ponder no more.  YOU MUST BUY IT.  YOU MUST ALSO BUY THE LIVE ALBUM!  DO IT!  DO IT NOW!  NO, LIEUTENANT, YOUR MEN ARE ALREADY DEAD.
