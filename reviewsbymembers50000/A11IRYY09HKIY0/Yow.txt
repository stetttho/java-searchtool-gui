 Alim Qasimov has one of the most amazing voices you're likely to hear during your time here on Earth.  I've been told that he almost leaps in the air when he sings, and when you hear this you'll understand why.  I wish I could understand the lyrics, as the emotion apparent in his voice sounds like the type that might destroy you were you to grasp the full weight of its meaning.  Nevertheless, as sonic/sensual experiences go, listening to Alim (and his daughter to a certain extent) can hardly be surpassed.  If the climax of "Bagishlamani" doesn't move you, then you're obviously some sort of dead-to-the-world piece of scum.
