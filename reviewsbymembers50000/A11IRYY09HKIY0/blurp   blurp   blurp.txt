 The sounds on this CD will melt your brain.  If that sounds like a good thing to you - it does to me - then by all means buy it.  It's one of the greatest recordings in the "contemporary instrumental" genre, a beautifully cut jewel laying in a field of boring stones.  I would love to hear more from this trio.
