 This album proves one thing for sure: Creed has inherited a holy place in the hard-pop pantheon...they are to this decade what Journey was to the 1980s.  They'll never be quite as big, I hope, and certainly their vocalist doesn't have the distinct voice possessed by Steve Perry.  Is being the 21st Century's first Journey a good thing?  Well, that depends on whether or not you like epic, cliche-laden, Jerry Bruckheimer scale pop-rock.  If you don't, avoid this album at all costs.   However, if you don't feel guilty about your love for bands like late-80s/early 90s Van Halen, Journey, Toto or even that band who did "When I See You Smile," then by all means buy this album.  It's trite, cliched and totally commercial, but like "Die Hard," at least they use all those trite cliches in a clever, catchy way!
