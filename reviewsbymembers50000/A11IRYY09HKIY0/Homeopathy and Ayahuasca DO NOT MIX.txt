 Ayahuasca is properly known as a powerful hallucinogenic/purgative tea originally from the jungles of South America.  It is NOT meant to be a homeopathic remedy, and the idea is ridiculously stupid.  It needs to be highly *CONCENTRATED* (not diluted) to be effective from any standpoint, whether it be for psychoactivity, or somatic/healing effects.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, AS YOU WILL NOT BE BUYING REAL AYAHUASCA.  Ayahuasca typically contains DMT and a MAOI to prevent DMT's destruction before it crosses the blood/brain barrier.  If this was actually ayahuasca (although the "ayahuasca plant" Banisteriopsis caapi is sometimes available here), it would most certainly not be sold on Amazon because it would be a controlled substance, subject to Federal drug laws.  Shame on this company - and any other "alternative healing" folks - for exploiting the populace's ignorance.
