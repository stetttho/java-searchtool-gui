 First there was the birth of religious belief in the savannahs of Africa as our ancestors encountered entheogenic plants and fungi.  Flash forward many thousands of years to ancient India, where the Mahabharata was authored, then to the Middle East, where the texts of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible originated.  Then the Qur'an.  Then the works of Baha'ullah.  They are all antecedents to this amazing recording, truly inspired by God (or, by John McLaughlin's limited conception of "God" based upon Theosophical and Yogic belief systems).  Rockin' pundits of the 1960s may have said that "Clapton is God," but John McLaughlin is among the rare musicians who come close to realizing that lofty, worshipful statement.  No one truly compares to John McLaughlin.  We're not worthy!  We're not worthy!
