 I bought this on LP many years ago, already a fan of David Torn from "Planet X" and "Cloud About Mercury."  I was not prepared for this kind of music.  At the time, I couldn't haven't even categorized it as anything other than "noise."  It's apparent to me now that these are drum/guitar "free-jazz" improvisations/compositions.  It's great to hear a top-notch, creative electric guitarist approaching that genre, as they are few and far between (dey's lots of saxophonists doe, dat fo' sure!).  Adventerous stuff, reminiscent (though I suppose it should be the other way around) of Pat Metheny's "Zero Tolerance for Silence."  I suppose that covers much of free jazz too.
