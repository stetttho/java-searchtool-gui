 This is an amazing CD.  Totally totally amazing.  It's as though Palestrina took a vacation in Iran.  I listen to this CD whenever I need spine-tingling artistic inspiration.  My very favorite selection is #8, Sirt im Sasani, or "My Heart is Trembling."  Prepare for a full kundalini awakening of the musical variety.  Highly recommended.  Buy it today.  The other CDs in this series are top-notch too, but nothing compares to this one.  Spread the word...
