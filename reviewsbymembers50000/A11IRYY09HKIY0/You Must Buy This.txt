 This is one of my all-time favorite recordings.  Much of the music is truly timeless, and they're many wonderful performances.  Highlights for me include Springsteen (I Ain't Got No Home), U2 (Hallelujah...not the Cohen/Buckley/Cale version either) and best of all, John Mellancamp (Do Re Mi).  I could have done without Arlo Guthrie (heck, I can barely stand to listen to Woody either) and most especially the Brian Wilson cut.  God is he awful.
