 The reviews on the back of this video's box would make you think you are about to see something like "American Masters," an intelligent, well-produced examination of Nusrat's life and his artistic impact upon the world.  Instead, the production is less than excellent, the history is slightly innacurate (Qawwali is NOT "Sufi music," but music performed by only a few Sufi groups in Southern Asia, not the entirety of sufism in the Islamic world).  However, interviews with his various collaborators (Michael Brook) and samplers (Bally Sagoo) proved interesting, but not too essential.  As far as the music is concerned, you're constantly teased by snippets of "Allah Hoo" and "Dam Mast Qalandar," but for the most part the soundtrack seems dominated by one or two songs played over and over ad naseum.  Purchase this video only if you're a Nusrat completist.  Better yet, just go rent it.
