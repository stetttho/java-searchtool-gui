 I was very skeptical of Part, having seen rave reviews (from Michael Stipe of all people), as I tend to discount rave reviews. I heard a few of his pieces over the years without being at all impressed. If you like JS Bach or Rachmaninoff's "Vespers," then it didn't seem like Part was offering anything substantially new or innovative. Then I heard "Litany" and was blown away by the time the first vocalist intoned "Oh Lord." This music is like a divine nuclear explosion, the sound of a soul calling out for God from the depths of its being (de profundis). Silly descriptions aside, "Litany" is among the most stunning, beautiful compositions ever created by human hands. Catholic, Muslim, Lutheran, Ahmadiyan, Sikh, Buddhist, Athiest, Wiccan, or whatever, "Litany" will make a believer out of you. Having learned to hear Part, I've also come to admire other works, even those I previously disliked.
