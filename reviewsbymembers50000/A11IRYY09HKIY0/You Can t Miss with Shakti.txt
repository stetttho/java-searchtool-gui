 This is the final recording by the original, classic, non-gimmicky Shakti (Remember Shakti being unoriginal, non-classic and gimmicky, IMHO).  You absolutely *must* have this if you love adventurous, amazing music.  It's more varied than either of their previous two recordings, "Shakti" and "Handful of Beauty" (my favorite, BTW), and has a heavier, rockier edge.  "Face to Face" opens with one of John McLaughlin's all-time cool-a** rhythm guitar riffs.  Mere mortals still quiver in their boots almost thirty years later...
