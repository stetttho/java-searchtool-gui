 I have no idea how I ever learned of the existence of Stephan Micus' work, but it was probably sometime back in high school when I "got into world music."  My early experiences of his music were stunning, and in his music I found great depth and beauty.  However, as I heard more and more, a certain sameness was apparent in all of his music.  It's all ethereal, and it's all melodic (in a sense...except the "...Stones" album, in which he hits rocks or something), but I've found that barring differences in instrumentation, the *music* is often quite similar in theme and feeling.  That being said, this new one (with yet another great ECMish cover) is just as strong a work as "Darkness and Light," but perhaps - in my opinion - not as strong as "Athos" (I *love* that one; what the *heck* is a sattar and where can I hear more of that thing!?).  If you're a fan of Micus, by all means purchase this CD.  If you're looking for an interesting, indefinable, "world music" listening experience that none of your friends know about, buy this album.  If you're familiar with his earlier works and are expecting something breathtakingly new, this is *NOT* the album to buy.  Still, it's better than most New Agey, "world music" recordings out there on the market.
