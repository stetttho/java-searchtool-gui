 I had to add my two cents to this listing, as this is one of my all time favorite works of art by any artist in any genre in any era in any culture. All the other reviews you'll read here will tell you that this CD is good, but I'm here to tell you that those people are WAAAAY off.  They're absolutely wrong.  This is pure sonic beauty. It's not just good. It's remarkable, phenomenal music. Stunning. A peak experience in the true Maslow sense. From the opening harmonics on "Kare Kare" and its cool, very trippy  fadeout, right through to the melancholic, gorgeous finale ("Together Alone"), this album is a step away from absolute perfection.  Perfection, I say! I wish they had put something else on there besides "Skin Feeling." It's a silly track and it doesn't fit in here at all. Otherwise, this CD features some of Neil Finn's finest moments.  The richness of his voice on "Nails in My Feet," the angelic chorus on "In My Command," the way-cool melody/chord progression on the bizarre "Catherine Wheels," the psychedelia of "Fingers of Love" ("the light that falls from a crack...an insect too delicate to catch...color is its own reward"), the heart-tugging pop ditty "Distant Sun" (which I can still listen to up to ten times in a row). This album is many cuts above anything else that Crowded House ever released, and that says more about "Together Alone" than the other albums, as they too are filled with riches of pop music brilliance. "Together Alone" is also the only CD they made whilst living amidst the beaty of a dramatic Kiwi beach (Kare Kare; seen in "The Piano") and apparently smoking lots of Cannibas, which shows through in the stony atmospheres that permeate this album.     My god!  If you like rock, spacerock, progressive rock, folk, Jelaluddin Rumi, pop, "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot," The Church, Pink Floyd, Radiohead, the Beatles, Neil Finn, Squeeze, psychedelia, or universe of beauty in any of its myriad forms, you owe it to yourself to buy this.
