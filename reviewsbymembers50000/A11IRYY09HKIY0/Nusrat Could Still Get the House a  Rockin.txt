 My beefs, right upfront...I think the production could use some sparkle.  All in all, the music is warm but dry; I really enjoyed the pure group sound that Michael Brook used a few times on "Mustt Mustt," most notably on "Ta Deem."  On this recording you'll also find that Nusrat's voice is not in tip-top shape.  Now, I'm not saying that is singing is anything less than excellent, but hey, Nusrat's merely excellent is somebody else's brilliant.  My point is that this guy was past his prime as a vocalist, very ill and it shows.  The heavy metal pyrotechnic, Yngwie Malmsteenesque sputterings of the "South Asian solfege" (do = sa) aren't anywhere near as plentiful here, but that doesn't detract from the depth of this music.  Nusrat truly was a musician for our times; it's almost fitting that he died at the eve of the 20th century.  If you're a fan, by all means get this.  If you're new to Nusrat, I would recommend three recordings to acquaint you with his traditional style, all with performances and/or production more suited to my tastes.  First, there's the flawless studio recordings made by JVC in Japan.  The sound is crisp and I prefer it to "TFSR."  Next, you should hear "Shabazz," a RealWorld recording that is really among his best; check out the first track, "Beh Haadh Ramza Dhasdha," and you'll see what I mean.  The other recording in question is a live recording (with stuff you can see on your computer) called "Imprint."  Both this recording and that of JVC feature versions of one of his signature tunes, "Allah Hoo," and the "Imprint" version has some amazing interplay between Nusrat, Rahat and the tabla.  Get them, and get this too if you like.
