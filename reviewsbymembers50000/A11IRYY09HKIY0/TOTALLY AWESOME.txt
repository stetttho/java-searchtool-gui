 The CD is worth hearing for "Mutual Tribes" alone. It's skimming across the surface of the primordial soup in a UFO with your soul being stretched and bent in all sorts of ways it wasn't meant to. This is one of the most extraordinary recordings I've ever heard, and really opening my ears to the work of Roach, Rich and their ilk. I'd previously dismissed such music as New Agey fluff, but there's absolutely nothing fluffy or silly about this work. The music is a vivid depiction of a timeless, and a brilliant collaboration between the three musicians. It's a sonic ayahuasca dream. A careful listen to the many tracks will reveal a great deal of understated, processed guitar work from Saiz, and it's one of the key atmosphere-setting sounds on the album. Overall, and outstanding recording. If you want innovative music that takes you places inside the dimly-lit, sticky, wet and warm parts of your lizard brain, this is it.
