 This is great music, the the production sounds as if it was recorded in some sub-par studio in some soon-to-be backward Islamic republic.  Oh wait, it was! If you love Persian music, perhaps you'll get beyond the production issues.  However, if you like modern, crisp production, much less production that doesn't sound like it dates from 1962, please look for other recordings.
