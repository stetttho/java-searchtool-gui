 OK folks, even if this homeopathic tincture is made from the ayahuasca vine itself, a plant known to us in the West as Banisteriopsis caapi, this product is most assuredly not authentic ayahuasca.  If it was, it would be a *Schedule I controlled substance* like LSD or magic mushrooms, and CERTAINLY not sold on Amazon.com.  In the common use of the word, ayahuasca is a strong psychedelic brew used by shamans, healers and seeker, primarily in South America, but elsewhere as well, and increasingly so.  Most commonly, it's a synergistic combination of an natural MAOI (that's what Prozac is) with a compound known as N, N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT).  Numerous religions are based up the sacramental ingestion of ayahuasca.  Its mode of healing is often that of massive PURGING, be it physical (barfing) or emotional (again, barfing, but most strangely euphoric barfing you'll ever experience), not through people exposing themselves to water that contains barely a trace of the actual substance it purports to be.  As I write this in the late winter of 2005, our new Attorney General is making a concerted effort to stop true ayahuasca use in the United States (it's legal in Brazil, and increasingly tolerated in many other nations, esp. western Europe).  Do you think Amazon would really carry a drug (medicine?) that our government is determined to quash?  Really folks, look elsewhere for ayahuasca!
