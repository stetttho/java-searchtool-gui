 If you love Jeff Buckley, don't buy this CD thinking it'll be like listening to the Jeff of the 1960s.  The voices sound similar for sure, especially when Tim gets all high and whiny, but that's where the cosmetic similarites end.  Tim's music and singing is very histrionic, and it doesn't appeal to me.  I have to say that I bought this CD to familiarize myself with his music, as it had such glowing recommendations.  The sound quality is excellent, and if you're already a Tim fan, by all means you need to get this.  Otherwise, skip it.  Tim was never never never ever had even half the talent or soul possessed by Jeff.
