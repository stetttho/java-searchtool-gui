 I bought this collection some ten years ago, and it has aged very, very well.  The performances are great, and there's a real cohesion in them in terms of production.  Whoever produced the CD really loves music, and must have made many mix tapes in his/her life, because it has the ebb and flow of a really excellent mix tape, with shifting moods and styles.  I enjoy quite a bit of it, but the highlights for me are Lucinda Williams' cover of a Nick Drake song, the David Wilcox song, and the Peter Himmelman song, which also features an *amazing*, beautiful, lyrical guitar solo coming straight from the heart.  In fact, "Always in Disguise" is really my favorite song overall from this collection.  BUY IT TODAY!!!
