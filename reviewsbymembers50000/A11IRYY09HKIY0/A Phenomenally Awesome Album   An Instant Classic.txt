 I am not a Wilco fan.  I've listened to most of their pre-YHF albums, and though they were nice, nothing struck quite like this album, which in and of itself, took a while to penetrate my mind.   While the comparisons to Radiohead may be tired at this point, they are still apt, even if they're only superficial.  The bizarre noises, unconventional song structures, lyrics that pin down the zeitgeist in very strange ways, etc.  YHF is akin to Wilco's own "OK Computer," where the sounds of their past, while still present, are shifted left of center, and in some cases into inter-dimensional wormholes feeding spilling directly into the place in our chests where we feel longing and nostalgia. While none of the Wilco guys are "great musicians" in the progressive rock sense of the term, they are all true artists, and I think Jeff Tweedy is amazingly gifted.  That was confirmed when I saw "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart" and his solo acoustic outings in that film.  He sings from the heart.   "I would like to salute the ashes of American flags..."   Also, has anybody ever noticed that he sounds strikingly similar to Jerry Garcia at times?
