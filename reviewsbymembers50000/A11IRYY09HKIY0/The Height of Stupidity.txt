 I read this book as part of an introductory undergraduate course in cultural anthropology.  I'd not heard of it at the time, and the professor seemed quite excited about our reading it.  I respected his opinions and began the book with an open mind.  However, what I found myself reading was really, really bad.  Now, I'm no genius by any standard (except for chimps), but *I* could have come up with a better format for the presentation of this information, if you want to call it that.  The underlying ideas found in this book are interesting for sure, though more mature and developed versions of similar ideas can be found in the work of other, better authors.  As far as the writing is concerned, it's certainly nothing special.  I don't understand why so much praise was heaped upon this book.  I think as far as spiritually-minded books are concerned this one is the literary equivalent of "Con Air."  It's stupid, cliched, has nothing original to say at all (the whole Genesis allegory is pretty well-known now), and above all, is so implausible as to be idiotic.  If you're looking for truly challenging ideas, writing or plotlines, please look elsewhere.  I'd rather read the children's classic "But I'm Not Sleepy," than ever look at this drivel again.  Ugh... Having said all that, Quinn's pilfered ideas are not without merit and it might be healthy to mull them over a teensy bit.
