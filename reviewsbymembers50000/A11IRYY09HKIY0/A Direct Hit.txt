 Fans of Persian and Kurdish music will absolutely love this recording, which unites two amazing musicians.  Not quite as lush as the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink arrangements of the Kurdish ensemble The Kamkars, they more than make up for that with more richly ornamented melody and depth of feeling.  There's little thunderous daff drumming to be heard here, which is, for me at least, one of the more appealing aspects of Kurdish music.  An excellent, EXCELLENT CD.
