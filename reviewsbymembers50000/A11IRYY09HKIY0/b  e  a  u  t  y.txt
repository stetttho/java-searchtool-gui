 I've read that some folks find this album quite dull, but for my money, it's a top-notch, amazing work full of strangely evocative songs and soundscapes.  The addition of guitarist Nels Cline is especially helpful, as he adds all sorts of interesting textures.  Jeff Tweedy is growing increasingly in touch with his muse.    There are some great moments on this album, and subtle references to great bands and sounds of the past, be it Burt Bacharach, Ornette Coleman, Terry Riley, The Beatles, Krautrock, The Band and dare I say it, Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers.  Who could deny that "At Least That's What You Said" kind of sounds like Tom Petty's "Last Dance with Mary Jane" paired with a cubist version of Neil Young's "Southern Man" and his spazzy, out-there guitar work on "Arc/Weld?"  I'd also like to opine that the "stadium rock" section of "Spiders" repeats a motif that sound strikingly like "Takin' Care of Business" meets an interlude from Rush's "Xanadu."  Bizarre.        My favorite musical moments arise in "A Muzzle of Bees...."    #1: the grounding deep end bass note that comes right after a vaguely medieval prog-rock guitar riff that pops up between "silently" and "come back to me."  I keep rewinding the CD to hear it over and over again.  The chorus really builds up to that moment, like a glimpse of profound inner light.       #2: during the instrumental bridges of the same song, amidst the storm of distortion, an amazing, shimmering chord slides up from the chaos.  Tweedy really knows that value of a good major seventh chord too.  As evidence of this, witness the melancholy that the interval lends to the lyric "how will it ever come?" in "Ashes of American Flags" on "Y.H.F."           I look forward to hearing Tweedy's future music.  I'm especially excited about plans for solo collaborations between him and Michael Bolton, Zamfir and John Tesh (AKA Tweedy, Bolton, Tesh & Z).  It'll be awesome!
