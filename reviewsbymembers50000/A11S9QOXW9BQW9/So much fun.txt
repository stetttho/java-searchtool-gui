 My twin sons are 21 months old... they love fire trucks and they love this playset! I needed one because my sons loved ball pits, this one is just incredible  We bought this model because of its size, it would be easy to fit both of them in it. My friend had one, her son loved it for about 5 years!!! So I figured we could start with this ball pit...  It is very fun for my sons! They love the pump and it always works for them... There is enough room for both of them to play and they love crawling all over the place in it!!! The balls are easily stored in an old plastic zip-up bag that my king-sized comforter came in. We have never had any problems with the balls and have even bought 100 more for even more fun!!!  It is annoying to blow up and take down, but thats the same wiht ALL ball pits. I have never ever ever had any problems with leaking or holes, my sons abuse it ALOT though... Its never tipped over (though we keep those squishy heavy paperweight type things in the corners... they are like 10 lbs each and its basically rubber with sand in it...) We really love this fire truck and its so much fun for our boys...  WE also have a large pop-up elmo tent that could fit about FOUR toddlers in it and thats much easier to set up if we dont want to go through the hassel of this ball pit. That tent holds all the balls and my sons sometimes like it even more because its more of a "hide-out" and they like that better sometimes...   I also have another fire-truck incase anything happens to this one... I have had it for about 6 months and its still going strong with just one little patch on the top... I dont think after our second one breaks that we will get a new one, I think we will just buy a bigger tent because those are much easier to set up/take down and more durable...  But for an inflatable ball pit this one is SUPERB!!
