 My 21 month old twin boys love elmo, they have elmo games, elmo toys, elmo chairs, elmo dishes, elmo toothbrushes and now an elmo room! We went to BRU to pick out a "big boy BED", but they refused to have their cool stock car beds without Elmo too! They were running all over the store with those elmo sheets (almost took them too, but good thing I realized!!) Their room was a sports theme origionally so Elmo fit right in. We too found the comforter to be a bit hard and scratchy at first, but after we washed it, it was fine. We got the pillow case pictured with both of ours (maybe some people just get duds?) and after washing it COLD both times (not warm as the directions said) with those color catchers, the whole set turned out soft, durable and bright! ***To those of you who recieve the red pillow case, do NOT wash it with the rest of the bedding, as it seems most of the washing problems are for the red pillow case users*** It fits perfectly on their crib mattresses and it looks so nice with the sports theme and their red/blue stock car beds! My boys are eager to sleep in their rooms because elmo is there too, and to all you other parents of Elmo fanatics, I know this bedding set will make all the difference!
