 We needed two tricycles for my 21 month old twin sons. We had a different one but it wouldnt grip the sidewalk, it was loud, and it would tip over if a feather landed on it, we chose this trike at TRU and are SOOO happy we did!  WE wanted one with air tires that could grip anysurface, one that had a handle, one that had a basket, and one that could grow with my sons. This trike also had free-wheeling so now my sons feet didnt get scratched when we were just pushing them. We purchased the little foot rest for them too so they wouldnt need to rest their feet on the pedals. The air tires griped onto the street perfectly, they were really really sturdy too and would not tip over wevn with two toddlers! We purchased a kettrike push bar which really worked wonders and we bought a basket for the front handle bars, it was perfect for my boys! About the only accesorry not compatable with the Air Happy is the tandem insert, but thats a small price to pay for the air tires. The seat is also adjustable and it can fit ANY toddler up to about 5 or 6 years old!  We have used these trikes EVERYWHERE and they aren't too big to fit two in the trunk of my escolade. We have used these in Manhatten at Nannas house, in the park, on the boardwalk, dogwalks, around town, to barb-e-ques, and anywhere where these would be fun to have around! My sons still use strollers but this trike is great too, and they are really learning how to steer well and pedal! Theres no tricycle out there that is better than the Air Happy (except maybe the Air Jumbo)...
