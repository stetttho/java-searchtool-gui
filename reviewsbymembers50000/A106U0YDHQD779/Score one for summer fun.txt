 This was a great find for my little guy. I was originally looking for just a single float for the baby, and I found this.  I thought it was a great idea, because it would keep you close to your baby, with your hands free.   My son absolutely loved this toy.  It kept him well supported, no tipping.  (He weighs about 20 lbs.)  He could kick his legs and play with the attached ball toys, but I think what he enjoyed most was being face to face with us.  I would reccommend this toy to anyone.
