 Let's get real here.  Diapers stink.  If you're looking for a product to cure that particular problem, your search should end here.  Diaper Genie works.     I have used both types of diaper pails, and Diaper Genie is the hands down winner.  Sure it comes with a hefty instruction sheet, which I had to take out and refer to the first few times I emptied it. My husband has no idea how to empty it, (or maybe he's just playing me!) and yes, my mother in law has yet to figure it out.  I also am not thrilled with the added expense of having to buy special liners.  But in spite of this, I can't think of a better way to dispose of diapers.    My son's room is pretty small, and you would never know there is a full pail in there.  I only have to empty it every week or so, just cut the liner and pop out the sausages. (Or, "stinky links" as we're so fond of calling them) Buy it, use it, pass it along.  Let's here it for clean air!
