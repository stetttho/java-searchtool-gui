 Yahoo!  We just purchased the Ultrasaucer for our 4 mointh old son, and it's a regular Six Flags full of fun.  He seems to really love it so far.  I could go on and on about how my darling child presses the hoozy and makes cute noises, or which of the boingy thingys is his favorite, but I suspect that most people don't need to know about that.  The real story here is in the set-up.    Before you begin to set this puppy up, set aside a good chunk of time.  And get yourself a comfy floor cushion and a nice iced tea, because you'll be there for a while.  Now when I say good chunk I mean 35-45 minutes.  To the average person, 35 minutes is not a long time.  But when your talkin' Mom time, that's two loads of wash, the breakfast dishes, a quick run with the Swiffer,a trip to the mailbox, and a tick check on the dogs.  All while listening to the Hot Topic on The View. (but I digress..)  So anyway my best advice to you is make sure you have everything before you begin, and if you have it all, put it up on a table where kids, curious Cockers and crazy Cairn terriers cannot reach any of it.  (My life is a Dr. Suess book)    What do we love about the saucer?  Umm, it seems pretty sturdy, it's made of that rubbermaidy (ish?) kind of plastic.  The seat comes out and can be washed. (KEY)  And it seems to have a lot of room for growth.    What do we not like so much?  Hmmm, the price, and the huge honkin' size of it.  It's almost embarrasing, but in a good way.    Enjoy!  They're only young once.
