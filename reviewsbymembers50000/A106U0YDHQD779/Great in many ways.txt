 I just love this product.  I first began using it for nursing, which is the reason I bought it.  It was the perfect shape and size for that.  As the baby grew, we would put him on his back in the boppy when he was playing with his kickstart gym.  This proved to be a great idea, because he looked more comfortable, and he could better reach the gym with his hands. Inevitably, when dinner hits the table, baby needs some sort of attention.  Boppy provides a nice spot for Ben to lay while I eat.  And now that he's beginning to sit up, it is a super way to support him.  Now if I could only keep the dog from napping on it.....
