 I wanted to avoid buying a real changing table, because it would be one more thing to have to get rid of when it outlived it's usefulness. (i.e., "Oh, nice microwave cart!  Wasn't that in the baby's room last month?") I spotted this changing pad and decided to use it atop my childs dresser.  It works like a charm.   It's covered in wipe clean vinyl, which is nice, considering how dirty these things can get.  It has nice sturdy sides, which keep the baby in place, even when wigglesworth is at his wiggliest.  The bottom is covered with foam material, which doesn't really keep it from sliding around on the table, however.  I solved this problem by purchasing some of that rubberized shelf liner.  It comes on a roll, they sell it near the contact paper.  I cut it to the same size as the pad and now that puppy stays put. (Tip: I cut a CD sizes piece and put it under his bum to keep him from sliding down in the high chair.)   They sell a cover that sort of fits this product, but it's by another maker, and it fits quite tightly after the wash.  Well worth buying two covers, though.  You'll need them!
