 Even though this appears to be out of stock, I have seen it at many stores, and it is well worth the trip to purchase it.  The Playtex nurser has been around for a good long while, and for good reason.  It works.       This sampler package provides a great opportunity for parents and babies to test and see just which of the products work best for them.  It comes with two different size bottles, two types of liners, and several types of nipples.    I find that the drop in liners are so much easier to use, even though they are more expensive.  There is, however, a major 'neighborhood' drugstore chain out there which sells their own brand of drop in liners, and they work just as well at a much cheaper price.  They don't come in the dispenser package like the real McCoy though, so I just saved the Playtex box and refilled it.    Bottom line-nice selection, trusted brand, easy to use, great deal.
