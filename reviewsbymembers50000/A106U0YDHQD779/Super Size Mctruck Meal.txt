 If you have a child who is interested in trucks, this is a good bet.  It's a big sturdy board book, great for little hands.  It's loaded with photographs of real trucks- farm trucks, fire trucks, big rigs, construction vehicles, many of which we see on a daily basis around town.   My son will soon be two, and he has enjoyed this book practically since he was born.  It's one of those books that grows with your child. When he was smaller we would just point to the trucks, identify them, and talk about what they did.  When he got older, we would say the name of a truck and he would point to it. Now he's pointing and telling us what each truck is...you get the idea.  It's also a great way to learn colors, (Show me the red truck!) and parts of cars. (Where are the headlights?) Two years ago, I couldn't tell a backhoe from a forklift. Now I'm a pro, and so is my son, thanks in part to this book.  Although I do have to say, a couple of the construction vehicles are mislabeled, a minor annoyance.  They also have an animal book in this series, which is cute.  The Big Train Book, however, is a big yawn.
