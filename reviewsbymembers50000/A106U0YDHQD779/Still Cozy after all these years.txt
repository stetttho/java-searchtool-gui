 I happen to own a "vintage" cozy coupe that was purchased for my daughter over 11 years ago.  My 15 month old son now uses it and loves it. I really am surprised we hung onto the thing for so long.  My daughter played with it well past age five, inside it, sitting on top of it, rolling it down the hill, you name it.  We kept it in the basement and dragged it out as a surefire hit for any baby that may visit. ("Auntie Sue, can you go get the cozy coupe?")  When baby number two rolled along, we hauled it out, this time for good, hosed it down, and it works like a champ.  It's still in great working condition, the wheels are in great repair, the door (opened and closed, no doubt, thousands of times) is perfect, and the all-important horn still squeaks with the best of 'em.  Even the headlight decals are still sticking!  I would have no reservations about purchasing this or any other Little Tykes product.  Fun, durable, hey, Fred Flintstone would be proud!
