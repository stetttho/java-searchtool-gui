 My original intent when I purchased this product was to keep my son on his side while he slept.  For a while there he seemed not to like it when I put him down on his back.  It worked  for that purpose, but after a few weeks it just became a hassle to wash it time after time.  After that he was comfortable on his back for sleep.    What I did use this product for, with much success, was nursing.  I liked to lay on my side when I nursed during the night.  It was more comfortable for me, and I could doze off a bit while he was nursing.  This positioner kept him up on his side, so it was easier for him to reach me.  It also kept him from squirming around on the bed.    What I don't like about the product is, it's kind of cheesy.  The velcro tabs began to rip off, and the flannel in between the two triangles never seems to lay flat.  That, and it takes forever to dry.  I'm not losing any sleep over it though, because it's one of those things that you use for such a short period of time anyway.    For the price, this is a pretty good product.
