 This is the perfect blanket.  I own it and a few like it by Carter's and I have to say they are the best.  Soft and warm, yet still lightweight, and they look great on both sides.  They are perfect for the crib, and I always keep one in the stroller basket.    This is the blanket that you will keep through all of your kids, and I'll bet it will still be presentable enough to pass along to someone else when all is said and done.  That is, if you're willing to part with it!
