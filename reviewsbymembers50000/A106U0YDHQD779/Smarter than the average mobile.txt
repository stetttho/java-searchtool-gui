 I love stuff that has more than one purpose.  It makes parting with our hard-earned money that much easier.  This mobile fills that need quite nicely.    First of all, it's a great mobile.  The hangy things (that being the technical term) are two-sided.  One simple side for younger babies, and a more complex side for the older set.  The pieces also come right off and serve as rattles. (Great for diversion on the changing table.)  When baby is old enough to sit, you can remove the arm and keep the music box portion in the crib.      It also has a remote control, which is really cool.  You can hang it on the doorknob of the room.  And it has three different sound choices, waves crashing, traditional medley, or even a little Bach. (Classical music for baby!  What an original idea!)     The only thing I don't like about the mobile is the fact that those fabulous rattles I was raving about make noise if you bump them.  And while that is great if you have baby in there for entertainment, I have accidently bumped it while trying to put down a sleeping boy.  Ooops!  Make sure you swing the arm out of the way so that doesn't happen.   Anyway, this is a great product, and well worth the price.  Enjoy!
