 I was shopping for some non-traditional music for my new son, and up pops Martha Stewart Sleepytime.  I have to say I clicked on it out of sheer curiosity. (Martha Stewart?  Childrearing?  Hmmmmm....)  I mean, she can weave a basket for me or show me how to make crepes, but I never actually considered her an expert on children.  Call me crazy, but this CD is just what I was looking for.      The music is, above all, very soothing.  The vocals are smooth and relaxing, without  being too babyish.  The fact is, most of the songs are not kids songs at all.  Its a wonderful mix of modern and folk singers, which blend to make for a nice addition to your evening routine.          There are a few surprises, like Barenaked Ladies crooning 'Close to You', or Bobby McFerren on 'Common Threads'.  And I absolutely adore Keb' Mo'.  Then you have a few of the more expected tracks, such as Allison Krauss singing 'Baby Mine'.  It's a nice version, but I'm still scratching my head wondering why everyone feels the need to use this song on thier kids' CD.  Love ya Dumbo, but been there, done that!    Bottom line: if you're looking for something to listen to while you're rockin' that bundle of joy, here's your ticket.  It's a 'good thing'.
