 With 11 years between my two kids, a lot has changed to say the least.  I think the biggest difference (well, besides that whole "sleep on the back thing") is the breast pump.    My other experiences with breast pumps involved pain, lots of time, or undue expense.  I find the Avent pump to be quick, efficient, and best of all, pain free.  This pump is a marvel  of "why didn't I think of that" technology.    First of all, it's cheap.  You really can't beat the price, especially if , like me, you only want it for occaisional use.  The let-down massage cushion is very soft, and easy on those tender breasts.  I know you hear me on that one, girls. I find that I can express both breasts in about 15 minutes.  It is even easy on my hand!  I thought I would be pumping the thing like crazy and working up a nice case of carpal tunnel, but once I begin to pump, I find that I can just hold it in the "closed position" and I continue to express.   It is super easy to disassemble and clean as well. Breastfeeding is a wonderful.  This just makes it easier.
