 When I discovered this book, I was shopping for my neice.  But, I liked it so much, I bought a copy for my 13 month old son as well. It tells the story of a bear and her young son, going through the nightly rituals of reading, tucking in, setling in with the stuffed animals and drinking warm milk. It has now become a part of our nightly ritual.   The illustrations are warm and rich.  The text is rythmic and fun to read.  And the back and forth conversation between Sam and his Mom reminds me of the days when my daughter was that age. I think this book simple enough for a baby, and engaging enough for a toddler. My young son always smiles and looks at me when we get to the page where Mrs. Bear reads Sam a book, and "they both knew all the words."   As an aside to single Moms,the book and it's sequel, 'Don't you feel well Sam?' do show a warm and wonderful relationship between a Mother and a son.  A super gift book.  All my new Mom friends will be recieving one! Don't miss out on this one.
