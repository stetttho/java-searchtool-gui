 My son is 10 months old and is absolutely in love with this tape.  The puppets, sound effects and lively music keep him entertained.  I love the idea that they are teaching words, and using poetry to do so.  Th only thing I could possibly say in a negative vein, is that Julie Clark's voice can become a little grating.  (Think Ginger on Gilligan's Island.)  That said , it is still well worth the price.
