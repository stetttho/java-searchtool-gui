 This book has been a great help to me.  It is so easy to read and use , I don't know how I got along without it before.   The book gives you 150 of the authors favorite perrenials.  They are chosen for, among other things, ease of growing, length of bloom, persistence in not so great soils, beautiful color...etc. Each flower gets an entire two page spread devoted to it.  The author describes how to grow it, where to grow it, how to make the most of it, special tips, and what other flowers will look great with it.  There are tons of photos and line drawings as well.  There is also an index at the front of the book, breaking down the flowers into specific groups.  Say you're looking for a short Spring bloomer for the front of the border, or you are interested in plants that attract butterflies.  He has list after list which make it easy to find what you're looking for. I have spent many an evening just leafing through this book, familiarizing myself with the varieties.  Now when I go to the nursery, I know just what to look for.
