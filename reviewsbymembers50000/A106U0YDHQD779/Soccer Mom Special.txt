 Allright, I'm going to confess here that the reason I chose the palisades travel system was because it matched the interior in my Forerunner.  Whew!  I'm glad I got that off of my chest!    Seriously though, I've come to really appreciate the versatility of this little wonder.  The car seat is snug and secure, and after a few tries, pretty easy to get in and out of the base.  The stroller is way easy to fold and hoist into the car, with tons of room for my junk in the basket underneath.  The ride in the stroller is pretty smooth too (or so it would seem, I've never actually ridden in it..)    But the true beauty of this stroller is it's funtionality. (is that even a word?) I have an older daughter who plays a lot of soccer, and believe me, we've been caught in a few rainstorms.  This stroller can completely enclose the baby in a cocoon of warm dry comfort if you simply raise the weather hood on the car seat and the stroller at the same time.  It looks pretty funny (coach calls it the "lunar module") but what the heck.    Lastly, I've always felt that Graco made an excellent product for the price.  You don't have to take out a second mortgage to buy this one.  You may even have enough cash left over to ,say, redecorate your kitchen to match your Palisades high chair!  KIDDING!
