 I'm sitting here wondering why they call this thing the 4 stage bath tub.  As near as I can figure, it's only got two stages, and excuse me, but they both stink.    Ben has been sliding down in this thing since the first day we tried it.  I went out and purchased a sponge to try and keep him from sliding, which does sort of work.  Then I got smart and stuck the sponge in the kitchen sink where I should have been in the first place.  Much better.    I have yet to try the stage two of this tub, and I'm so disgusted with it, I may never bother.  Another thing about the tub that I don't like is the fact that it has three suction cups on the bottom.  I have a wet baby in my arms, I can't be messing with all those suction cups!    In closing, it's huge.  I had to clear out some prime real estate in my son's closet just to store the thing.  Every morning when I go to open his  closet, there it sits, mocking me!      Okay, maybe it's not that bad, but I just suggest to you to go and purchase the baby bath sponge for 2.99, and sit them in the kitchen sink.  Easier, cheaper, and saves your back!
