 Okay I admit, it doesn't have the charm of the old fashioned highchairs of yore... but you can hose it down rather easily if need be. (And beleive me, NEED BE!)  The neat seat high chair suits us in a lot of ways.    First, the seat adjusts for recline, which is good for younger babies.  When I first put Ben in the chair, I had to laugh, because the chair seemed so honkin' big and he seemed so small!  The seat also adjusts for height, which is great.  Right now I have it on one of the higher settings, to save my back, but as he grows older I'll lower it and pull it up to the table so he can eat with the rest of us.  There are a few height adjustments, so you can adjust to the height of a table, or breakfast bar.... once the tray is off, it's pretty low profile.    The chair has wheels, which are very conveinient, and a five point harness, which seems a bit much, but whatever.  I am a little worried however about how well the tabs on the chair cover will hold up.  The chair cover is vinyl, which is very realistic considering the abuse these chairs take.  But it has these cheesy little tabs that hold the pad onto the base.  I  think at the very least they should have grommets to reinforce them. (Think shower curtain liner!)    But let's face it folks, you can't beat the price.  Tons of features, easy to clean, grows with your child, and heck, it even matches my car seat, which always seems to be laying about the house anyway...gotta go, I hear a hungry baby.....
