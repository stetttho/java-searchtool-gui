 I was browsing around, baby in my arms at the local ...store recently when I was approached by a mother-to-be.  She asked me a few questions about some of the more obvious layette items and I was glad to oblige.  As she was leaving, she asked me if there was anything she was leaving out.  "Washcloths! I said.  "Get more than you think you need!"  She kind of said she hadn't bothered to get any, because they looked so flimsy.  I said that flimsy was good, because flimsy is what's going to get inside that tiny little ear!    I found them to look a litlle thin too, when I first looked at them, but I found I use them for so many things!  Bathtime is the obvious, but I always keep a clean, dry one tucked in the carseat to wipe up the drool.  I always have one at the kitchen sink for face wipe ups during the day, and I can't imagine getting through one of his meals without one.  They are soft enough to use dry, which is a plus.     The towels are a little thinner than say, a Carter's towel, but they work pretty well.  I suggest getting a huge pack, it's just easier!
