 Carter's , as a whole, makes an excellent product.  This little number is no exception.  We have this and simalar products, and I've found that this is just a good idea.  The zipper is so much faster and easier to do and undo in the dark.  And the less you mess with the baby in the middle of the night, the better.  The quality of the fabric is exceptional.  It's soft, and it resisits pilling even after tons of washes.  A great buy.
