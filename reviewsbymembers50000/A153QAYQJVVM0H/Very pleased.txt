 I quickly learned that the description on the back of the book did not do  Hearts in Atlantis justice. A 70's child, I was concerned that I wouldn't  be able to connect to most of the content here. I was in for a pleasant  surprise! I was hooked immediately. Actually comprised of different stories  (all from people who start out in the same town), it was very interesting  to see how things were going to play out. King's observations of the  sixties and especially the Vietnam War were amazing. He has such an ability  to express ideas and emotions! Was it any accident that I just finished  reading (finally) Wizard and Glass right before? As a fan of the Dark Tower  series, I was especially thrilled with the "Low Men in Yellow  Coats", and how it tied in with the Dark Tower. If there are other  readers who are wondering why the tie-in, I'd like to quote from the  Afterword from Wizard and Glass: "...I am coming to understand that  Roland's world (or worlds) actually contains all the others of my making;  there is a place in Mid-World for Randall Flagg, Ralph Roberts, the  wandering boys from The Eyes of the Dragon, even Father Callahan, the  damned priest from 'Salem's Lot, who rode out of New England on a Greyhound  Bus and wound up dwelling on the border of a terrible Mid-World land called  Thunderclap."  And now we can add the likes of Bobby Garfield to  that list. I think that you can still enjoy Hearts in Atlantis without  being familiar with the Dark Tower series (if you aren't, just think along  the lines of X-Files). This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it.
