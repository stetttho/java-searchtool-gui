 Extremum is absolutely exquisite. While the pace is a bit different than other previous albums, every track has its own unique intensity, ranging from the ethereal to the horrific. The tracks flow smoothly in a natural progression. This CD confirms my belief that Fichot is a genius at capturing emotion in sound.
