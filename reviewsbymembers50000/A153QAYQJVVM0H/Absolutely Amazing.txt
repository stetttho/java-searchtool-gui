 These cards are gorgeous! I love the models that are used in the cards because they're of different shapes and appearances. This is also the first deck I own that has three different Lovers' cards, which I really  appreciated (you can choose one based on your own sexual preference or use  all three and attach variations of meanings to the Lovers' card). I loved  the dizzying perspective of the Hanged Man; I found the Queen of the Swords  to be the most beautiful card in the deck. I found the accompanying book  to be helpful, but as with most Tarot decks I own, the book eventually gets  pushed away as I discover what the cards mean to **me**.  I will say  this: those who are offended by full frontal nudity should probably avoid  this deck. If you are doing readings for other people, you may want to keep  this deck for your own personal use if you're not sure what their reaction  would be (just common sense stuff). The human body is such a wonderfully  artistic form, and this deck proves it.
