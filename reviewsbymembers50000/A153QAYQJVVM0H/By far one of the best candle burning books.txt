 This is probably one of my favorite books on candleburning. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the art. Very thorough explanations on candleburning, and my favorite thing about this title is that the book of Psalms is completely reprinted, making it extremely easy for one to conduct this type of magic (especially if you are like me and do not own a separate copy of the Psalms!). As a non-Wiccan Witch who values her experience as a Catholic-turned-Christian in her youth, and still has respect for the religion, this is a very pleasant and refreshing look at a practice that is so often dominated by Wiccan/New-Age opinion and practices.
