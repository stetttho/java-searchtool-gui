 This is a no-nonsense, practical guide to accessing the Warrior archetype. Although the title is "Wiccan Warrior," as a non-Wiccan Pagan I felt that this book applied equally to me. Would recommend especially to  beginners as it contains some important commentaries on Wiccan basics such  as what Wicca is really based on and how modern the religion really is ...  views that are often left out by other authors in preference for a more  glossy, photogenic image of Wicca being the "ancient"  pre-Christian "craft of the wise." Would also recommend this book  to the more experienced, as it presents a wonderfully fresh view of Wicca  and how to apply one's spiritual/religious beliefs to everyday life.  As  other reviewers mentioned, this book is a short read, but well worth it. I  especially enjoyed the chapter "The Initiated Warrior" - the  initiation ceremony was beautiful!
