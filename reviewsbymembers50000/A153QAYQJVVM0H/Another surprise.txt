 I was almost certain that I was going to dislike this book. The description sounding boring, but having finished Hearts in Atlantis earlier, I knew that the back cover doesn't always tell the truth about what's packed inside. I think this is a book that you will either love or hate. I've noticed that King has become much more proficient with character development (I mean, come on, he did provide some background but at least didn't start out from the day Noonan was born up until present time). So if you buy into the Noonan development, chances are you'll stick with the rest of the story. Having recently finished this book, all I can say is - Wow! There were quite a few surprises (plus some good ol' horror cliches). Everything makes sense in the end. This is another great display of King's maturing talent. I can't wait to read more!
