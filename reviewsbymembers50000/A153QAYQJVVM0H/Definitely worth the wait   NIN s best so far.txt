 Absolutely breathtaking, and well worth the wait. Some people may be put off by the two CD/tape set, but I for one can never get enough of Trent Reznor. If you purchase the album, do yourself a favor and set aside time  enough to listen to the Fragile in its entirety. The complexity of the  tracks is mindblowing, and I think that Reznor's translation of emotion  into music is on the edge of genius. I think the track that surprised me  the most was "La Mer" - not something I would have expected from  NIN, but was awesome nevertheless.
