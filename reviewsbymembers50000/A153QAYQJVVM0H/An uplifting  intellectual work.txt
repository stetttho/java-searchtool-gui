 This is only the second book I have read by His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, and I could not put this one down! While it is recognized that what is being discussed in this book is really nothing new, the Dalai Lama has  presented the ideas in such a way as to make them seem new. And yes, while  the book does contain a Buddhist flavor despite the attempt to stay away  from any particular religious thought, one still should applaud the effort.  And that is another item that makes this book so refreshing - the ability  to discuss spiritual (not religious) and/or ethical concepts without the  narrow-minded approach of My-Way-Is-The-Only-Way.  I think that this  presentation is especially important for US culture. We need to get away  from the self-centered "Me" way of thinking, and move towards  "We." To stop being so selfish and start taking other people into  account. You don't need a bible or someone shouting from a pulpit to tell  you how to be kind and giving. It's a part of our human nature, and it's a  bit of common sense thinking.
