 I have heard so much about the original (Katamary Damacy) that I bought a copy on an online auction. While waiting for it to arrive in the mail, I discovered that the sequel, We Love Katamari, had been released. I immediately went out and purchased it.  If the game manual by itself makes me laugh and feel good, there is much promise for the game. And the game is absolutely fun! I can't wait for KD to arrive to compare the two, but for now, We Love Katamari is just a plain old fun game. You use the two analog sticks like "two hands", and basically roll the katamari collecting stuff. The underwater part is especially fun, especially with the snorkeling cat!   Overall, the quirky humor, great music, and insanity makes We Love Katamari one of my favorite all-time games. It's a great game for us folks who remember the good ol' days of video gaming (when Atari first came out), when the purpose of a game was to have *fun* and not beat the snot out of your opponent with complimentary 3-D blood and gore. I highly recommend this to anyone who isn't afraid of some far-out fun!
