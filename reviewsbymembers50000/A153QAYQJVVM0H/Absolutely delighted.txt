 I was first introduced to Matisyahu through my satellite radio playing "King Without a Crown." There is something very attracting to his music that I couldn't quite put a finger on. But after purchasing this CD and listening to it several times, I have finally decided what makes Matisyahu so appealing to me is that it is so uplifting. Matisyahu's passion obviously fills his music. It's as if he's channeling his energy and his belief into the words he says, but in a way that is not overly preachy, insensitive, or obnoxious. I highly recommend this CD. It's the first thing I think of if I'm having a bad day or need a pick-me-up - listening to it is that good.
