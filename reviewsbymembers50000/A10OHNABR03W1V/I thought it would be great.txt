 I bought this thinking that it would give me everything I'd need for my baby.  Now that I've been a mother for 6 weeks, I can say most of this package is a waste of money.  Firstly, there are much better sets that come with cases.  This is just a set of loose items.  Secondly, the pacifier thermometer is a TOTAL waste of money because they are all SO inaccurate.  The nail scissors couldn't cut my newborn's nails at all.  The only parts of this kit we use are the medicine dispenser (and we have many of those we got free, so we don't need it), and the nasal aspirator (we also got a few free, so don't need this one).  We got so many thermometers free (hospital, dr. etc) that we haven't actually used the one from this set yet. I'd say either buy a smaller kit with a case, or just buy the parts separately.
