 I ordered these at the last minute thinking I needed a few smaller onesises for the first few weeks.  These not only fit perfectly, but they stretched enough for her to be able to wear them for at least the first two months!  My daughter was 7 lb 6 oz at birth, and 12 lb by 2 months.  These fit her fine. re. the other review stating that they're too small for a newborn:  They LOOK like it when you take them out of the package, but they're so stretchy they actually fit fine.
