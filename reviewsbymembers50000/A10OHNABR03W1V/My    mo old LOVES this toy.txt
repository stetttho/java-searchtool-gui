 We bought this for her 1st birthday, and she loved it from day 1.  She's almost 15 months old now, and uses it EVERY day.  The batteries last about a month for each set.  We had to pull them out the other day (to use in another toy) and when she found out the radio on the house didn't function as expected she got VERY sad!  She expect to be able to play her own music now :)
