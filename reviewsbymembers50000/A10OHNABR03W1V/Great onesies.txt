 I got these at the last minute, realizing that the baby clothes I'd received as gifts might be too big for my daughter for awhile.  I was right!  These were a lifesaver.  They fit her from 6.5-12+ lbs.  They're so cute, soft, and withstood many many washings.  The ONLY problem I encountered was that the sleeve seams stuck to velcro materials (bibs and wraps).  I would buy these again in a heartbeat.
