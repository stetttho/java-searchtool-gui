 My husband and I spent HOURS at Babies R Us playing with all the travel systems.  We chose this one over the more expensive ones because it seemed the easiest to use, and had the best features.  We were SO right.  We've had our baby out almost every day since the day we brought her home from the hospital, and it has been SO handy.  The only complaints I have about it are that the front tray (the baby's tray) of the stroller scrapes on the ground when you're opening it unless you hold the whole thing off the ground, and that the parent's tray is a wee bit difficult to fold down past the handle after you open it.  Otherwise I would wholeheartedly recommend this product to any parent.
