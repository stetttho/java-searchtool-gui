 This bag is so awesome.  I hate bags with the zipper that goes straight across the top.  This bag is just a wide open top - easy to put almost anything into.  And it has more room and WAY less bulk than most of the more traditional looking diaper bags.  My only complaint is that the strap could be longer -- but I feel that way about almost every diaper bag.
