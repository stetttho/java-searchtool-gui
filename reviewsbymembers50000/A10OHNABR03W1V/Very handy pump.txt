 I bought this pump because I heard it was the best.  I knew I would be pumping when I returned to work.  What I didn't know was that I would end up being a full-time pumper.  My baby won't take the nipple, so I pump all the time.  This pump has been great.  It has enough settings that I could start out softly without killing my nipples at first, and can crank it when I want to get lots of milk out quickly.  The only real drawbacks to this pump (and they're not small) are that the cups are very hard so they hurt your nipples a bit, and that the set isn't really "hands-free".  You can get the hands-free converter, but it's still very clumsy, and you have to use the Medela bra with it.  I have just ordered the Whisper Wear pump to see if that helps with these problems.  Feel free to email me at tara@clatterbone.com if you would like to know how they compare.
