 I can't say I agree with the glowing reviews otherwise posted here. It would be a one-star for me but I've added the extra just from the lurking suspicion that maybe I just didn't "get it". I'm willing to admit as much but only suggest you consider if you mightn't end up in the same boat... I know Berman to be a writer who presents powerful ideas in an engagingly eclectic fashion from reading his "Twilight of American Culture" - see my review here at Amazon - but I found this book to be incomprehensible and unfocused. In "Twilight..." he ties a clean structure (essentially 'tell em what you're gonna tell 'em - then tell 'em - then tell 'em what you just said) to his eclectic collection of sources and exemplary material - it works. In "Coming to Our Senses..." he does not do that. I'm still not sure what his central theme was (except from reading reviews here, for instance). His ecclecticism overwhelms. I came to this book extremely enthusiastically after reading "Twilight...". SO it was not through lack of motivation that I just put it down, finally. I will still take a look at his other books in this earlier trilogy - but with caution.
