 After reading this script I'm kicking myself for not yielding to the urge to see this show on a recent visit to NYC. What a fascinating and engaging story! I'm rarely one for reading plays in published form - it's an odd and fundamentally second-tier genre, no?  Sort of like reading sheet music!   But this book was nevertheless entertaining, moving and, at times, startling.  Although the story is ultimately a universal one, you might especially enjoy it if you are a fan of recreational mathematics or of stories about mathematicians - I am. Some of the recent splurge of fictionalized accounts include "Uncle Petros and the Goldbach Conjecture", "The Wild Numbers", and "The French Mathematician". They are great adjuncts to this story, sharing intimate looks at love, work, and insanity in the lives of those odd creatures - mathematicians. Of course the TRUE story of such a person and such an endeavor is that of Andrew Wiles' 1995 proof of the 350-years-old Fermat's theorem, described eloquently in Simon Singh's book, "Fermat's Enigma." Notwithstanding that long reading list, "The Proof" stands alone as a powerful work and as, perhaps, the most human of them all. The mathematics of the play serves as an abstract but intriguing backdrop for the story itself, which is one of family, madness and self-discovery. The sparseness of the casting, with only four characters, adds to the elegance of the tale and doubtless allows a theatrical production to build elements of character and setting that are only imagined by the reader. But go ahead and imagine. At 83 pages it will be, like any script, a quick read. Take the time to savor it.
