 People who will do anything to get what they want, if they really exist at all, are essentially invisible to us everyday folks, and we're equally invisible to them - a mundane backdrop. They are kind of like the "dark matter" that physicists say binds the universe together and either explains its eventual collapse or infinite expansion. The scientists can't find it, but their equations say it must be there. If you've ever studied the "equations" that describe the circumstances and involved parties leading up to the first Kennedy assassination, you've probably felt like those physicists. Was it a Mafia hit? Was it rogue CIA elements? Castro? This book is Oliver Stone on PCP. It has all the characters (The Mob, CIA, Cuban exiles, Hoover, Hoffa, Castro, JFK & RFK), and all the darkest themes that have been suggested to link them together and to the events leading up to 11/22/63.  "American Tabloid" is a tightly wound fiction that says, in the end, that it was all of them, and somehow none of them. It was an inevitable intersection of individuals and institutions deranged by their own willingness to do anything to attain and hold power. Don't read the book if you idolize JFK. Don't expect Agatha Christie dialogue.  It wraps a staccato style around a collection of truly depraved individuals. It's a credit to the weird energy of that style, and to Ellroy, that he somehow draws us toward its twisted central characters. The same unwholesome urge that moves your foot to the brake when you pass a bad accident will have you staying up too late reading. What happened? If you've always wondered how the goons who killed JFK managed to erase so much history that attempts to find "scientific" answers are shot full of holes, read this book. Once you believe that the "dark matter" in the human soul exists - and Ellroy will make you believe - you'll know how easily the erasure was accomplished
