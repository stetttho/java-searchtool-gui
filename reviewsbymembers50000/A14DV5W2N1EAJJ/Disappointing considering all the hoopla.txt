 I never really liked "Moby Dick" but I had a fierce high school teacher who forced me to read to the end. Having finished it, though, I was left with a lasting impression of a unique character, an unusual narrator and a powerful story. Perhaps it was the lack of a stern prod this time around, but I didn't get past the first quarter of "Ahab's Wife" and never developed the slightest interest in the characters or their fates.  It's certainly true, as other reviews have said, that the authorial "agenda" leaks through to stain the pages - a somewhat feminist or woman-centered story built on what I guess is called a 'post-modernist' worldview. But thats a worldview that I'm not altogether uncomfortable with - I don't think it was that which turned me off. And the writing is talented enough, I suppose - in a somewhat overblown way (that I thought was intended to mimic Melville.) I'd have to say that the characterizations, within the given historical context, were just plain unbelievable in the end. If this had been written as a piece of future fiction such as Atwood's "Handmaid's Tale" it might have come off better in that department. There is something peculiar about attributing some elements of 'modernism' or 'post-modernism' to peoples of the last centuries... peculiar and not especially believable. This question - of how much of modern sentiment to inject into pre-modern characters - is probably the hardest part to balance with historical fiction. I think most good historical fiction seeks to tell a story about the times. This book seemed more intent, instead on making a point within the trappings of a story.
