 If, like me, you were fascinated to hear that Fermat's so-called "last theorem" had been proven in 1995, then read Simon Singh or Amir Aczel's books popularizing the proof in outline, you probably wanted something more. If, like me, you are a person who took some math in college, enjoys recreational mathematics books of the Douglas Hofstadter and Ian Stewart genre, and even sometimes picks up the odd number-theory book, you might consider yourself an "amateur." If...if... this might seem like the book for you. I'd suggest that its not. The mathematics in this book and its level of presentation was simply impenetrable by me. Not slow going... "no" going. That's frustrating to admit, but in a way fine, since it affirms of my admiration at a distance of the work that professional mathematicians do. I have seen many cited who state that Wiles' proof is simply beyond the ken of even 95% of working mathematicians. I believe this book must really be intended to serve some fraction of that group.  Perhaps within the fold of mathematics these would consider themselves "amateurs". My two stars are offered only for them. The book is simply not for the "lay" amateur. And Ribenboim's titling of it suggests that he does not even know that this lower caste, containing those of us who enjoy recreational mathematics and would describe ourselves as "amateurs", even exists. We know we exist as something mathematically distinct from the general population by the simple fact of the universally raised eyebrows that confront any mention of our interest in mathematics. Nevertheless, like any other species in a niche, we will have to continue to feed on a sparse supply of intellectual sustenance and learn to avoid the over-rich and indigestible fare of the higher forms. Finally, if you haven't read Singh or Aczel I'd offer the former 5 stars and the latter 3 but recommend both. A truly fascinating story.
