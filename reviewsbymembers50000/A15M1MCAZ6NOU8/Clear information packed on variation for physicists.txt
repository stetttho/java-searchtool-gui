 This book from 1966 has been republished in a Dover edition and that usually means that it is a book that has become a classic, and this turns out to be correct in this case. There are many types of books on variational stuff. There are the mathematically inclined books on variational calculus. This is not one of them. This is a book on variational principles in theoretical physics. The style is clear and compact with many formulas and calculations given. It is a useful handbook on variational principles in physics and it could also serve as a text for a graduate level course. Its main weakness is perhaps in the lack of discussion of the conceptual background. It differs considerably from the classic by Yourgrau and Mandelstam which concentrates more on historical,  philosophical, and conceptual aspects of the subject. But, if you have the right background for it, it is excellent.
