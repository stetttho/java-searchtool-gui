 This is a good book on classical electrodynamics. It is on about the same level as Jackson or the fine recent book by Schwinger et al. even if it perhaps attempts to be more elementary. In stark contrast to Schwinger (and Jackson) it takes a continuum mechanics point of view as fundamental.  There are no atoms and no averageing is used to find macroscopic fields  from microscopic. This has some advantages but, in my opinion, hides the  fact that in vacuum there are only two fields while in media two  polarization fields must be added. Many things are very pedagogical and  clear in Kovetz book and it is probably a good book to learn from. The book  uses SI-units and is unusual in that it discusses thermodynamics and  continua more thourougly than its competitors.
