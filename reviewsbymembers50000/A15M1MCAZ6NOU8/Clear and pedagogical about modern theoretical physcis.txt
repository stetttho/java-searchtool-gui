 This book was originally published in Denmark in a typewritten form. I  gives a very clear treatment of many aspects of modern theoretical physics  on the advanced undergraduate or graduate level. Electromagnetism, gauge  theories, path-integrals, differential geometry, and other central topics  are treated with a minimum of unnecessary abstraction and a lot of examples  and applications.
