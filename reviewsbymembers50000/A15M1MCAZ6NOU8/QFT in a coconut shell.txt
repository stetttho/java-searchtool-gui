 The title may not be to the point since the book in fact is fairly long. Quantum field theory (QFT) is however a quite mature subject nowadays so there is a lot of material. In this book you get a pedagogical, informal, and sometimes even entertaining account of modern QFT. The style is explanatory and playful rather than terse and concise. The areas treated all seem important. Of course you need the right background to be able to digest this book, but if you do, you will like it.
