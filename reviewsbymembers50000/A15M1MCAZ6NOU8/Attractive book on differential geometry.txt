 Differential geomety is perhaps the most beautiful part of higher mathematics. It combines geometry, analysis and intuition in a wonderful way. This attractive book is a concise and modern book that manages to be both pedagogical and accurate in a pleasant way. In only 350 pages most of the differential geometry that a non-expert will ever need is outlined. Illustrations and notation seem optimal for their purpose. The book is a worthy successor of classics like Struik, Stoker, and Kreyzig.
