 This is a concise, clear, and coherent account of advanced classical electrodynamics. The equation density is higher than in most books. Mostly this means that intermediate steps of the many illuminating calculations of  the book are included. Many interesting topics not normally included in  this type of book are included. A lot of the mathematics needed is  developed in detail. I recommed it strongly to both teachers and advanced  students of the subject.
