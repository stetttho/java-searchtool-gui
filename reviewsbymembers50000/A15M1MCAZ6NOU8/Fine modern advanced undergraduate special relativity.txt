 This material of this book was successfully used in a course of special relativity for advanced undergraduates at the University of Stockholm by the late professor Bertel Laurent, one of Oskar Klein's best students. When  he sadly passed away shortly before retirement the manuscript was  transformed into a book by his enthusiastic friend Stig Flodmark.  The  book is unusual in that it does not discuss the historical, philosophical,  and experimental background that most book dwell on a lot. Instead special  relativity is clearly and simply presented with modern coordinate free  (index free) notation as a correct and accepted theory of physics. I  recommend it strongly as a concise, pedagogical, and compact course book  with a modern point of view.
