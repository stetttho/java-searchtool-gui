 This is an original, pedagogical, and scholarly account of quantum electrodynamics. It does not imitate other books. The author has his own points of view which are personal and insightful. The subject is presented as a part of physics with many applications to Casimir forces, Van der Waals forces, radiation and spectra of atoms, vacuum fluctuations, quantum optics etc. The author gives the impression that he explains what he has really understood and he makes you curious about the things that he has not. I like this book and recommend it; it has integrity.
