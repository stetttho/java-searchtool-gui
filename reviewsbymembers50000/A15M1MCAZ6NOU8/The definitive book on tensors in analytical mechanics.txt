 This book is not a text book. It is, in some sense, the final word on  tensor formalism in finite degree of freedom (analytical) mechanics. It is  one of the most scholarly books I have come across. The list of references  is very exhaustive and the author is well read in the literature on the  subject, not just in english, but also in russian, french, and german. The  style is clear and concise, the notation is carefully chosen and summarized  in a useful section where conventions, notation, and basic formulae are  listed.
