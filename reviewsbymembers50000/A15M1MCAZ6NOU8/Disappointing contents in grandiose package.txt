 This book has an exciting and promising title and it starts with an interesting discussion about how Feynman and other great physicists inspired the author. One therefore starts reading with great expectations. Unfortunately these are soon gone. There is no coherent exposition of electromagnetism to be found in the book. A few specific areas are treated in an original but non-convincing way. The author conveys some scattered insights but does not produce anything useful in the way of a new and better theory of electromagnetism. I happen to agree with the author that the vector potential is an important concept which perhaps sometimes is not given the full attention it deserves in some texts, but that is about it. I cannot recommend the book as textbook on any level of education. As an historical document it might have some interest. The author says that Feynman smiled in an embarassed way when he told him that he was the reason he had gone into physics. I now understand why Feynman was embarassed: Carver Mead may be a brilliant inventor and engineer but he does not have a clue as to what one would mean by "foundations of electromagnetism" in the way Feynman would have understood these words.
