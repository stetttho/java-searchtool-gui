 What a chore it was to finish this book! It's been sanitized to the point of lethargy. Mick Wall gives the appearance of doing his best, but ultimately, being an "official" biography, he has to kowtow to the Steve Harris Show, which is what Iron Maiden is revealed to be. Not a speck of dirt, and way more than I ever wanted to hear about British football. For hardcore fans only.
