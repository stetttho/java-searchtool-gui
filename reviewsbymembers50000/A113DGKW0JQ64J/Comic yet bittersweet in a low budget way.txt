 After watching "Comic Book - The Movie" on DVD I wasn't completely sure completely sure what to think. Yes, Mark Hamill was trying to do another "Spinal Tap" / "Best In Show" / "Trekkies" mockumentary, and he does star in it - but between the high-profile "Directed By Mark Hamill!" tags and the shot-on-video low budgetness of it all it seems like he just wanted to get a directing debut at any cost and could probably self-finance this one. The plot is actually pretty good, and true to the heart of comic-book collector fandom; in fact, there's a lot of well-researched backstory behind the made-up story of "Captain Courage" and the phony Hollywooders trying to remake a golden-era pseudo comic into a "GI JOE 2004" doomfest. There's also an attempt to play the comic-book fans with heart too, but in the end it's not enough heart - like "The Cable Guy", Mark's quixotic quest doesn't overcome the "Trekkies"-type mocking atmosphere of the film. I'd give it 2 stars - though Donna D'errico (as "Papaya Smith") is still superbly cute. Knowing what I know about Donna from Motley Crue's "The Dirt", I wonder how she could actually keep a straight face with a name like that!
