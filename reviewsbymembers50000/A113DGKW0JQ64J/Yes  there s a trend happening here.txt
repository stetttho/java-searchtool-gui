 First off, no problem with the cover - I'd love to have a poster of this! But the content - it's more ranting than insightful, and not in a particularly entertaining way. Although most of the subjects Margaret covers are worth covering, I just didn't walk away from this book feeling like it was time well spent. Have no doubt, it -is- possible to do politics, comedy and social satire well, but the overall tenor is so insular that if you're not already a member of Margarets' noisy coalition of special interests, you may be left feeling unwelcome and unamused.
