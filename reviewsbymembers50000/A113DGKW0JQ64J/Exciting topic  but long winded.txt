 This was a frustrating book. The subject and its treatment are so delicious that I couldn't put it down, yet the endless recycling of the oxygen atom and his eventually Earth-bound buddies to the End of Time made me want to shoot it. This is truly a book that could have used a few timelines, charts and a Cast of Characters to avoid overwhelming the reader with its never-ending chemical cast.
