 This book is best read as the third in Cleo's series of rich yet exotic life experiences. As with the other two books, here we have a woman whose looks and charm have allowed her to squeak through a whole host of interesting experiences that, by now, should have left her dead, diseased, or incapacitated. But fortunately for us, we have this MUD & VR-centric collection of experiences that are refreshing, fun and immersive from this woman's community-centric point of view - and a very honest take on the (intended and unintended) hypocricies of love online.
