 Up here in the Cupertino mountains, this generator is the most popular solution for backup home power. You really don't have any other choice in this category - 9KW, propane compatible, and under $2K. Winco's canvas cover, auto-solenoid gas shutoff & line voltage monitor are all worthwhile accessories. Noise is good for a standalone generator, but quiet it's not. Runs our 5K-sq. foot house nicely, networked computers and all - just lay off the electric stove.
