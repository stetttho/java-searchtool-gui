 Henry Makow, inventor of the "Scruples" board game, plays the role of the last honorable man looking for the last honorable wife well. As I'm reading along, I'm searching for clues as to where this relationship is going to end up - Nirvana, or train wreck? Unfortunately, there isn't enough information to generalize from Henry's spoiled and ultimately treacherous beauty queen Cecilia to Filipina culture at large. Was she a bad apple, or representational of international sexual politik? Although you're expecting to discover some problems due to cultural difference alone, what you don't expect is the rapid descent into post-Sam Kineson domestic hell that explodes almost out of nowhere once they marry and move back to Canada. Henry's honest take on cultural feminism at the end might have served better as a prologue; but the bigger question is: Will Henry go back and try again? For a female counterpart to Henry's journey, check out Cleo Odzer's "Patpong Sisters."
