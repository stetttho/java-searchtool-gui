 Out of several spotty releases, "Wild Dogs" really stands out as a stellar disk. Heavy, melodic, mid-tempo metal that's as catchy as it is simple. From the sneering, leering "Violation" to the blood-and-guts cover of "You Keep Me Hangin' On", this power trio rose above its poverty-metal roots with a slab of vinyl that belongs in the library of everyone who loved early Roth-era VH, Scott-era AC/DC & Dio-era Sabbath. An excellent interview with Dave Feinstein and several live bonus tracks make this disk beyond great. Oh to be 18 again!
