 This album almost holds up to the Schenker titles from the pre-McAuley glory days. The title track has one of the best choruses ever in a Schenker song, and the instrumental showcases what a good, clear-as-a-bell tone is like. The vocalist and quality of lyrics are unusually strong as well. This may be the last major-label quality solo effort we're going to see from Schenker for awhile, it's too bad he just didn't stop here.
