 I was very surprised to see a muso album like this being promoted in the "Hear It Now" listening kiosks at Tower Records when it came out. But it's wicked stuff - the shortest review would be to say that if you liked Stu Hamm's "Kings Of Sleep", you'll like this. No matter how you slice it, it's like an early Stu Hamm instrumental album (which itself is like a bass-centric Joe Satriani album.) Great melodies, chops a plenty, and no filler - you could throw this in a CD player at a garden party without fear, educating the musical IQ of your audience all the while.
