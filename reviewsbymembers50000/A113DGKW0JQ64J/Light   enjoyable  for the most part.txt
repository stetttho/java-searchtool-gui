 Way back in high school, just before becoming a computer nut, I was a radio hobbyist and would have really enjoyed this book. Even now, as a CS/EE guy I still found it great toilet seat reading. It's not a heavy,  serious book - it's light reading, sometimes annoyingly so; but with that  in mind, entertaining & informative. Wish it had more to say about  Spread Spectrum. Look forward to the DSP version, but hope it's  "heavier".
