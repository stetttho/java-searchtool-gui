 This book is a tailor-made introduction for audio DSP-centric Windows programmers. Never have I found such a contemporary mix of subjects addressed, (many with source) in such friendly manner. This book isn't  enough to learn DSP from scratch, but it is enough to provide you with at  least a cookbook understanding in many areas. And for advanced DSP heads,  some subjects covered (tube distortion, noise reduction, compression) are  rarely discussed elsewhere. Doug has a rich hardware background as well,  and the mentor-ish background he gives is a hoot. Buy it, read it, and  orient yourself to new possibilities. Wish I had this  useful/friendly/practical an overview back in grad school.
