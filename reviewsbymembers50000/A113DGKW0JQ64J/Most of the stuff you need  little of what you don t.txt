 I've owned three eTrexs from this series, ranging from the entry-level yellow unit to the top-of-the-line Vista. When the Vista got lost, I didn't want to spend as much replacing it, so... I bought the Legend. Basically, the Legend is the Vista without the electromagnetic compass or air-pressure altitude indicator, and 8MB (vs. 24) of RAM. On the plus side, the Legend has longer battery life, which is a real consideration. The only feature I miss from the Vista is the electromagnetic compass; a very useful thing to have when you're trying to triangulate on a bearing and projecting waypoints out from a fixed bearing. The 8MB of map memory is plenty; you can cover half of California with it. Firmware-wise, I'd like to see waypoint names longer than just 10 character with lower case, for the benefit of round-tripping your descriptions from products like DeLorme's XMAP and Topo USA. An excellent device, durable and compact - tracks great even on the front dash of your car. Worth 4.5 stars, really.
