 A timeless album that drips with passion, it still holds up today over fifteen years later. Gypsy-flamenco metal? Vivaldi-rock? It gets no better than this, being the yardstick by which every virtuoso rock recording is judged. Weak spots: The lyrics. "Evil Eye" is overproduced a bit, as well; the live Alcatrazz version was quite something. Strong spots: Everything else, including the mix. If any album deserved one of those 24K gold "remasters", this is it.
