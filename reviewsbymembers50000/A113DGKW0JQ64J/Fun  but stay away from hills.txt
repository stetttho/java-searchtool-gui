 I purchased my BladeZ XTR at Costco earlier this year, with the new 450W motor for a paltry [money]. More of an impulse buy than anything else, but since I also drive an electric car how could I not? Everything that's been said about the BladeZ's quality and speed here is true. It's well-made and rugged, and fits easily in the back of my RAV4EV (unlike my bicycle). The handle is hard to collapse however, requiring adult strength and as there is no key theft is always an issue. Once you get used to the extra clearance required to corner on such tiny tires, the only problem is overheating on hills. It really needs another gear option; more than 20 seconds on a modest grade will trigger that safety cutoff, and at 55 lbs it's no fun to push. Wait 30 seconds, and try again.
