 I'd been looking a long time for a 1280x1024 LCD monitor with with digital DVI input for around 1000 bucks. A simple request, but impossible to fill! It was worth the wait because AG Neovo's standout 17" monitor has all this and more. Like a hard glass surface that you can actually Windex, and an attractive minimalist black design that looks like it came from a Swedish furniture showcase. The contrast, crispness, and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles can't be beat. When the Matrox G550 Dual-DVI card comes out, I'll consider purchasing one more of these super displays.
