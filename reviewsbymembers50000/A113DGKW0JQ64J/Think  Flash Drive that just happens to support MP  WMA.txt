 The MuVo was my second choice player, having returned a Samsung Yepp YP30-SH model to Best Buy the day before. The latter has  better styling, features and display, but its atrocious digital rights management gave me a new appreciation for the MuVo. Basically, the MuVo has none of that. It's a flash drive that just happens to play MP3's & WMA files, and in a Spartan fashion at that. On the downside, of course there's no EQ controls or LCD display, volume level is just adequate, and it doesn't skip playback of incompatible files gracefully. The MuVo also occasionally clips the beginning or ending of songs, so consider adding a little padding when compressing your files. On the plus side, its codecs have breadth; it supports a good variety of MP3 and Windows Media bitrates, which is an important thing that's almost never mentioned on the box. If the unit only had a built-in microphone, I'd give it five stars. For reference, here's the test matrix I tried with the unit. Windows Media 9 VBR100 1-Pass Lossless: No  (811Kbps) Windows Media 9 393K VBR: No Windows Media 9 192K VBR for Portables: No Windows Media 9 96K 2-pass CBR: Yes Windows Media 9 64K 2-pass CBR: Yes Windows Media 8 6K Voice: No Windows Media 8 20K Mono: Yes Windows Media 8 32K Stereo: Yes Windows Media 8 128K: Yes Windows Media 8 160K: Yes And a few unusual MP3 variations. I tried more than these, and couldn't get the MP3 codec to choke once. Very solid. 24Kbps Mono: OK 32Kbps Mono: OK 40Kbps Mono: OK 56Kbps Mono: OK
