 There are other biographies out there that fill the same niche "Fox Girl" does, but it's hard to think of it as a work of fiction. No doubt Nora Keller's experience writing "Comfort Woman" provided plenty of background for the author to make "Fox Girl" ring true. Hyun-jin speaks with the voice of naivete, and it's up to the reader to fill in warnings left unsaid as she follows a common path of survival through the GI support infrastructure known as "America Town". Nora Keller strains at the end to provide something of a happy ending, although it's more like the temporary relief felt from getting off a bed of nails - an afterthought, perhaps, demanded by the publisher for the benefit of the audience. Why, and how, did Hyun-jin get so irrational about her desire to raise her sister's daughter at any cost? It seems out of character with the rest of her personality which the experience of her own (possibly artificially induced) miscarriage doesn't quite justify. The interview with the author at the end of the book, along with the Social-Studies like questions make me think that Nora wrote the book with high-school English class discussions in mind - and indeed, if "Lord Of The Flies" qualifies, then so does "Fox Girl".
