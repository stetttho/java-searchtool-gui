 I'm aware of the beef that long-time UFO fans had over this album, feeling that it was too '80's, too Whitesnake, too keyboardy, or whatever. I have no problems with it - and maybe that's just because I'm not the kind of guy to revise my tastes just because after "Nevermind" the 80's suddenly became unhip. "Misdemeanour" was one catchy slab of pop metal, hook after hook after hook - and except for Tommy's lead tone (which I found a bit bright) it was all exciting, fun stuff and still is. I won't bore you with the track-by-track breakdown, but man - "Name Of Love" is one smokin' track, and "Night Run" is one of the most maddeningly sing-along choruses ever. Really - how can anyone bash this LP when we have "Making Contact" out there? -djh
