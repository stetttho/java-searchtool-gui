 Nearly every song is a gem on this fine, fine disc. Ten is the number of years since I've last heard an album this good! Well, almost. I'm rounding a 4.5 review up to 5 stars here, due to the occasional whiff of Steve Perry ballad-itis on a couple of tracks. Gary, let your band shine. The production, the hooks, the Neuromancer-esque concept, the wonderful Luis Royo cover art  - I'd buy this album twice just to hear "Timeless" or "Paradise" again when this CD breaks.
