 This is an absolutely wonderful recollection, particularly because it tries to cover as many "fall through the cracks" microcomputers as it can - including the many S-100 systems of the era. It's amazing how much first-hand contact Stan had with the early players simply by virtue of opening the East Coast's first computer store. The book itself, compiled from his column in Computer Shopper, has a really old-style Garrison Keiller feel to it - the tone is that of an "I was there" hobbyist writing for the benefit of other hobbyists. Big points for coverage of the ultra-obscure Video Brain and the Exidy Sorcerer, along with flying in the corporate jet with Charles Tandy in the earliest days of the TRS-80. Despite its completeness, coverage of the Commodore-Amiga is almost completely left out. For that, read "On the Edge: the Spectacular Rise and Fall of Commodore" by Brian Bagnall.
