 Paulina writes with depth, research, and insight - attempting to deflate as many ego balloons as possible about the New Economy without providing an alternative or giving full credit to the personalities behind the culture, whom are naught but nerdy male cardboard cutouts by the time she's finished with them. You can't write off Paulina as a crank - she's far more even handed than one would expect, protecting credibility seems to a major objective here. A very cocksure and interesting writer who keeps her passive-aggressiveness well hidden. A Worthwhile, but uncomfortable read.
