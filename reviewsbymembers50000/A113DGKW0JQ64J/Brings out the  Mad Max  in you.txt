 OK, even if the post-apocalypse concept is a bit worn, this album wears very well and, for guitarists, is just plain enjoyable to solo over! It would be an outstanding album on its own, but it stands eclipsed by another recent melodic-metal concept album: Ten's "Babylon." Both albums will make you feel cinematic, and just plain good to be alive.
