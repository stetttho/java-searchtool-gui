 Even though I already have the predecessor to this book described on www.dspguide.com, I purchased this 2003 version to stay current. What makes this book great are how clear the explanations are to a number of core DSP areas that are often poorly explained like overlap-add fast convolution while still covering some unusual things that are rarely discussed (neural net filter design?!) along with practical cookbook techniques. And all this with charts, graphs, and clear-as-ice examples in BASIC, hoorah! Steven is egoless in terms of presenting the useful stuff - he's not trying to show off his math, he's just trying to help you understand. :D
