 I've purchased every disc by Joe, but none of them hold up as well as "Second Coming." There's no filler - all the tracks are catchy, hooky, and emotive. The production is good, and it just makes you want to crank up your car stereo and roll down the windows. "You Turn My World Around" is one of the finest rock tracks by any band, I think. All three (so far) "Reign of Terror" discs are good, but this one stands out as one fine slab of Americanized Euro-metal songwriting.
