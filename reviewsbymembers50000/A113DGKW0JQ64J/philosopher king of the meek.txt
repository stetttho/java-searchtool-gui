 It doesn't take much to see how Kur(d)t's psyche evolve from reading Journals. Shy, sensitive and philosophical, he's the odd guy out growing up in blue-collar redneck Washington. His railings against jocks, hicks & cheerleaders, while nurturing his own personal code of fairness and peace, is the stuff of every coming-of-age movie made real. Enough patterns crop up that you start to see how Kurt deals with this. He becomes cynical, an observer of humanity from the outside, hiding behind a smiling, if enigmatic face cultured to keep strangers from studying him (and his Journals) too closely.  Kurt's aware that his art and personality attract the curious, and if there's anything he can't stand it's being analyzed the way he analyzes others; this becomes a major source of stress near the end of Journals, as he becomes the target of every critic's airmchair analysis with the increase of his band's popularity. Kurt doesn't seem to make the connection between the never-ending stomach pain that followed soon after (and is a common side effect of) his heroin use - even when the only prescription medicine that alleviates the condition turns out to be another opioid. Attacked psychologically on one hand and physically on the other, the most surprising thing is that he endured as long as he did. "Journals" is wonderful reading. There are many like Kurt, and many like him who found their release through art or science. May we all live and learn from his life experience.
