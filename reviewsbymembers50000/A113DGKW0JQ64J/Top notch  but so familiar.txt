 These guys have heavily enough from the early Yngwie Malmsteen library of backing track riffs that you keep thinking "Where have I heard this before?" all the while tapping your foot in the car and singing along. It's almost like Rising Force meets the Scorpions, and that's a very good thing indeed. Well mixed and played, with top-notch production.
