 My God, what a disappointing album this was. Now we find out what an album produced and engineered by Yngwie sounds like, without the objectivity of a good producer to keep him from hanging himself. As much as I hate to say it, this garage-quality recording is poor even by Shrapnel standards. If you can get past the poor lyrics, poor sound and just plain shock value, there is some phenomenal soloing here - but does Yngwie need to prove himself anymore? We know already!
