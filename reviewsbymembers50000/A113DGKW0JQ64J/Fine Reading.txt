 I picked this up at a Fry's Electronics recently and read it as much to increase my knowledge of basic electronics as power-related issues. Except for the theory behind switching-power supply operating that is a little rushed, it's an enjoyable, practical and -readable- book on all the many 'gotchas' that will get you in your attempts to achieve clean power. As a recording studio engineer, I found the generous (and subtle) info on grounding, 3-phase power, ground lifts, crosstalk, etc. just right.
