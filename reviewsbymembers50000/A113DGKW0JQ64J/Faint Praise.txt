 NEWS FLASH: Michael Schenker Gives Up Trying To Name His Instrumentals After Ridiculous Christenings on Prior Albums. Can you imagine calling into a radio show and asking them to play uh, Song #13? So what we have here is a collection of well-recorded self-produced song fragments that is much better than some other collections of song fragments (Jason Becker's "Raspberry Jams") or self-produced audio wastelands (Yngwie's WTEAW.) What does it remind me of? Background music that might be played over the house PA before a concert. It's good enough to rock in a pleasant way, but not compelling enough to upstage the headliner. Even when recording at home, Schenker is just too pro to put out a really bad (electric, at least) product. Think of it as song fodder to steal from, in a somewhat inspiring way.
