 Kudos to New Scientist magazine (May 6th) for tipping me off to the existence bit of pseudoscientific silliness. You'd be much better off renting (from Netflix) the Discovery Channel's "If We Had No Moon", which not only covers the most plausible explanations of how the moon was created but also its symbiosis with the development of life on Earth.
