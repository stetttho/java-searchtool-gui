 What a treat it was to find this 2-DVD set at Tower Records recently - and it tries hard to make up for the fact that this live show is almost 30 years late, oh well! The bonus material on the second disc, including the "in-studio" footage and historical recollections from the original members is worth the price of admission. The show itself, while excellent, is not true UFO - it's three original members with a couple of cocky but talented sidemen (Vinnie Moore & Jason Bonham) who seem a little bit too aware that they are probably in a temporary situation at best. As much as I'm a fan of Vinnie's neoclassical releases and Jason's solo album, I would much rather have heard a "very 'eavy, very 'umble" old school gentleman drummer like Cozy Powell (RIP) playing along with Schenker or Tonka here. It's got a little of that Steve Vai gun-for-hire vibe, and the result, while fresh, lacks impact as a result. And do leave the arrangement of "Love To Love" alone, please - it can't be improved upon!
