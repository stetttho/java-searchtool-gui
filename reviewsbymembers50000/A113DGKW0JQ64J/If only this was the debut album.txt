 OK, so it took years for Warlord to release a full-length LP. For those keeping count, there was the original EP with seven or so songs, a couple of vinyl extended singles, a Metal Blade demo appearance ("Mrs. Victoria") and a "live" fanclub-released performance video that was anything but live! Never mind all that. Throughout all these releases, bandleaders Bill Tsarmis (aka "Destroyer") and Mark Zonder (aka "Thunder Child", who later went on to Fates Warning) were the only constants. But what constants they were! The comparison one might make is what Ozzy's Randy Rhoads-era might be like if King Diamond wrote the lyrics. This is proto-neoclassical, power metal at is most melodic, soulful finest. Not to be confused with the white-metal band that now bears its name, the original Warlord put out some of the finest, most heartbreaking examples of metal guitarcraft ever committed to vinyl. When one contrasts the level of songwriting and performance ability from Bill & Mark against their seeming inability to tour and manage their careers, all one can do is cry. FIVE STARS.
