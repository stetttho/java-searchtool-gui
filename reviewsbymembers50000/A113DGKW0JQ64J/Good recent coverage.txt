 "Crazy Fingers" suffers from a disease in common with most unauthorized biographies, in that endless personal gushes combined with magazine interview snippets don't make up for the lack of in-depth access to the subject. However, it is a comprehensive look at Jeff's career, and fortunately gives equal press to early, mid-year and recent history, all the way up through Guitar Shop. Nice binding, too.
