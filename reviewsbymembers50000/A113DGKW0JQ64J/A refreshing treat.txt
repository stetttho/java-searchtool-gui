 This album is the real deal; only "Strangers in the Night" is a better live album. After so many, many mediocre releases from Michael, I can't say what a surprise this album was. In fact, it's as good as UFO's  recent "Live in Wolverhampton" import is bad. Schenker wasn't  this good on the G3 tour, that's for sure - and no other Schenker album has  a mix of songs as good as this.
