 "Excitable Boy" is forever going to be most folks' first exposure to the wry wit and smile-through-clenched-teeth emotionalism that sounds like Jackson Browne channeling Tom Lehrer while in the midst of a breakup. This is wonderful stuff. Zevon's intelligent, melodic sentimentality is bracing, powerful, and wonderful - he really has no peer. Musical-wise, Zevon is part of a trinity that includes Jackson Browne & Linda Ronstadt, and it's no surprise that these three have intermingled over the years. From here, try "Transverse City" for Zevon at his most Pink Floydian, or "Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School" for one of Warren's strongest classic downtempo songwriting efforts.
