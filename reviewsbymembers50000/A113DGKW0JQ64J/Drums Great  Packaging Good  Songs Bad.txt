 I couldn't resist picking up Iowa after being exposed to just so much endless hype about this band - even in Japan! C'mon - is this really anything more than GWAR with Cannibal Corpse lyrics? If you've heard one death metal band with cookie-monster vocals you've heard 'em all, really. It's tight, and well recorded, but who cares? There is nothing new here. Maybe I'm missing something, but this 9-member band sounds like 4 guys, max.
