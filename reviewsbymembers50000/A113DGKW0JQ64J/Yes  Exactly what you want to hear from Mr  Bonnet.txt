 Even though I understand this album to be a rerecording with Graham Bonnett taking over the vocal chores, It's exactly what I want to hear and nearly as strong as his best work from the "Built To Destroy" era. Fantastic melodic metal in the Schenker/Rainbow vein, does Graham find these bands or do they find him? They all seem to share the same great musical sensibilities no matter who he plays with.
