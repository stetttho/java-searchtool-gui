 "Seventh Sign" is Yngwie's first solo album on an minor label, but it makes up in spirit what it lacks in budget. There are more catchy tracks here then on anything post-Odyssey, only some sound a little too familiar! Yes, there are some recycled licks here - you'll be scratching your head trying to figure out where you've heard this or that solo before, and sometimes it's obvious. But in the latter day wasteland of Yngwie songwriting, this gem earns its place on the conceptual shelf between Marching Out and Trilogy.
