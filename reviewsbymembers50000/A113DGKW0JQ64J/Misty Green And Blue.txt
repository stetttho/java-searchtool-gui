 Does this album really need any more kudos? It's the benchmark live rock guitar album, the Gold Standard by which all others are judged. Although the tight pacing of the original "Strangers" release is confused a bit by this extended collector's release, it's a still hoot to hear the extra patter and live bits. Schenker/Mogg/Parker/Way, I tip my hat to you for this magnificent album with the wonderful Hipgnosis cover.
