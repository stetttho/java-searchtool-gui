 Although the book's format reminded me of those great "5 minute detective"-type multiple-path books I read as a kid, what hit me so hard is that, having been to TJ (when I was about the age of the protagonists) is how spot-on it is. The surreal palette of trouble that happy-go-lucky Gringos can wind up in is portrayed with such... accurate humor, can only attest to the fact that the Zuckermans have probably made this trek more often than they want to admit! Tijuana was the perfect first choice to start off this series - but having done so, what could possibly match it?
