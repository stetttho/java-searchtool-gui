 For one to win any contest or to accomplish any task starts with an unshackled mind.  This is the central thought author Almas Jamil Sami wants to get across to a new generation of young African Americans with the second edition of his book: "The Unshackled Mind: An Afrocentric Approach To Self Help" (1999, Sohaja Publishing Company, 158 pages). 	Sami does provide some food for thought in this work by taking the reader through several familiar paths of history with his insightful narration and observation.  What truly drew me to the work was the way in which Sami addressed young people who may be a little `stuck' on themselves.  So much so, that they `think' that bad behavior can lead to good results.  Sami urges young readers to realize that everything does matter in keeping a mind alert, and a life free from unneeded entanglements with the criminal justice system. 	Sami takes on and cooks more than one `sacred cow' in this short volume.  He also hits topics such as the need for hard work and perseverance in order to achieve.  Plus he goes behind the scenes for some rare looks at a few of our well-known athletes, providing some commentary and illustrations that will get your attention, and cause the reader to loudly agree--in more than one place. 	The difference between becoming free in one's thought, and becoming a footnote as to what might have been are brought forward for the reader to examine.  No, this work may not be everyone's `cup of tea'.  However, who said that `tea' had to be of the same flavor to be truly enjoyed.
