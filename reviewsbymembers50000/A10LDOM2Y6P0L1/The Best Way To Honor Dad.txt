 It's one of those books that will provide a permanent link concerning the past of your family history, to your descendants, as is a great Father's Day gift.  I am referring to the book "A Father's Legacy: Your Life Story In Your Own Words", assembled by Terri Gibbs (2000, J. Countryman Publishing, 208 Pages). Now, much has been said as to the contribution of fathers in their role as providers, priests, and kings of their homes.  However, few--if any--publications have taken this time-honored idea and put it into a format whereby fathers themselves can best share and explain their own life story to their children and grandchildren.  Gibbs puts together plenty of month-by-month sections whereby fathers can write down their observation on life, include photos of important times and family memories, and a few extra pages for wisdom insights that can help children--and spouses--understand what makes the patriarch in their lives `tick', so to speak. The book also offers nuggets of encouragement, as well as pauses for spiritual reflection and inspiration.  It is one of those rare works that will give a man a chance to think and reflect from where he has come from, and how he became the family stalwart that he is today. There are few works on the market that encourage fathers to express themselves to their families and spouses.  This is one of those attempts to bring back the honor and reverence of the institution of fatherhood and manhood.  Gibbs has done a masterful job of including those items of information that allow men to express themselves in their own words.  It will continue to `give' an accurate picture of Dad, long after he has departed from this world.  I highly recommend this work. Mike Ramey
