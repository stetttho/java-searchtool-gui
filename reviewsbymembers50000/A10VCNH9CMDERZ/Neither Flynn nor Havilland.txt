 Mr and Mrs Wilde (Jean Wallace) suffer a lot, but all their suffering does not touch the heart. Mr Wilde is perhaps too old for this part and uses terrible intonations. Brian Ahearne as a King is very good. Fights are good  with a lot of fighters. I recommend Flynn and Taylor epics instead of this.  It is not bad, but something is lacking.
