 I admire greatly the research program of professor Dunning. The experiments described in the book are often ingenious and creative.  I am presently writing a book about human irrationality and found a lot of material to use. The first impression the book gives is rather pessimistic, perhaps too pessimistic. Untill now I had thought that one's own personality ratings correspond quite well with other people's ratings. To some degree this is true about the results of prof. Dunning, but his main point is that we think too much of oneselves. This can be seen most clearly in moral area. We are much more moral than those "other people". In the early 80's I did an attitude study which showed that we are fairly positive toward mentally ill people, but those others - who they are? - are very prejudiced and want to keep these horrible people in mental institutions. Prof Dunning ponders similar questions. Which opinion is the right one? It seems that at least in some areas the opinion we hold about ohter people is nearer to truth than the one we have of ourselves. The experiments that show this bias are really great. What comes to mental patients, I think the truth is somewhere in the middle. We are not ao good than we think but not as bad as we think those other people are.  This is a good book in many ways, clearly written and coherent. What I expected was a more thorough discussion of human rationality/irrationality. However, Dunning makes in the ennd some very good points obout positiveness of not knowing ourself as it really is.  This is my point, too. A fully rational, realistic human being would be inhuman. We are perfectly capable of making bad deeds rationally. Perhaps love is always irrational. The final verdict about knowing thyself perhaps eludes us.
