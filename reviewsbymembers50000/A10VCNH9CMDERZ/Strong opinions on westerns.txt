 Though I did not agree with many of the reviews I found them enjoyable. I also share his views on spaghetti westerns. (They are hit on your face). Being an author himself he of course emphasizes the role of a writer. That  is good. Garfield does not like B westerns. If you like them, do not read  this. Enjoy and disagaree!
