 Having lived in ultraprotestant country where one of the most popular books for young people in my childhood concerned the evil deeds of jesuits, I am not easily persuaded. I admit there is much new data which makes the concept of Dark Age silly, but it bothers  me only the best side of catholicism is presented here. At one point all scientific inventions were made in Soviet Union. Now they have been done in monasteries. I would like to know why there was Luther and protestantism. The book mentions those who left protestentism and became catholists, but how about those who left the Catholic church? I would like to read more even book.
