 I hade high expectations about this book, but it offers just the same as countless other books:Great promises without any scientific foundation. All this sounds great, but actually provides very little. Perhaps American  readers want this, but from Europe this is simply too much to take. You are  not going to be any happier after reading this book. You can enjoy it, but  that is different. Do not buy any happiness books that promise happiness.
