 Charlton Heston is an intelligent writer who has much to say about films and life. It seems that he has a very realistic view of his talents which are considerable as we all know so well. We all agree that there can be no better Moses or Ben Hur. I have read this book twice, though last time I had to stop when he talks about guns. How can so an intelligent person become a spokesman for rifle association? As a professor of psychology I find his arguments in this are just rubbish. Guns do kill and the more guns there are the more people are killed. Perhaps everybody has his and her blind spot. If you skip these arguments, the book is actually very good.
