 Beside Barbara Bonney there is Finnish soprano Soile Isokoski who has really natural, beautiful voice. How can so fully trained voice  be so natural! Some singers do have some kind of cold and hard voice, but Barbara Bonney surely is not one of those.   Having no musical talent I can but simply enjoy and I need not bother about keeping right notes, etc. That seems to be a blessing.
