 I have seen this film twice and it makes me sad and pessimistic. If you like real heroes, do not buy this. It is well-made and acted film, but not for romantics like me. If you can take that all persons in this film are morally suspect, just enjoy it. My heart just is not able to give it more than 2 stars.
