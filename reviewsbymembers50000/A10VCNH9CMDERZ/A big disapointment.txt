 The original Magnificent Seven is my favorite. It is one of the best westerns ever made. I was looking something similar, but that is not possible. The time has its effects. We ar now much more cynical - at least pretend to be. The basic ingredients are there, but it just does not work for me. Its too messy, noisy and violent and the Seven are not interesting as persons. It is hard to understand, what those who like it, are seeing. My only consolation that the Finnish paper I read gave it exactly the same rating. So, if there are Finns or Scandinavians, do not buy it. It's not for your mentality. If you think, like me that best westerns were made 1940's and 1950's, do not buy it.
