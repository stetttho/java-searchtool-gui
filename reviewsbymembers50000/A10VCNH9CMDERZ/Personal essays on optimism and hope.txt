 Martin Seligman is really worth of this book. He speaks now about positive psychology after 100 years of negative psychology. Essential to positive psychology are concepts of optimism and hope. Without these human beings would have perished. Essays have been written by leading authorities in this area. Language is clear and the chapters can be understood by laymen. Health, family and therapy related research is discussed in the book. The style is quite free and personal comments are included. I recommend this book for those who have some basic knowledge in psychology.
