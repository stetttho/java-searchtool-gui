 I enjoyed Garfield's comments though I often disagreed with him. I do enjoy some lesser B-films of the fifties and are not nearly so critical in my evaluations than G. Originally my ideas obout Italian westerns were just like G's, but I have relented somewhat. I do not include them among the best westerns, however. It is also right to notice the importance of writers and not always honor actors and directors. That is the major bias of G which I do not mind. This is not for spaghetti lovers, but others surely enjoy it. Garfield can write very fluently.
