 I am professor of psychology. I used this book in my personality class. There were about 60 women and 3 men in the class. The rejection of Shalit's ideas was total. This a new way to debase women. There has been much more  violence toward women before, the students said, but it was hidden. I  thought the class would kill me just for presenting Shalit's ideas.
