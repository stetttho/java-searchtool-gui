 I was surprised to receive a large, very well researched book about Boone. Its pictures were also beautiful. It's build with interviews with those who have known Boone. I had doubts about this method, but it worked fine. I think Boone had the charisma to be a great star, but maybe his looks did not allow it. Anyway, if you are interested in Boone, you find all essential facts about him in this book. I recommend it.
