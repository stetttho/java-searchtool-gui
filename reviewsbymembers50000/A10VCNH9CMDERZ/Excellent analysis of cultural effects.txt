 Schumaker writes terse, short, fact-filled sentences which require sometimes two readings. I was amazed how well-read the author is. He moves from psychology to economics to political philosophy to sociology. In my opinion the mental problems are mainly cultural and reading this book reinforces my view. There is a lot of perceptive critique of globalization, Western myths and American life. Perhaps he is sometimes a bit pessimistic, but  there are data which supports this view. The more we can control  material things the more alienated we are going to be. One of the best books I have read lately.
