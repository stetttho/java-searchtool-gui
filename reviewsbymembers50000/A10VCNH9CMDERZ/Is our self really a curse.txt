 Having written a book about self in Finnish 12 years ago, I find this book in many ways unique. It has a clear structure and the ideas presented are always interesting. The author can bind many threads together. Roy Baumeister has written much about "How self became a problem", but this book complements nicely Baumeister's writings. I find his emphasis on rationality and reality too strong, but he has provided many good points for his position. The Western self really is a curse in many ways. In the end of his book the author relents somewhat and admits that the ideas of positive psychology may be valuable. Especially I valued the parts discsussing about self and religion. I made a lot of notes and will be using his ideas on my lectures.
