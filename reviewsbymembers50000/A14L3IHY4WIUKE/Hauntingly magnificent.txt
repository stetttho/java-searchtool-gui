 This is the kind of book that sticks with you.  I finished it three days ago, and I've thought back to it many times since, and even dreamed about it! Thayer does a wonderful job here.  He spent five years on this book, and it was well-worth the effort.  The depth of the book comes from the  depth of the characters...Dixon Graham Bell, Rick Beanblossom, Andrea  LeBore...which are finely drawn, intimate portraits of people so real that  you feel you can reach out and touch the page and feel their hands pushing  back from the other side. The Minnesota weather is another character in  the book, and just as finely drawn as the human characters are...obviously,  Thayer knows the state well.  Another non-human character is the television  news business, and Sky-High News in particular.  Thayer worked at a TV  station in order to research the book, and his knowledge of the ins and  outs, highs and lows of the TV news game is obvious. And the plot is full  of twists and turns, more than enough for the most adventurous  thrill-seekers.  And then it comes to an end in such a way that it leaves  you breathless, satisfied and yet hungry for more, almost to the point of  going back to the beginning to read the whole thing again, in your thoughts  and dreams if not in reality. This is a great read.  It is my first book  by this author, but I will seek out even more of his work.
