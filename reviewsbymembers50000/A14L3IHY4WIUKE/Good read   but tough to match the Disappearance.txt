 There is a bit of a conundrum here.  If you haven't read The Disappearance before reading this one, you will enjoy this one more, because you won't know the true mystery maestro that Freedman can be.  BUT, if you haven't read The Disappearance, you won't know the background on Luke and Riva  which adds interest and wrinkles to Above the Law. This is a good read.   The mystery is well presented, and the author gives readers several  believable red herrings to suspect and follow before ultimately revealing  who the killer is.  It is well paced, and Freedman is a gifted writer,  particularly in capturing the aura of places: Santa Barbara, and the small  towns of Northern California, among others. Ultimately, though, it  doesn't measure up to the riveting, edge-of-the-seat,  I've-got-to-stay-up-all-night-to-finish-this-book drama that Freedman  offered in The Disappearance. Above The Law is a very good novel, but not  the truly great read that Freedman offered mystery lovers with The  Disappearance.
