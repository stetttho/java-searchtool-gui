 The interesting thing about reading the screenplay and the story it was based on was seeing how Kubrick took the story and translated it into  modern times and a different locale. The story itself, in both its  screenplay and original short-novel form, isn't that good.  It's too weird,  and too shallow, and the conclusion doesn't make any sense. Perhaps it  was Kubrick's legendary film-making that overcame those flaws.  Having not  seen the movie, I don't know.  Readers, in my opinion, would be just as  well to give this book a pass.
