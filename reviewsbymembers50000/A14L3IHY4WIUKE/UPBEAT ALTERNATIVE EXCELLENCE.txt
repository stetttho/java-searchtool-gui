 This album is awesome!  And the more you listen, the better it gets. It starts off strong with the excellent "Dilate," and never weakens through all eight tracks.  My personal favorite is "She Knows," but there isn't a bad song on the CD. Right now FSM is best-known for their appearances on "Buffy."  The day is coming, though, when they are known for selling a lot of albums and rocking packed-house stadiums.  Grab this album now!
