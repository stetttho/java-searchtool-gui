 This is a great read...full of mystery and suspense. It is also filled  with deep and finely-drawn characters.  Iles does a wonderful job of  unwrapping layer after layer of secrets and mysteries until the lives of  the characters are laid bare and the mystery's answer is finally  revealed. Iles also does a great job with settings, painting a gripping  portrait of his home town and of life in the South. I would rank this  effort with anything written by John Grisham, and I am eagerly looking  forward to reading another of Mr. Iles' books.
