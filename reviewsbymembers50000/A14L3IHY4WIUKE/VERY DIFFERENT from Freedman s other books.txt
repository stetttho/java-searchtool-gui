 OK, first, throw out of your mind all thoughts of Freedman's other books you've read (The Disappearance, Above the Law, etc).  This book is TOTALLY different.  No lawyers, no detectives, no murders... Once you've done  that, you're more ready to accept this book on its own terms: the  coming-of-age story of Roy Poole, a young teen growing up in Maryland in  the late 1950s. This is Roy's story, told in his words.  When you accept  it as that, it is quite good, and at times enthralling.  Young Roy is white  and poor, and The Obstacle Course of his life takes him into contact with  rich folks, black folks, and other folks.  Through it all, he keeps his eye  on his ultimate goal: to be a student at the US Naval Academy. As a  teen-age boy, Roy's thoughts return often to sex, and his gutter mouth will  be offensive to some readers. In the end, Roy finds out what all of us  must at some point: that he's on his own in the world.  He must stand with  the results of his choices, and ultimately it will be Roy Poole that  decides how much Roy Poole can accomplish.  In that sense, the message of  this book is a good one. I was left unsatisfied, though, by the ending.   Freedman did not seem to tie up the strings of the story into a satisfying  knot.  I was struck by the thought that the Roy we see at the ending is not  consistent with the Roy we've seen before, and the central question of his  future is not completely answered. Or maybe the answer is up to the  reader...to you and me.
