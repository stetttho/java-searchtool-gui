 After reading Primal Fear, the gripping, skip-work-until-you-finish-it Martin Vail novel that pre-dates this book, I couldn't wait to get into "Show of Evil." But once into it, I found it disappointing, not  up to the high standards set by Primal Fear. The story here seems to get  lost, as if Diehl can't decide whether to write a straight sequel about  Aaron Stampler (now "cured" of his mental illness), or a new  mystery for Martin Vail to solve, with just hints of Stampler.  The book  gets better towards the end, when Diehl gets off the sidetracks and brings  us Stampler in all his evil genius, and Vail's attempts to bring him  down. Another thing I questioned in the book is the dramatic change in  some of the characters after Primal Fear.  Vail, the great defense  attorney, is now the DA?  Venable and Vail, once sworn courtroom enemies,  now sliding between the sheets together?  I know 10 years is a long time,  but some of the transformations seemed to stretch credulity. And the  close of the book, seeming to leave the door open for yet another sequel?   Please, Mr. Diehl, move on to a new evil genius. This isn't a bad read,  and in parts is quite good.  But it isn't "Primal Fear."
