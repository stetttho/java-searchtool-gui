 There's a lot I like about this book.  It's an easy read, divided up into bite-size chunks so that it's easy to pick up and put down when you're on a schedule. It's also long on practical advice and low on voodoo and magic.  It's in plain English and it makes sense.  It gives practical, real-world actions that you can take to make yourself into a better leader, and to attract quality leaders around you. This is a great book if you are already in a leadership position and want to brush up your skills, or if you're looking to build yourself into leadership material.
