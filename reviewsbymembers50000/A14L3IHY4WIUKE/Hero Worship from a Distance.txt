 Interesting story about one man's rise from the porch of poverty to the mansions of Beverly Hills.  The story is well researched and well reported,  but it seems that Geffen is a hero to the author, and there is a positive  slant placed on almost all his actions. The actions of his rivals are seen  almost always in a negative light. The choice for references was kind of  strange to me, too, including long quotes from "Queer in  America." This shows the work of a hero-worshipping author writing  from afar.  One who sat down with David Geffen and spent time and effort to  interview and understand the man might come up with a much different, and  much better, work.
