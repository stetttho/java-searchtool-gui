 You'll need free time until you're finished, because you won't want to put it down! This is a great read, a courtroom drama and murder mystery that  keeps you guessing until the final scenes unfold. The backbone of the  book is the wonderfully drawn characters, especially Luke and Riva.  Luke  is the one-time prosecutor defending the man everyone thinks is guilty.   His motivations are complex and finely drawn by an author with a gift for  emotional details, the kind that make a character stand up off the page and  come alive. The roller-coaster ride plot takes you behind the thin veneer  of a rich Santa Barbara family, into the dark corners and locked closets of  their lives...the places they want no one to see.  Their beautiful,  innocent 14-year old daughter has been murdered.  But how innocent was  she? Freedman earns high marks as a mystery maestro, a true craftsman of  the genre.  If you like the well-drawn characters of Richard North  Patterson and the courtroom pyrotechnics of early John Grisham, you've  gotta read The Disappearance!
