 I have to admit something up front:  my favorite part of Stephen King's books is the "Author Note" section.  I've always enjoyed getting a little picture into his mind, or where the story came from, or how this idea blossomed into a full-fledged novel. Well, ON WRITING is one long "Author Note" section, and I loved it! He starts out with his life, and he tells his story with his trademark humor and candor.  It wasn't always pretty for little Stevie, growing up with a single, less-than-fully-employed mom.  This book shows how those experiences shaped him and his fiction. King's candor is shined on everything in his life, including drug and alcohol abuse and his recent encounter with a speeding mini-van and the recovery battle. It also gives us a window into the King marriage.  Tabitha doesn't get as much publicity as her husband, but this book makes it clear that they are indeed partners in life.  She obviously captured his heart as a college boy, and owns it to this day.  After telling his personal story, King shares some insights for writers.  This is not a college text book, though. King is up front that he is sharing ideas that work for him, but they won't work for everyone. I love his analogy of story as dinosaur bones...it's already there in your mind, you just have to dig for it and uncover it. Reading this book, you sense that King doesn't take himself to seriously.  You sense that he'd be a fun guy to sit down and have a cup of coffee with, to chat about baseball.  You also sense his intense dedication to his craft, his passion for telling you a story. This is an outstanding resource for writers, but perhaps even more meaningful and valuable to King fans.  It's an "Authors Note" that you won't want to put down, and you don't want to miss.
