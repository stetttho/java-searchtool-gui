 This book leaves you panting...you will not want to put it down. It involves some well-drawn characters and a pulse-pounding plot, and an ending that sends chills up and down your spine. Martin Vail is the hero  of the story, a lawyer charged with representing a young boy accused of a  brutal killing.  The book tells the story of building the boy's defense,  and trying to save him from an open-and-shut prosecution case and a date  with the electric chair. The writing is well done, the plotting is  terrific and the finale is breath-taking.  This is the book Michael  Crichton hopes to write when he grows up!
