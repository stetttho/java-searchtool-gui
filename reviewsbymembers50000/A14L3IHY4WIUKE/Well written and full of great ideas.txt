 Whether you are standing up in front of a joint session of Congress or a sub-committee of your local PTF, this book is a great resource. Noonan knows of which she writes, having written speeches for the Great Communicator himself, Ronald Reagan.  The stories of working side by side  with Reagan were a high point of the book, at least for this Republican  reader. Ultimately, the strength of this work, though is the practical  advice she gives to every speaker.  This is a nuts-and-bolts manuel to  writing and delivering a speech.  It's also an easy, quick read, the kind  you can refer back to for years. An excellent resource for anyone who has  to stand up in front of people and talk!
