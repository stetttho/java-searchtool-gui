 Whenever you open a novel, you know what you are reading isfiction.  You sign a silent pact with the author to suspend yourdisbelief, to enter the world of the story. That only works if the author respects the readers enough to present a plausible story.  It didn't happen, of course, it's fiction.  But it could have... The basic weakness of this novel is that there are too many "out of the blue" plot twists.  The reader feels jerked around, manipulated, and the story comes off as completly unbelievable. She's his friend...no wait, she's a government agent...no, wait, she works for the mafia...no, wait, she has a heart of gold.  It's too much, even for someone who has signed that silent pact to suspend disbelief. The basic plot here is intriguing.  As a JFK assasination buff, I was drawn into the story.  But once inside, I found it far less than satisfying.  END
