 This one absolutely is a thrill ride! I have read several of Koontz' books, but none had the pulse-pounding, sweaty hands, gotta-keep-reading-until-I-finish pace of Intensity. Koontz does such a good job in getting inside of his characters, and Chyna is one of his best.   The incidents from her childhood and how they play in her mind make her a  real and three-dimensional character. The villain here is a  conscience-less reptile, and is presented in a way that sickens but also  entices the reader.  We cringe at his acts and tremble at his thoughts, but  at the same time we admire his thoroughness.  Obviously, a man with a  passion for what he does! The finale is wonderful and satisfying, and  this book is a must-read for suspense fans everywhere!
