 This is a great listening experience.  From the hard-rockin' roots of "Born to Run" to the soulful, introspective side in songs like "Secret Garden" and "Streets of Philadelphia," this CD  has it all. Sure, every great song Bruce has recorded isn't  here...frankly, that takes the boxed set.  But a great selection is here.   And as a younger fan, I was excited to hear some of the great songs of his  early albums that I hadn't heard before...like The River. The highlight,  here, is the liner notes...with a note from Bruce about each song.  A great  chance to look into his mind, and see what he was thinking at the time of  each song. This is a great, great CD...and it belongs in the collection  of every rock fan.
