 I like the premise that Koontz starts with here: that your goal as a writer should be to have as many people as possible read your book.  That is my goal as a writer, and I found the book incredibly helpful and  insightful.  Obviously, Koontz knows what he's talking about, with millions  of books in print. This is a very practical guide: long on examples and  practical lists and short on voodoo and magic.  Koontz breaks writing down  into understandable pieces, whereas some writing books I've read spend far  too much time on touchy-feely things that are hard to understand or  emulate. There is much practical advice here, not only in the writing of  best-sellers, but also in the business of books, dealing with contracts and  agents, etc. There's even a reading list of books and authors that will  inspire the aspiring novelist. My one complaint is that, even in the 20  years since this was written, the publishing industry has changed  dramatically.  I would LOVE to see Koontz update this tome with a 21st  century edition, addressing some of the changes he's seen in the course of  his career. I'd also like to see an updated reading list...I wonder which  authors Koontz would praise now? An excellent resource for writers, even  if you have to pay quite a bit for it!
