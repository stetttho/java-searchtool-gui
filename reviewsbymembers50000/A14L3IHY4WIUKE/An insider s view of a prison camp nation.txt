 This book is a wake-up call to those of us in free nations: an icy bucket  of water to help us open our eyes and appreciate the freedoms we  have. Soon Ok Lee was living the easy, ordered life of a Communist party  worker in North Korea.  She was able to travel some in her job as a  procurer of goods.  However, when one official requested more than his  share, Soon Ok told him no, making an enemy for life, and an enemy that  cost her the life she had known. Set up on false charges, she was sent to  prison camp.  She was told at the gate to forget that she was human if she  was to have any hope of survival.  Her story is graphic in its details and  shocking at the total lack of value given to human lives in North  Korea. Singled out for some of the worse treatment in the prison were  people of one group: Christians.  The so called "heaven people"  (for it was illegal to mention God) were treated even worse than the  general prison population.  Soon Ok couldn't understand why these people  refused to deny their God and save their lives.  She was even more  surprised that these believers would willingly take the punishment of  others on themselves, sometimes even to the point of giving their lives for  another prisoner. Miraculously, Soon Ok survived the prison.  She was  released and returned home only to find that her husband had disappeared.   With her son, she determined that she could no longer live in a country  that promised equality for all people and then treated so many as  "tailless animals." This narrative goes quickly, but will stay  with the reader, haunting with its descriptions and with the thought of  what is still going on in North Korea. May it drive us to prayer for  those still under the boot of oppression in North Korea.
