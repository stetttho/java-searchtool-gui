 Whether you're a fan of U2 or of popular music in general, you SIMPLY MUST HAVE THIS CD. There are no bad songs on it.  There are no mediocre songs on it.  Each song is unique and moving and wonderful.  Each time you listen you'll catch some new wrinkle of Bono's singing or a lyrical line that you hadn't caught before. There is a wonderful depth to the music and the lyrics.  It is music for thinking people who aren't afraid of their feeling side. Intellectual romantics. As always with U2, there is a message to the music as well. If the only song you've heard is the radio favorite "Beautiful Day," then you haven't even scratched the surface of this wonderful work.   BUY IT TODAY, and listen for a lifetime.
