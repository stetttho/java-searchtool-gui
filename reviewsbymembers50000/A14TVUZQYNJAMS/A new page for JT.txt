 October Road is a breath of fresh air.  Its predecessors, Hourglass in particular, met with great critical acclaim, but left me regretting James Taylor's indifferent settling into adult contemporary boredom.  On October Road, JT drops the synths and explores different edges to his music, something that I hadn't heard on a James Taylor album since Dad Loves His Work. The comfortable foundation of this album is necessarily the tunes done in the vein of JT's greatest hits: "September Grass," "October Road," "My Traveling Star" and a few others come to mind.  These tracks show why Taylor is the greatest down-home balladeer since, well, ever.  The tunes that are clearly written for pop-singledom are done tastefully: "Whenever You're Ready" is the most obvious example, with "On the 4th of July following as a somewhat unorthodox second.  "Raised Up Family" is reminiscent of Dad Loves His Work's "Stand and Fight" and In The Pocket's "Money Machine," underrated tunes that lay down the funk in a unique way that only JT can pull off.  Tunes like "Mean Old Man" and "Belfast to Boston" don't come from James's typical mold, and are refreshing. In addition to being the best JT album since his last collaboration with Russ Titelman, In The Pocket, October Road has taken great advantage of advances in modern recording technologies.  I didn't realize how really great this album was until I listened to it on a set of quality headphones. Recommended for everyone.  Best new album I've heard in years, hands down.
