 As a huge fan of Bulgakov's masterpiece Master and Margarita, I really enjoyed this book.  It's a delightfully quick and witty read.  Heart of a Dog is full of pointed references at Soviet society, many of which are outdated, but many of which are fully comprehensible and applicable by modern, Western readers.  The satirical nature and tone that came to ultimate fruition with Master and Margarita can be traced through this book, making for an overall short, enjoyable read.
