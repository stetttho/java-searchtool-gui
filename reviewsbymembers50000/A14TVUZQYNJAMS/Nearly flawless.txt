 ONE MAN DOG is a great work of art and is probably my favorite album of all time.  The follow up to mega hits SWEET BABY JAMES and MUD SLIDE SLIM AND THE BLUE HORIZON, ONE MAN DOG often catches flack for its failure to live up to its predecessors.  In some ways, these criticisms are correct, but overall they are too harsh and do not take into account the nature of the album. This album is best described as a suite of brief musical experiments, in the vein of ABBEY ROAD.  Stylistically, ONE MAN DOG runs the gammut much more (and to a greater degree of success) than any other JT album.  Songs range from James' familiar easy folk rock ("Nobody But You", "New Tune") to country-tinged funk ("Chili Dog", "Fool for You", "Woh, Don't You Know") to smooth, bass driven jazz changes ("Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight") and everything in between.  JT's backup band, along with his own versatile compositional talent, make these styles cohere effectively, convincingly, and seamlessly. Some of the sounds on ONE MAN DOG are some of the most beautiful sounds ever recorded; the tambour of the instruments, the notes chosen by the musicians, Peter Asher's mastering, etc. all combine to create aesthetically orgasmic ear-candy.   The reason I give this album only 4 stars is because it is painfully undeveloped.  The music is in many places raw and JT's attempt at fruition on his ideas falls short.  The emotional highs developed by the medley of sounds and the brilliant organization of the tracks are cut short too abruptly by this failure to reach maturity on the songs.  It makes for a bit of a bumpy ride. In all, I highly recommend this album to anyone who is interested in out-of-the-ordinary albums or who is a James Taylor fan of any merit.  At first listen, especially for those who are not familiar with much of JT's work, it may be confusing and unsatisfying.  In the end, however, the music on  ONE MAN DOG has the capacity to bring the listener to tears.
