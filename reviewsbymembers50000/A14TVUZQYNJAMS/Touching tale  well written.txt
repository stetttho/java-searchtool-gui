 I had the great fortune of seeing Mr. Bardach and Ms. Gleeson speak at my university.  Bardach briefly related his tale to the room, and they both then discussed the challenges and the joys of writing the book.  If memory serves, the talk was given on September 12 or 13, 2001--giving special poignancy to the early passages on the falling of bombs, the fear of invasion, and the family huddled around the radio, fearing what was to come. Needless to say, I bought the book, and was not disappointed.  As other reviewers have pointed out, this is one of those rare non-fiction pieces that reads like a novel: Indeed, it is the occassional recollection that you're reading a memoir that makes it especially gripping.  The story was, of course, unbelievably touching in its harrowing and heroic qualities, and the mis-en-texte, facilitated by Ms. Gleeson, put it in a language that is both unpretentiously personal and deeply insightful. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in this tragic period of world history or merely in the human struggle to survive.
