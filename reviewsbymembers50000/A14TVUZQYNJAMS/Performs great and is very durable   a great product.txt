 Having purchased a cordless mouse a few months earlier and really enjoying the freedom it provided, I picked up this cordless keyboard about 8 or 9 months ago.  It has proven itself to be one of the best investments I've made in a long time. I've been nothing but impressed with its range.  The six foot range advertised is nothing for this keyboard...actually, just fot the heck of it, I'm sitting across the room right now to type this review--around 10 feet away--and the keyboard is picking up every stroke (I think I should move closer...my eyes are starting to get strained!). I've also been extremely impressed with the durability of this product.  Being cordless, this keyboard tends to get picked up and moved a lot, and, as a result, dropped.  I've dropped this one several times and there really isn't even a scratch on it.  Also, it's running on its original batteries--2 AAA's--which I think is pretty impressive, considering how much I type. The layout is also really nice.  I've never quite gotten used to the Logitech Pro or the Microsoft Natural keyboard layout...this one is classic, and suits me fine.  The CD player controls on the keyboard are also a nice touch, as are the "favorites" buttons, that will take you to a specified web site or launch a particular program. This keyboard is worth the investment.  I'm thinking about getting the mouse, too.
