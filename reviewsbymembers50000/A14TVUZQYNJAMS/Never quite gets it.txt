  Basically, "The Simpsons and Philosophy" sums up my entire life.  I'd been philosophizing about/during/with _The Simpsons_ long before I'd even heard this book existed.  Once it was released I was quick to get it.  Unfortunately, I was not thrilled with the book's content.  I've also read the other installment in this series, _Seinfeld and Philosophy_, and the more essays I read in the _Simpsons_ version, the more I sadly realized that this was just an attempt to cash in on the success of the earlier version with a lesser-quality rip-off.  Not that the book is all bad.  There are some high points.  Springfield's ambivalence towards Lisa's intellectualism is illustrated carefully and humorously.  Some of the forays into the moral structure of the Simpson universe were successful.  Unfortunately, though, the majority of the book was not.  Many of the scholars who contributed (very successfully) to _Seinfeld and Philosophy_ were invited back this time around, but it is painfully clear that many of them have never really watched _The Simpsons_ in the careful way they have _Seinfeld_.  The book gets off to a rough start with an Aristotelian evaluation of Homer's ethics, in which Homer is shown to be, more or less, a monster.  Any true fan of the show has to feel a little uncomfortable with that assessment.  Several other aspects of the show are analyzed in similarly unfamiliar ways.   The few essays that do show sufficient knowledge of _The Simpsons_ tend to be, well, not really philsophical, while the philosophically sound essays are devoid of Springfieldian prowess.  Essays dealing with gender roles and family structure belong more under the heading of Sociology than Philosophy, etc.  If you really, _really_ love _The Simpsons_, you should get this book.  If you're looking for a philosophical primer, however, or a flippant jaunt into the hilarity of the series, don't look here.  You'll be disappointed.
