  I've been quite fond of Seinfeld through its entire run; even at the young age of 12 or 13 I would watch and enjoy first-run episodes.  Now I am a philosophy major.  Buying this book was, well, natural.   The high points of this book are high indeed.  It's easy to tell which of these essays sparked the original concept for the book: they shine with sharp wit, understanding of the Seinfeld universe and real philosophical explorations.  These best of the best essays offer philosophy truly relevant to the show.  The essays on nothingness and on morals come to mind; after all, the writers intentionally made these topics central to the show.   From that point, the works write themselves--and it shows.  A few of the more disappointing essays seem to be space fillers: they needed chapters on Kramer and Elaine, so they attempted to find philosophical significance in them.  Not that what they came up with is bad, just not as in-your-face Seinfeldian as several of the other topics.   All in all, this is a very solid collection, providing a bridge between two subjects that everyone, in their heart of hearts, always knew were related :)
