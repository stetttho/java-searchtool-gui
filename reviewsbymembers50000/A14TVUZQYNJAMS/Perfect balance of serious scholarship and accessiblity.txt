 I first found this book in my high school library.  When I stumbled upon it in my local bookstore, I couldn't resist.  Its graphic richness makes it a great coffee table book (and conversation starter--see section on linguistic pet peeves), yet the continuous accompanying text makes for a good (if not exhausting) straight read-through.  Well researched, organized, and selected material--there is little in this book that is less than fascinating.
