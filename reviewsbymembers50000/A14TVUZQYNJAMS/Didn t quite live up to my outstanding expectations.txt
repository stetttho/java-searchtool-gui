 It is, needless to say, a welcome pleasure to have these episodes on DVD.  The video quality seems to be excellent.  The sound also seems good; I watched an episode in French today and was very pleased with the audio options. The features are a little hit and miss.  The foreign language clips are very interesting, as is the commentary on animation.  "The Simpsons: America's First Family" is pretty good, just a little short.  Extremely disappointing was the commentary to the outtakes from "Some Enchanted Evening"; the extent of it is basically the five or six bigwigs on The Simpsons talking about how horrible it was.  Kinda sad. Buy these DVDs, but don't expect too much from the extras.  Hopefully they'll step it up a notch (more 'making of', maybe) in subsequent editions.
