 I was a huge fan of the original GTA.  In the same way that Pac Man and Tetris are the sorts of games wherein the fun never ends, GTA excelled.  GTA2 went downhill a bit, and with GTA3 the fun is lost. This isn't to say that GTA3 is not a great game--it is.  The graphics, sound, gameplay, everything is nearly perfect.  There is hardly a thing in the game that is not exceedingly realistic. That, however, is what I don't particularly like about the game.  GTA1 was great because of its cartoonish wit and simplicity.  In multiplayer mode especially, the winner was the person who was the most skilled.  As the series has moved along, however, it has become more about who finds the biggest weapon.  Cars break down too easily and don't handle well enough.  The police are too smart.  Pedestrians are few and far between.  Simply put, the details are so good that it makes the gameplay much more difficult and, for me, removes a lot of the pure joy of playing the game--not to mention the un-PC tongue-in-cheekiness of the original, and even GTA2. This is a great game for people who love first person shooter games, people who get off on beating people with baseball bats, and anyone who likes slick-looking and -playing computer games.  Fans of the GTA series from way back might be disappointed, however.  I'm sticking to the original.
