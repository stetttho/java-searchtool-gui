 I bought this mouse on a whim about 18 months ago.  At first, I was really happy with the results: I kept the receiver within 2 feet of the mouse and usually within the supposedly unnecessary line-of-sight.  I really enjoyed the way that the cordlessness freed up my desktop space. It wasn't long, however, before I started having problems.  The first was the batteries.  I also own a cordless keyboard, which has been running on the original batteries for about 8 months now.  I understand that a mouse, because the information is so much more sensitive, would use batteries faster than the keyboard...a set of batteries every month or two, however, is a little more than I would like to go through. The power problem, however, was the least of my worries.  Due to a somewhat unorthodox computer setup I had earlier this year, it worked best to have the mouse receiver and the mouse itself on seperate surfaces (one on a bookshelf, the other on a nearby table).  Even within the manual's suggested 3 feet, there was absolutely no response from the mouse.  I had to change my entire setup in order to have my mouse on the same surface as the receiver--apparently the radio waves are better transmitted that way. Anyway, the worst thing is that a few months ago the wheel stopped working.  As a third button it still functions normally, but as a scroller there is no response.  I can't use Microsoft customer support; it must have run out after a year (although I must give it to them, when I was having the earlier transmission problems, tech support was friendly and quick-responding).  So now I'm stuck with a wheel mouse without a wheel.  It's frustrating. In conclusion, don't buy this mouse.  The freedom is nice, but it is a very limited freedom, and the durability of the mouse seems pretty shabby.  I've heard nothing but good about Logitech...hmmm....
