 There is nothing inherently wrong with this book.  It clearly states her philosophy--a solid, logical one to which I owe nothing but respect--and the writing is, as Rand's prose usually is, uninspiring but efficient.  Unfortunately, however, Anthem has little signifigance other than that it came before Rand's two larger novels.  To learn about Objectivism, her outright philsophy, The Virtue of Selfishness, for example, is the source.  For dramatizations, look to The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged.  For early Soviet distopian works, Zamyatin's WE is contextually more interesting (and, perhaps, watered down) Novel or poem, fiction or manifesto, Anthem is neccessary reading only for those who haven't the time to trudge through a bigger book or those looking to complete Rand's corpus.
