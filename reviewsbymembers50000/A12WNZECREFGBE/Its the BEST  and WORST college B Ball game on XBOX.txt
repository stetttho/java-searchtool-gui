 im saying that in a hypothetical sense, since it is the only college hoops game on the Box. let me go through the pros. Pros: LEGACY MODE: Magnifico! Sheer Brilliance! A triumph for sega! GYM RAT MODE: a little arcade in this game, unlike NFL 2k3 WIDE SELECTION of TEAMS: from Sell-out crowd Duke to small time Coastal Carolina, all division-I schools are here  MAN VS. MAN: A Good 2 player game on or offline LEGACY MODE: i know i already mentioned this, but it is all the rage. Beautiful! Cons: FANS: Ugh, Sega can do better than CARDBOARD Designs! SOME FEATURES IN IN-GAME PLAY: too easy to get backcourt violation, fouls called too seldom, way too easy to steal, goaltending rule is whack, and the free throw system takes some time to get used to, but ull get the hang of it. A QUESTION: how do some fans in a block hold up a big sign that says, "ESPN" on it? and then the same group of people put up Brick signs when they come up to the free throw line?
