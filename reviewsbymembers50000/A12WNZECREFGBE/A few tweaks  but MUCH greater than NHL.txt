 Hossman's Scale: 4.6/5.0 Rating: A- Pros: 1:Some game that can actually compete with EA's hunk of junk 2: #1 in REALISM!!! (the first time they're fighting for a puck on the boards) 3: Franchise Mode is still fun 4: The only game on XBOX u can play online 5: Pretty Deep commentary... Cons 1: ... that cant even pronounce names of players correctly 2: Graphics feel like ur playing NHL 99 on N64 3: No Franchise Revamp like in NFL and NBA?! Perplexing: You would think ESPN would give Sega Sports it's best commentators. Final Verdict: BUY!!! if you hate EA's NHL game. Whatever you do, at least rent it.
