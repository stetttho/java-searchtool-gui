 I decided to rent this game because of the praise that I had received from numerous magazines about the original Red Faction. Now, let me tell you, this is nothing compared to the original Red Faction. For some reason, THQ had put it on cruise control for this version and instead of making it better, they had made it much worse. This game is a Run and Gunner, which I said on the title. If you are not into this genre, don't rent it.  Pros: 1. Walls can be blown up, dented, fragged, etc. (original, I think)  2. Solid Multiplayer Mode (up to 4 players with bots.... but can only have 6 playing though.)  Cons: 1. Plot is very stale (don't really get a background on Sopot (supposed "bad guy") or any of the main characters. And the plot twist in the middle of the game does little to make it interesting)  2. Cutscenes redefine the definition of "bare bones" (some take less than 5 seconds!)  3. "Multiple endings" is a joke (no real change in ending of game, just a change in the AFTERMATH of the game which is not affected by decisions, but by only friendly fire!)  4. Graphics leave much to be desired.  5. Grenade throwing is iffy.  6. music and sound aren't that good either.  Final Verdict: My belief is that this game is not worthy of being bought. Unless you don't have Halo and need a multiplayer game. But rent it if you wish to experience it.
