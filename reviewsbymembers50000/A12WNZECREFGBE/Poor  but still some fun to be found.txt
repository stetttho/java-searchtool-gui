 This takes a while so be patient. Pros: 1. First Simpsons title since 1998 2. Much Better than Simpsons Wrestling 3. Real voices by simpsons actors. 4. Many a shortcut on this game. 5. a fun 2 player game 6. some good jokes... Cons: 1. ...that get repetitive faster than the color commentator on NHL 2003! 2. graphics look like Robotech:Battlecry meets Superman (boo hoo hoo!) 3. difficulty settings are just too easy (its actually easier to get $$$ on hard) 4. voiceovers get repetitive in one run! 5. little plot at all, just the problem and the solution, no plot twists or the sort. too predictable 6. Mission mode: WAY too easy! 7. voiceovers lag badly. 8. all about the objective in the end (not good for a comedy king like the simpsons) 9. End Sequence not that good. 10. In game lips do not even move at all! 11. Cut scene graphics are much better than in In Game (did i mention that the cut scenes with Montgomery Burns get repetitive too) 12. Loading times are RIDICULOUSLY SLOW! oh man such a poor game graphically and it takes so long to load. (Ouch!) Final Verdict: RENT FIRST![.] It would have been an ACCEPTABLE game for the N64, but they dont even tamper with the Xbox's potential. A lamentable day for all simpsons fans
