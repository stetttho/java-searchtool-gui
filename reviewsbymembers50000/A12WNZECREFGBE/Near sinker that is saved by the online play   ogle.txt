 Someone help me! Because I am addicted to this game!!! This game has replaced Unreal as the Online King... for now. So if you are stuck in a mind bending decision between Rainbow Six 3 and Counter-Strike, I would definitely recommend Rainbow Six 3 by a land slide. Pros: 1. Online Play! It rocks! It's all the rave! Id give it eight...teen thumbs up!!! (its that good)(insert drool here if in agreement) 2. Voice communication in the single player action adds to the experience 3. A mass array of weapons to choose from Cons: 1. Single player missions are repetitive, only consisting of hostage rescuing and bomb defusing plus recon missions which require, yes, bomb diffusing and hostage rescuing... without getting caught (whoopie! NOT!) 2. WHERE'S THE STRATEGY?! Does the USA wing their recon missions? I mean this was what Rainbow Six was all about, strategy, now they're making it into more of a glorified FPS! 3. Graphics are too PS2-ish 4. youll only use about 3-5 weapons in primary weapons, 1 in secondary weapons and frag grenades (the rest are basically useless to the enemy) 5. many cheats in the online game (Molotov cocktails, Action Replay, and Wall glitching to name a few) + Ubisoft is working too slow, if working at all to fix these problems 6. Is there any way to turn off the music? (PLEASE MAKE IT STOP! MAKE THE SHODDY EXCUSE FOR PATRIOTIST RESCUE MUSIC IN THE MENU STOP!!!!!) Final Verdict: The only thing that saves this from being a Drake or a Dead Man's Hand is basically the online play. Even though there are glitches in the online game that I have talked about, Id still buy it basically for the online play
