 I've got a real bone to pick with EA. They just keep giving the Xbox wavw after wave of games with poor graphics and less features than on the PS2. Now, I am real close to dumping EA and begin playing Sega Sports games (which has some very sold games) PROS: 1. everything Triple Play wasnt 2. some original spots (throw meter, franchise momentum, etc.) 3. commentary is decent CONS: 1. lightyears behind the other baseball games 2. yet another case of PS2 graphics syndrome 3. Faces look pasted on 4. controls are confusing 5. there is no point to Pitching 6. Franchise mode is all hype 7. cannot control fielding at all 8. impossible to get on base 9. beginning trailer is a real turnoff FINAL VERDICT: do not waste your time and money on buying this game. If you think I'm wrong, rent it first, then well see whos saying, "why didn't you tell me this game stunk?"
