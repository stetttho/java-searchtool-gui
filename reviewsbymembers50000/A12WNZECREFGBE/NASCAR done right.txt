 I played last years version and was pleased with the progress it was making. This year its 2002 version times 10! Pros: 1. NASCAR is better than ever! 2. last years tweaks are fixed 3. an improvement in graphics 4. outstanding career mode 5. so many modes, that it will keep you busy for months! 6. the ability to import songs is available Cons: 1. physics take some time to get used to 2. first years of career mode are frustrating due to crapiness of car and crew Final Verdict: A definite buy! as i said earlier, it will keep you busy for months
