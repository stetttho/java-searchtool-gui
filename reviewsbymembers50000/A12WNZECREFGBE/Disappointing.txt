 I have been a simpsons fanatic for the past 5 years and am humiliated by this ...video game. for 1 thing the Simpsons is a great show so it shouldnt have a scummy video game like this one. they must have been on a low budget making the game. Here are 5 good reasons why this game shouldnt have been invented 1. The graphics are bland, their entrances to the car are absurd. (Hans Moleman doing a flip into a car?!) 2. The mission mode is unbelieveably sinchy. 3. They dont even have all of the characters. (No Patty + Selma, no Julius Hibbert, No Lenny + Carl to name a few) 4. The lines get dull + repetitive in 10 minutes and most of the lines are from old simpsons episodes. 5. This is just [an]... imitation of some game i forget the name of........ oh yeah, CRAZY TAXI!!!!!! I rest my case.
