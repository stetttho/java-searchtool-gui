 I decided to rent the game because i am a NASCAR fan and this game is excellent, no hands down. the graphics are right on, you dont finish when you crash, has a deep selection of racers to choose from, and you get cash in career mode to improve cars and you get sponsors. But this game is not perfect any how.  The career mode has a few catches to it, you cant change the settings of 5% race, no caution flags, and minimal damage, so its not a simulated game. you cant change difficulty during career mode because rokkie gets easy, way too easy during year 2, the racing season is only 12 races so thats a bummer, and the Career mode isnt as Deep as i thought it would be, drivers only retire when they finish low in the standings, and the people that replace the people who retired are the racers who dont race all season long and are high in the points race.
