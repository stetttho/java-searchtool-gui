 Pros: 1. FINALLY!!!! IT IS ON THE XBOX!!!!!!!!! 2. Two games for the price of one 3. Unlimited Freedom!!!! (if you want to get a tank and just annihilate people and cops, you can)(If you want to eat some pizza, you can do that too)(If you want to pee in the ocean, well, maybe you cant do that.) 4. Do many different odd-jobs for cash (Taxi Driver, Fireman, Policeman, stunt driver, or even a vigilante) 5. Excellent Voice Acting (makes you feel like this is a movie) 6. The infamous island transfer on the PS2 is almost nonexistent in the Xbox (less than 1 sec) 7. Lips move on the Xbox now. 8. Beautiful soundtrack (available for a very cheap rate as well) 9. The rest of the great goodness on the PS2 as well. Cons: 1. Not enough extras to convert PS2 players to the Xbox version 2. Plot is just so-so 3. My mom won't let me buy it because it is too "violent" FINAL VERDICT: BUY IT DARN YOU!!!!! BUY IT!!! As it says in the game, "Tie up your daughters, shoot your sons, 'cuz Love Fist is comin' to your town... er GTA is out for Xbox!"
