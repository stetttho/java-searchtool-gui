 When my little sister first got this game, I thought it would be like any other Sims game I played. Play it then get bored in 10 minutes. You see, I never really fell in love with the PC Sims game. Maybe it was because of the snail-slow loading times, maybe something else. But I am highly suprised with this game. PROS: 1. The Sims are on XBOX! 2. Some good 2-player mini games 3. The Get a Life mode is a great addition. 4. And the same old Sims goodness (court wife, court neigbors wife, court neighbors daughter, court girlfriend, etc.) 5. and some more extra goodies in between (did I hear Monkey Butler?) 6, you got to earn the original sims mode and other goodies (in the original menu, it only has "Get A Life" mode) CONS: 1. There is something missing in the graphics, but I cant tell what 2. Controls are hard to understand and frustrating 3. you've played the original sims version before 4. Only has the first 3 sims version on it (so there is no vacation mode, no pets, and no nightlife) 5. the Love Bed is locked when you start the game. THE LOVE BED!!! 6. I HATE DUDLEY LANDGRABB!!! He is so lazy! He doesnt even answer the phone! (calls it "hell's bells") FINAL VERDICT: Avid Sims fans can sprint to the store to get this one. Casual fans can walk.
