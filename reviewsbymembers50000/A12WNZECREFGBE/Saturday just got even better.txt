 I did like NCAA 2003 with its freaky-deep Dynasty mode and all, but nothing prepared me for what NCAA 2004 had in store. Basically, it's NCAA 2003 with a facelift  Pros: 1. Its NCAA 2003... With a facelift! 2. EA Sports teams up with Sports Illustrated to make this a better game (the best moment in Sports Gaming since Sega meets ESPN!) 3. More Teams, Plays, and Mascots 4. The Best Dynasty Mode around just got even deeper 5. NCAA 101 will help newbies to the game by teaching then the basics (Offense, Defense, The Option, etc.) Cons: 1. The game has some bugs in it (one is where the game stalls for some random reason, but dont worry, this only happens for about 5 seconds then it returns to normal. Another is the typical EA bug where it sometimes does that "this disk cannot be read" thing) 2. Loading times are a travesty Final Verdict: Id say buy it, the bugs dont really ruin the game's image at all and with the SI contract, this game is a cant miss
