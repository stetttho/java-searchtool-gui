 when EA sports says it has the #1 hockey franchise ever. Well, if you wanted to know why its because it has no {explicit} competition for the past 10 years! well, lets look at the few positives that it has. Pros: 1.Realistic Shooting.(finally)        2.EA trax gives us ACTUAL and GOOD music.(finally) And now the Cons.        Cons: 1.A lot of em        2.In-game passing is horrid        3.Scores in 20 minute periods are unrealistic        4.Player control is depressing        5.A franchse mode that hasnt improved since NHL 2001        6.Play-by-Play gets repetitive fast        7.EA Online costs $$$ this year        8."New" pictures were taken at the start of last season Perplexing: when will someone ever come out with a good hockey game? The verdict: dont buy this if you have 2002 or 2001. only if you have 2000 or 99 for comp or just want to be kept up with statistics
