 Well, what do I say, I had written a review earlier dissing the game due to it's poor online play, and it was plain deplorable at one point. let me explain the maze a little for you: over 30 second connection times, freezing when you were trying to cancel a friend invite, slow gameplay, lag everywhere, 30 second pauses, 3 pauses rule (dont ask), if opponent quit and you quit after, the game counts against you. Oh, it was tragic! But luckilly for those of you who are catually waiting until tomorrow to buy it, they released a patch fixing these problems. But they still have the 30 second pause limit and the 3 pauses rule. (uuuuuggggghhhh) Pros: 1. the off-season dynasty mode is vastly improved (pipelines and recruiting influence) 2. actually hard to run 3. when the stadium is rowdy, the opponent will actually feel it (shaking of screen, composure braks down, etc.) 4. EA's missing link (go ahead, guess) 5. and it's fixed (even more yay!) 6. Create a sign will allow the player to customize your own signs (mine for big gain is "I'm driving (GET OFF THE STREETS!!!)" Cons: 1. Online pauses are like communism (see above) 2. Loading is slower in simming this year than last year, keaves something to be desired. Final Verdict: last time I had done this I had told people to disconnect their internet connections then play the game. Now, you can finally reconnect your internet connections after you download the patch. Trust me, it's much better than what I had to go through (uuuugggghhhhh!)
