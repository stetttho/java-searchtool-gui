 actually a suprise that I rented the game, thanks to Xbox magazine and the demo i played on the disk, I had no doubts when i rented this game. Pros: 1. It's Indiana Jones! AGAIN! 2. a mass array of weapons to choose from 3. fight Chinese, Turks, and, of course, NAZIS! 4. a good problem solving game 5. an Indiana Jones type of plot 6. superb acting 7. Suprisingly addictive 8. and yes, an excellent music score Cons: 1. Save Points poorly placed 2. killing people can be tedious later in the game (dont even think about killing people with the whip.) 3. Challenges can be confusing to younger gamers. Final Verdict: I order you to rent this game! Avid fans, casual fans, or people who dont even know who played Indy Jones in the movies will be entertianed. if an Indy addict or an archaeologist, Buy it Immediately!
