 Pros: 1. Man, this is addicting 2. Xbox Live enabled (for even more fun) 3. play and burn calories! (just what the doctor ordered for me!) 4. good fire-up tunes! Cons: 1. Not much separating it from the PS2 Editions 2. Steep learning curve (may take weeks to barely pass some of the songs if you do not have good hand eye coordination) 3. Other family members will want on it so you will have less time for DDR and other Xbox games. 4. Very expensive ($40 for the game, but dance pads range from $30 for a pad [think the kind of pad that you get in twister], $110 for a stronger pad [what I have] but may break down from overuse [I recommend that you get a warranty for the pad], and an over $500 one for you hardcore fans, but it's only available online and shipping costs are a burden [over 30 lbs.]) Final Verdict: Deserves being bought for the Xbox Live enability alone, but if you are on a budget, don't even bother without getting hit with a hefty cost.
