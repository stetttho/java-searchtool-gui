 Im not complaning because it stinks or anything but because of something big. THE GAME DOESN'T WORK ON XP!!!!! I returned it to see if it was my computer that is the problem but it is very common for hitman 2 to crash on windows XP. so if it says "Direct3D : unable to create device. Try changing resolution or color depth" and on XP. Return it immediately. I returned it and got it on Xbox.
