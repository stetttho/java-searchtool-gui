 i have been a fan of NASCAR for years, and nothing has ever struck me as fascinating as this game! The Career mode is just a triumph! It will keep avid fans busy for months! although the physics can be aggrevating and frustrating at times, it is still a definite buy. Avid and casual fans will be pleased with this game!
