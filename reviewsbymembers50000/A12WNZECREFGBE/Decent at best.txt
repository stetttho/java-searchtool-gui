 Pros: 1. High Heat is on Xbox! 2. The great simulation engine comes along with it Cons: 1. No Improvements at all on the gameplay 2. About the worst graphics i've ever seen on the Xbox 3. Sound and announcers are humdrum and repetitive 4. Menu system is too complex to begin with 5. Market system needs tuning 6. Potential to be a great game gone to waste. FINAL VERDICT: just a rental. Not worth the [$$$]fee to buy it. But baseball fanatics will find it interesting
