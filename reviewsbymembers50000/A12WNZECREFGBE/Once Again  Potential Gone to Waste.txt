 My feelings about the game as a whole are mixed. On one hand, some things have improved, but in other areas, some have retrogressed. Pros: 1. The Freedom to freely field at your own pleasure (finally) 2. The same ol' good pitcher-batter interface 3. AAA and AA teams have you playing as the prospects (YAY!) 4. Chemistry a good add-on to the Dynasty Mode 5. Manage a Dynasty Long after your Grandkids are Dead (120 Years!) Cons: 1. EVERYONE DIVES! (Now People like Mo Vaughn can be superfielder for only 9.95!) 2. Dynasty Progression is too erratic (they basically either never improve for 3 years or jump 20 contact and power in a Spring Training!) 3. Commentary is too sparse (BEEF IT UP!) 4. Doesn't really feel like you're at a Baseball game (the clapping after pitches and the boring commentary make it feel like a game of Golf or a Tennis match!) 5. Barry Bonds did the LaVar Arrington (not in the union) 6. Rosters definitely do not feel like they were January 15, 2004 rosters (for one thing, Kevin Young is not on the Pirates anymore, he's on the Twins... Since JUNE!!!) 7. Spam never belongs in a managers e-mail (it's sparse, but can't you get a spam blocker or something?) FINAL VERDICT: I don't feel like I can just play this and get the feel of the game like I do when I go to a real game. But in my mind, I'd buy it, since it's the best out there (Iv'e never played ASB, but ESPN looks like a real sucker this year)
