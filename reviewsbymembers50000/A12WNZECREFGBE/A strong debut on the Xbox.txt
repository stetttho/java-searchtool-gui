 Pros: 1. Much Better than it's predecessor 2. A limited # of saves, which makes you think about where to save the game. 3. The option of a 1st or 3rd person shooter in the game 4. The only game that lets you decide to stealthfully execute your target, or just walk in and shoot everybody 5. Threat Meter is a good addition to the game. 6. good music score 7. more than one way to finish each level 8. can change uniforms to disguise yor self as the enemy Cons: 1. AI has faults in it 2. acting is poor 3. The storyline is just sad 4. nothing much to do in the long run  Final Verdict: My opinion is that if you are a hardcore gamer that loves a good shooter, buy it. If not, rent it.
