 This book is a well-written, well-organized, concise introduction to SQL.  Each of the 22 lessons takes about 10 minutes to complete.  The same files are used throughout and are available from the author's Web site.  Using these files and the author's numerous examples, one can learn SQL step-by-step as painlessly as possible.   There is one deficiency, though.  Appendix E lists all SQL Reserved Words, but doesn't provide the exact syntax to use (for different DBMS's) or examples.  Correcting this would subtantially increase the size of the book but would be extremely useful for reference.
