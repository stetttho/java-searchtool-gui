 This is another UNvisual QuickPro Guide from Peachpit Press:  the screen shots are way too small and must be viewed outside in bright sunshine.  At about half-off list price, a case can be made for purchase, if you're a FileMaker junkie (like me).  It's (unfortunately) intermediate level, not advanced (as it claims). It covers indexing options, conditional valuelists, textstyle functions, mass update of serial numbers, script parameters, bulk e-mail, importing with scripts, and communicating with a Palm.
