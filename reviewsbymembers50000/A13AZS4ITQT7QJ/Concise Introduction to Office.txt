 This is a very well-written, very concise introduction to Microsoft Office 2003.  It's also very reasonably priced.  So:  how come I cannot award it five stars?  Easy:  the screen shots are way too small; either you will need to read this book outside in bright sunshine or you will need a magnifying glass. It's not a "Visual" Quickstart Guide; it's an "Unvisual" Quickstart Guide.  I don't know what's happened to the publisher (Peachpit Press), but years ago the screen shots in their books were nice and big. C'mon, Peachpit, bring back the large and legible screen shots.  Then you'll earn the five stars you covet.
