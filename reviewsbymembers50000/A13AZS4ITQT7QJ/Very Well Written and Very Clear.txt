 The scripture for parliamentarians is, of course, Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised, 10th Edition (Cambridge, MA:  Perseus Publishing, 2000).  All other books for parliamentarians are just "commentary"--but some are better than others.  Jennings' book is superior to most:  it is very well written, very well edited, and very clear.  I'm now a Registered Parliamentarian (and my proctor for the test was Jonathn M. Jacobs, listed in Jennings' Acknowledgments and also a reviewer here) and even I got a better understanding of a few things.  Like:  p. 114, preferential voting; p. 130, handling a substitute motion; p. 193, call up motion to reconsider; p. 194, reconsider and enter on the minutes; p. 278, the chair and the 2/3 threshold; p. 293, adopting reports; and p. 315, a serious Audit Committee Report.  I normally throw in a few complaints in most of my book reviews, but it was hard to find any problems with the book; maybe just this:  rather than the bonus chapters being available on the Web for download and printing, it would have been better to incorporate them in the book proper.
