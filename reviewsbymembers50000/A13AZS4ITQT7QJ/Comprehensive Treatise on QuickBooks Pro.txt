 Ms. Ivens writes clearly, properly, and intelligently on QuickBooks software.  The screen shots are legible, unlike those in some other computer books.  The index is detailed, and thus useful.  I counted only two typos in the 572 pages.  My company, Transpower Corporation (a commercial and custom software manufacturing and systems engineering company in metropolitan Philadelphia), did its first QuickBooks installation in 1999.  I purchased Kathy's book QuickBooks 6.0--The Offical Guide; this helped to make the installation go smoothly.  It's been five years since, and QuickBooks has changed considerably.  So I purchased both of Kathy's current titles, QuickBooks 2004--The Offical Guide, and Running QuickBooks 2004 Premier Editions.  Both are excellent and I recommend them to all computer consultants operating in the small business space, which QuickBooks has taken over by storm.  (Unfortunately, QuickBooks is not so applicable to medium or larger businesses because 1) there is a five user limit for Pro/Premiere editions and a ten user limit for the Enterprise edition, 2) it does not work with Windows Terminal Server, and 3) it allows only seven custom fields).  After reading both books, I've come to the conclusion that for most small businesses the Premiere editions (with their specialization) make more sense than the less expensive Pro edition.  Kathy provides many useful tips in her books.  They go way beyond what is supplied in the manuals shipped with the software.
