 Although Dr. Spock was a Leftist, he was not a "permissivist."  This book, revised and updated by Dr. Robert Needlman, is reasonably comprehensive; the major sections are:  Your Child, Age by Age; Feeding and Nutrition; Raising Mentally Healthy Children; Common Developmental and Behavioral Challenges; Learning and School; Health and Safety; Glossary of Medical Terms; Common Medications for Children; Glossary of Common Medication; and Resource Guide.  Here are some samples of what is discussed:  p. 67, velcro diapers; p. 266, early nursing patterns; p. 392, father's jobs; p. 415, group sizes in pre-school; p. 422, scientific results; p. 616, signs of autism; p. 643, reading books to the baby; p. 699, symptons to call the doctor; p. 723, immunizations; p. 735, car seats; p. 743, bicycle helmets; p. 754, dog rules; p. 802, teething; p. 839, food poisening; p. 862, classic infections.  I have just a few minor complaints:  "Internet" isn't capitalized; there is no table of childhood development (and Needlman quotes Spock as not wanting one!), and vegetarianism is over-pushed.  (Instead, I prefer the turkey-salmon-vegetable-fruit-legume diet (similar to the Paleolithic diet).)  Also, no distinction is made between high- and low- glycemic carbohydrates.  Regardless, I recommend the book to all prospective parents.
