 This book is for advanced programmers only.  If you're a beginner or at intermediate level with FileMaker, most of the screen shots will be too small and the techniques too advanced.  But advanced users will love the four appendices:  Additional Resources, Calculation Function Reference, Script Step Reference, and Documenting FileMaker Pro Systems.  The book is worth buying just for the appendices!  Numerous advanced techniques are discussed, but not in a step-by-step fashion.  The files on the included CD are rudimentary but helpful. Examples include constructing a "self-join" file, implementing dynamic report columns, extracting values from checkbox fields, highlighting portal rows, and constructing a "back button."  There is a good discussion of relational database theory and how to use the new Relationships Graph.  This book is a must-have for all advanced FileMaker 7 developers.
