 Bicycle Magazine's Mr. Hewitt provides 636 tips (plus sub-tips and framed sections with extra tips, presumably totalling 1000) covering safety in traffic, riding positions, skill builders, training techniques, distance riding, mountain biking, racing, health and fitness, nutrition, equipment, and bike care.  The tips are stated concisely and are mostly well-organized, although each chapter should have been divided into sections for greater clarity.  The glossary and index are excellent.  There is one demerit, however:  there is a dearth of illustrations (only 9).  If the book had contained more diagrams, I would have been compelled to give it a 5. Even better would be to make the book into a video or DVD course!
