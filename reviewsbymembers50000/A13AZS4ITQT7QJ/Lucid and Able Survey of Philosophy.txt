 Do not interpret the "Made Simple" part of the title to mean "over-simplified" or "simplistic."  This book is a lucid and able survey of philosophy at an intermediate level.  The seven sections cover ethics, political philosophy, metaphysics, philosophy of religion, the theory of knowledge, logic, and contemporary philosophy.  (The only major topic missing is esthetics.) In doing philosophy one is engaging in a serious, long-range conversation with past and present thinkers in an attempt to understand ourselves and the nature of the world in which we live. With this book as a foundation, one could go on to read advanced texts in philosophy and the technical literature.  For instance, one could study Samuel Alexander's magnum opus Space, Time, and Deity, and not get lost in the thickets of thought.  I highly recommend Philosophy Made Simple as a sturdy foundation for building your own philosophy.
