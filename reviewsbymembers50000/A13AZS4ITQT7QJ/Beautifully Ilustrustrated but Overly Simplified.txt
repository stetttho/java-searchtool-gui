 Like all of publisher DK's books, this one is very beautifully-illustrated and very reasonably-priced.  It's suitable for a teenager or an adult just getting back into cycling.  It's also small enough to fit in some saddle bags.  However, it's not detailed enough for semi-pro or pro bicycle mechanics, who will certainly continue to use Barnett's Manual.  The index of Sidwells' book is OK, but the glossary is far too brief.  Overall, the book is better for amateurs than other such books, but just not detailed enough for really serious work.
