 Of the hundreds of computer/math/science/engineering books I have, this has got to be one of the prettiest.  The screen shots are in full color and are very clear and legible; would that other computer books be so pleasant to read!  This book is a step-by-step guide for setting up your wireless network painlessly.  Get it, regardless of your level of computer skill; I run a systems engineering company, Transpower Corporation, in metropolitan Philadelphia--so I'm in the business, and even I learned a few new tricks.
