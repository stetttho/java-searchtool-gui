 This book reads as if it were written yesterday--the writing sparkles.  After each chapter I looked up the philosopher in the Encyclopedia Britannica and compared the write-up there with Durant's.  In every instance, Durant's was far more interesting and insightful.  The book is more about history than about ideas.  This contrasts with the book Philosophy Made Simple, which is more about ideas than about history.  Reading both will give you a fine, intermediate level understanding of philosophy.  One disappointment is that Samuel Alexander and his work are not discussed.  I think that his major work, titled Space, Time, and Deity, is superior to anything done by Russell, who is covered.  Other than that, it's hard to find something to complain about.  The chapter on Voltaire is still so timely--the Arabs certainly need an Enlightenment thinker.  There is an article on Voltaire in today's Wall Street Journal!
