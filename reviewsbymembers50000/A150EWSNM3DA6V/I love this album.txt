 I have listened this album several times before being able to judge it. At the first times it seemed good but not fantastic, just a bit too traditional if compared to BVSC. But after, I have gradually changed my  opinion: this is surely a very good work, with the voice of Ibrahim Ferrer  that shines. It is as worthy as the first BVSC album. My preferred songs  are "Guateque Campesino" and "Bruca manigua".
