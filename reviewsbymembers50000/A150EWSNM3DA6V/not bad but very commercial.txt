 This album is very commercial. Santana has understood how to make money with songs that are devoted to the people fond of the music of MTV but not surely to the listeners of Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis or Tito Puente. If you  wish to listen some real genuine latin music, buy the first album of  Ibrahim Ferrer or the last of Compay Segundo.  Luckily, in this album  Santana shows that he has not forgotten how to play the guitar.
