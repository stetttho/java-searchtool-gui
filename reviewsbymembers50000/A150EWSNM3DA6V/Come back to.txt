 I think this is really a good album. Buy it and you will go back to the early '70 years. In particular, I loved the songs in which Hooker play together with Alan Wilson: I have realised  why  Hooker considered  "Blind Owl" as one of the best harmonica player ever heard.  Canned Heat supported  Hooker's music much more better than lots of other  more known groups. Really nice.
