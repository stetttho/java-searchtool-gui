 I think this album of Compay Segundo is also better than the even very good previous "La mejor de la Vida".  Differently from the other recordings, in this album Compay Segundo has introduced the clarinets which  are very typical instruments of the pre-1940s Cuban music. The global sound  of the work results very romantic and passionate. Compay used to play  clarinet in the municipal band of Santiago de Cuba as a teenager. "Calle  salud" features some traditional cuban songs like "Lagrimas Negras" or "La  Engaadora" (that was included also in the album of the pianist Ruben  Gonzales) but also some beautiful composition of Compay like "Amor Gigante"  or the merengue "Maria En La Playa". In addition we can appreciate a new  version of "Chan Chan", that has become worldwide a symbol of cuban music,  like Guantanamera, while "Se Perdi La Flauta" is a beautiful instrumental  of "Sabroso". In the song "Morir de amor", Compay Segundo and the vocalist  of his group sing together with Charles Aznavour. "Calle salud" is surely a  "must" for the people fond of Latin music.
