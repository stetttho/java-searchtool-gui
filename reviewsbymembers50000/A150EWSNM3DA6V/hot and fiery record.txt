 This album cannot lack in the collection of people fond of blues, or of good music in general. It captures an exciting and hot concert between two great artists that are unfortunately dead, but this work represents the  best epitaph for them. The quality of the recording is very good and A.  King and S.R. Vaughn are supported by a first- class band. Also the  excerpts of conversations reported in the CD are very amusing. I love all  the songs of this album but my preferred ones are "Stormy Monday", "Pride  and Joy" (the sole track sung by Vaughan). and "Ask Me No Questions".
