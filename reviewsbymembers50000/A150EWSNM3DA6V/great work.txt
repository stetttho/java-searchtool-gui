 The album of Omara Portuondo is superlative. The atmosphere andthe sound are similar to those of the album of Ibrahim Ferrer, but themusical arrangements are better balanced, and allow the listener to better appreciate the beautiful voice of Omara Portuondo. You will listen lot of different styles including mambo, bolero, son, and a composition of Gerschwin that is appropriate to justify the comparison of Omara with Billie Holliday. I hope this album will sell lots of copies, even if it's completely different from the bunch of stupid commercial latin-pop music that is invading the markets.  Allow me to say that I suggest to listen this album to all the Cuban living in USA and those living in Cuba as well. This music is so nice that may help to conciliate the souls of the two communities and find out again the rich common cultural background.
