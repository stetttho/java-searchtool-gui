 This four-CD box is expensive but it's surely worth. It's a beautiful example of the best period of the pop, rock and soul music. The box includes the whole concert of Jimi Hendrix, that was historical because it  was the first time he played with his Experience in front of the american  public. At the Monterey Pop festival, Hendrix played wonderfully and the  box also records the final moments when he destroyed his guitar. Also, you  will listen the legendary performance of Otis Redding , that unfortunately  died few months later for a plane accident.  But the box also includes  several other groups that, at this moment, were at the best. For instance I  love the blues that was played by the Butterfield Blues Band, by the Big  Brother & The Holding Company with Janis Joplin, the Canned Heat. Also  the performance by Mamas & Papas and the Byrds were extraordinaly . The  quality of the recording is excellent and also the booklet, that reports  several pictures of the musicians, is really very nice.  I hope that one  day they will release the WHOLE Monterey Pop Festival, maybe in a box of 15  or 20 Cds.....
