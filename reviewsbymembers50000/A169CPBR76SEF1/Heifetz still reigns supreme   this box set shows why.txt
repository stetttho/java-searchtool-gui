 Although it has been some time since I've listened to the "standard repertoire" ( having moved onto mostly 20th century modern / "contemporary" music ), Jascha Heifetz' artistry was the reason I  was drawn to classical music in the first place. I can't possibly imagine  better performances of the BRAHMS and SIBELIUS concerti. Some critics from  days past have mentioned the Heifetz tendency to "rush" but I've  always felt that in some of the ultra-romantic pieces ( TCHAIKOVSKY for  example ) that this was a plus. Perhaps Itzhak Perlman's version of the  BEETHOVEN ( Barenboim conducting ) surpasses the Heifetz but not by much.  The "lesser" pieces of BRUCH and GLAZUNOV are elevated by  Heifetz' extraordinary musicianship. My only possible complaint would be  that the ELGAR and WALTON concerti were not included, the latter piece  being a Heifetz commission and superior musically to the PROKOFIEV #2 ( not  PROKOFIEV's best work ) which IS included in this collection. Certainly  those pieces would have sealed this set as "platinum" ( the  VIEUXTEMP piece is of inferior musical quality in my opinion and Heifetz  doesn't really "do it" for me in MOZART and BACH ). But, this box  set is spectacular as it is and really offers quite a bargain. By the  way, the AMAZON reviewer refers to "Daniel Heifetz"; the name of  course is JASCHA Heifetz.
