 This Spanish import box ( �Paco de Lucia: Caja Segunda Epoca� ) contains three of Paco de Lucia's albums In all likelihood, most true fans of Paco de Lucia's are familiar with these recordings; for the benefit of those who aren't, I'll make the following comments. "FUENTE Y CAUDAL" is most renowned for the opening "rumba" titled "Entre Dos Aguas". This was the tune that transformed a 25 year old Paco de Lucia from a flamenco hero to a  ( Spanish ) national hero. Far from being a pop trifle, �Entre Dos Aguas� is beautifully composed. For the first time on record, Paco plays in an ensemble ( 2nd guitar, electric bass and  congas ) that was at that time unusual in flamenco music. Its beautiful melody, intense and expressive character ( elevated by Paco's transcendent "duende" ) was a unique inspiration, far from the "light" rumba flamenca that had been played before. Paco has long been known as a true musical genius, supremely inspired ( equally gifted in artistic and technical ability ) so it is no surprise the rest of the album is great. However, two particular cuts stand out. "Fuente Y Caudal",  a piece in the "taranta" form, is a mournful and inexpressibly profound composition. As with the very greatest musicians, Paco�s technical prowess is really an afterthought. His sublime intensity and communicative skills transport the listener in a manner only the very greatest musicians can. "Fuente Y Caudal" never fails to send chills up my spine. The other standout tune is "Cepa Andaluza",  in the "buleria" style which Paco himself has characterized as the most complex and most characteristic flamenco form. Paco displays phenomenal energy as he is accompanied "por fiesta" with "palmas" and "jaleos" ( handclaps and shouts of encouragement ). This cut (  one in what is now a series of revolutionary "bulerias" by Paco ) practically jumps out of the speaker! "ALMORAIMA" was Paco de Lucia's first "concept" album, recorded with unprecedented ( in flamenco ) attention to production values. It is completely unified in terms of mood and song selection and is unique is several areas. Building on the instrumentation displayed on "Entre Dos Aguas" from 3 years prior, Paco employs the electric bass and congas on portions of almost all the compositions. He plays ( overdubs, in itself somewhat unique in flamenco c. 1976 ) a nylon string oud ( Arabic lute ) on several cuts. A mixed choir ( male & female ) sings a choruses on the intro and fadeout of the song dedicated to the great singer La Perla de Cadiz ( the "cantina" form is a variant of the "alegria" common to the Andalucian port city of Cadiz ). The points made so far only pertain to the arrangements. However, the compositions themselves are much more sophisticated than any Paco had ever written; in terms of melodic invention ( very high throughout ), rhythmic syncopation and compositional ( structural ) "balance" ( opening, middle and closing sections ). Some of Paco's greatest tunes are on this album, many of which he plays on his tours to this day. The title cut "Almoraima" and another famous "rumba ( "Rio Ancho" ) are virtually trademark Paco de Lucia compositions. The melody of the latter tune seems to sing an anthem of freedom, his propulsive, bossa nova style syncopations all but force your body to move.  �Almoraima� by contrast has notable Moorish ( North African ) influence ( its melodic contour as well as the use of the oud ). Paco�s revolutionary impact was also felt in his complete reconstruction of the �sevillanas�, a very light form of flamenco ( some do not consider it flamenco at all ). His tune, titled �El Cobre�,  is divided in the traditional manner in four short, contrasting parts. Paco  utilizes  very unusual chords, progressions & modulations in creating a truly �valid�, independent composition. The album closes with �Llanos del Real�, composed within a mournful flamenco form known as the "minera" ( the latter term used in traditional relationship to the men who worked in the ancient silver mines of Southeastern Spain ). This poignant tune is also an effective "mirror image" of the Arabic influence implied in the name ( and music ) of the title track. It's hard to ignore what seems to be an evocation of the despair felt by the Moorish aristocracy retreating ( c. 1450? ) from their former kingdom back to North Africa along the "royal plains" near the Almeria province. �CASTRO MARIN� was recorded in Japan in December of 1980 during a tour with John McLaughlin and Larry Coryell ( the original guitar trio ). This is a unique work, given that Paco plays solo for over half of the album, something he hadn�t done in about 8 years. In a way, this album is a sort of preparation for the album �SOLO QUIERO CAMINAR�, which he recorded with his newly formed �sextet� in the summer of 1981. Several of the compositions played on �CASTRO MARIN� were re-recorded later on the other album.  One of the virtues of �CASTRO MARIN� is that it shows how much Paco can achieve in a short amount of recording time ( just a couple of days ).  The title track, named for the town where Paco�s mother was born ( in Portugal, just across the river from Spain ) is a �fandangos de Huelva�, mixing mostly new ideas with some variations from �Aires Choqueros� (1973). His �bulerias� ( �Gitanos Andaluces� ) and �solea� ( �Herencia� ) similarly mix new ideas with older ones. Paco�s overdubbed solos on the latter tune burn with intensity. A duo with Larry Coryell on �Convite� was Paco�s favorite track from this recording. On this tune ( a catchy "rumba" ) Coryell plays some Wes Montgomery style octaves which, judging from Paco�s use of the same technique on subsequent albums, impressed him enough to incorporate it into his own style. Finally, a somewhat under-rehearsed ( but not the worse for it ) trio of Paco, Coryell and John McLaughlin engage a three-way musical �battle� appropriately titled �Palenque� ( after Mexican chicken fighting rings ). My personal favorite cut is the opening �Monasterio de Sal�, an ingenious tune played in the �colombiana� flamenco form, a style owing to the contact between the Spanish and South American cultures ( �rumba� and �guajira� being a couple others ). Since Paco is really a composer as well as a guitar player, it comes as no surprise that his �colombiana�, while being played in the appropriate rhythmic style of the form, is a completely original creation. His approach of uniting complete originality with the traditions of flamenco has given birth to a whole cadre of younger guitarists following in his wake.  Paco�s example changed the old practice of completely modeling one�s �falsetas� ( variations in particular flamenco forms ) on an older master ( EG, Sabicas or Nino Ricardo ). Now, it goes without saying that some of the younger players experiments are more aesthetically "valid" than others. But, on the whole, a reinvigoration of the flamenco culture ( one that continues to this day ) was inspired by Paco de Lucia and his friend, the late maestro, singer Camaron de La Isla. Eventually, many younger flamenco guitarists gained their composure, stopped  showing off with ( mere ) technique and �cooled off� enough to sensitively accompany singers in that most vital part of flamenco, the �Cante�. Currently, there are scores of fine singers ( EG, Duquende, Potito, Jose Merce ) as well as guitarists ( EG, Rafael Riqueni, Tomatito, Moraito Chico ) who owe a lot to Paco de Lucia ( and Camaron ) for keeping the flamenco culture alive and vibrant and not, as Paco himself has said, as a precious antique fit for the �museum� but lacking flesh and blood life.  To sum up, this box set features three fine albums at a more than reasonable price. They are highly recommended, as are the three contained in the similar import box titled �Caja Tercera Epoca�, which feature 3 more of Paco�s works ( �SOLO QUIERO CAMINAR�, �SIROCO�, �ZYRAB� ), ranging from 1981 thru 1990. And don't neglect Paco's
