 I own 4 or 5 different complete recordings of Ravel's piano music. In  terms of interpretation and  ( this is crucial ) the SOUND of the  recording, this set  ( volumes 1 and 2 are sold separately ) is my  favorite. Of course, all complete Ravel sets have their strong and weak  points, and Paul Crossley's is no exception. For example, Crossley's  "Gaspard de la Nuit" ( Volume 2 of the 2 volume CRD release- this  review is of Vol 1 ) features a "Scarbo" ( 3rd movt ) that is  slow bordering on mannered. In fairness, Crossley used the deliberate pace  to contrast with the absurdly fast tempi that most pianists use, which has  the tendency to reduce the piece to (merely) an overly virtuosic display  piece. I have no such reservations about the other "large" works  ( "MIROIRS", "LE TOMBEAU DE COUPERIN" ) that Crossley  plays with great delicacy, nuance and feeling. Sound, both in terms of the  players touch AND the engineering of the recording are absolutely key to  properly appreciating the works of certain composers like Schubert, Chopin,  Debussy and Ravel. Unlike the overly harsh, "clangy" sound heard  on the DECCA recording ( Jean-Yves Thibaudet ) or the overly reverberant  CHANDOS ( Louis Lortie ) sets, the Crossley/CRD has achieved the perfect  balance for the exquisite, fine diamond-cut precision of Maurice Ravel's  compositions. Very highly recommended to long time Ravelians or newcomers  to this music ( if you like Vol 1,  be sure to get Vol 2 ).
