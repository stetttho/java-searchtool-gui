 "LIGHT AND SHADE" is a well-made British documentary from 1993 about the great Spanish flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucia. Although of short length ( approx 60 min ),  the documentary / interview ( available in Spanish, English and French ) is a good introductory look at his family history, musical career and outlook on flamenco culture ( and of life as a whole ). Paco is well known in flamenco circles as a wise and thoughtful man ( if one with a streak of melancholia ) and thankfully, his sense of humor is seen in places.  The documentary starts out with Paco's  ( nearly ) complete performance of his virtuosic composition "La Barrosa". For those not familiar with the flamenco guitar, the DVD features of freeze frame and slow motion will allow a close-up view of what many musician's consider  the world's most advanced guitar technique. Along with the actual interview, which weaves through the entire documentary, are short clips of Paco's performances in the 1970's and 1980's:  these include performances with his friend Camaron de La Isla, with jazz guitarist John McLaughlin, and with his touring group ( the Paco de Lucia Sextet ). There is also a fascinating clip from his recording session of composer Joaquin Rodrigo's famous "Concierto de Aranjuez".  "LIGHT & SHADE" is not a definitive biography nor does it pretend to be ( the only satisfactory book about his life is in Spanish ). It is however a noble introduction to a musician who continues to exemplify the living flamenco tradition and bring both its vibrant musical life and his individual genius to audiences around the world.
