 Previous reviewer Nicholas Fox is dead-on in his assessment. I purchased this recording to obtain a contrast to the Stravinsky disc by Maazel and the Bavarian Radio Sym Orchestra ( RCA ). They feature two of the same  pieces ( Sym in 3 Movmts and Sym of Psalms ). The BRSO and Maazel are FAR  more rhymically dynamic than the Berliners are with Boulez. As Mr. Fox  wrote, the Berlin PO is the wrong orchestra for Stravinsky ( particularly  "neo-classical" Stravinsky! ). I do however think that Boulez  took the wrong interpretive tact with a generally slower tempo for the  pieces on this disc, for example, Sym for Wind Instruments ( his old  version with the Domaine Musical in the early 60's was more streamlined and  effective, recording quality notwithstanding ). The Sym in 3 Movements in  bogged down not only by the Berliners rhythmic "sameness" but  also Boulez' choice of a slower tempo. He does bring out the beautiful  strands of harp and woodwind instruments in the slow movement of the SYM in  3 MOVEMENTS, but the level of excitement is higher with Maazel.  Maazel and  the Bavarian RSO is highly recommended. Finally, the recording provided by  Deutsche Grammophon is not flattering compared to the outstanding  RCA/Maazel disc ( all of Maazel's recent RCA discs are supremely recorded  ).
