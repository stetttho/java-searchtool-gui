 Warning! For those potential buyers who are newcomers to Paco de Lucia's music or to flamenco music in general, please note that this pricey ( 1 CD ) album is most certainly NOT the "best of flamenco guitar", whether one takes that grossly inappropriate title to reflect the flamenco of the esteemed maestro Paco de Lucia or any other flamenco artist for that matter. In fact, only 1 tune among the 20 listed ( "Aires de Linares", a piece in "taranta" form ) is an actual flamenco piece! The rest are a collection of Spanish, Mexican and South American tunes, some are classic melodies and others fairly "middle of the road" in my estimation. If one is looking for an album featuring Paco's interpretations of these light and pleasant Latin tunes, I would suggest "HISPANOAMERICA" as a far better bargain as well as a more truthful title ( accurately reflecting its contents ). And, if one wishes to truly search out the "best" flamenco guitar that Paco de Lucia has recorded, I would recommend his most recent solo album, "LUZIA" ( 1998 ) or his earlier classic, "ALMORAIMA" ( 1976 ). For "flamenco puro", that is the style of the flamenco song ( "cante" ) accompanied by guitar and "jaleo"  ( shouts of encouragement, handclapping and general festivity ), I would recommend Paco's work with the late, great singer Camaron de la Isla: "CAJA INTEGRAL", as the title implies, is a complete box set of Camaron's work, magnificent but expensive. Another compilation, much less costly, is "AUTORETRATO". Both of these recordings are featured under Camaron's name. Given Paco's Olympian stature in the flamenco culture, newcomers deserve an introduction to his music that delivers what it promises. The CD under review is NOT that introduction.
