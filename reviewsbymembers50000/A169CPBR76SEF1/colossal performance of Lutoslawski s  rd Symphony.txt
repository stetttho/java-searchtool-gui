 Witold Lutoslawski ( 1913-1994 ) wrote many great works, particularly for orchestra, but if I had to choose just one piece as being fully representative of his brilliance, it would be his Symphony #3. Started in 1972 as a result of a commission by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the music was not completed until 1983. In the interim, Lutoslawski finished several shorter works ( "Mi-Parti", "Les Espaces du Sommeil" ) which influenced the form and orchestral details of the ( approx ) 30 minute Symphony. Of course my words won't do proper justice to the piece; my best "bare bones" description would be to mention that the composer unites the beauty of instrumental color with a classical ( "goal oriented" ) dynamism and cohesion.  This work will most likely be best appreciated by those with a working knowledge of earlier masters ( Stravinsky, Debussy, Bartok ) who themselves had such great influence on Lutoslawski. In fact, the companion piece on the compact disc under review is the much earlier ( 1954 ) "Concerto for Orchestra", directly modeled on Bartok's famous work of the same title. Lutoslawski's "Concerto" is an instrumental tour de force but for all its undoubted viral exuberance, is more of a pure "showpiece" than anything else the composer would conceive until his bravura Piano Concerto in 1987.  The performances by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra are simply colossal. Not even the composer's recording with the Berlin Philharmonic tops the passion and detail that Daniel Barenboim brings out of the CSO. Note that the tracks are indexed on the CD so that the listener can perceive with the eye the various sections into which Lutoslawski divided his work.
