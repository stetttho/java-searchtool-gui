 Maurizio Pollini is in fine form throughout these exemplary, magisterial, performances of Franz Schubert's "late" piano sonatas: C Minor (D 958), A Major (D 959), B Flat Major (D 960). As the excellent liner notes (Paolo Petazzi) accompanying the original (1987) Deutsche Grammophon release indicate, Schubert did most of his work on these pieces in September of 1828 (just after completing his famous String Quintet), clearly intended to form a single collection.   The virtues that are unique to Pollini: supreme technical facility, fastidious attention to form (shape and coherence of piece as a whole), scrupulous study of various editions of score, concert performances years in advance of recording- all come into play in these renditions of Schubert's glorious and darkly complex music.   Highest recommendation, and at a very attractive price (another "packaging" of this material by DG features only two of the sonatas, and at higher cost).
