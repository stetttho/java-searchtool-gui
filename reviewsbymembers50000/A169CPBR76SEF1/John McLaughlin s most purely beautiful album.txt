 John McLaughlin has always been renowned among guitar enthusiasts as having great technique. However, among the various qualities which set him apart from other players, McLaughlin's playing, like that of his idol John Coltrane, is always in service of musical expression, regardless of technical considerations. As with all great musicians, his music is a reflection of an inspired mixture of mind, body and spirit. McLaughlin is, as people often say, "intense", but due to his honesty and dedication, his "message" can be felt and appreciated by players and non-players alike.  "BELO HORIZONTE" (1981), dedicated to the French classical pianist Katia Labeque ( listen to "Waltz for Katia" ), is McLaughlin's most purely beautiful and romantic work. Throughout much of the album there is a palpable aura of nostalgic yearning, somewhat akin to the moods in Astor Piazzolla's music or the bittersweet songs of Antonio Carlos Jobim. This melancholia is very much in evidence on the breathtaking "Stardust on Your Sleeve" and "Zamfir". Somewhat surprisingly, McLaughlin's flamenco-style nylon string guitar blends well with a mixture of electronic and acoustic instrumention; this ensemble doesn't detract from the album's unique ambience. And lest people think otherwise, while he is enchantingly lyrical in some pieces ( his brief rendition of Bill Evans' "Very Early" ) in others McLaughlin plays with his trademark fluency, ripping off mind-bogglingly fast passages in a manner which recalls the firework displays of the famous acoustic guitar trio ( "PASSION,GRACE & FIRE" ) with which he played during the early 1980's.  The duet "Manitas de Oro", played with his good friend Paco de Lucia, is a fitting conclusion to a beautiful and sometimes haunting work. "BELO HORIZONTE" is highly recommended.
