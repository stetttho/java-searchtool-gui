 Sinopoli's renditions of these pieces are intense and passionate. Possibly less refined than Boulez in separating all the "strands" of polyphony ( though Sinopoli is by no means lax in that regard ), he and the  wonderful Dresden orchestra bring more vitality and life to these  masterpieces than most other performers. Also, the TELDEC recording is  superb ( note that Maestro Sinopoli can be heard breathing with quite some  excitement in some pieces ) as it is with other Sinopoli and Barenboim  releases ( Berg, Bruckner ). Highly recommended for those who are looking  for a more overt connection between Webern and the late ( or  "post" ) romantic Austro-Germanic composers ( Bruckner,Mahler,  Strauss, early Schoenberg ), these performances stress more of the link  with the past than the ( Boulezian ) leap into the future.
