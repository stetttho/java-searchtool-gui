 For this reviewer, decidedly outside the heavy metal scene, the initial encounter with Opeth was made through the earnest recommendation of a young fan. Words fail to do justice to the awesome power of this band, which combines the ferocious intensity and attack of the blackest (bleakest) metal, the dreamy lyricism of "alternative" (read, Beatle-influenced) music and the suite-like passages of sophisticated "prog-rock". Once one gets used to the dark ("death growl") vocals in the intense sections, the richness of Opeth's musical creativity will repay many listenings. A word of caution: as the song titles will imply, the subject matter as expressed through the (well-crafted) lyrics is, to put it mildly, less than euphoric. If one is absolutely repulsed by a melancholic (or just plain choleric) musical disposition, it might be best to stay away from Opeth.    In "Deliverance" the listener is overwhelmed by long, complex and often ingenious arrangements that play off the (effortlessly executed) tension between dark and light sections. The songs may perhaps be described more accurately in the singular, since where (practically) each tune ends the other begins. In effect "Deliverance" is one long "stream" of continuous music, culminating in a final chord which resonates (a la Beatles "A Day in the Life") for a solid minute and half.   Long time Opeth aficionado's will have doubtlessly already described in their reviews the various roles played by individual band members as well as the producer of this particular album (and its "companion" recording titled "Damnation"). For a relative newcomer, one could do no better than to purchase "Deliverance", "Damnation", and the recently released DVD concert/documentary titled "Lamentations", which gives detailed information on the making of what can properly be termed musical milestones.
