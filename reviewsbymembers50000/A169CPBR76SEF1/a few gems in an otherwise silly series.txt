 KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER, airing 1974-75, followed up on the success of two previously aired made for TV movies: "The Night Stalker" (1971) and "The Night Strangler" (1973). While this reviewer has seen neither movie (and therefore has to suspend judgment as to their quality), quite a few others have extended praise on their behalf. Be that as it may, as far as *this* complete DVD set is concerned, one really should make the attempt to critique through lenses free of nostalgic fog.   Without question, the main virtue of this series ( now an "oldie" ) is located in the late Darren McGavin's dynamic portrayal of quirky Chicago reporter, Carl Kolchak and his encounters with various instances of strange ( and largely malevolent ) phenomenon. His humorous interplay with the cast regulars, especially Simon Oakland (Kolchak's grizzled boss, Tony Vincenzo ), redeemed a good deal of the outright silliness that passed for scary in 1975 ( I do, however, freely admit to being frightened as a 10 year old! ). Truly, McGavin's talent was well above the material provided through largely paltry scripts. Out of the 20 episodes featured, only four or five displayed any kind of consistent quality: "The Vampire", "The Spanish Moss Murders", "Demon in Lace", "The Sentry" and ( above all ) "Horror in the Heights". The rest run the gamut from fair to awful, enjoyable only if one is an inveterate collector of all things 70's, or perhaps taking a stroll down memory lane. If, however, one is looking for genuine thrills, it would undoubtedly pay to find the few worthy episodes in the local video shop.   Final note: aside from Darren McGavin's acting, the only other substantial attribute KOLCHAK possesses is the interest of one of its fans, a fellow named Chris Carter. Apparently, Carter drew upon aspects of the Kolchak character while fashioning his landmark creation THE X FILES and its main protagonist, Fox Mulder. For this reason alone, KOLCHAK deserves a measure of respect.
