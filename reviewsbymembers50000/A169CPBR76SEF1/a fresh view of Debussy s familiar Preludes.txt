 I had never heard of pianist Stany David Lasry or the ARCANA label for which he recorded these versions of Debussy's Preludes ( Books 1 & 2 ).  Played on a restored Erard piano ( the type Debussy himself played, c. 1900  ), Lasry's versions of these very familiar ( and still enchanting ) pieces  are outstanding in giving one a slightly different aural "view";  a sort of restrained dry warmth, beautifully recorded,  is achieved that  allows the pieces to be seen anew, perhaps in an analogous fashion, to  paintings that have been restored ( delicately ) by experts. No true lover  of Debussy will want to have just one version of these masterworks- 10  versions would not be outlandish. Stany David Lasry's version is I believe  worthy of exploration for those who may think they've heard everything that  is to be  heard in this repertoire. Note that Lasry has separately recorded  Debussy's "Images", "Estampes" and other pieces (  unfortunately not the "Etudes" ) for the same label (  I'm not  sure whether it's also available thru AMAZON ).
