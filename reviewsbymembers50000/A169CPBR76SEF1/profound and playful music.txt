 Horace Tapscott's last album ( "THOUGHTS OF DAR ES SALAAM", 1997 ),  performed in the jazz trio format, is full of excellent compositions ( 4 of 9 written by the leader ) that are diverse in style and substance. Some tunes ( "Bibi Mkuu" ) are reminiscent of McCoy Tyner's open-voiced ( quartal & quintal ) harmonies and pentatonic "cascades" while others ( "Wiletta's Walk" ) echo the "cracked tonality" of Thelonius Monk. "Lullaby in Black" is brooding tune of Scriabinesque gloom while the liltingly sunny "Social Call" ( similar to Dave Brubeck ) is its polar opposite. An interesting ( "bop-meets-Bartok" ) version of Sonny Rollin's "Oleo" is taken at a frighteningly fast tempo. Tapscott's piano playing, while not at the virtuoso level of Tyner or Cecil Taylor, is quite impressive. Through a combination of power and delicacy, he is able to "squeeze" out  a full-blooded tone from what ( in lesser hands ) can be a mercilessly colorless instrument. His improvisations ( full of infectious enthusiasm ) are exciting excursions skirting the edge of control: pungent chords, jagged melodic "stabs" and forearm-to-keyboard clusters deployed with Basie-like economy. His musical partners are equally sensitive. Billy Hart's drumming is tightly focused ( artfully restrained ) and Ray Drummond's bass work is tasteful and concentrated ( a gorgeous rounded tone ). This rhythm section is a veritable model for a jazz trio, an ideal support structure for the leader.  Prior to listening to this album I was unfamiliar with Horace Tapscott's music. From the perspective proffered by "THOUGHTS OF DAR ES SALAAM", the world is poorer for his absence.
