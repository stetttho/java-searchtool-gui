 This is a short ( 100 page ) but very interesting interview with Elliott Carter conducted by Enzo Restagno, an Italian professor of music. The interview(s) took place in the wake of a series of concerts in Turin (1989) celebrating Carter's (then) half century of active composing. As Carter is well known as a lively, witty conversationalist and Mr. Restagno poses sensitive and erudite questions, the interview provides telling insights into Carter's artistic conceptions ( not restricted to music ), his memories of many great musicians ( Ives, Varese,etc ) and his thoughts about contemporary music and its often misunderstood role in American culture ( Carter has received far more commissions in the last 20 years from European sources ). Highly recommended to long time "Carterians", this little volume should prove valuable to newcomers as well. This is a worthy successor to the unfortunately out of print "FLAWED WORDS AND STUBBORN SOUNDS", a series of interviews conducted by Allen Edwards c. 1969 and compares quite favorably with the equally sympathetic and insightful series of interviews with another genius of contemporary music, Iannis Xenakis ( "CONVERSATIONS WITH XENAKIS" by Balint-Vargas ). These are books that connect with the interested "common listener" and avoid the type of musicological analysis more appropriate to the academy and advanced professionals.
