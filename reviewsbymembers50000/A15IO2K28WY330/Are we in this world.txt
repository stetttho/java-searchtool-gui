 This movie tells you that reality does not seem real sometimes.  The Matrix has set some minds to think that we are programmed, and that we cannot control the living.  Well I believe that the Matrix has a very deep  message, which tells us that we have become too dependent on technology,  and that we have forgotten who we are.   This is a movie that will make you  think hard, watch it!  It is an awesome movie.
