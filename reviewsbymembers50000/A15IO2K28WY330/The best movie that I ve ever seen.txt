 I bought this movie without knowing what to expect, I have never been touched by a movie so much before.  Forget Titanic, this is as real as love  gets.  The story however does not have the same concept as love between two  strangers; in this case, it is about love between a brother and his little  sister.  The little boy looses her sister's shoes; they are so poor that  the parents cannot afford to buy a new pair for her.  They decide to keep  it a little secret between them.  The little boy feels so sad that he lost  her sister's shoes, so he is determined to recover them; he does everything  possible so her little sister is happy.  Throughout the movie you can see  the incredible amount of love that they have among each other.  The movie  takes place in Iran, so the movie is subtitled in English.  But you do not  have to look at the words at the bottom of the screen to understand what  the message of the movie is.  I recommend this movie to anyone.  It will  touch you so deeply inside your heart.
