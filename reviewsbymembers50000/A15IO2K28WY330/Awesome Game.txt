 Back in the day when I was younger, I use to skateboard every single day.  I did it for many years.  When I saw this game in a game store one day, I  could not believe that they made a skateboarding game that actually looks  real; I mean these types of games are hard to make them fun and realistic.   I bought the game the minute that I got home, and I tell you, I felt that I  did not want to go anywhere; I could not wait until I got home.  This is  probably the best game that I have played within this category of game.   The graphics are incredible, the game play is amazing, and it is also  challenging, so you will not beat it in a day.  Usually after I beat any  game that I play, I put it away and I do not play it anymore.  But I beat  the game a couple of times, and I am actually trying to do it with every  single character.  Buy the game; you will have so much fun!
