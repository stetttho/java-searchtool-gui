 This is some of the best work that Sylvester Stallone has ever done. I am sure that many people have already seen these movies before, but there is nothing like it when you watch it in digital sound. These movies have been digitally remastered, so the experience is nothing like the originals. I gave this trilogy 5 stars since they are so action packed. They do not make movies like these anymore.
