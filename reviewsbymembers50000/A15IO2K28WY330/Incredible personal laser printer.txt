 Some of my job duties here at work are to help distribute the best performance systems as well as any other computer peripherals such as printers to the users. In this case I needed to get an additional printer. I decided to go with the HP 1200, why? well look at the features, 15 PPM, 1200 dpi.  This printer is replacing the HP 1100, which does it's job @ 8 PPM. They go for the same price! You can upgrade the memory to 64MB. That is more than what you need for a home or personal office printer. This is not a printer for a big network, but you can certainly use it for a personal network. I work in the Informational Technology department, I deal with computers EVERY day of my life.  This printer was bought by me, installed by me, and tested by me. Set up is so easy! all you do is run the CD that came with it, that is all.  It also allows you to use a Parallel Port cable or a USB cable (printer cable is sold separate). As a tip, if you have a USB computer (usually systems that came with Windows 98 or higher) use it, it transfers information from your PC to the printer much faster...  I hope this info helps you!
