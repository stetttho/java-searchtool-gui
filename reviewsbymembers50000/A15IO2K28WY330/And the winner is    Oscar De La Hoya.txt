 When I first saw the CD for sale at Amazon; I felt VERY skeptical about a hardcore boxer singing. I thought that it was going to be like another Rocky or WWF music soundtrack.  I had an idea of who he was as a boxer, a very smart person that always knew what he wanted out of life, and an excellent fighter perhaps one of my favorites. One day I was watching TV and he was in a show where I watched him sing "Ven a mi." I was amazed, so I decided to buy his CD. He delivers many deep messages as a singer, and actually determines the real star inside of him. His voice, well for someone that beats everyone up, is very, very nice and the music has a fine upbeat tone with a very precise soft touch to it. I listen to all kinds of music, and I really enjoy listening to someone that sings from the heart.  Listen to the previews; if you do not speak Spanish, there are a couple of songs in English that are worth the purchase. This is the beginning of a new Latin star in the music industry.
