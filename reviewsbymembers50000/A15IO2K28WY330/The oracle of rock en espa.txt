 This is one of the best performances in the music industry period!  The acoustics and the lyrics blow away any individual who listens to their music. Many new comers to La Ley (including myself) do not expect much of them, but from the moment the guitars, the drums, and the lyrics are mixed together, you begin to zone out, an effect only the greatest music can produce.  Some music takes a while to get into, but finally you love it; other you love from the gecko.  You will feel the music running through your spine from the first time you hear it.  For years many of us have been waiting for the DVD version to be released, and finally here it is. Enough said!
