 This calculator has put me ahead of the class in all my Calculus classes, there are many operations that it can do that the TI83 and TI86 cannot do! Such as derivatives, anti-derivatives, factoring, etc, etc. I've use the TI86 before and there is no comparison, I am now taking Discrete Mathematics, and this calculator helps me out every time. Most of my classmates bought the TI83PLUS or the TI86, and now they are all angry since they did not spend their money wisely. One of the other features is on the display itself; it is incredibly clear and very sharp. The menus are very easy to get around, and graphing is a snap.  Everyone in my class loves the calculator!  Some of the other things that it can do, is actually load games, like packman, asteroids, etc. There is a website that can help you get the most out of the calculator, with instructions on how to use it, plus many questions that you may have on how to perform calculus, or algebraic operations. It also gives you detailed information on the differences between one and the other, but I ask you to take my word for it.  This is a "must have" if you have to take calculus or any other advance math class in the future; I hope this information was helpful!
