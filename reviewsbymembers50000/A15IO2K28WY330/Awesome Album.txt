 This is some of the best work that Jon Secada has ever done. He uses a combination of upbeat sounds as well as his incredible talent to sing soft  music; the combinations of both make this CD incredible.  I went to see Jon  Secada at a free concert that he performed in NYC.  The concert was  amazing. It was like a dream come true to watch him sing ten feet away from  me.  I highly recommend this CD not only to fans of Jon Secada, but to all  the people that get inspired by simply the words of a song.  Not only are  they amazing, but they also deliver a message in them.  If you need some  more information about his concerts and different events, go to  www.secadafan.com.  But for now order the CD, it will be worth your money.
