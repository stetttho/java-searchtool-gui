 This is by far the best Outlook version Microsoft has ever released.  Yes it is true the integration is not so good if you only have Office 2000 (Word, Excel, etc...) however the product is incredibly flexible.  I use it for personal use, however my fianc runs her own online business and we get TONS of emails from clients... a task which was extremely challenging to keep up with prior to this new version. You can simply manage your emails in a very neat and orderly fashion.  Never mind the selection of setting up Hotmail accounts! Outlook allowed us to manage our personal, business, and Hotmail accounts with out the need of multiple profiles. Another advantage is the improvement of managing your follow-up emails.  The application creates a Follow-up folder where all of your follow up emails are easily accessible. If you are running Windows XP you can make Outlook look really nice for cosmetic purposes and really enjoy the new look. Hope this review helps you with your buying decision. :)
