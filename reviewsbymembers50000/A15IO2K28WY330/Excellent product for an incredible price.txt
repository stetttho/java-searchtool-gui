 Ok, so I guess that the person that bought this did not get a rebate, well that should not be the way to determine if a product is good or bad.  First of all, this is an excellent product, and the price is amazing.  I checked everywhere for this type of memory, and it was at least $125.00, now you need to buy in pairs for EDO memory, so you do the math...  It gets expensive.  Anyway, my point is that Amazon sells it at the best price!  So if you need this type of memory, well you will not find this for less. Now make sure that if you are looking to get 32 MB added to your system, you actually need two 16's, if you need 64 MB, then you need two 32's...  This is a great product, buy it!
