 I really enjoyed this story a thought it was beautifully written.  I did not realize that it was the first in a series until I got to the end and I can't wait to read more.  Before I read this book I knew nothing about the Forbidden City and I found my sell totally captured by the tale.  It dragged alittle when the were heading back to the city at the end but overall I would recommend this book.
