 I just finished reading "The Other Woman" and thought it was a good book.  It held my interest and I liked the way the book ended by taking care of all the loose ends.  I think Jane Green is a very enjoyable author and will continue to read all of her books.  But, I did wish the book was more up beat and light like Mr Maybe and Jemima J.  I found this book insightful and made you think about family relationships, but it lacked the escapism and fun of her other books.  I felt like she sat down to write this when she was really angry at her husband and/or mother-in-law.  I hope her next book is more like Mr Maybe and more lighthearted.  This was a serious and mature Jane Green.
