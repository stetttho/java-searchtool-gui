 This book was so enjoyable to read that I was sorry to see it end.  Others have commented that it could have been shorter, but I do not agree.  I thought by the end of the book your really knew each person and saw how they evolved during the story.  Jack was totally Devine!  I got so into this story that I actually had sushi for lunch today!!!!  This book was better than the Other Side of the Story.  All chicklit fans will enjoy this one.
