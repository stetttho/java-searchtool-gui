 This book started out very slow and was alittle too dark.  Although it did pick up halfway through when Kitty got involved with the woman's right to vote movement, I can't say that I would recommend anyone to buy it.   I think if the focused less on the cemetary and funeral rituals and focused more on the people in the book and the relationship between Kitty and Richard it would have been a better book.  The Girl with the Pearl Earring was definately beter.
