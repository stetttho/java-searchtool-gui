 This book is a good as everyone is saying.  I was curious about this book since it was getting rave reviews, but I did not expect that I would like it.  I was afraid it was going to be about war and very anti-American.  I was in for a big surprise.  This book was such a touching story and totally moving.  It is so sad to read about how a country was ruined by "religious" men and how a person could be shaped by one turning point in their life.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.  It is such a heartbreakingly beautiful story that I can not imagine anyone not being touched by this very moving story.
