 This was an excellant sequel to a great book.  I never in a million years thought I would like this book as much as the first book, but Emily Giffen did a great job getting you to like and care about someone that I did not like in the first book.  And unlike the first book, this story was laugh out loud funny.  Where as the other book was hot and electric at times this books was warm, touching and sweet.  It was actually more of a love story!  I never though I would have written this but I liked the second book better than the first and if you read my other reviews you will find that I really really liked the first book!!!  Great chicklit!!! I hope Emily Giffin writes another book really soon.  Buy this, you will not be sorry!
