 I really enjoyed this book and could not put it down.  I hesitated reading one of Dan Brown's older books because I was told they were not as good.  That could not have been more wrong.  If you loved A&D and the DaVinci Code I think you will like this book.   I actually was glad to read something other than the religous stuff and was very interested reading about NASA.  I love his style of writing with the short chapters that each turn into cliff hangers.  I can't wait for his new book to come out and I hope it is as good as the three I have read.  I would highly recommend this book.  It was a lot of fun to read.
