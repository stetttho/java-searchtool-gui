 This book was really great.  It took my alittle while to get into it but half way through I was hooked.  I could really relate to Cath and couldn't believe how lucky she was to meet a guy like James.  Truth be told,  I can't believe any guy would put up with that much in real life!!!    This is my second Jane Green book and she is definetly one of the leaders in Chicklit.  But I do have to admitt that I liked Mr Maybe better.
