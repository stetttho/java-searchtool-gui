 This is the second Trigiani book I have read and I absolutly loved it.  It brought back so many fond memories of my Grandmothers and made me really think about the hardships they had to endure and what we take forgranted everyday.  It also makes you think about idealized first love vs true real love.  I think this was a very heart touching book and would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good book.  Keep the tissues handy!
