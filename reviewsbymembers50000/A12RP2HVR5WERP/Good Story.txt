 I would actually give this story 4 1/2 stars because it was probably about 100 pages too long (between around 350-450), but overall I really enjoyed this book.  I almost did not read it because I thought it would be violent and bloody, but it really was not at all.  I can not believe this was her first book and I thought it was wonderfully planned out.  I thought she was very original in the way she told the story and I loved that it was told by many different people at different times over the course of about 50 years.  I can see why some have called this the Dracula Code, but I feel that is somewhat unfair to the author.  I think the book stands on it's own and is not a copy of Dan Brown (who I also think is a great author.)  I look forward to future books from Kostova.     Possible Spoiler:   Can anyone tell me the girl and Barley end up together?
