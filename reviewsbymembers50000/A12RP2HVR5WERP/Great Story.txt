 I loved this book.  It was a wonderful follow up to TOBG.  In fact I actually liked it better because I liked the central people.  Hannah and Daniel had such a touching love story.  She really was a "fool" who learned to be a woman.  I hope the next book is as good.  I look forward to reading it.  If you liked TOBG I think you will like this book.
