 I do not know what some of the reviewers are talking about.  I totally enjoyed this book.  It was classic Binchy and very moving.  I cried at several points in the book.  All of her books fit together and tell nice tales.  THAT IS WHY WE READ HER BOOKS!!!  I hope Mauve rights another one really soon!!!
