 I had to put this book down because I did not like the story.  I found the book annoying and did not like the subject matter.  I did not find anything funny or amusing about writing a light hearted story around Osama bin Laden and terriorism.  I am really disappointed in Helen Fielding's choice of subject matter for her book.  I loved Bridget Jones and can not believe how disappointing this book was.  I would not recommend it to anyone.
