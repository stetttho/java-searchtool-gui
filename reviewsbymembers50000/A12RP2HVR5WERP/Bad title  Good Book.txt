 I really enjoyed this story and think any fan of "chicklit" will like this book.  It is a more mature and sophisticated story.  It starts alittle slow and doesn't really get going until around 100 pages in, but it turned out to be a very sweet and touching story.  I really came to like Grace and could feel her hurt and fear of rejection that she has experienced in her life.  I wish all chicklit could be this good.
