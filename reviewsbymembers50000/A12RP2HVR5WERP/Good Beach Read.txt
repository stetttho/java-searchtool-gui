 I liked this book and found it very interesting.  I always thought it would be fun to work as a bartender especially working in the Hamptons.  This book showed a whole other side of that life and the ultra rich people they serve.  It really held my interest and I couldn't put it down.  I think there was more truth then fiction in the stories the authors included in the book.
