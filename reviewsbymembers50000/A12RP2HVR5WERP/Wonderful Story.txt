 I had purchased this book after reading so many positive reviews on Amazon and I was not sure if it would live up to all the talk.  Well it was really a wonderful story and I loved it.  I loved reading this historical fiction tale and I would highly recommend it.  Anyone who loved The Other Boleyn Girl will also love this book.  I also think that a few of the reviewers were critical of John and that they do not get that he was just a product of his time and was a good man and very good to Katherine.  I thought he was very sexy!
