 This book was great and lived up to my expectations.  I have been waiting all summer for it to come out and was worried it would not be as good as her previous books, but it was just as good, if not better!  The story was wonderful and I think this would make a great movie.  I can not understand any other reviewer who say it was to light and unrealistic.  Kinsella is the queen of light hearted romantic comedies. I found myself laughing out loud throughout the story.  And the raspberry scene made the purchase of the book well worth the cost!  I am only sadden to know that I will probably have to wait another year for the next Kinsella book.  Anyone who loved her other books, loves Chicklit or is looking for a good romantic comedy should buy this book! It was very enjoyable and I totally loved it!
