 I thought this was a great book that held my attention from the first page.  Anyone who enjoy's Philippa Gregory's books will love this book.  It really explored the deception and quest for power that occurs in the Royal court.  I disagree with anyone who stated that Elizabeth appeared weak in this book.  Even the strongest person would feel the weight and the pressure that goes with the crown and be effected by that.  I found Robert to be and extremely powerful and sexy man and could not help but find him appealing even though his power started to make him into a monster.  I felt sorry for poor Amy who was no match for a Queen.  This was a very facinating book and kept me on the edge of my seat.  I can't wait for her next book and I hope she considers writing more about Elizabeth and Dudley.
