 With the exception of All-Stars, this was the last season of Survivor that I watched from beginning to end. I think this season was so great, that newer seasons just haven't been able to compete.  I didn't understand (and still don't) the 'Rupert craze'. He had some good moments, but I never saw him as a threat to win it all. And I didn't find him all that loveable. He was certainly entertaining, though. Good choice for a cast member.  Like another reveiwer, I was rooting for Burton all the way. When his beard grew out, Burton reminded me so much of Steve Reeves from the old Hercules movies. I just couldn't help but root for the guy.   Although I've never liked him in anything else, Jon 'Johnny Fairplay' was extremely entertaining this season. The 'dead grandmother' will be a tv classic for a long time.  To be honest, I didn't even notice Sandra on the island until the last three or four episodes. For her to win was somewhat of a letdown, but at least the ridiculous, wishy washy Lil didn't win.  Although I was pulling for Burton (both times he was in the game), this season had enough twists, turns, and drama to keep me hooked all the way.
