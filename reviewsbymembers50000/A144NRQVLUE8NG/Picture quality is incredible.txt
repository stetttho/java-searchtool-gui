 The 4th season is probably my least favorite of the show, but it's still better than 99% of other shows on tv. There are many great episodes on this set, but it contains two or three of my least favorites of the series (The Bob Hope episode, Stan gets remarried, and the one about the boxer).   I just can't get over how beautifully crisp the picture quality is on these sets. They've really done an amazing job with remastering these episodes.
