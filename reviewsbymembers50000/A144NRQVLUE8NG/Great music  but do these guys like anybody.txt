 I've always felt that entertainers should entertain, not protest, campaign or criticize government. The music on this cd is incredible. While some songs do sound like retreads of past songs, overall the music is great and, in some cases, very original.  But these guys seem to be anti-everything. anti-war, anti-peace, anti-wealthy, anti-redneck, anti-social, anti-conservative, anti-christian, anti-Jesus, anti-government. Geez, get over it, already.
