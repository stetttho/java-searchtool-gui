 Okay, I know this was a James Van Der Beek geared movie, but I wish it had shown more of Paul Walker's character. One of the most interesting things about the story was that Lance and Jonathan were best friends. We never really got to see how these guys actually worked through the strains that were put on their friendship by everything that happened - before and during the movie.   Jonathan had been in Lance's shadow for years. Everyone in town worshiped Lance, young and old. Then Jon became the star because Lance got hurt. Lance's girlfriend dropped him and went after Jon. Jon got into Brown Univeristy while Lance's dreams went down the drain. I mean, one trip to the the strip club and everythings okay?  Paul Walker is a good actor and could have done great with some meatier scenes and a bigger role. Too bad the director couldn't see that.  But that aside, Van Der Beek is good and Jon Voight was perfect as the coach.
