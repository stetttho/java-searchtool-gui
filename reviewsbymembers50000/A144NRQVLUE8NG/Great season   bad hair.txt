 I love this show and this season. My favorite episodes for this season are: Sick and Tired (Dorothy is sick but no one can diagnose her disease), Rose Fights Back (Rose tries to get a job with a consumer reporter agency), Dancing in the Dark (Rose is intimidated that new love Miles is a college professor), Ebbtide (heartbreaking episode where Big Daddy dies), Comedy of Errors (Dorothy follows up on a childhood dream of being a stand-up comic, Blanche is audited), Clinton Avenue Memoirs (Sophia tries to remember her past by going back to her apartment in Brooklyn), and Sisters and Other Strangers (Blanche's sister writes a novel that appears to be about Blanche, Dorothy struggles to put up with Stan's Russian cousin who prefers communism over democracy).  Bea Arthur is my favorite and I love her, but this season was a bad-hair season for her. Watch for her worst hair episode in 'Dancing in the Dark'. In the scene where Rose asks Blanche to take her place on a date with Miles, Bea looks like she just went through a car wash. I laugh every time I see this scene.
