 This set offers a great deal of extras. It includes about 30 deleted scenes - some hilarious scenes with LC and Lo, which should have been aired in place of those nauseating scenes of Kristin and anyone she was talking to (or making out with).   It has interviews with all the cast and asks some pretty good questions. There were a couple of questions that should have been asked that weren't. Examples include asking LC how she felt when Stephen mouthed 'I love you' to Kristin right before he took her up to his room in Cabo or asking Kristin how she felt when Stephen met LC at the airport in San Fran. I'm sure the reason these question weren't asked is because the interviews were filmed after the show was wrapped, but before it aired.   We are taken on a 'cribs' style tour of LC's incredible new house and Lo takes us on a tour of Laguna. We are shown some footage from the casting tapes. While Trey, Talon, & Morgan are featured more in the extras than they were on the show, great kids like Dieter and Jessica are barely mentioned. I think Talon talked more on the extras than he did on the entire season.   As for the shows, the picture and sound is pretty good. I give the set four stars because a lot of the original music from the show is not on this set. Why MTV couldn't shell out some bucks to do this is beyond me. You'll notice some songs did stay, like '100 years', but the replacement music mostly sucks.  Laguna Beach is a great show. Although I'm looking forward to catching up with some of the cast in season 2, I'm leary because I don't know how much of 'cotton mouth' Kristin I can stomach. According to the preview contained in this set, she seems to dominate season 2. Groan.
