 The songs on this cd have a simple, yet significant meaning, which is to praise Christ and lift Him up in worship. These three ladies share their wonderful gifts to do just that. It is so great to hear Susan Ashton singing again. Let's hope this is just beginning of a comeback - a solo cd perhaps! Christine Dante and Michelle Tumes also sound great. Strong songs include 'I Will Never Be the Same Again', 'Outrageous Grace', and 'I Believe in You.' All in all, a wonderful blessing to anyone who loves great voices and messages of praise.
