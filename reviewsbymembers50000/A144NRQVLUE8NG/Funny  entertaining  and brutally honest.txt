 This book is very entertaining. While some may say it is mean-spirited or right-wing, Goldberg is saying what a lot of Americans are thinking.   We're tired of spoilt celebrities with five mansions and twenty cars getting on tv and complaining about how horrible our country is. We're tired of biased news people trying to become celebrities by bad-mouthing our government. We're tired of white men being blamed for every problem in our country.   Goldberg has guts. Great book.
