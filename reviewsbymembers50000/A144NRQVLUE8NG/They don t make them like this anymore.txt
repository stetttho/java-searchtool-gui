 I have spent the last several nights watching episodes from the 2nd season of this incredible show. What a gift this series was. Good, clean episodes written beautifully with wonderful characters. This show had such a calm pace to its writing. And each episode transports the viewer to a different time when life was more about people than material things. All of the episodes I've watched so far have been excellent. As much as I remembered loving this show, it is still much better than I ever imagined. By all means, revisit Walton's Mountain.
