 While this cd is much better than their previous two 'Back Home' and 'Share the Well', the group still very much needs Derek Webb.   'Sing His Love' is by far my favorite song. It's catchy and it reminds me of songs from '40 Acres' and 'Long Line of Leavers'. It will stay in your head all day.  Two other stand-outs are 'Draw Me Nearer' and 'I Surrender All'. A very nice set from a great band. But they still need Derek Webb.
