 This season is one of the best. The highlight of the season is the first episode called 'The Conflict'. We meet Grandpa's sister-in-law Martha Corrine, her son Boone, and grandson Wade.

Also, John-boy begins college, Ike and Corabeth get married, John-boy enters a dance marathon, Grandpa has a heart attack right before his birthday, and John-boy gets Blue the mule.
