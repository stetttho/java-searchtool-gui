 Here are three scenes that I remember from the second season that are not included in Lifetime episodes:  1. Twas the Nightmare Before Christmas - in the airport scene, there is an extended part of this scene involving Sophia that will have your sides hurting.  2. Long Days Journey Into Marinara - the early scene where Sophia and Angela have prepared dinner, there is an intro to the scene involving Blanche and Angela that Lifetime omits. It's great.  3. Just Between Friends - there is a great scene where Sophia meets Blanche's boss that is hilarious.  That's all I can remember, but I'm sure there are more extra scenes of this season that new viewers haven't seen and us long-time viewers have forgotten. Can't wait for seasons 3-7.
