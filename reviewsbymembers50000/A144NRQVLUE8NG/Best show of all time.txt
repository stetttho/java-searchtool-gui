 MTM Show was a show that kept getting better and better each year. While this is not the best season of the show, there are plenty of great episodes. This was a fun time for fans of the Mary, Rhoda, Phyllis triangle because so many episodes center on this. Also, home life and work life begin inter-acting more as Rhoda and Phyllis become more familiar with Mary's boss and co-workers.  The extras are wonderful, although I do think the producers and directors are featured too much. I would rather have had more interviews with the best cast ever than people I didn't know.  But the episodes are wonderful, the picture and sound are good, and Mary is, of course, beautiful and loveable as always.  Where's Season 3.
