 I'm a big Jason Sehorn fan and I remember when he messed his leg up by returning a kickoff for special teams. I worried that he might not be able to come back. But several months later, I saw him on 'Superstars' - defending his Superstars championship - and was blown away at how huge he was. He had rehabilitated the leg and had packed on some serious muscle.   Not long after that, this video was released. I've always wanted to get it, but could never find it. I decided I wanted to get back in shape and started looking at exercise videos, and was happy to see that amazon had this available.  Although I would have rather gotten a dvd of this, the picture quality of the video is exceptional. And, boy, does Sehorn put you through a workout. I had no idea you could do this much with one of those exercise balls.   This is not your normal workout that is done by everyone at the gym. This is a unique workout that is sure to get you in great shape, while strengthning your abs and every muscle on your body.
