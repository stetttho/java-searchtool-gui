 Finally a Bryan Adams 'best of' with 'One Night Love Affair'. It was almost like he was thumbing his nose at those of us who loved that song.   Only one hit I see missing from this: 'Do I Have to Say the Words'. The song was not a favorite of mine, but why leave it off an anthology collection? I just hope we get the edited single version of 'I Do it For You.' I hate that long version. Regardless, I can't wait to get this collection.
