 Trouble in Shangri-La is one of the best pieces of work Stevie Nicks has ever produced. This is a GREAT cd from beginning to end.   The thing that amazes me about this cd is that it has multiple producers, yet flows perfectly. It's as though the producers all got together and said 'Let's throw in a lot of 70's Fleetwood Mac, a touch of 80s Fleetwood Mac, a bunch of 'Bella Donna' and a little 'Wild Heart' and make the perfect stevie nick's album'.  Sheryl Crow produces several songs and even wrote 'It's Only Love'. Although Crow recorded the song for her next album, I believe she wrote this song specifically for Stevie. The opening line of the song - 'I think I met my match again' - seems to reference Stevie's Fleetwood Mac hit 'Sara'.  Not since 'Bella Donna' has so many great songs been on one Nicks album. Several songs were written in the 70s and 80s, but were never released. Planets of the Universe was written and recorded during the 'Rumours' sessions - (the original recording can be heard on the 2 cd re-release of Rumours about a year ago and sounds nothing like the great version on this cd). Stevie also wrote some great new songs for the cd.  Although much attention is made for the many guest stars of the cd, most of my favorites are the songs sung by Stevie and her two back up singers of many years. My personal favorites are Candlebright, Sorceror, Planets of the Universe, It's Only Love, Love Changes, and Love Is.    If you are a Stevie Nicks fan, definitely add this one to your collection.
