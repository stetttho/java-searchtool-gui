 It's been a long time since a book made me laugh out loud while reading it. I took this to the car dealership to read while having my car worked on. I was laughing so hard, people were staring at me.   I hope she writes a follow-up book that centers more on the parents of kids I hate. This book touches on it, but I do believe there's an entire book to be written on the subject. I'm glad Ms. Frost wasn't too PC - she said just what she felt.  Although I would've preferred no profanity, I was surprised that the book didn't overuse it. There were a few vulgar remarks, but overall, this book was wonderful. And hilarious.
