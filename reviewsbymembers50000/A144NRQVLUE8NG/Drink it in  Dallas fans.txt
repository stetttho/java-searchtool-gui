 I spent days with my nose buried in this book. Boy, did this bring back memories of one of my all time favorite shows. Unlike some of the sloppy tv books, you can tell that the author had a passion for the show and poured her heart into creating this piece of history.   Ratings and rating positions for every episode. Every episode is listed with original airdates. Although the synopsis of episodes is limited, the stories, quotes, and anecdotes listed below the episode will usually remind the reader of what happened. Character's first and last appearances are noted with the episodes occurred. From the great Larry Hagman to the most minor supporting character, attention is given to almost everyone who ever appeared on this show.  A wonderful bonus is the additon of the 'Dallas' movies. Also, many rumors are finally settled, usually from the horse's mouth, and so many surprising facts (like Bobby was supposed to die at the end of the 5th episode of the 1st season). I also appreciated the outrage the cast (including Barbara Bel Geddes) had toward the disrespectful treatment of Donna Reed's dismissal by the producers.  It seemed like the author put so much heart in this book. And it also seemed like the actors appreciated the thoughtfullness enough to contribute the way that they did.   A MUST for any Dallas fan.
