 This cd has some rare album cuts that I've never been able to find on a cd. Stores are overflowed with 'greatest hits' packages that repeat the same songs over and over. But I was thrilled to find some of these great album cuts that are always overlooked.  I'll never understand why we can't get all of Crystal's complete albums on cd (like Anne Murray has done), but until then, I hope we get more cds like this one.
