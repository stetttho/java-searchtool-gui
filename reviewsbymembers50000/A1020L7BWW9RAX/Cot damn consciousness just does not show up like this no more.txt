 First I must state that this emcee is a friend of mine. Courage is an incredibly socially conscious emcee and he has a lot to say on his solo debut "The Art of Spiritual Warfare." Him and his Eastern Sunz crew rep for the politically minded in ways that I have not heard since the days of Public Enemy, way back in the late eighties. His style is a combination of many influences. You can feel the reggae influence in the music, you can feel the Talib Kweli and Chuck D. influence in the lyrics and his voice is all his own. This educated cat is speaking to us about everything that matters to him and should matter to the rest of us. The cool part is that he keeps your attention and commands that you pay him the respect of listening to what he has to say. Once you do you will learn a lot and you will be nodding your head at the same time because he has some amazing beats that just keep rocking even after multiple listens. This album is not the typical. He does not have one song that is not completely conscious. On "Ghost Dance" (6) he is speaking on the different ethnic groups that have been victims of genocide over the years, while he gets a little spiritual and reminiscent on "Three Spirits" (9). When you have an hour and a half sit down and listen for real because Courage has something to say and you owe him the listening because he delivers something that he believes in and is so educational if KRS had not already taken it this album would be called edutainment.
