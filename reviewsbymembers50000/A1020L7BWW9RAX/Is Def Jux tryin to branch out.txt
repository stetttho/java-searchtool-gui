 For those that don't know Boston is home to more than Benzino and a corrupt hip hop mag. The mighty Bean-Town is home to Akrobatik, Mr.Lif, & DJ Fakts One all who are respected solo artists but together form the Perceptionists a union that has been a long time coming and does not disappoint. Actually it is a bit surprising for a Def Jux release. All the beats are much more straight forward and almost all of them are banging in different ways, even El-P switched up his style and laced three of the tracks with some funkiness. If you are at all familiar with either of the emcees in this group you know that lyrics will be in abundance. They an emcee's emcee and they spend the whole album dropping hot lines for everyone to enjoy over and over again. Along with Ak and Lif tearing it up you have Boston legend Guru bless "Party Hard" with his amazing flow, even if he is monotone. This album is just a wonderful ride all the way through and definitely should make it on to the year end top tens.
