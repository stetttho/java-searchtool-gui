 Hip Hop has always been connected to Jazz, weather it was Tribe back in the early nineties, Madlib today or any other producer you can think of chances are they have used some Jazz at some point in their career. Well with this album you get a traditional Jazz trumpeter composing and arranging a straight up Jazz album with a taste of that Hip Hop spirit. Weather it's the "Common Freestyle" or Q-Tip on "Poetry" this Jazz album has just the right amount of Hip Hop to please B-Boys along with the real Jazz fans. Those are just the two tracks with emcees on them. Several other tracks stand out with some great singers performing. The epic "I'll Stay" makes you wonder where D'Angelo has been and on "Forget Regret" Stephanie McKay makes you want to find her solo CD and hope that the RH Factor backs it. This album is an impressive mix of Jazz with Hip Hop and if you are a Hip Hop head looking for an introduction to Jazz then this is the album for you. If you are a Jazz fan that has always been disgusted with Hip Hop's connection with Jazz hopefully this will show you what its all about: Good Music.
