 MF Doom is a character, literally! He can join the Monsta Island Czars as King Greedorah, he can travel through time as the mad Scientist Viktor Vaughn, and now he can team up with Dangermouse to become Danger Doom! When I first heard about this collabo I was convinced it would be another epic album just like the Doom and Madlib "Madvillian" album, but sadly that is not the case. While I was not looking for a remake I was hoping for something reminiscent of what they created. Instead you get something that is completely different and in the end that is what makes Doom so damn good! He releases multiple albums a year and he never sounds repetitive. He always comes with the new hotness. That hotness is due, in large part to Dangermouse who crafts some mesmerizing musical soundscapes. Such as the Cee-Lo assisted "Benzie Box", the beat, some intense drums and what sounds like static and some haunting keys, just put you in a trance. That is what Dangermouse seems to have mastered. He can create the most simplistic of beats that actually are not simplistic at all. He layers sounds like non other and actually allows the song to develop. Lyrically you really know what to expect, more of that Doom madness that just keeps coming and always sounds sick. The guests are top notch and I haven't heard Ghostface sound so good with another emcee since the days him and Raekwon were making Cuban Linx. Every track on "The Mouse & The Mask" flows together and it makes you wonder if Danger Doom really is a superhero here to resurrect hip-hop.
