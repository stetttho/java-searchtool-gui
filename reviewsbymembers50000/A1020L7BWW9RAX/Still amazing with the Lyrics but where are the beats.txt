 Talib Talib Talib...what can I say about the man? Amazing lyricist, involved in at least one & possibly two classics. He is top five in the game right now. So he goes and makes an album with commercial beats. Hi-Tek sounds like a sell out except on the title track, the rest of the beat makers are mostly club banging type beats. Supa Dave West does deliver a couple solid beats and surprisingly just blaze beat for Never Been In Love is tight. So what is it that makes this album just aight? I don't know. I think it is because anyone who has been onto Talib since the days of Fortified Live or 1-9-9-9 know what Talib can sound like over more organic beats. This is by no means a bad album but it just could have been better. I spent most of this review talking about the beats because lyrically Talib is still amazing: "If lyrics sold than truth be told/I'd probably be just as rich as Jay-Z/Truthfully I want to rhyme like Common Sense/Next best thing I do a record with Common Sense." If you want an album full of quotable check this if you are looking for an album full of club banging beats check this if you want an album with vintage Talib over some raw organic beats then go back to blackstar.
