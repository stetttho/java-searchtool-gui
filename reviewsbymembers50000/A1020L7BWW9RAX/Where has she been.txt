 Named after her newly formed record label based around the shining star that is Sacario (what happened to this kid?) this album shows Angie stepping up her game and putting Cool & Dre to work before they were Fat Joe's go to beat makers, and before they were big time producers for that matter. When Angie dropped her first album it seemed she was counting on her radio ties to make a name for herself by loading the album with big name guests. That album was also received as some what of a joke being that she was a radio DJ (and quite a successful one at that). But with this album she is trying to show that she actually does have some skills on the mic and has an ear for talent as she picked up the aforementioned Sacario and Cool & Dre before anyone else new about em. The lead single "If I Could Go" featuring Lil' Mo and Sacario is a hot club banger with Mo dropping a hook very well and both Angie and Sac come with it and Rick Roc drops an infectious beat that can double as both a hip hop club song and as a song that you could salsa to. She calls on a few big name friends such as Missy Elliott, Petey Pablo and Noreaga to come in and add some life to a few tracks. Her alliance with Fat Joe goes beyond just picking Cool & Dre to produce over half the album as Tony Sunshine drops in on the Ski produced "F*cked Up Situation" (10) and Fat Joe himself joins her and Sac on "Live Big remix" (13). This album does a good job of introducing us to some new talent and giving Angie Martinez a name as a solid emcee and not just someone who is trying to hustle her NY fame into worldwide fame.
