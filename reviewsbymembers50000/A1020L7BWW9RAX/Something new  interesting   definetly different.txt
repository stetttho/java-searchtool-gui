 This record took me forever to get. Actually I'm still not sure if I "get" it, but when a record has rave reviews all over the net and I think it's bad I doubt myself just a little bit until I have listened to it to death. That being said I have been rocking this record in my MP3 player for a solid month and I am starting to see what those cats are talking about. But only sort of. Emcee Baje One and producer Snafu have a special chemistry here that really does seem kind of scientific, or maybe that's cause of the topics to rap about: Time travel, plutonium, liquefying ice, etc. Needless to say this album is a little different, but they do it well and with precision. Baje One is a solid emcee with a dope flow and a confidant swagger that is present in many NY representers. Snafu makes beats that bounce and weave around the lyrics usually with only one thing being steady: the dusty drums. At times comical they have created an album that is truly nerd rap, not because they are using big words but they literally are talking about things that my chemistry genius girlfriend would love. Not to say they don't get their straight up hip hop on either though. On "House Wigger" (14) they address those who may be posing as something they are not (and hip hop seems to be full of em). If you are looking for something a little different and fun this album is for you, just be prepared for something you have never heard and may never hear again. Junk Science = dopeness on record, it just takes forever to really sink in.
