 I have been listening to this all day and it is pretty good. The first three songs are all great. The ballad's are...OK. Player is probably the best one. The track with twista is incredible. 112 like to have the interludes but they don't work as well on this album as they have in the past. Overall this album keeps me wanting more and should definitly get them some new fans. Peace
