 Does the Quannum crew ever release a bad album? I do not think so and with the combination of Lateef the Truth Speaker & Chief Excel from Blackalicious it's hard to think that their streak is gonna end. Excel's production on this EP is tight as usual and his use of live instrumentation is very nice. He is just getting better and better as time goes by it seems, I am looking forward to the next album with Gift. Speaking of Gift he makes an appearance here on Best of Me and Beautiful You, both of which are nice. Lateef holds the album down perfectly fine though. He addresses the state of the world on If, and just tears apart the rest of these beats with his flow matching the breaks perfectly. Lateef may not be Gift of Gab but he is just as skilled. Where Gift goes for the fast paced flow, Lateef is slower but still just as on point so don't worry about wishing this was just another Blackalicious album, Lateef fits in just fine. While Excel continues to perfect the art of mixing samples, scratches, and live instrumentation together, we get a good album that could have been a little longer but is still better than most of the releases out their.
