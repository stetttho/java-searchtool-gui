 Hailing from NYC by way of Connecticut, Bisc1 is what you might expect out of the underground. He is an amalgamation of the Def Jux sound mixed with some of his own flavor thrown in their for good measure. Starting as a graf artist and currently doing design work for many independent labels (including Def Jux) Bisc has been perfecting his craft as an emcee for a minute. His beats are a mix of the original dusty boom bap drums with some of the new techno influences that can be found throughout many releases. As a lyricist Bisc does a good job on this EP showing us what he is about. Whether talking about all the pieces that it takes to live this culture on "Pieces" (4) or discussing the haters and how he has no time for `em on "Crumbs" (2) he know how to get his point across and flow to the beat in just such a way that his sound intrigues you and invites you in to listen closer. With only six tracks Bisc1 makes his intro to the world quick and to the point: He has his style and your gonna get with it or not. My suggestion peep him out and you will not be disappointed
