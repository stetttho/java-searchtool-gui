 Oldominion's Onry Ozzborn and JFK come together as Reason & Recluse respectively to form Grayskul and deliver some dark hip hop that only Seattle could breed. They are also joined by bass player Rob Castro who produces one track and lays bass lines down on other tracks. These two emcees both with Latino heritage create an album that is both bumpin and interesting. Due to their cultural ties they deliver songs that speak on ancient rituals and spirits just as much as they are talking about Seattle and how they are super heroes here to save hip hop. They are here to save hip hop with some real lyrics that are more than just dealing drugs and gang banging. Having been around for awhile now they brought in underground heavy hitters Canibus, Aesop Rock, and Mr.Lif to name a few guests and they hold their own next to these lyrical geniuses. The beats are all dark and have a very special feel especially if you have spent any time in Seattle. They harnessed that dreary feeling that looms over the city more days then I care to count and delivered and very good hip hop album not just for Seattle artists but for hip hop in general.
