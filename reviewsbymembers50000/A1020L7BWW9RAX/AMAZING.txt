 If three artists, all experienced members of the Jazz, Rock, Funk & Electronic music scenes, were ever to come together for one night and record an album live Jungle Funk is as a good a representation as any. Vinx, Doug Wimbish & Will Calhoun joined forces April 12-14 back in 1998 to create music that is just that: MUSIC. This can not be classified or categorized. It is an amalgamation of every genre these men have ever worked with or been influenced by throughout their lives. Bringing a unique combination of Drums, Guitars, Samplers, Synthesizers & their own vocals Jungle Funk is funk for the party in the Jungle. Whether you are looking to lay back and chill with some instrumental jams, vibe out to a laid back soul number, or get your freak on on the dance floor this album has it all. With no set pattern these three men combine their musical genius to create something that I doubt could ever be done again. Overall an experience on record that can transport you to wherever you want to be and bring you back in one piece; leaving you feeling a sense of awe like you have just seen the future and the past all in one.
