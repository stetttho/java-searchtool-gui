 This album is not for the faint of heart. It is hard, crazy, rock rap hybrid. Like linkin park but 100 times harder. And it is really damn good. Couple of the tracks don't come out amazing but overall they are all good. Feel Good is awesome, Morgan (Kittie) and Serj (SOAD) add the perfect lines. The reason for this album to not sell is that it is all very hardcore. Great album that should definitly be looked at as a blueprint for Rap/Rock not a rip off of other rap/rock bands. Peace
