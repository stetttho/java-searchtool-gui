 Looking at this album I was assuming she was one of the many young R&B artists who didn't make it. Was I wrong. She is one of very few young women singer/songwriters that chooses to be backed by a band instead of some flossy hip-hop production. Rebekah is a very good singer with a great voice and her songs are well written. Each track on this album is different. None of them sound the same, even though they do revolve around a few key topics. The title track is a great song with her band putting together a great track. Her band seems to be just a collection of studio musicians who know what they are doing and this is demonstrated by the fact that her bass player is Mike Elizondo, who currently is Dr.Dre's go to man for any bass lines he might need. Rebekah unfortunately did not really have a chance to be successful. Our society does not seem to appreciate female singers who are not singing cheesy pop love ballads over some synths and a repetitive drum track. If you are looking for a good singer that you've probably never heard of check this album out you will not be disappointed.
