 In '99 Wildchild, Madlib, & DJ Romes came out as the Lootpack. This album is the closest we have got to another new Lootpack album since. Madlib and his little brother Oh No handle the production and this album is definitely proof that Oh No can step out of his brothers shadow and shine on his own. Anyway this is a Wildchild album so does he hold it down? Yes. His flow is perfect for these style of beats and he spits some hot lines. His flow is all his own. It has the feel of the laid back Cali vibe but at the same time you could play these tracks at a party without killing the energy. He holds the album down even with guests such as Aceyalone and LMNO. Romes brings the cuts into the album to give it that original feel (more artists need to incorporate the DJ). There are a number of guests but they never outshine Wildchild. Overall this album is another solid release from stones throw with the lyrics and the beats being sick throughout. It is Wildchild's album but Madlib's beats are definitely reason enough to pick it up.
