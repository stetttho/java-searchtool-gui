 The beats are sick. That is the best thing I can say about this album and since it is Dangermouse (Grey Album Fame) who produced this album I would expect no less. DM has an uncanny ability of finding some really amazing samples and throwing them into beats to craft something never heard before. The title track is a perfect example; DM samples some chanting harmonies that work perfect with the drums and creates a haunting track. Every track on this album is the result of some kind of crazy sample that is flipped perfectly into a beat that Jemini flows to perfectly. Jemini is not a terrific emcee but he is by now means a terrible emcee. He has his moments but when combined with Prince Po or J-Zone it is hard not to be upstaged. He does drop some knowledge on (...) and "Bush Boys". He's got the braggadocio of typical Brooklyn emcees and demonstrates it on "The Only One" and "Omega Supreme". If you are looking for an album that can be played in the club and for the backpackers, for the intelligent heads and the ones who could care less about the lyrics, you have found the right album and it is all thanks to Dangermouse spectacular auditory creations.
