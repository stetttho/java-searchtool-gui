 Lots of talk and speculation but what's the deal about this crew outta NC called The Justus League? They are taking this hip-hop back to the days when hip-hop was fun and had meaning! This is what hip-hop is all about right here. 9th Wonder, Big Pooh & Phonte just know how to put it down and they do not compromise themselves one bit (which is nice to see from a major label). I know that 9th has been sounding a little tired as of late but he was just saving it for his boys. He worked in a real studio this time around and it shows. His samples are tighter, his drums hit crisper & the overall sound is warmer. Phonte and Big Pooh are both still evolving lyricists, but at the same time they are very precise with their words and flow. They are kept on their toes by the young bucks in their crew who they have guest on this album. Joe Scudda continues to impress me with his verse on "Love It" and Darien Brockington needs to teach these so called R&B cats out today what real soul music is. You find lots of subjects touched on, but it is always second to the overall theme of the album, which is trying to show the world that hip-hop is dope beats & dope rhymes about something, and above all its about having fun. We have lost that in a lot of today's big hip hop stars and Little Bro gets props for taking a stand on something they believe in.  I loved "The Listening" and did not expect them to top it but the more I hear this album the more I think they may have. It is not that "The Listening" was a bad album so much as this album is just more whole. I find it having a familiar feeling. It almost seems like you have been listening to it for years and you just copped it yesterday.
