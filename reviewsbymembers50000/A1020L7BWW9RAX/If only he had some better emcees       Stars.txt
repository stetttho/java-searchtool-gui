 Chicago has been doing some big things on the hip hop tip lately and here is the latest from the windy city. For a debut album he shows off his production skills quite well, while putting his emcee duties on the back burner. Instead he pulls in a bunch of mostly unknown cats to rip it over his amazing beats. These guys don't do a bad job but they are not on the same caliber of most of his musical offerings. The intro track is just a moody instrumental with some really perfect samples scratched in for added effect. On the posse cut "Dreams" (5), Diverse continues spittin pure fire just like he did on his solo debut. He is joined by Longshot and Profound, two other rappers that hold their own. Boston legend Edo G comes in for a solid track with "Take'N'Over" (16) and Copperpot constructs a Pete Rock esque beat for him to tear apart. This album has one major flaw: While the emcees are not weak most of them do not do Copperpot's beats justice. He has constructed some of the better beats for an indy album in awhile but they are laced with rappers that either need help with flow or content (battle raps are tight in a battle, not on an album). If you're a beat fiend check this album if you like thought provoking lyrics go pick up Qwel's album.
