 1999: LA based label Stones Throw releases the debut group album "Soundpices" from Lootpack, a group that consists of emcee/producer Madlib, emcee Medaphor, & DJ Romes. "Soundpices" goes on to become a modern day classic and Stones Throw develops into one of the premier independent hip hop labels. 2005: Madlib is an elite & prolific producer consistently delivering classic or near classic material. Medaphor has changed his name to M.E.D. and putting in work with guest spots on numerous Stones Throw projects and is now ready to drop his debut album "Push Comes to Shove." With eighteen tracks, thirteen produced by Madlib, two produced by Oh No, two produced by Dilla, and one produced by the one and only Just Blaze (yes indeed!!) you know that this album is gon be fire musically. Lyrically this album is only a solid effort. It's obvious that M.E.D has skills and if all the mainstream spit like him than hip hop today would be a whole other story. His flow is choppy and sporadic. He can only really ride to beats that are the same: choppy, and not always easy on the ears. This is the problem with the album. He has amazing melodic beats that unfortunatley he can't do justice to. Their are a couple of tracks that he rides to a tee (dilla's Push) but overall most of these amazing beats go to waste. I don't mean to sound like this album is terrible but if he coulda got some beats that fit his style more it would have come off better. But honestly who is checkin for Stones Throw projects because they want amazing, elevating lyrics? We all know that Stones Throw has a stable of competent emcee's and amazing beat makers and that's what we all want to hear: That new crazy Madlib (...), which we get in abundance here.
