 Royce Da 5' 9", you might be saying who the hell is that but if you like Eminem check out Bad Meets Evil from The Slim Shady LP and you will now who he is. This CD has been held up for awhile but i believe it was worth the wait. Royce has some tight beats on here by Premo (BOOM, My Friend) & the Neptunes (Mr.Baller & Others). Boom is awesome, probably the best song on the CD. The Clipse come through on MR.Baller. Rock City with Em and Nickel Nine Is... are also nice. If you are looking for some straight up hip hop check this CD
