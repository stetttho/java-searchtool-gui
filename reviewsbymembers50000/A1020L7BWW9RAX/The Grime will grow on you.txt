 If you were coming here looking for a rap album turn around right now unless you have an open mind when it comes to music. Dizzee makes what they call Grime music over their across the pond. It is an interesting amalgam of rap, garage, & house. Lyrically Dizzee is a trip. He has a lot to say and the fact that he can flow to these beats is really impressive. His accent adds that extra touch to his songs that make them sound good. He addresses a lot of topics ranging from partying to growing up in the hood's in London (the LD as he calls it). While he is rapping, his beats are like nothing you have heard over here, unless you are a major techno fan. They definitely have the electronic edge to them. While I enjoy the sounds I find it hard to listen to at times because they are so sporadic and jumpy. There are the mellow tracks which are a nice break but overall this album is a straight up party from start to finish so if you are wanted to just chill throw something else on, but if you want to get wild then let Dizzee Rascal pump out of your speakers!
