 There's electro funk, there's dance music, there's glitch pop, and then there is this. A combination of the Prefuse perfected hip hop meets electronica and straight up dance/electronica music Jimmy Edgar shapes an off beat but not album in Colorstrip. While he obviously knows how to man a synth and drum machine he needs to stick with being behind the boards cause laying down vocals is not his strong suit. On "My Beats" (2) he is literally talking (not rapping, not off key singing, talking) and it is just annoying. While some may find it fun and maybe this is what is popular on the dance clubs over the pond I can't get into it. On the beat side of things he does have some cool creations. While definitely in the same vein of Prefuse he does his own thing and he does it well. I can totally see Lady Sovereign, Dirty Rascal or any other grime artist rocking to many of these instrumental tracks but on top of that I could see an emcee with a sporadic flow (Aesop Rock?) sounding very dope over the creations that Jimmy has cooked up. Edgar shows his skills behind the boards and demonstrates that whatever genre this music could be called he is a straight up musician and should be respected as one.
