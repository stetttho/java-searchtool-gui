 Might Mos Def is back. Five years to the day of his previous classic "Black On Both Sides" being released he dropped his sophomore LP "The New Danger." I can't tell you how hyped I was when I saw that I got to here this album, and for me it did not disappoint. There are a couple of low points but overall it is a very good album. Starts out with his rock band Black Jack Johnson just jamming and Mos is rapping with some singing interspersed, and then he goes blues for a track. That song is good but seems out of place between more hip-hop styled tracks. He jacks "The Takeover" beat for "The Rape Over" not bad for a short track. What follows is a mixture of hip-hop, rock, and blues. Mos sings a little but still raps for most of the album. This is a impressive record. If you have followed Mos carrer over the last five years you know he is not the same person he was when he made and released BOBS but its ok. Unlike Talib he did not go commercial and it seems to be working just fine for him cause it is selling steady. Cop this.
