 Midwikid's debut is not that bad. I found it in some cheap $$$ pile and picked it up just because i knew Kay Gee was the producer behind it. Well it does not really disapoint. It is a pretty good album. Some good bass to ride to and some hardcore gangsta tracks. I am more into underground stuff like anticon and def jux etc. but it is much better than alot of the mainstream (nelly & the tics) midwest stuff. Their beats are all provided by somebody named Ratid X and they are pretty smooth and have a dirty south feel kinda. It starts out with some hard hiting beats but it mellows out and is pretty sick. Definitly some head nodding beats here. If you get this you will be gettin something wikid.
