 Wow...where is this stuff today? Motown was one of the most successful labels in the history of recorded music and they always had that funky music to vibe to. Well a group of today's best DJ's and producers have gotten unlimited access to the Motown vaults and this is the result. Absolutely amazing backing tunes that pay tribute to the original's and mix them up at the same time. Z-Trip does an amazing job of incorporating the original vibe of "I Want You Back" while still making it sound like the Jackson family just went to the studio and laid down the vocals yesterday. The Randy Watson Experience is headed by the Roots genius ?uestlove and includes James Poyser (Common, Roy Hargrove) on the B3, and they take over Gladys Knight & The Pips "I Heard It Through The Grapevine" with a full set of live instruments; it's like the funky brothers never left! The last track that I want to mention is the one that I was most looking forward to. It's by the one and only DJ Jazzy Jeff! He teams up with Pete Kuzma to deliver an almost nine minute jam of the Temptations "Papa Was a Rolling Stone". Now if you have heard any of Jazz's recent stuff (not the fresh prince) then you know that this is gonna be beautiful. He does not disappoint one bit, with the original horns still their but distorted slightly. He adds some funky bass lines and of course the Temps are always amazing and this song is no different. Not to forget the other 12 songs on this album they all have their own distinctive vibe that is both modern and old at the same time. Absolutely beautiful music for your listening enjoyment in the 2 double 0 5!!
