 Quannum projects co-founder is back with a remix album of his solo debut Later That Day. Lyrics Born has been makin moves for years on the hip hop scene and now he drops an album that branches out to some other styles. While its still same ol same ol Quannum with Jumbo, Xcel, & Shadow on most of the beats he branches out and works with several new people such as Evidence (Dilated Peoples), KRS-One, E-40, & Herio alum Casual, plus the typical quannum cats Lateef & his wife Joyo Velarde. If you don't know LB, then let me say he likes to fuse multiple genres together and form some crazy bumpin music. Wether its some bluesly/reggae music (Over You #10) or some raw funkyness (Stop Complaining #15) he mixes it up well all the while droping consistent hot lines. All of the music on this album is impressive even if some of it is not your typical hip hop beats. LB is no slack on the mic either, his flow is always changing and he always has something to say. On "Im Just Raw" (4) he comes with the raw battle rhymes that so many emcees forget about once they make it. LB has the album open with two Jumbo bangers (Oregon!!!) and i will just say that i can not wait for the next Lifesava's album cause these beats are awesome and the emcee's do not disappoint, most definetly the two best beats on the album. Latryx comes together for the remix of "The Last Trumpet" which is an amazing song with some very importent lyrics. If you have any preconcieved notions about remix albums then let this album put them to rest. They may not sell millions of albums but they release quatlity music that true fans of music as art can apprciate
