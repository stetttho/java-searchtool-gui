 Philly outfit Jedi Mind Tricks bring the hardcore boom bap hip hop to the forefront with this their fourth effort. While Vinnie Paz has always a lyrical gangsta with hints of philosopher, historian, and theologian he continues the trend here with mixed results. While I do not agree with his homophobia his comments on Christianity and the misconceptions about Islam are well placed. His voice is slightly grating on the ears but generally his lyrics are sick enough to take away from the gruffness of it. Just look to "The Age of Sacred Terror", track 2, to see examples of all his sides and put on display along with tight lyrics: It is the age of the sacred terror/a communist revolutionary Che Guevara. Listen close and you will find lots of little lines that are demonstrate his prowess on the mic. The other half of JMT is Stoupe the enemy of mankind and if he keeps makin beats like he has been on all the JMT albums he's gon be the envy of all producers out there. His beats are just beautiful. Some are operatic, some are Latin influenced and some are just breathtaking. He layers all the sounds together so well that you don't want it to stop, and with this release he felt inclined to give us some snippet's of other beats as interludes and they are all amazing in and of themselves. If you have been looking for an indy group that has a feel of the mainstream then JMT is your group, and "Legacy of Blood" is the album you need to cop.
