 Ace Rock is back once again with an EP to hold us over till he drops another full length and he does not fail. On Bazooka Tooth his intense lyrics were back by Ace newly developed production that was too much for what he had to say. On this album he is back with Blockhead and he has mellowed out his production style. You get the typical Ace Rizzle here along with a few guests such as El-P and CamuTao on Rickety Rackety. Aesop attacks the Catholic Church on Holy Smokes but does so fashionably and brings up some good points. On Food, Cloths, Medicine he is at his best production wise and beat wise with some tight samples. If you are looking for something to hold you over till the next full length then this album will do it and then some. Plus by getting the book "The Living Human Curiosity Sideshow" which contains all his lyrics from the albums Float, Labor Days, Daylight, Bazooka Tooth, & Fast Cars, Danger, Fire, & Knives you can not go wrong with this purchase
