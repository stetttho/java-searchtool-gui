 This album is a universally hailed classic from nearly every one. It took me a minute to enjoy it but going back and listening again and again I discovered what everyone was raving about: Mos Def is a genius. He constructs rhymes that even if they don't seem like they would sound good, due to his flow it comes off amazing. His lyrics are always on point, even when he's making a club track with Busta Rhymes (Do It Know). His voice works well weather he is singing, talking, or rapping. The combination of these styles works well. He recruits some key beat makers for this album including a revitalized Q-Tip, the always on point DJ Premier, and underground heat maker 88 keys. If you are a person who thinks that hip hop is more than shaking your ass then check this album, and if you think that that's all hip hop is check this album out, you might learn a thing or two.
