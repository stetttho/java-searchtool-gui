 The two sisters with soul that comprise the group Floetry know how to make good music. The album opens with the upbeat "Blessed 2 Have," which gives praise to everything they have had in their lives. As the song progresses you see the chemistry they have together and how well the poetry works with the singing. The music is understated on most tracks allowing the vocals to carry the songs and allowing her to stretch out a little bit, expanding the overall feel of the music and contributing to it rather than just being vocals over a beat. This is what shows you that she is a talented singer: She makes the song have life and musicality. The other half of the group demonstrates her title of flo-a-cist throughout the album with styles ranging from spoken word (Let Me In #4), to straight up emceein on "Supastar" (2) where guest Common drops a verse just to show you that these British girls are down. As the album progresses you get the sense that they wanted to give you an album you could put on and chill to, but that also had meaning and was on an old school tip. While it's a mellow album with generally down-tempo love songs they are pure beauty and remind you of the days when R&B didn't exist and it was Soul music. These women make some of the best Soul music you have heard in quite some time and there have been few albums that compare in recent memory.
