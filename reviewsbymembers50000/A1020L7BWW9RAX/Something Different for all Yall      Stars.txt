 So the old adage proves true once again: Take one look at this album's cover (and title) and you're likely to think that Jeune is some gangsta rapper outta LA. I threw it on and damn was I surprised! Not only is he about as far from a rapper as you can get but he is one of the best singers I have heard in a very long time. Granted that this album is eleven years old and from a label I doubt few have heard of, it still has that intangible feeling like "wow" how did he not get noticed. His session musicians do a great job of bringing that old school funk/soul vibe to the album instead of just having some prerecorded beats for Jeune to rock over. This is what really makes this album. Sure we have many singers today and some truly are talented but none of them have that musicianship backing them. Gone are the days when David Axelrod or the Mizell Brothers produced your record from the ground up and recorded the whole thing live in the studio. For that fact alone this record is worth checking out, when was the last time you heard a real soulful singer singing over some real soulful & true music? "Back to Reality..." may not be the most amazing or original thing ever produced but listening to it over ten years later it still sounds fresh and impresses me for what it is: Some guys who just love music and were looking to try and effect change in their community with their music.
