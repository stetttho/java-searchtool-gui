 Hi-Tek...not much can be said. He has produced beats for everyone from Talib and Mos to Snoop and the Eastsidaz. His beats are perfect for Talib but on this album they fit everyone well. He even tries his hand at some R&B with a track from Jonell "Round & Round" which is one of the better songs on this album. Hi-Tek delivers a mixture of his typical raw organic production and some more commercial styled beats. The first song, featuring Common, is a very dope cut as are the Cormega, Talib, and Mos tracks. This album is a good album, better than a lot of the crap out there but it really feels like a compilation more than one artists album. The beats are hot and most of the rappers are on point. It is also nice to see the boot camp click comin back, Tek brings buckshot back for "Illest It Gets". This is a good album but I think Tek should have saved these beats and made another Reflection Eternal album instead.
