 Bishop is your typical straight up hustler/gangsta emcee. He also happens to be a straight up nice emcee. No he is not the second coming of Jay-Z but he has some skills and does a good job of flexing them on this 6 track (w/ 5 actual songs) EP. When I read the title I thought it was going to be some kind of advertisement for helping focus kids and push them in a positive direction. After listening to the album though I don't see how it's any different from any other album released from someone who spent their early lives dealing drugs and sticking up people. So once you get passed the title having no bearing on the content of the album and just look at this as any other hip hop album you can see that this kid Bishop from Newark means business. His flow is straight up east coast and even if he does claim Newark as home he spent plenty of time across the water in NYC. His crew Committee holds their spot well with none of them showing Bishop up but still showing that they can rap to. The beats are top quality making you wonder why they are only releasing this EP. In the end this album stands out with dope beats but falters when you realize that although their hood tales are constructed well they are not saying anything different from every other hustler turned rapper in this business.
