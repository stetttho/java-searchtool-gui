 R&B singers fit into two categories: Either they don't really have any talent but they have slammin bodies or they have amazing talent and maybe not quite the supermodel body. Cherokee does not show off her body here to much but she does show off her vocal cords some and she really shows of some talented writing skills approaching a lot of subjects that stay in the background. On "Stepping Stone" (5) she talks about a woman who is continuously verbally abused by her man but she keeps taking it until she finally has gained enough "strength to carry on." The music is all top notch with a band playing some blues, some jazz, and a little bit of funk. Her voice is very cool but I don't think that she has the pipes of some singers but this is ok cause what she does with her voice works perfectly well and leaves very little to be desired. If you are looking for an album with an honest singer and some funky tunes then go no further than Cherokee's "I Love you...Me."
