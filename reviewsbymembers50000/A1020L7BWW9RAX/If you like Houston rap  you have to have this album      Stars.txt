 The trillest of the trill is finally dropping his debut album. Bun B is no newcomer though. Having released classic albums as the un-incarcerated half of UGK, he helped pave the way for the Texas and more specifically Houston revolution that hip hop is seeing right now. Bun's legendary status is obvious as this independent release shows some of the biggest emcees in the game making appearances, including Ludacris, Jay-Z, & T.I as well as a who's who list of Houston rappers. As far as the music goes this album is your typical Houston gangsta funk. The beats are straight forward thumpin 808's that have been made famous by the likes of Mannie Fresh and KLC. Fresh makes a couple of the soundscapes for B to rip and they sound as perfect as any cash money banger of the past. Jazze Pha pops in to delivering his traditional mix of southern hip hop with that hit of soul and funk that he brings to a track. As far as the lyrics go this is basically Bun and friends getting hard. Bun's voice is deep and strong which makes his tales that much more believable. While he can make an album full of the same topic matter and sound convincing the best track on here is "The Story" (10) which is just that: The story of how he as come from the bottom to the legend he is now. This album is another essential release from the town that seems to be never ending with hits right now. Houston Stand up and lets get screwed!
