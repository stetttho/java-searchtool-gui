 Hip Hops drunken frat boys are back and they are growing up...sort of. "Hello Nasty" finds MCA, Adrock, & Mike D discovering more styles of music to mess around with and steer away from the drunken rhymes of such seminal albums as their debut "Licensed to Ill". Instead they seem to be talking in rhyme about a whole lot of nothing a lot of the time. They are saying stuff but it is kind of subliminal and not direct. I guess this is my beef with the album while it sounds tight throughout and is worth bumping over a lot of today's hip hop this album generally is not saying anything. I have to respect the beasties for continuing & advancing in a genre where most groups that have been around for twelve plus years are still doing the same things they did at the beginning of their career. The music on this album is pretty amazing throughout and the instrumentals placed on the album are really sick. I guess I would have expected that with all their statements about politics and how bad they feel about their misogynistic lyrics of the past they would have included some of that on here. Either way they dropped yet another groundbreaking album for hip hop and it is definitely worth checking out.
