 How do you begin an album from the legendary recluse know as Quasimoto? First let's explain who this high pitched rhymer really is and who he is down with. The crazy beat conductor Madlib is here all over the place whether it's the typical blunted out Madlib beats, which once again prove that he's the greatest diggin producer around. Or maybe `Lib drops some jewels with his typical laid back flow that almost sounds like he is just talking. Then of course there's the Lord. Quas is in and out on every track, probably due to takin hits between bars. Along with the typical genius that you get with Madlib you also get a few guest to come through and "Closer" is an amazing reunion of Madvillain, with MF Doom reuniting with Quas so the two can trade bars. Overall most of the album is just Quas and `Lib tradin off and on with lots of instrumental breaks and some crazy obscure vocal samples. No hooks, no crunk, just that pure and uncut Madlib funk that you only get from lots of bong hits and thousands of old records, enjoy!
