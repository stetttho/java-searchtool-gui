 Impeach the Precedent? Wouldn't we love to see that? I know that I would. But this album is about so much than politics; it is about some great music and helping a good cause. You see, the proceeds that are generated from this album are being donated to the Rainforest Action Network (RAN) as to try and save our world through the grassroots efforts, since it seems that mainstream paths do not want to work. Secondly although this album is called a hip hop album it is really just a compilation album full of some great emcees and some amazing soulful artists. This is what hip hop started as: Old school soul mixed with some new flavor. Whether you are looking for some straight up hip hop, soul, funk, or great music this album has it all. Antibalas comes through with some awesome jazzyness (P.A. 2 #11) for you to enjoy and the Poets of Rhythm (funk group) drop a great cut that just flows and is full of life (Flight To St. Vincent #7). This album not only shows that their still are some good musicians in the world but that there are still people in the music industry that care more about the state of the world rather than money for their pocket!
