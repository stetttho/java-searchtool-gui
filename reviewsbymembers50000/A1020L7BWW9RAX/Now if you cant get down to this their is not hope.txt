 Combine the wonderful rhythms of funk, horns of jazz and some soul singing and what do you get. The positively glorious Breakestra! This album is just a bunch of fun. The lead man, Miles, has a great voice for what they are doing and the backing band can just jam! This project was spawned out of their performances at the root down in LA and if this is what they can do on an album I would be scarred to see them live. Not because they are bad but because they are so damn good! These guys are not looking to do anything but kick it and make some people party. The combination of Jazz, Blues, and Funk & Hip Hop is definitely proof positive that genre's are meant to be destroyed. While there are a few tracks that are laid back this album is basically a party starter. On top of that it is full of old school breaks that those beat diggers will know automatically. Breakestra is just a wonderful album that needs to be heard by all! No hype, no BS just good tunes and a fun time, put it on and enjoy yourself!
