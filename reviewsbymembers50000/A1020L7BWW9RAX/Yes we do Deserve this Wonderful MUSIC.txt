 Michael Franti & Spearhead have been doing this music thing for a minute and this album is just more of their wonderful blend of politically charged lyrics, funky rhythms & awesome grooves. Franti is a wonderful lyricist who knows how to write a song that is good and gets a message across without sounding like he is preaching. His style of rapping is very cool and a different feel for anybody who is tired of the same old same old style that seems to be all over MTV and mainstream radio today. You find yourself bobbing your head to the whole album just because it is that good. He can sing as well and play the guitar throwing in some nice little riffs in the songs to make them his own. As you listen you can't help but feel like if Bob Marley and Public Enemy had a child Michael Franti & Spearhead would be it, and everyone deserves that music for sure!
