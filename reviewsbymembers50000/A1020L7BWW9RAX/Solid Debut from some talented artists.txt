 Aloe Blacc & Exile? They come together and create Emanon. I don't now too much about them but they dropped a pretty good debut album with "The Waiting Room." Most of the beats are raw and organic but scaled down. Not a lot of layers just some tight keys and a drum beat, maybe some strings or a vocal sample thrown in. Now this may sound simplistic but in a day and age when a lot of indy folks are creating massively complex beats this is a likeable change. Aloe is the Emcee & Singer and Exile is the beat creator. Aloe is a tight emcee who drops knowledge on tracks like "Politician" and "Six Million Ways." He also has a voice that beats most of today's R&B singers, and he just does it for fun. Exile is a producer in the vein of Premo but with a modern day feel to his style. Two of the tracks (The World Don't Sing & A Story) fall flat for me. While "The World Don't Sing" makes since in context with the track that follows (Politician), it is just feels out of place. "A Story" might be just that but the combination of the beat and Aloe's flow just ruins it for me. For a debut full length this album shows promise for these two up and comers and it is definitely good enough to make you want to check out their back catalog and any future releases.
