 Where do I start? I saw this album and I was filled with joy! It's been three years since Sage's last official album and several tours. While "Personal Journals" was just that: personal, "A Healthy Distrust" is a bit more political and more of Sage's great poetics. On "Gunz Yo" you here a battle ready Sage with one-liners like "You're dead like De La. I hold my crotch like a 9 MM. Gunz Yo!" On "Escape Artist" Sage tries the triple time flow and does it amazingly, this is probably the best track on the album. Being that Sage is a lover of all music he teams up with Indy Rocker Will Oldham for "Sea Lion", and dedicates a track to the late, great Johnny Cash with "Jah Didn't Kill Johnny." The beats are more of that typical anticon style. Alias puts in a lot of work and they are all dope. The legendary Dangermouse (Grey Album fame) puts in a track, as does Reanimator. All you Non Prophets heads out there Joe Beats gives us the beat to the one interlude on the album. Overall Sage delivers a great album early in the year that easily will keep Sage name at the top of all the best emcee lists.
