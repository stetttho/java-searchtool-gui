 Jnerio Jarel? Who that be? This is what I thought when I received this album in the mail to put in rotation at my radio station. Well this kid turns out to be a producer extraordinaire who happens to emcee just a little bit to. As soon as you pop this album in you are welcomed to his world which is just a little different. Presently residing in Philly he has spent much of his life all over the place. Born in Brooklyn, acquiring the art of rhyme in Houston and perfecting it in New York (with stops in many other places in between) Jarel has a wide range of influences that make his album that much more intriguing. With obvious ties to the Philly "Sound" his style is all his own with influences ranging from the Native Tongues to Soul & Jazz, and even to that Madlib funk. Jnerio gives us an album that is both instrumental and rhymed on. Some tracks he delivers that classic soul vibe and he may throw some ad-libs in (and you thought only commercial artists did this!) with a singer such as Vinia Mojica, of Reflection Eternal fame, crooning away like it was a jam session with the around the way band. Or he may just deliver a straight up hip hop cut where he flows to a beat that he cooked up with who knows how many samples layered in. Overall Jnerio delivers an album that is more like an unsolvable puzzle: the combination of styles, samples, and guests will prevent you from ever fully completing it, but they will also leave you no choice but to keep coming back to it.
