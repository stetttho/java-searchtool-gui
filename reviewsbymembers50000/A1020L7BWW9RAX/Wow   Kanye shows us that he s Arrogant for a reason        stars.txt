 Wow...I got this album two days ago and have listened to nothing else since. I was slightly skeptical about it prior to the release and then all the reviews started coming out saying it was amazing. I was not fully convinced until my man, who did not like College Dropout, told me it was "an instant Classic." If he thought it was that dope then I had to check it out and here I am 48 hours latter still vibeing to it. Kanye and Jon Brion hooked up and did something magical I'd say. We have all heard Kanye's beats and seen his arrogant, egotistical self act a fool on TV and while I'm not a big fan of him as a person he pulled something off that is quite promising of hip hop's future: He made a hip hop album that is musical, socially relevant & sells. I guess that means that we will have to put up with his arrogant ass for that much longer. Being the sophomore album he pulled out all the tricks, bringing in an indie rock producer to help with orchestration, that's right Kanye still has all those samples but he's got strings, flutes, horns etc. on this album and it's live! As you listen to the album you feel the emotion & energy that Kanye has for this music. He loves hip hop so much that he can't be bound down by the so called strict standards that plague hip hop today. Lyrically he actually is solid. Of course he's brought in guests that are better than him but it's a beautiful thing to here Jay rhyme & then here Nas kick a verse on the next song, the epic "We Major". Paul Wall rides the beat to "Drive Slow" with out flaw and Cam'Ron continues his string of guest verses that are dope (keep it up and real heads might be checkin cam!) He solidifies himself as the best producer doin it (sorry Just) and shows us that reality, while not always pretty, can be entertaining and that a rap album can speak on real subjects & still be fun.
