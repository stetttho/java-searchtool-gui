 The battle champion is back with his official sophomore LP. Walz as a rapper is an amalgamation of several styles. We all know that he is a proven battle emcee with more wins than we can count. But on his album he breaks off into other styles equal parts gangsta & conscious, but always dope. C-Rayz comes through on this album with a mix of beats that show the second coming of Def Jux. Most of the producers are cats that I've never heard of but I think that we will all be checkin for em after listening to this album. The lyrical topic's he touches on is wide. He discusses the problems with race and skin color in this hip hop game on "Blackout". He and Vordul Mega get gully on "Street Reppin". Then he flips it and attacks all the wannabe gangsta's out their on "Pink". He does not let up once on the album always spittin that raw and real sh*t for ya brain, and overall he succeeds in continuing the monstrous year that Def Jux is having by delivering an album that will make it onto several top ten year end lists
