 Kanye ruled the hip-hop world in 2004 and now he is after the R&B world. John Legend the Debut artist from Kanye's GOOD music imprint is a classically trained pianist and an amazing singer. A quick glance at the liner notes shows that Legend co-produced every track and wrote all his own lyrics. This is definitely the sign of an artist who wants to control his career and make it a long lasting one. Used To Love U (3) is a really awesome song that has a perfect sample in it to make both the club and the bedroom hype. That is the general vibe of this whole album. Legend mixes old school soul with modern day hip-hop sounds to deliver a very impressive R&B album. Mostly upbeat love songs, but thanks to the Kanye touch they stand out from the typical. The beautiful ballad "Ordinary People" is just amazing, just Legend on the keys and vocals. The guests are kept to a minimum. Of course Kanye has to pop in for an appearance but he spits his typical plain man rap and the Big Boss Dog Snoop stops in for a smoothed out verse on "I Can Change" which has Snoop saying he will give it all up for one woman. The terrific Miri Ben-Ari also has a few spots on here with her violin. If you are looking for a new version of the Ol' School soul that your folks have in their record crates then this is the album for you.
