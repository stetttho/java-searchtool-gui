 Anticon: A collection of artists that all make some amazing hip hop together. This album is Alias second, and first instrumental project. True he has laid down beats for most of the anticon associates over the years but this is just him making some amazing beats. Alias generally goes for the spooky and ominous sounds maybe with some grainy vocals cut in to the track as well. In the vein of RJD2 or Odd Nosdam (another anticon instrumentalist), this album flows from beginning to end with some samples for the true beat digger to decipher, two guest lyricists, and lots of drums and synths. I do not really now how to describe this album other than to say that it is amazing. Alias has done something special here that needs to be heard by the world so buy a copy for you and a copy for a friend, they will love it.
