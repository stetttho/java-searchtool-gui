 This is not even hip hop right here man. Common's album "Be" is a journey. A exploration into what hip hop should be: amazing music. "Be" is just that, music for your soul, music for your brain, music that lets you just be. Common has always been a dope emcee, we all know that but something is always missing. "Electric Circus" was missing the rapping, "Like Water For Chocolate" was missing No ID. What is "Be" missing? Absolutley nothing. Common and Kanye connect and unite chi-town and deliver possibly the best hip hop album of the year. The album has all the magic that ol' skool hip hop albums have, the days when it was one producer and one emcee. Granted Jay Dee (know Dilla) does do two tracks but they flow perfectly fine with Kanye's old soul vibes. Kanye shows a side of him that has been hinted at but never fully explored, until now that is. He uses lives instruments mixed with several soul samples to create modern day soul. This is what makes "Be" an amazing album: It has soul. You can feel the emotion that Common raps with, you can feel the power in Kanye's samples and drums, you can feel the soul in James Poyser keys. Its all real, true MUSIC. Lyrically it should go without saying that the whole album is on point. Common always puts it down for the fans of true poets, and he does it again on "Be". This album is pure and you owe it to yourself to realize like Common does on the title track that "the present is a gift & i just want to be."
