 This album is so tight. I don't know how to explain it. Pete Rock is definetly top 5 producers ever. He mixes the samples up and always comes with that hot beat. Track 13 is amazing, very mellow but at the same time it gets you hyped up. All these songs are hot. Track 8 with CL Smooth is sick. It shows that pete rock and CL should come back and hit us with that heat, it would be certifiable classic 4 sure. Back to this album, pete does some sick outros and intro's to tracks that are really cool, just a short like 10-15 seconds of a tight jazz sample with a hot bassline. This album is a great album for any aspiring rappers. I personally used two of the beats for my first album, but know i got the MPC and makin my own beats. Bottem line Pete Rock is hot and delivers an instrumental album that flows smoothly. Play Dis At Night is one of the smoothest beats i have ever heard with a crazy jazz sample. Petes Jazz is just that some hot jazz that Pete took to a whole other level. The UN are hot but the best track with a rapper on here is "Nothin Lesser" with Freddie Foxx. The Bonus track with the UN #15 is crazy. The Keys that he has in their are sick. So yes indeed this album is hot and i must say you gots to cop it AS SOON AS POSSIBLE its hot as hell
