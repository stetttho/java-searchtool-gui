 Wu Tang, Wu Tang, Wu Tang....what more do you say? The clan has been around for a decade plus and they are still banging. RZA created a new form of sampling and as a collective they were insane. From solo classics to the four full lengths that they dropped it was all amazing. This album starts off with C.R.E.A.M., quite possibly one of the best tracks ever. And it just keeps going. All the hits are here as are a few of the not so famous songs. You get a few rare tracks from soundtracks or from one of the many Wu-Tang side projects and they hold their own with the rest of the tracks. And just to show how classic their debut was half of the "36 Chambers" is here so all you old school heads can hit that up whenever you want. It is hard to create best of records especially for a group like the Wu but they did a good job here. Now if they would just give us a complete box set of every thing (yeah right!!).
