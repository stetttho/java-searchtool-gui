 For a man to go from an instrumental hip hop album to this, which is quite the opposite, and do them both almost perfectly is very interesting. While Wale's project as Science Fiction received a lot of critical acclaim for his amazing musical collages this album here is just Wale performing everything. All the instruments & vocals were done by him except on the few tracks with verses from some amazing emcees. Wale is from Nigeria and you get that African feel on a most of these tracks, whether it is from his voice or from his drum patterns that he creates. The intro track is amazing even if it is not even 2 minutes long. That is a problem on a lot of this album the songs you want to be longer are incredibly short. Wale is singing on this album and his voice is very interesting. Unlike a lot of singers today he actually has a voice that he can use as an instrument which proves to be very nice. His lyrics range from politics to love to life and they are all backed by some amazing sounds. The three emcees he recruits are perfect for this project and while they dominate the tracks they are on they do not take away from the whole Wale Oyejide experience throughout the album. If you looking for some smooth mellow music to have in the background or if you in just one of those odd moods put this in your deck, it is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face and make you problems disappear (at least for the duration of the album).
