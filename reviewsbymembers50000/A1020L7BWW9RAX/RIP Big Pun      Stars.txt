 Posthumous albums are funny things. Few artists recorded like `Pac. That man lived in the studio if he was not in jail. Big pun released one album while alive and it is supposed to be a classic in the truest since of the word. I can't comment on that album cause I have never heard it but this album is fairly simplistic overall. The two skits are just bad. Then two of his Terror Squanders basically get solo tracks: Tony Sunshine with "My D**k" and Remy Martin with "Ms. Martin", so right their your down to only 12 songs that actually have Pun rapping, and this is suppose to be his album? If you throw all the guests in that number gets almost cut in half so overall you have a compilation album with Big Pun and lots of guests. Now sometimes this does not matter but the only great guests are M.O.P., true prospect shows some promise on "Off wit his head"  and Cuban link is aight but basically the terror squad had one great rapper, Pun himself, and lots of mediocre rappers. This album is laced with some nice Latino beats which means that you can at least here the wackness being backed by some good soundscapes. The one thing I will say that when Big Pun is on he is on his flow and lyrics can be spectacular. One example of this is "We Don't Care", for such a big man to have that great of breath control is very impressive since I've heard people that are much smaller than him not be able to flow that well. So overall I would say check his debut and if you see this album used then maybe cop it otherwise it's not worth it.
