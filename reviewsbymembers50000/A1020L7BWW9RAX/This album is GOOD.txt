 Pharcyde has been around for a moment in this world of hip-hop and they have had their break ups and regrouping. Well the former leader of this fun crew of emcees has finally dropped his solo joint and I must say that he delivered a dope album. This thing is fresh, I don't care if the lead single came out 5 years ago or not. Everyone that is hating on the album because it took so long take one listen to "Writers Block" (9) and tell me that you are still mad at him. He put his heart and soul into this album and it shows. It has the typical funky and fun vibe of traditional Pharcyde all the while lyrical content that really is impressive for today's hip hop. He does not kill you with intelligent rhymes that are over your head, he just delivers every man, every day rap from the soul. He talks to his kids on "Dreams" (19), he tells the story of him and his girl on "The Story of Us" (11), and reintroduces himself over some crazy synth strings on the intro "Fat Leezy" (1). The one weak side to this album is a lot of the songs have cheesy choruses that bring it down at times, but overall this album is really dope and I wish I had discovered it sooner.
