 Modern day west coast Wu-Tang? I think so. The Visionaries are 5 emcees and 1 DJ. They come back strong for their third album. A vast array of west coast producers create the musical backdrop for these guys to spit their lyrics. They are solid all the way through. "Nine Eleven" is one of the best songs about 9/11 with lines like "The only enemy is evil/Not other countries, races, colors, or creeds" they are socially conscious and still bangin. They come with some good party tracks like "Strike" & "Momentum". This is a great album be sure to check for it.
