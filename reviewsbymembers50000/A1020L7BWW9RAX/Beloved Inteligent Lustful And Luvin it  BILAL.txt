 So what can i say about Bilal.He is the best singer of today. He has some incredible lyrics. He has killer beats and he is just...Amazing. This album is incredible. Thats the best way to describe it. INCREDIBLE!!! Mos and Common kill it on Reminisce. Dre delivers a awesome track with Fast Lane (one of Dre's sickest beats yet). Now don't get me wrong he has a couple dope guest's but this IS A BILAL album and Bilal rips it on every track. Just a couple stand outs are:All That I Am, Love It, & even though it is a bit different Queen of Sanity is an Incredible track. Bilal is a modern day Marvin Gay fa sho. Cop this NOW. Peace
