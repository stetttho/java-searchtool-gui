 First off i would like to clear up something: This is an EP by a group made up of RJD2 and Blueprint called Soul Position the name of the album is Unlimited. Amazon is all messed up. Anyway on to the album... I don't really now what to say. This is amazing it took me a little while to really get into it but know i cant wait for 8 Million stories (10/7). RJ's beats and Prints rhymes are just flawless. If you liked dead ringer or the horror than you will like this album just because of the beats. But believe me BluePrint does not disapoint. He comes correct especially on the title track and on Mic Control. Well anyway u had best check this sh*t out. Peace
