 The original Roc-A-Fella soul brothers are finally back with an album of smoothed out love songs and up-tempo club jams. The Roc fell apart and they moved on to The Mint and deliver a 20-track album with five chapters and mix results. My first thoughts about this album were that it was too long and that has proven to be true upon repeated listens. The other question I have is what the significance is of the chapters. They are trying to tell a story but the songs in each chapter do not always match up with the chapter's title. As far as the music goes, it's just ok. There are lots of R&B/Soul singers out doin their thing and these two are no different. They have the intense sexual songs (Presidential Suite #8) and they have the love song that goes out to the girl they lost (Farrah #15), did they ever stop and think maybe if they were not out trying to freak every girl they might not have lost that one perfect one? The production is nothing special, Kenni Ski does a decent job pulling double duties as singer and primary beat maker. The one thing that it seems these brothers got goin for em is that they can sing. Their harmonies and verses are generally on point and stand out at times, compared to the rest of today's modern so-called "Soul" singers. If you are looking for some real classic type soul music then go check Bilal, but if you want modern R&B with a touch of the classic seventy's sound this album will probably at least wet your appetite.
