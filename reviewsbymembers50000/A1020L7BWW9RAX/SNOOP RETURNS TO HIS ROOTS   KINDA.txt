 This is definitly Snoop's best CD in a while. If you look at the picture of him on the back he looks like a hungry young MC ready to tear it up on his first album. Of course we all now Snoop is not new, and as the title says he has paid the cost to be the bo$$. The first two songs are both intro's that kind of give doggystyle records a mob feel. Stoplight is the first real song and it is one of the best. The lead single with the 'tunes is tight also. There are a fare amount of guest's on this album including Jay-Z, Redman, & Ludacris. This could probably be snoops best since Doggystyle! Premo gives the best beat on the CD with "The One & Only" wich snoop is. Speaking of beats where the hell is DRE??? That is one of my two complaints for this cd. The other is why did Snoop diss Xzibit?? I hope those two get back together. But anyway this is an awesome cd and if you like classic snoop then check it out.
