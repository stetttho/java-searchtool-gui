 Female R&B groups always draw comparisons to the same artists: Destiny's Child and TLC. Well this group of four talented singers started at the same time as DC and is on a much different vibe as TLC. Four singers all with voices that could bring the roof down and some really smooth hip hop styled R&B production. After listening to this album I have to ask myself what is it that made DC blow up and keep these girls from making a second album together. Most of the time when I pick up an R&B CD I figure it to be some cookie cutter BS but on here you get some ladies that just want to sing about love and their men. Not the most groundbreaking of topics but they do it with class and the music that back em is great. The four interludes throughout the album hold it back a little bit from flowing perfectly but the two emcees that stop in for guest spots come correct. So once again I ask why did a group with so much potential not make it out the box? They even have one of puff daddy's "Hitmen" on board as executive producer. If solid lyrics, great voices, and good music (for this type of R&B) does not sell you to MTV I do not know what would.
