 How do you begin this review? Everlast started out in House of Pain back in the day and then when they dropped off the face of the earth Everlast came with a blues/rock album that received a fair amount of praise. Then there was this, his sophomore effort. While not a bad album it does not always flow that smoothly. He opens with "Whitey" an interesting intro that you could totally see Bubba Sparxxx tear apart, but in all fairness this is the only time that Everlast sounds good over a beat on the album. The rest of the album goes back and forth between guitar based tracks and more traditional rap tracks. His style of rapping over rock beats has been done before but he sounds better than most.  He is at his best playing a mellow blues riff and kind of half singing half rapping his verses. This album is by no means bad and actually it is pretty good but he should have ditched the rapping altogether, even if Kurupt sounds damn good on their duet "One, Two (12)."
