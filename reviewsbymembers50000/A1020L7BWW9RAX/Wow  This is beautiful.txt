 How do you begin to write about such an impressive album? Released on Rawkus before they fell apart, before Mos went to Rock to express himself, and before Tallib tried to go commercial, during what could be called the peak of the underground.  This was just two guys with a passion for dope beats and fluid rhymes. They introduce themselves over hypnotic keys & subtle drums from Evil Dee with the beautiful "Astronomy (8th Light)." "Definition "and "Re: Definition" are two cuts that demonstrate both emcees lyrical skills and Mos early desire to branch out to other genres, he sings the oh so memorable chorus. "Children's Story" is the most obvious tribute to the golden era, as it's a cover of the classic Slick Rick cut, but throughout the album any hip hop head will catch the numerous references, both lyrically and musically, to that time in hip hop. J. Rawls delivers the stunning "Brown Skin Lady" while Mos & Kweli speak about the beauty of woman, more specifically the beauty of  those "brown skin ladies" out their. They get intellectual on "K.O.S. (Determination)" over a very mellow beat and a wonderful chorus sung by Vinia Majica, if this song does not make you want to strive for knowledge of self then I doubt anything will! The album finishes up extremely strong with a posse cut that showed off the Rawkus stable (what happen there?) and then goes to one of the greatest songs ever "Thieves in the Night". Not much can be said about this song other than it is pretty much perfect from what they have to say to the beat to how they flow over the beat, all just amazing. The album finishes up with "Respiration" which features Common and by the end you may just be speechless & in need of respiration. This album shows how great hip hop can be and why we need to support it till death do us part.
