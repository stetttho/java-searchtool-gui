 Ever since i have bought this album i have been waiting and waiting for the rest of the world to start talkin about Res. I have tried to understand why it hasent gone diamond yet. It is just and incredible album. Res voice is like nobody youve ever heard. Her music is dope and her lyrics are good. So if you want some great R&B definitly pick this up. They Say Vision is awesome and so is Sittin Back (my personal favorite) but every track this disc is just amazing. I only hope that even though it hasent sold that well she will get to release another album. The only other R&B album that is as good as this is Bilal's but that is another Review. Right now you just need to do yourself a favor and cop this hot ish. Peace
