 Although this is credited as a Nickpeace album, it is really just a compilation album to show off his label Million Dollar Dream. With fifteen tracks, three being instrumental interludes you get a solid album with very few missteps. They are not the most lyrical of artists or the most creative of rappers but they have a style and they do it very well. Most of the artists here have been around for along time with devoted followings especially in the bay area. Brotha Lynch Hung comes through on the track "Ain't not the bay", which as you can tell is all about people thinkin that Sac town is the same as the bay area. The legend Mac Dre has a track on here, which sadly does not live up to his potential, but since his passing it is probably hard to find tracks that are unreleased by him. The Nocturnal Hustlers have one of the sickest tracks on here with "Rip Tracks" (12) but most of the songs are solid and worth a spin or two. I do not know how many of these artists are on Million Dollar Dream but this definitely makes you want to check for most of the artists that make an appearance. Nickpeace does a good job of releasing a sampler of what to expect from his label in 2005 and beyond.
