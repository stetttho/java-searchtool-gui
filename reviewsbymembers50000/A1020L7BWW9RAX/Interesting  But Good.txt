 One of the original Beastie Boy's doing an alternative rock album? Well Ad Rock did make a country album. At first I did not know what to say about this album, but as I listened so more I found it to be a very good EP. He is experimenting with all kinds of sounds and he did it all himself with a little help from a couple of people. This is what makes this album attractive to me. I love it when an artist does a project all by himself/herself in their own private studio. It seems like the ultimate form of artistic freedom. Mark actually does not have that bad of a voice and the instrumental's backing him are put together well. Don't expect any rapping or DJing on this album but if you like some mellow alternative/indie rock you should dig this, hell I am a hip hop head and I'm feeling it.
