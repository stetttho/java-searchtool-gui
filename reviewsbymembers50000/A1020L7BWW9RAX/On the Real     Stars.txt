 Long before this album dropped I was talking with a friend and I said that I was worried about what this album would hold. Slug & Ant will always have a special place in my heart. They were, in a large part, what brought me into the so-called "underground" hip-hop scene. That being said I had to sit down and listen to this album many times to do it justice in words. Slug has never been a Rakim or Sage Francis, but he has been an above average emcee. Yes he talks about girls, and he has always known how to rock to Ant's beats. He has always had something to say and a lot of the times the best results were the low key jams that his flow was almost him talking. On this album Ant produces some awesome beats that take some getting used to hearing Slug over. Every artist can evolve and what I see here is two individual artists who hit their peak together and are now working as one. Slug stepped up his flow on this album, he had to cause these beats are a sign of a new Ant, he went digging and has created some musical soundscapes that Atmosphere fans will not be used to. Luckily the new Ant gave birth to a new Slug as well who delivers some dope flows on tracks such as "Hockey Hair" (6) and the typical Lucy style rap "Pour Me Another" (8). He also pens an amazing verse that addresses the fan that was raped and murdered at an Albuquerque show in 2002. This album shows that while artistic evolution may hurt on a specific album, what is beginning here will prove to be very beneficial for their artistic output in the future.
