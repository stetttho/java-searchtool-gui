 Ra Scion and Blue Scholars beat smith Sabzi team up to create more homegrown Seattle Hip Hop. Saba moves in a different direction from the original Scholars beats and makes some instrumentals that are a little more soulful and much more produced. This probably has just as much to do with the fact that he is maturing as a beat maker as it does that he is working with an emcee whose style is rooted in the original boom bap. Ra is a nice emcee who has suffered in the past form not having the right beats. This time he gets to flex his lyrics about love, life, and the greatness of hip hop (KRS-One anyone?) over 13 mellow and fun beats. The sticker on the front has a quote from KRS himself saying that this is "real hip hop" and that fact is played upon continually. Scion likes to speak about unifying hip hop and supporting all the elements. He likes to use hip hop as a way to create a peaceful and nice world. But most importantly he likes to talk about hip hop in general. Whether he is shouting out the South Bronx (?) or every Seattle emcee he is truly a lover of this culture. While this is dope to hear and he has dope beats to rock his knowledge over it gets a little tedious and repetitive after multiple listens. If you want something different and fun, pick this up and be ready for and education cause Common Market shows that fun hip hop with meaning can be made and enjoyed; you just got to give it a chance.
