 Gift of Gab & Chief Xcel are back and they just keep on pushing the boundaries. The Craft is their third full-length album and the live instrumentation that the Chief introduced to us on Blazing Arrow is in full effect here. Every song is a journey and they all flow together like one long song. Gift touches on several topics in his usual style: dropping poetical lyrics that 99% of the other emcees out wish they could think of. He speaks on the issues with prisons in America not doing their job of rehabilitation on "The Rise & Fall of Elliott Brown" (10). "Ego Sonic War Drums" (13) is an amazing track that speaks on the political state of the country and world we are living in, and the drums on the track really do make you think of marching into battle! But the overall feeling of this album is exactly what the title says "The Craft" and gab has several tracks that he speaks about this art or rhyme that he practices but the chorus to the title track says it all: "This craft/this beat/this rhyme/this vibe/this style/they say music gives new life/from a source inside that is forever flowin/this stage/this mic/this crowd/this show/this life/I've been givin a gift tonight/& for that I vow to be a vessel."
