 Madlib's little brother was trained well. "The Disrupt" sounds like a cleaned up Lootpack album. Where Madlib's beats sound really old and scratchy, Oh No's beats don't have that old "blunted" feeling. He can rhyme as well. He opens it with a great song Right Now, which also contains some nice cuts on the 1's & 2's. The guests are nice but they don't outshine Oh No. On The Ride we get to here Med and he sounds as good as ever, a good set up for his solo album soon to come. Even though I said that Oh No does do production his brother laced him with some tight beats as well that are a little atypical for Madlib but still sick. For a debut this is a very solid album, typical west coast Stones Throw hip-hop at its best. Look for Oh No to join his brother in the ranks of classic artists in the future.
