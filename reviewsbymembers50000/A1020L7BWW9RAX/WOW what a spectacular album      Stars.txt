 1988? What a great year...even though I was only two and can't remember it. I have gone back and coped the albums from hip hop's "Golden Age". Blueprint is a true b-boy, he knows his history and he ain't afraid to show it. Blueprint covers all the topics from 88 whether it's political consciousness (Liberated), battle rap's (1988), story telling (Inner City Native Son) or the braggadocio that so many of those original emcees had. Along with the lyrics print's got the beats to and he delivers an album that shows plenty of influences form the golden age but still includes the modern day twist on it. This album is fluid and amazing. Sitting here listening to it now I realize that compared to current hot albums this album is ages ahead even though he went age's behind to create it, a true masterpiece.
