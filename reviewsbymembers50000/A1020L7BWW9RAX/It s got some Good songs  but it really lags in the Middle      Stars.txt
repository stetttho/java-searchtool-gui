 When people think about the sound of the south these days one name come to mind: Lil' Jon.  Well that crunk sound has been being developed for many years and it was first seen back in the 80's and was known as Bounce. Developed in Miami and exposed to the world but Luke and the rest of the 2 Live Crew, bounce was bass heavy music for clubs. One of the other early emcee's in this developing scene was JT Money and his crew the Poison clan. While Luke and his boys got famous off of mindless songs about sex JT and the Poison clan actually had some skills and were a little more hip hop and a little less bounce. This CD is a collection of the best songs that these guys did and you will find a lot of the typical topics: hoes, dough, and some hood stories. The poison clan is a decent group of emcees but there is a reason that JT is the lead. He can take command of a song and he does construct some good lines. The clan backs him up with mixed results: sometimes they are on point but sometimes they just don't have enough presence to get you to listen. The bounce sound can get a little repetitive at times and when they make the joints that are just crazy bass with chants it is really hard to listen or take it seriously. If you are a crunk fan then you had best learn where your music came from and see how it should be done. JT Money & the Poison Clan use simple drum beats to spit their stories and they do it better than most trying to today.
