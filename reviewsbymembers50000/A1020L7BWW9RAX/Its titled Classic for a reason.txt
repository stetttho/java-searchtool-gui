 The west coast Wu-Tang? I think so. Living legends is a collective of 9 emcees from the bay area and LA. Last year the dropped their first group album in several years and it was met with only luke warm results. Now a year later they drop a 15 track deep album with all 9 emcees and dubbed it classic because they new what they were making was real. Although the first song is simply titled "Intro" it is so much more than your typical rap album intro skit with an amazing beat and some sick lyrics. This is the formula throughout the album: amazing beats and sick lyrics. All the 9 of the guys drop dope verbal's for ya to devour. A lot of the production is kept in house but they do branch out some with Madlib stopping through and DJ Khalil doing a track. If you dig real beats and some simple man rap then be sure to check this album the first classic album of the 2 double oh 5.
