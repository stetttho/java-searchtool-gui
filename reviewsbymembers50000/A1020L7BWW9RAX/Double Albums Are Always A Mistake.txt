 Double albums...what do you say? All the greats have released em and they all have the same result: Good but would be classic if cut down to one disc. Nas has been getting closer and closer to another Illmatic album since the summer of 2001 and his battle against then king of NYC Jay-Z. Then in the summer of 2002 he went crazy and went at everybody. His moms died and he chilled out a little bit and released his second best album (Gods Son). Now he's back with a nod to the first lines he ever spite on wax: "Streets Disciple/My raps are trifle". With those words he built a buzz that has yet to be matched. With this his eighth album he shows us that he is finally grown up and happy. Nas is goin at the government, the "Uncle Toms" and the rappers that are ruining this art form. At the same time he is settling down (him and Kelis were married a few weeks ago). He is no longer the young and dumb rapper; he is the elder statesman that is tryin to find a balance. He is the Streets Disciple and unlike Jay he aint retiring.
