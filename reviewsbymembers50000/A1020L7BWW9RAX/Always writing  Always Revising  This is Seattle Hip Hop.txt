 If ever two artists were supposed to be together in one group it is DJ/Producer Sabzi & Emcee Geologic. Geo fits Sab's beats like Snoop fits a Dre banger! Their style is all their own and a bit different from the rest of the Seattle hip hop you hear. They definitely are working man's hip-hop and they represent anyone who works hard at perfecting a trade. Their trade happens to be the art of rhyme and beat making and they are pretty good at it. As I listen to this album I find Geologic's voice entrancing and very smooth. Sabzi produces very musical beats that have you instantly nodding your head. Geo's style is pointed towards hard work and his family's history, and Seattle's. They rep home pretty heavily, shouting out 7th & Jackson and on Evening Chai (9) he gives you the low down on what's been happening in Sea Town for ages. This album just rocks all the way through to the end and when its finished you want to play it again. This is where you find its one flaw: it does not have terrific replay value. Its good, don't get me wrong its damn good, but after 10 15 listens it seems boring and you want more. I over look this fact being as it is their debut and it is so amazing those first 15 times.
