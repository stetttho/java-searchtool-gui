 Sample based music has not sounded this good since DJ Shadow stepped on the scene with "Endtroducing." Not that I am comparing Dilla to Shadow, they are both masters of their craft and very different crafts they have mastered. Where Shadow only works with a select few emcees, Dilla has been producing for emcees most of his career. His work has shown no particular love for either coast being involved with both Tribe and Pharcyde heavily in the early to mid nineties before going home to link up with his Detroit brethren Slum Village. As he grew his sound did to demonstrated by his work with the Okayplayer collective. Dilla eventually found his way to Madlib and the stones throw family and one could say that was the first stepping stone to the birth of this album. Dilla was always  known for his samples and the art of digging up just the right loop for that perfect beat, and Donuts is no exception. Made in large part while he was in the hospital fighting Lupes (the disease that would eventually claim his life on February 10, 2006) and other complications arising from it, Dilla never could put in enough work. He had released three other beat tapes similar to this one to the mixtape circuit in the last few years and has two more albums on deck for this year and next. Donuts shows all his artistic influences over the course of its thirty one tracks from dusty drums, to the soul and funk of the sixties and seventies, up to that new Madlib funk that must of rubbed off on him. Dilla was a genius with the turntables and sampler always knowing what the beat needed to be complete. With this album he knew that his time was coming and as it draws to a close you can just feel the samples he chose shouting out to you saying thank you and goodbye. Well Jay Dee it is us the listener who should be saying thank you, we love you and goodbye, Rest in Peace the one and only J Dilla AKA Jay Dee.
