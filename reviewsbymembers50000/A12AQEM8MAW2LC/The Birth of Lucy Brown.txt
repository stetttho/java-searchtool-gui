 "You're a Winner Charlie Brown" is a selection of Peanuts cartoons from 1959-1960. If you like Pigpen, this would be a good one to read, as he appears in quite a few places. You even see him clean in one strip! There's a lot of Linus too. We see him talking though his short lived dream of being a doctor, wondering if he needs to shave, hurling rocks in a vacant lot to let out his emotions. Plus there's Charlie Brown attempting to fly a kite, which you can see from the cover.  Though you don't actually see her in this book, a great deal of this book involves the birth of and thoughts about baby Sally Brown. Chocolate cigar are handed out. Charlie Brown wants to dress her in a jumpsuit similar to his signature zig-zag shirt, and worries about his sis. Snoopy gets dressed up as a baby. Lucy wishes she had a sister and upsets Linus, who has one of the most heartbreaking faces I've seen in Peanuts when they make up again.   Schultz would continue to develop the style of his characters, though I admire the way they are drawn here. They're cute, but aren't "stereotyped in shape" at this stage, if you know what I mean.  Though there are some funny strips, and the birth of Sally is interesting in the scheme of all things Peanuts, it isn't the funniest of the Peanuts series I have read. My favorite Peanuts moments are the silly ones, and though there are silly moments here, they are few. Just a matter of taste. A good read for a rainy day.
