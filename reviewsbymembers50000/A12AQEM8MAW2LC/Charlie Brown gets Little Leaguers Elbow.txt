 "You're the Greatest Charlie Brown" is apparently a name for a cartoon series, I discovered when punching this into amazon.com search. The book I am reviewing is a compilation of Peanuts strips from 1963-1964, selected from another Peanuts book called "As You Like it Charlie Brown".  This is one of my favourite eras of Snoopy. I like the style and the sense of humour across the strips. The book takes a little while to warm up though, I feel.  Quite a few memorable moments. Snoopy gets caught in a flood, Charlie Brown gets little leaguers elbow. Lucy points out all Charlie Browns faults via a slide show, complete with intermission and whopping fee. Linus has to sing a carol for the PTA against his will, thanks to Lucy. Lucy also has a go at poor Linus, making him and his blanket (and deprivation of) her science experiment.  Worth a look for any Peanuts fan.
