 Spock's Beard are a band that recreates the sounds of 1970s progressive rock, while fusing it with their own quirky style. On "Gibberish", they sound a LOT like Gentle Giant, with the acapella rounds and often disjointed structure. Organ, violin, keyboards, and an often noisy electric guitar are thrown into the mix for good measure. As the title suggests, the lyrics don't make much sense, but they do come off sounding deceptively profound. ("All that is shall be in the world. How can it be not what it is? etc"). I don't really like the production much though, it sounds a little more watered down that it sounds like it should be, but it is still a very fun, very enjoyable track. Have a listen!
