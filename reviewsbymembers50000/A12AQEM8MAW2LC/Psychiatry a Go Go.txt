 "You Need Help Charlie Brown" is a collection of Peanuts comics from 1964-1965, including quite a few strips around Lucy's psychiatric booth, featured on the cover.  What happens in between these probably yellowed pages? Quite a bit. Snoopy's doghouse gets a clean out. Linus runs for class president and almost wins. Lucy and Snoopy get into a silly fight (Snoopy licks!). In another section, Linus' blanket, too, has a go at Lucy. Charlie Brown goes to camp, and meets someone as lonely as he is. Snoopy falls in love with a girl beagle at the ice skating rink. Charlie Brown finds his baseball mound covered in dandelions, and gets his baseball team to grit their teeth, with rather funny looking results (Lucy looks hillarious with gritted teeth, which take up half her head!).   The characters look almost as we'd expect them to, though Schultz would continue to refine them as time went on. At this stage, some of the regular characters, like Peppermint Patty and Woodstock, haven't been introduced yet.  It's worth noting some of the comments Linus makes throughout these strips. He comes back from church school all dressed up, saying that he'd been reading the letters of the apostle Paul. In another strip, he reassures Lucy that the world won't flood again because of the promise made by God in Genesis 8. I'd be interested to know what was going through Schultz' head at the time. I've noticed this theme in a couple of the other collections around the same time. Had he been going to church? It's a shame it didn't continue through the series.  For Peanuts fans, "You Need Help Charlie Brown" is worth a read.
