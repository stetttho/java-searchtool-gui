 Here Comes Snoopy is one of my favourite Peanuts books. Compiling selected strips from 1955-1956, it is a book full of laughs. Particularly funny are Snoopy's imitations, of everything from Lucy, to a moose, even Beethoven! Snoopy gets weed claustrophobia, tussles with Linus, while Charlie Brown enjoys chocolate creams and a cool breeze. There's not much of Charlie Brown's self pity and misfortune as there would be later on, and the jokes are a lot simpler, with what seems to be less running gags.  I admire the style of the characters during the era captured. Charlie Brown and the lil' folks around him all look cuter than they do later on, as does Snoopy, who looks more dog-like in his poses here.  Definitely worth a read, and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in the early Peanuts strips. I haven't read too many of the early strips, but I certainly enjoyed this book.
