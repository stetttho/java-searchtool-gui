 I grew up with these fun little books. I loved them so much, I used to carry at least one round with me wherever I went. It's nice to see that the Mr Men series is still around for little kids and their parents to enjoy. Mr Bump is an accident prone guy. He's always breaking things or getting himself stuck. He can't get a job because he's always getting into trouble. He doesn't mean to, but he tends to have accidents whether he likes it or not. Will he find the job that's right for him?  The book has very colourful, cute illustrations. I remember as a kid thinking that even though Mr Bump had lots of accidents, he still had a nice, friendly town to live in. Roger Hargreaves' writing is easy for little kids to understand, while still often witty for the grown-up reader reading it to them. In a way, kids might be able to relate to Mr Bump, having lots of accidents and getting in trouble, even though he doesn't mean to. I'd recommend this for any young children. If they enjoyed this book even half as much as I did when I was little, then it will have been well worth the purchase.
