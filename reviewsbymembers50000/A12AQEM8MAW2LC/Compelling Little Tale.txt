 "Last Jew of Rotterdam" tells the compelling tale of Ernie Casutto, a young man caught up in the Netherlands during Nazi rule. It's a far cry from his childhood, growing up in the tropical paradise of the Dutch East Indies. His sweetheart is taken from him, he lives in fear and doubt. Why are the jews being persecuted, he asks himself? Why do they have to be set apart? Why does he have to go through with this? Where is it leading him? What is the world coming to?  This book is as much about Ernie's coming to Christ as it is about surviving persucution in Holland. Whether he is hiding in an attic, being questioned by Gestapo agents or sitting in the darkness of his jail cell, his ever growing belief in Jesus as his people's messiah is what keeps him going, what gives him strength. It even saves his life a few times, believe it or not. It's what guides his life post-war, it takes him to New York to minister to his fellow Jews.  As well as his story, "The Last Jew of Rotterdam" contains the tale of his wife, Elly (who was a friend of Anne Frank) and an account of his years of ministry, including his battle with glaucoma and blindness, which mysteriously disappears, thanks to what appears to be a miracle.  It's a short book, and very easy to read. Casutto's writing style is simple and concise, while remaining compelling all the way through.  I read in a few hours. I'd say its a good book for children (10-12) to read on the subject, actually. It deals honestly with what happened in Europe at the time without being overly graphic. A great testament of God's power, too. A good faith builder and an inspiration for all us christians out there.
