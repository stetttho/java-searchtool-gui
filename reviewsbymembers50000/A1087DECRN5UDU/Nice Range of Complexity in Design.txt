 As with all Mr. Sibbett's books, the images translate well to computer application when scanned. Most designs are two to a page with three on some pages. There is a nice range of complexity in the designs from simple to  very detailed. Some designs too are scaled to produce items where the image  needs to be large, for instance when you would want the image of only one  or two flowers on the side of a box.
