 This book reflects the quality of all of Mr. Sibbett's publications. I use the images in computer applications and the quality of his images are far superior to other books I have bought. I like the range of complexity one  book will contain. My finished lamps are only a few inches in size, his  designs translate well to this new application of his designs.
