 My application of Mr. Sibbett's designs begin with their being scanned. As with all his books the quality of the images in this book are very good. I appreciate the slight similiarity between some images that lend themselves  well to making matching items. A variety of designs from simple to more  complex are offered. At most their are two to a page making them easy to  work with.
