 This book does contain Tiffany window designs which Tiffany created using Tiffany glass not modern glass. They reproduce very well when scanned. I use them in computer application of the designs. The book which has the  postcards is "Tiffany Stained Glass Windows" by Alastair Duncan  (ISBN: 0486253368)which I also bought. This book does have some colored  images and when combined with the Duncan Postcards you can produce some  nice images. Fifteen or sixteen of the postcards are images that are also  in this book. I would suggest buyers consider getting them both.
