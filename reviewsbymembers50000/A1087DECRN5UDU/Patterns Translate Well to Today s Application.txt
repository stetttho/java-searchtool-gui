 This is one of my favorite source books for designs. I use them in computer application so the line size and clarity are important. Like all Mr. Sibbitt's books, the image quality is high. The designs also lend  themselves well to a little adjustment in width or height adjustment. Many  of the designs have similar components in them allowing one to use them for  matching pieces for both transoms and sidelights.
