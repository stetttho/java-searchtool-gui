 The first step to my using Mr. Sibbett's designs is to scan them. He provides clearly defined, good quality images that scan well at high resolution. The quality of images is not always apparent to the naked eye.  The images are large enough to duplicate well without loosing detail. For  my purposes the max of three images a page at most works well. Other books  may have more patterns but they loose quality when made larger.
