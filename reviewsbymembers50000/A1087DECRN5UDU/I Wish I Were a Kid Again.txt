 I bought this book for the line images of the designs, I use Tiffany designs in computer application. I also bought Mr. Sibbett's book "Art Nouveau Stained Glass Coloring Book" in which the designs are simpler. I was impressed with both books. Paired with a good-sized set of felt tip  markers with fine points, this book is a great gift for a friend in the  hospital or a grand child who has learned to "stay within the  lines" to some degree. It is possible to scan these images, print them  on high quality white paper, color them with the markers, then scan them  again and print them on overhead transparency material. The result will  have transparent colors and is beautiful put in a window.
