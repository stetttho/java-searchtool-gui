 Tiffany made some of the most complicated lamps ever produced, a lot of the design was created with his choice of the individual pieces of glass he used. I used these images for computer application, so the complexity was  welcome. It would require the skill level of an experienced glass artist to  reproduce Tiffany-like lamps; the representations of which are widely  available on the Internet. I would suggest anyone considering making a lamp  with actual glass, copy the tiny image (the line quality of the images is  very good) and taping it together if it is necessary to have a visual image  of the shape of the completed lamp.
