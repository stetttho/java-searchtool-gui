 It isn't at first apparent from the listing that this is a book of postcards. I found it very valuable because I also bought Eaton's "Tiffany Windows: Stained Glass Pattern Book". Although colored  examples were given for them, the Tiffany designs are complicated. 15 or 16  of the postcards were duplicate designs that were in the Eaton book. I use  the images for computer application and they helped me a lot to choose the  right colors.
