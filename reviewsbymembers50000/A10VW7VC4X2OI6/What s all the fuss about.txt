 I almost gave this game 5 stars automatically because it has the words Mario and Kart in it... a shame that it doesn't deserve it. Of course the graphics are great: SNES graphics on a handheld! No slowdown and very colorful. I liked the questionmark-blocks in the snes-version better though :) The sound is ok. Nice voices but the music isn't as good as his older brother. It just seems so... uninspired. And so do the tracks. They are very standard (except for that Indianshyguy-track :) and most important: too easy, even in 150cc. Also the questionmark-blocks keep respawning every few seconds so it's very hard to miss them and you'll blast yourself upto #1 in no time. If you've won the gold cup in each race you can try to get a star/2 star/3 star-rating (to brag about against yer friends) A 1 starrating is do-able but above that it only gets frustrating: you'll have to pick up all the tiny coins (which are sometimes almost invisible because of the GBA-screen) AND avoid the sand,  - 4 times in a row - You wanna play the most fun mode in the game, the battlemode with 4 players? Not possible in singleplayer, only available in MULTIPAK-mode. That means that you'll have to find 3 other people with a GBA and Mario Kart. I wish you good luck finding them... You'll be using the L-button (fire) and R-button (jump) a lot. Be prepared for cramps... So all in all this game, although it sounds great, just doesn't delivers the charming fun of the SNES-version. I you really wanna play this, have you considered buying the original?
