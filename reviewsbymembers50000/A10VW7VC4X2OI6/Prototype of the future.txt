 4 out of 5 stars for BLACK & WHITE?! Yep. Although everybody seems to go totally nuts about this extreamly hyped game, I still found it a slight dissapointment. This is mainly because it's a GAME. You can't have total freedom cuz' it's programmed. The AI isn't perfect cuz' computers aren't. Lots of people (influenced by the press) didn't want to see this as a game anymore but as another, perfect world. I myself went with the hype and that's why I'm a little dissapointed. I've got absolutely nothing to complain about the graphics. They're in one word stunning. Highly detailed and the level of zooming is almost scary! Sound is also right all along. The devil with a 'New York cabdriveraccent' and the saint with the very brittish accent... the music also changes when your more evil or less evil.    And then the game itself... it's just not all that fun. You just have to convert vilages over and over again. The so-called great submissions just really have 2 options (and not 20 like those gamemags say): helping the villager (9 out of 10 times by finding something) or killing him. You'll only really use the titan for converting and helping villages. Also it's very (too) easy to learn 'em things and he doesn't really do much unexpected things. The AI is to blame for that. Not that it's bad, not at all, but we human beings aren't capable, yet, of programming humanlike AI. And that's what bothers me most. I want the game to be more. But it simply isn't.
