 I got drawn into seeing this movie because it's a creation of the same director as Se7en. Se7en was a brilliant movie that, if you haven't seen it, you should really go see. This movie actually has one big flaw: it never gets exciting. It's not at all scary, the plot is predictable and I personally think Angelina Jolie isn't a very good actress. It's basically a movie like Se7en, with one exception; everything what Se7en does right this movie does wrong.
