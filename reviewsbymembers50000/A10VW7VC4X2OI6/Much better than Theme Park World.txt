 The original Theme Park (1994) was, for its time, a fantastic game. It had great graphics, beautiful sound and it was very challenging.      Last year the sequel, Theme Park World, came out. I found it a huge dissapointment. The graphics were pretty good and sound as well, but the game wasn't challenging at all. It returned it the day after I bought it (I finished (!) it in 1 day)    Now there's SimCoaster (or Theme Park Inc.) It uses the graphicsengine of Theme Park World. Like I said, the graphics were pretty good a year ago, but now they're a little dated. Still it's very amusing to see your park running and there's no other game that lets you ride your own coasters!      The thing that's really good about this game is the gameplay. The game starts off a little easy but when you progress through the game it gets very challenging. Just like Rollercoaster Tycoon you'll get cetain 'missions' so you've got a goal to play to. This keeps you playing.    If you like these kind of games you should buy it!
