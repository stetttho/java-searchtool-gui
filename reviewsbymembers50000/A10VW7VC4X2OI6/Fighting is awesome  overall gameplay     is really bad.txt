 This game is very strange. I've never seen such strong elements in an overall pretty lousy game. With the "strong elements" I mean the fights. These fights cause a huge adrenaline-rush. There are a lot of moves and it looks and plays very good. But there are a lot of bad things about this game... For example, the overall gameplay is very bad. 18 levels long you'll have to pull a switch, go through an opened door, whack some baddies and pull a switch again and go through a door again and... you get my point.  This game has also got one of the worst save-options ever known to mankind. The game saves automatically at certain points, but you'll have to complete the level because if you restart the game the save-points are gone! This is only done because if you could save yourself you'll finish it in about 8 hours. But there's something even worse... after completing 10 levels I took a break and when I came back I accidentally pressed "new game". No problem, I thought, just load my old game again, but... The $^$#&#&^# game ERASED MY SAVES!!! The whole city trembled of the scream that left my mouth (hmmm... maybe only the neighbourhood ;)  The graphics are not bad, but very boring. The levels are completely non-interactive. It's a shame that Bungie put such a beautiful fightingsystem in such a lousy game. So... don't buy this game! (....)
