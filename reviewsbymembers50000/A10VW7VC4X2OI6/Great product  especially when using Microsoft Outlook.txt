 ZipMagic always had been as good as/better than WinZip, but now with the newest version it sprints 10 miles ahead the competition. It has never been so easy to inflate/deflate .zip-files. After installation the computer sees zip-files as ordinairy directories so you can browse/copy files in a mouseclick. In this version you can also make self-executable .exe files, which is very handy. There is also automatic virus-scanning (not default, have to turn it on!!!) And a lot more. If you own Microsoft Outlook it only gets better.... If you add an attachment to an e-mail it automatically inflates it when it gets to a certain limit. This is really good thinking. There are a lot more options which I haven't told you yet so.... .... if you do a reasonable or a big amount of zipping/unzipping then this is the product to buy! If you hardly zip/unzip, stick to the cheaper WinZip
