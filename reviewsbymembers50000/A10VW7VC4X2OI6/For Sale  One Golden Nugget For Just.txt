 This adventure is almost the perfect game. I find it at least the best adventure around (the two year newer Monkey Island 4 can't even beat it!) and probably it's one of the best games ever made. Nearly everything's perfect in this game; the beautiful graphics and art-work, the superb voice-acting, the cool jazzy music, and most important; the stoyline. If this game would be a movie it would be a very succesful one. The personalities of the characters are done very well. You'll really feel sorry for Manny (the skeleton travelagent) and when Glottis, his 10 ft high demondriver (with little wiggling ears!) litteraly rips his own heart out because he got fired you'll even be brought to tears. No game has ever gripped me like this one. There is only one little flaw; it's pretty short (finished it in about 5 days) but I didn't feel sorry I spent ... bucks back then on it because it was my best gamingexperience ever! And now it's only ...! So... it seems clear to me what to do...
