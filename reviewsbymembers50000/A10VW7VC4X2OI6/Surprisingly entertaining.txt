 This isn't 'just another superheromovie'. Not at all, this movie is very well done. A good cast, amazing special effects and a good storyline makes this a classic in its genre. Sometimes it's even touching, for example Rogue: she can't ever touch or be touched by a human being. That's so sad! This movie is definitely much more than I expected!
