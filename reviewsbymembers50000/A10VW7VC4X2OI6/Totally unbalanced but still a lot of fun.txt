 I've never played a game quite like this before. The characters are totally unbalanced (some are much stronger than others) and I don't think any other fighting-game would get away with that. But this game is so weird anyway that it doesn't matter. It has got pretty ugly graphics and strange Japanese sound but I had a lot of fun with it. Give it a try, you'll maybe even like it :)
