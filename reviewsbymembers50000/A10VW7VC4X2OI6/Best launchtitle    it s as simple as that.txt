 If you want the best-looking games on your GBA then you should go with Rayman Advance or Tony Hawk. Why shouldn't you buy these games? Rayman Advance: Most of the time (too) easy but sometimes frustratingly difficult. I finished it in a day! Tony Hawk: Looks great but if you've played a Tony Hawk-game before (hasn't everybody? :) then you'll always be longing for the "right" controls and game... OK enough about that, this is a review of Castlevania for crying out loud :) First off, this game isn't for everybody this should be you (more or less :) --- You were brought up with a NES, SNES or GENESIS and now hating that fake 3D-platformcrap and you're wishing that you could play a great, deep 2D-platformer once again --- Is that you? It's your lucky day! The graphics of this game are not bad at all, they are just not as good as RA and TH. The (animated!) backgrounds look gorgeous though and the camera is positioned just right to keep you unirritated. *cough cough* Rayman Advance could learn a thing or two 'bout that! *cough* Music is bee-au-ti-ful with stereo-headphones on. You won't believe your ears! But most important, the gameplay is great. It's very challenging but the difficultycurve is so good that you won't be frustrated at all! Furthermore, it took me 30 hours to complete the game... a handheld-game! The card-system also adds lots of depth and you can create your one style (you want a strong short weapon or a long wweaker weapon? Or will it be more defense/intellegence/luck? Or you want a huge earthquakehamer? It's all possible!) There are about 100 combinations!  This is one of the best games I've ever played. Note that I'm not saying Handheldgame! Whaddya waiting for?
