 Unreal Tournament for the Dreamcast rocks! It's got: - very good graphics, though not as good as Quake III  - 60 (!) levels, most of them are awesome with for example hidden buttons to trigger an object (to ... the enemy ;) and snipingplaces and sneaky corners to surprise the enemy but also great battlefields - cool music and sound - great AI, much better than Quake III; when the enemy is hurt he'll retreat and they haven't just got a higher hit% like Quake III but they'll really act smarter if you turn up the difficultylevel - unreal (had to use this once ;) multiplayer mode: up to 4 players on one Dreamcast with a decent framerate - ... weapons; both firing in two different ways including a sniper rifle, biosludge gun, chainsaw :) and much more - subtle auto-aim, enough to make it playable with the Dreamcastcontroller but not too much to spoil the game Convinced?
