 This console would be even worth its money if it would cost two times as much as it does now. I love the Dreamcast! Why? I'll tell ya why: - it's a bargain... If you're buying a PSone over this gem then I can't think of an other reason than you're plain stupid. The DC doesn't deserve all the negative publicity it got! - superb games: Soul Calibur, Virtua Tennis, Dead or Alive 2, NBA 2K1, Unreal Tournament, Quake III, Shenmue... the list goes on and on! And they WILL bring out more games (about 70) including Half Life and Sonic Adventure 2! - stunning graphics: I'm not joking now but some games even look better than the overpriced and overrated Playstation 2! Fire up Jet Set Radio, Quake 3, NBA 2K1 and you know what I'm talking about! - interesting internetdevelopment: you can play MP3s, SNES games, Genesis games, Movies (VCD) and so on by downloading small tools on the internet. The internetcommunity loves this console and I can't say they're wrong! If you're buying this console (it's worth it, believe me!) than buy a Visual Memorycard with it; it's required for almost all of the games. Buy it... now!
