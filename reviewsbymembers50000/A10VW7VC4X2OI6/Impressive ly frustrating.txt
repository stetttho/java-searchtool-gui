 This game has one thing that's a brilliant idea and a very frustrating flaw at the same time: the time-mechanism. It really makes the game feel alive but sometimes I'd wish it wasn't there. Why? We'll get to that later... Let's start off with the graphics. I don't know why, but they really looked "Playstationish" to me, but in a higher resolution. Bad? Not at all! What I mean by this is that it's got highly detailed graphics and, playstation-playstation :), very impressive facialanimations. The downside is that the graphics are a bit rough, especially when you compare it to something like Soul Calibur or Sonic... nevertheless I'd give it 8,5 out of 10. Sound. Very uhm... Japanese! Or let's say stereotype Japanese-Americangibberish :) Yes, voiceacting is pretty bad and the voiceactors' lines don't really help them either. Music is OK but sound overall could've been a lot better... Now let's get to the most interesting part, the gameplay. It's very intriguing because of the real-time gameplay but frustrated the hell out of me sometimes as I said before. I'll give an example. Ryo (that's the maincharacter ;) walks very far to see someone. But, you are a minute too late and he'll say he's too tired. Then you have to go to bed and walk there all over again, and it adds up to 30 minutes in real life! Yes it's realistic, but it isn't FUN, and isn't that the main purpose of a game? This game really has an interesting idea, rather involving gameplay but something that, thank God, will be ironed out in part 2. And if they do that then there's 5 stars from me to collect :)
