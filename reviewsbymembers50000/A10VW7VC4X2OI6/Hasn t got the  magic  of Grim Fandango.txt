 I've got mixed feelings about this game. There isn't anything really WRONG about this game but during the whole game I found myself comparing this game with Grim Fandango ---> which I liked better. The graphics of MI4 are pretty good and the voice-acting is even superb but I didn't feel drawn into the game. It misses some kind of "adventure-magic" (people who've played Grim Fandango know what I mean and if you haven't played it go buy it!!!) This is I think the most important feature that an adventure should have and this one lacks it :(
