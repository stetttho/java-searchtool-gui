 This game COULD have been a classic but it isn't. The game has been developed under a very strict deadline and because of this you'll often get the feeling that things should've been tweaked a bit. Don't get me wrong, it still has got plenty of things in it to justify the purchase but it's a darn shame that they didn't wait, let's say a month, with the release.  I've got almost no complaints about the graphics. They're very good and move very fast. The camera doesn't always cooperate though, and that can sometimes be very annoying. It also seems that Tails hovers a bit over the landscape so he doesn't let himself be controled fluently.  The difficultylevel of the Sonic and Tails campaign is okay, although sometimes it's a little too easy. I didn't find the Knuckles-campaign quite entertaining. In each level you'll have to find 3 emeralds, adventure-style. This isn't fun because the sonic-games are fun because they're fast and pretty much straight-forward. With knuckles you'll sometime be looking for an emerald for five minutes. The robot-campaign is far too easy, but has a very original and even moving story-line. You'll have to find out for yourself! The leveldesign varies from pretty good (snow-level) to simply amazing (amusementpark-level)  Overall it's a pretty good game that could've been better. It doesn't cost all that much, though.
