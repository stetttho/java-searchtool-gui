 Soundquality: 9/10 This card has got much more power than the previous Live!-cards and everything sounds great. It doesn't get the full 10 because of the lack of A3D-support (IMO better than EAX, but EAX isn't that bad...) and mere average MIDI-sound (Generalmusic) Don't be afraid though, there are some excellent Midifonts circling around the internet.. Software: 8/10 Not too much musicprograms but 2 great games: Giants and Deus Ex. An odd choice by the way since the sound of these games aren't the 'best ever heard'. But it's a good deal, since these games are fun to play. Price/Quality-ratio: 10/10 This card isn't too expensive and it sounds very clean and clear; it's also got 5.1-support and the firewire-port is a welcome addition. 5 stars? Not quite... this baby still _hates_ mr. KT133 and KT266... Ease of installation: 4/10 (VIA+AMD based system) | 8/10 (Pentium based system) Checklist for VIA: - Flash Bios, if it goes wrong you can buy a new mainboard... - Install the new VIA 4 in 1 drivers, hope it goes allright (computer will behave rather strange if it doesn't..) - Tweak Bios: prepare to spend several hours tweaking this thing.. If you don't do this, Windows is likely to crash often and the card produces a loud, crackling noise.. "Plug 'n Play huh?" Concluding Thoughts: This card is a great deal, reasonably priced and good sound but almost reaching 5 stars it trips over "Ease of Use" and loses one for being a frustrating brat and costing me three weekends pulling of utter frustration :)   Now everything's allright and I'm not at all disappointed. Just... be prepared :o
