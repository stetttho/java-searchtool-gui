 "His Women" and "Old Love Affairs", two short stories in this anthology, are such wonderful pieces. I had read both of these when they appeared years ago in The New Yorker, and very much enjoyed reading them again. The stories in this anthology are consistent, and the world  will greatly miss you, Alice.
