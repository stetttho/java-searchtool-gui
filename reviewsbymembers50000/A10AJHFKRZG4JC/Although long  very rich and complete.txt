 Although substantially long, this book is extremely imaginative and rich in detail, in both lore and fact. As in "Veronica," there are so many little connections throughout the story, it almost makes you want to plot a map or worksheet of people and places the story touches.  The book is virtually two stories in one, bouncing between its two main characters. It exploits the writing concept of "suspension of disbelief," where the reader is left to either challenge the likelihood of story events, or go along for the ride.  Magic realism aside, the story ultimately is a traditional one, but the creativity Christopher exhibits and the many fine details in this book make it a very worthwhile investment.
