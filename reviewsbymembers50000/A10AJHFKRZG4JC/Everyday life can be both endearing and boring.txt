 Having been familiar with some of the writings of Maxwell's counterparts at The New Yorker (i.e. Cheever, Updike, Salinger) I was expecting to be periodically impressed while I read this anthology. I did enjoy most of the  stories (though not most of the short improvisations). They are best read  slowly, by a sensitive reader who likes to look at everyday life.  Regretfully, nothing in this book made me whisper "wow."
