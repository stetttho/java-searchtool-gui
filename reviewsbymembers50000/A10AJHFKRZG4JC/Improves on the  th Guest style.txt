 If you loved the 7th Guest, this sequel will not disappoint, aslong as you can get it to run. I managed to, despite 'incompatibleVESA graphics driver' errors on multiple platforms, by downloading afew patches... and invoking it from a DOS window. Compared to 7thGuest, there's much more in terms of movie sequences, and the puzzlesare a bit harder, more of them where you play against the computer. Iespecially liked roaming through the same house as 7th Guest, it nowbeing in ruins, although you will find the door to the left when youwalk in the kitchen still doesn't open.
