 The eight stories in this anthology are poignant pieces of young women encountering the challenges that lie ahead in their lives. Most of the stories have the girl as the main character, and the father is a leading influence. You can read a sample from this collection online at the Ploughshares web site, a very reputable literary publication and the source through which I found this author. The story, "Mr. Sweetly Indecent," was selected as one of the best short stories of the year a few years ago by Best American Short Stories, a popular annual, and is my favorite piece in the anthology. I hope to see more writing of Ms. Broyard in the future.
