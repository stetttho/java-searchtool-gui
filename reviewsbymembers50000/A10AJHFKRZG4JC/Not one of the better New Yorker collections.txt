 Although I am a big fan of The New Yorker, I'm sorry to say this book did not make me laugh. I found it too obscure and I felt stupid I was not familiar with all the proper nouns. The one story here that is an exception is Larry Doyle's "Life Without Leanne," a wonderfully-crafted and indeed funny short short. I was hoping for some basic humor in this volume about everyday life, which follows other recent collections The New Yorker has put out in recent years ("Wonderful Town," "Nothing But You," etc.), and am sadly disappointed.
