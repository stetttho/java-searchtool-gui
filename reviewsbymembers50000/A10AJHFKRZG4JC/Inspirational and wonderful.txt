 I very much enjoyed reading this relatively short novel of a 30-year-old woman in Corpus Christi, caught in her mix of some of life's usual problems. I loved the hobby of creating wood carvings having innovative, contemporary takes on saints, and some of the 1st person thoughts she shares are thoughtful and beautiful. For example, she talks about parallel conversations, like two trees in close proximity, their branches entangled but only because of their nearness, each really wholly a part of its own. I adored the family she works for in the restaurant, and I even loved the landlord Mr. Vela, who struggles with having to free her from the home she's lived in her whole life. The greatest thing about this, to me, was that the author was careful to only show part of the history here until the very end, where a release of how special this relationship really was is brought out. My only regret in the story is Sofia's relation with David, whom I never thought should figure into the story as strongly as he does, and in the very end I feel we reached a bit of a contrived Hollywood resolution. However, this is a wonderful book. I look forward to reading more work of this author, and am grateful to The New Orleans Review for having cited this book in their book reviews section, the place I found out about it.
