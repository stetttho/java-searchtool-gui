 I tried to ignore the fact that Lawrence Sanders didn't write this book, but couldn't. Something was missing. This episode in the McNally series has a little more of the conventional mystery element to it, but regretfully less of the Archy characteristic flair. If you want a decent mystery, you will probably like this book, but if you are looking for more of the "Archy, have you been behaving yourself?", "No, have you?", "Of course not," humor, several of the previous books in the series are much better, my favorites being McNally's Luck and McNally's Puzzle.
