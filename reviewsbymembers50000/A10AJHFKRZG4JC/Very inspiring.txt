 I have had the camera a month and so far it has lived up to its expectations and stated specifications. Using the big LCD display without the battery-saver enabled, I was only able to operate it on a fully charged battery for maybe 20 mins before the battery needed recharging, so if you were bringing the camera to an outside event and you like the LCD display, you will need to buy another spare battery...
