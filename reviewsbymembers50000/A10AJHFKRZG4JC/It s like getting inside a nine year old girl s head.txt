 Very unlike other works from this author (i.e. The Fermata and Vox), this story wonderfully reveals what goes on inside a nine year-old girl's head. I enjoyed the imagination, thoughtful perspectives, and overall  light-heartedness. I also liked, many times, the last paragraph or sentence  of a chapter, which had nothing to do with the incident in the chapter,  just a summarizing thought that could have stood on its own. The one thing  that bothered me about this book is that it is written in third person, but  in a young girl's narrative voice. It made me wonder if the book was  originally written in first person (Nory) and redone. I don't know what the  point is in having a young girl's voice tell the story if it isn't Nory's  own.
