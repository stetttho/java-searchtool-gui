 Having read her other two books, this one was a disappointment because I was expecting the same humor and wit. I struggled with the relevancy  of all the flashbacks. Also, there is little mention of her love life in the  first half of the book; even if she had no serious lover, she had the  beauty and fit the age to at least warrant some installments discussing  love, I think. Fannie, please bring back some of those great exclamations  like "Rats foot!" And tell us once again of an other half falling  into a vat of lacquer.
