 If you have not played the original Siberia and are deciding which to buy, I recommend getting the first. It is not absolutely necessary to be familiar with the first when playing the second, but you will appreciate it more. That being said, Siberia 2 is just as good, although it felt a bit shorter in overall playing time. The graphics and sound are spectacular, and the storyline is reasonable. I needed hints on a few of the puzzles as it wasn't obvious what needed to be done, but the rapture of the game kept me from getting aggravated. I applaud the makers of this game for sticking with it (the original launch date was delayed considerably). Adventure game makers of products this good should be commended; it seems this kind of game demands so much passion and attention. If you enjoyed The Longest Journey you will probably like this one, perhap even moreso, as the scenery and focus seemed to be a bit more consistent. Do whatever you can think of to convince the right people to keep making games like this!
