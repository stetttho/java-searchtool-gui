 I must agree with the previous review. This third annual issue is even worse than the first two. The writing selected on the whole is too dark, distracted from reality, and/or difficult. I read much literary fiction  from college journals, and the variation there is enough for one to enjoy  at least several pieces in each issue. I do not know if the selection of  pieces in this book is a reflection of the guest editor or the writing  workshops, but if Scribner were to keep this effort going in future years,  I strongly suggest more variation and simplicity be considered.
