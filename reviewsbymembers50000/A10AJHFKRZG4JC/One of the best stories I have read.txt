 This book will have quite an appeal to the family man or anyone caught in the precariousness of life, love, job, and family, as they reach their thirties and beyond. Very simple and honest in narrative style, it primarily tracks a man's life through his loves. I thought the book was  very strong in emotion, without there being any violence, drama, or harsh  language. I was completely engrossed from beginning to end, and I feel this  book changed me. If you've read and enjoyed the author's short short  "On Seeing the 100% Perfect Girl..." (in "The Elephant  Vanishes"), you will most certainly revel in this novel. Well done,  Haruki. Please give us more like this.
