 I find it quite funny that almost 3000 people have posted a review for the DaVinci Code, and no one has reviewed AQR, one of the world's foremost forums of contemporary literature. As a reader of short stories I can say the 30 or so stories published each year in this magazine help set the trend for fiction writing, consistently, year on year. Some of these stories are simply magnificent - the best I've read anywhere. Journals like this are terribly under-rated, and their only objective is to produce the highest quality writing. There is negligible payout and no profit involved. This is art here, folks, in the truest sense of the word.
