 If you have not seen "Before Sunrise," released nine years ago, I strongly suggest you rent that one before seeing this sequel. Otherwise, you will not be able to appreciate this movie to the same degree.  "Before Sunset," having the same director and actors, is an 80 minute movie in real time capturing the second meeting of this magical soul mate-destined couple played beautifully by Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke.  First, the bad news - the movie is very talky. I was hoping for a bit more frequent subtle action and silence, as we see as they climb the walk-up. I'm also wondering why the very end fades on one specific character when I think a more suitable ending, and prelude to a third film, would have been a shot from a distance containing them both.   Other than that, I have nothing but praise for this wonderful film that engages sensitive viewers. The subject matter and acting felt so real to me, as if we weren't watching a movie at all, but, in fact, Ethan and Julie as real people in Paris.  I am hoping we do not have to wait another nine years to see them again, but I'm prepared to wait if that is what it takes.
