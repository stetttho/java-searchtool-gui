 I absolutely adored the author's "Philomena" story when it appeared in The New Yorker years ago, and I was so happy to read this more elaborate version. The style of the writing is rivoting, the wit and  sentiments warming and light. There should be more in the marketplace like  this; less drama and violence that will never reach you and me. This story  captures a city-goer who has shared experiences most of us have, and talks  about them in ways we should all appreciate. This and "Story of My  Life" are my favorite works from McInerney, and I hope to read more of  him in the future.
