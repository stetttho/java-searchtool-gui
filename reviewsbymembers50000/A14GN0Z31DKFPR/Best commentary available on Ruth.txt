 This book is a thorough but readable study of the book of Ruth. It pays close attention to the details of the text, including issues of language and cultural background, yet it's also strong on theological matters, which won't be true of many commentaries on Ruth. Hubbard argues that the most likely setting of the book is from the early monarchy during the reign of David or somewhat soon thereafter. His exploration of the obscure practices that may lie behind this book (kinsman-redeemer, Levirate marriage, etc.) are fascinating and thorough, yet he isn't dogmatic on every issue, realizing the difficulties in understanding all the details. Overall, his careful drawing out of the message in this book about God's providence and loving covenant care and the significant effect people will have if they display the same for others is well done.
