 II Corinthians is Paul's most passionate writing, and Clements does a good job carrying some of that passion through. The church Paul planted in Corinth has disappointed him seriously by seeking worldly values in terms of how they live their lives, what kind of people they listen to and follow, and even how they view Paul. He is weak in showing love while people he disagreed with him took control of the church. He isn't very good at entertaining people with good rhetoric. He isn't the flashy demonstrator of the Spirit's power that the interlopers were. So the church in Corinth has significantly been led astray by those who are all about appearance, and Paul is saddened and a bit dismayed. To respond to them would require stepping down to their level, which amounts to foolishness, but he must, or this church is in serious danger. Clements moves step by step through the progress in Paul's thought process as he writes to this church. It moves from sarcastic diatribe against the invaders to heart-felt love for those being led astray. All sorts of lessons for the contemporary church appear along the way. Long known as one of the best preachers in the UK, Clements gives a thorough and nuanced treatment of this highly relevent but difficult to understand letter. His writing is clear, and his exegesis is usually spot on. My only main uneasiness about this book comes at his treatment of the passage in chs. 4-5 about what happens to believers in Christ after death while awaiting Christ's return and the final judgment. I didn't find his view clear at all, so I don't even know how to evaluate his arguments for it, but some of what he said that I did understand wasn't as convincing as I'd expect from him. Other than that, this book is quite worth the time and energy it would take to find it. His books are unfortunately hard to get now. If you can find it used, buy it up immediately.
