 This is the last book the excellent 20th century philosopher Roderick Chisholm wrote. It contains many of the final thoughts he had on metaphysical matters and for that reason is interesting. However, Chisholm was losing his sight by the time this book came about, and he wasn't able to edit it very well. Apparently he was a very visual writer and needed to see his thoughts written out to evaluate them and put them together coherently. This book jumps around a lot, even within chapters. Pieces of it are good on their own, but it doesn't fit together well, and substantive subject changes are frequent without any completion to the previous line of thought. It's probably worth reading for anyone who enjoys Chisholm's work. There's probably much benefit from such a pursuit. However, be aware of the deficiences of this book.
