 Roy Clements is a masterful writer and excellent interpreter of biblical truth for the popular level.  His sermons have long stood out as some of the best Bible teaching of our day.  This book takes various of his sermons over the years on different psalms and collects them together, producing a great discussion of how faith and feelings interact.  He explains about various different emotions how they should reflect our relationship with God (rather than vice versa) and what that looks like biblically.  Half the book is on negative emotions, and half positive.  It's a great combination of good biblical exegesis and practical Christian living.
