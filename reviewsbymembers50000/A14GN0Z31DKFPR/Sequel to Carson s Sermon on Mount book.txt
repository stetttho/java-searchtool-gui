 This book was a long-delayed sequel to Carson's book on the Sermon on the Mount from 1978.  This one covers Matthew 8-10, in which Jesus demonstrates through his ministry what he has already claimed about himself in his teaching in chapters 5-7.  Carson's treatment derived initially from sermons, though all of it was from the background of the commentary he had been working on for the whole book of Matthew (available in the Expositor's Bible Commentary series).  A top-notch biblical scholar exegetes texts well, yet Carson additionally puts the text into persepective, showing its intent in its own context and its applicability to our day.  For a scholarly treatment by this scholar, see his commentary.  For a more popularly accessible book, read this one. Note:  This book is out-of-print in its original form, but it is available now bound together with the Sermon on the Mount book.
