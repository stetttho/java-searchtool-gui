 This book contains Carson's book on the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7) from 1978 and his 1987 _When Jesus Confronts the World_ on Matthew 8-10.  Both books are excellent, and it's nice to have them in one volume. The original Sermon on the Mount book discussed some historical, critical, and theological questions within the main text, and Carson has now separated that material into appendices, making the main body of the text more like that of the second book.  Both books originated out of sermons, and therefore they are quite accessible, yet the fact that they're from one of the foremost evangelical biblical scholars today ensures that they flow out of the best biblical scholarship. This book is an excellent place to get into this section of Matthew without the full study of a commentary and all the distractions therein.  It focuses on the main theological and practical points in the text, making it useful for understanding the point of the text for the Christian life, yet it does it from someone who is a published scholar on the book of Matthew, which gives it far more backing than slimmer studies tend to have.
