 Carson and Woodbridge have done an excellent job telling the story of a man's life from a conversion to Christianity in college until he is mature and serving as a Presbyterian minister later in life. The struggles he deals with, both spiritually and intellectually, become focal points for the authors to share their own insights as professors in one of the foremost evangelical seminaries of our time (and at least Carson was once a pastor also). The story is told in the form of letters from a seminary professor who had been a friend of the main character's father, and the relationship continues and deepens over the years. While the story itself is interesting, the bits of reflection "along with way" are the real gems. The main character and the professor reflect on many topics from relating to our culture, American or otherwise, recent trends in theology and biblical studies, signficant issues of practice in the church today, and just how best to serve God in different contexts. This book is well worth reading no matter your place "along the way".
