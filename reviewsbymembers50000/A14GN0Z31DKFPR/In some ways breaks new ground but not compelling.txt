 This book argues for the view that in the same place at the same time are two things -- the human animal that constitutes me and the person that is me. It's a very odd view given our common sense notions, but metaphysical study shows that no coherent view on these matters will entirely fit with common sense. That view is not entirely interesting, since it is not new, though some of her nuances and differences from earlier proponents of a constitution view are worth noting. The best thing about this book is that Baker has broken some new ground in her attempt to come up with an analysis of the constitution relation. Since her book was published, some reviews in journals have raised serious problems about her actual proposal on mostly technical grounds, which might suggest to some that her work is useless. That's not so. Hardly anyone has even made attempts in this direction, and the process is worth engaging in. Her work on this problem is groundbreaking, even if her actual positive proposal turns out not to work. One caveat - some stellar philosophers have complained that some of her arguments (e.g. for the neo-Cartesian sense that personhood involves something of my being conscious of my own consciousness) at times seem to be more rhetoric than philosophical argument. I'm more sympathetic to this line of thought myself, but lots of her arguments have seemed this way to some. When I heard this response to the book, I didn't immediately wonder if I'd read the same book they had. I do seem some of what they're saying, despite my attraction to what she's saying. So that's worth being aware of. On the whole, there's lots of good exploration here of underexplored metaphysical terrain. For that reason, anyone interested in issues of material constitution and personal identity should look at this book.
