 I noticed a significant drop in price for this textbook.  Therefore I'd like to revise my rating up to four stars.  Schloss and Smith do provide a  fine review of ABA in the classroom.  Its a good solid elementary text.  True some topics are not covered, but perhaps there will be a more advanced  text in the future.
