 This is the home version of the Reading Mastery curriculum published by SRA. We use it in our school kindergarden program.  It is simply the best book to teach your child to read. But the program is not easy. You may need  a reward program to maintain your child's motivation in the program. Use  it, you'll be happy you did.
