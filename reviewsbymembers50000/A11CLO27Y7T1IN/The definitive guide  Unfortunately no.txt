 The ABC 20/20 segment on Bipolar Disorder prompted me to buy "The Bipolar Child" by Papolos et. al.  I expected to get the definitive guide, or at least the nearly definitive guide, but I was disappointed.   The first two chapters were quite good.  There are descriptions of the  behaviors that define a child with Bipolar Disorder.  Chapter four provides  an excellent review of the medications that are used to treat the disorder  in children.  Chapter six provides a fine review of the genetic aspects of  the disorder.    So what's missing?  There are few practical guidelines to  the parent on how to handle misbehavior and how to teach more appropriate  behavior. There is little on the parent/child interactions that maintain  the behavior.  There are suggestions aimed at the teacher. Some are  specific, "Provide a classroom seating away from distractions",  "Have her sit in the front row". But again, there is little  direction about what to do when the child yells, screams, knocks over  tables in class. I'm not sure the suggestions given on pages 275 - 278 are  enough to be effective.  How should the parent and teacher provide  consequences for appropriate behavior and for misbehavior?  What are the  best classroom management systems? Is punishment effective?  How do you set  up a point system that works? What is a functional analysis of behavior?   This whole field of Applied Behavior Analysis is not given enough treatment  dispite it's proven effectiveness with Bipolar and other children with  behavior disorders. There are answers to the questions above.  Parents are  advised to look up the works of Marion Forgatch PhD, Gerald Paterson PhD  (Parents and Adolescents), Patricia Chamberlain PhD (Success Begins in the  Home) and others from the Oregon Social Learning Center.
