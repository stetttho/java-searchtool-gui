 I've recommended this book to parents of young children for over 20 years.  This book will provide step by step instructions on how to teach your child basic math concepts, reading concepts, how to tell time, body parts,  names of animals, concepts such as behind, over, under, around, big,  little, and so on.  If your child has a developemental delay or if your  child has developed normally, this book is an excellent resource.
