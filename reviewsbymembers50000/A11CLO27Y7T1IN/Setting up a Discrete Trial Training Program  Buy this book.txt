 An excellent, comprehensive book that will help you develop a discrete trial training program for a child with autism or other developmentally delayed child.  Terrific curriculum, step by step instructions, data  sheets. Now if there was a video that went with it, you'd be all set.   Great for parents, teachers, practitioners.
