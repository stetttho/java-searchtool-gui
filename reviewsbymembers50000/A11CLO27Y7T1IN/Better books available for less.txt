 Its a fairly decent review of behavior analysis applied to theclassroom.  I'd give it a higher score if it didn't cost $.. for a 300page cheaply made paperback.  There is not much new in this book that hasn't been published elsewhere.  Also, there isn't a lot of practical information for a teacher working for a school district.  It's a typical undergrad college text. The book doesn't go far enough.  For example, there is a section on group contingencies in the classroom, but no mention of "Learnball".  Not much on discrete trial training either. Direct Instruction is mentioned, but the instructional strategy behind programs such as Reading Mastery and Connecting Math Concepts isn't discussed.  There is a lot of excellent information in the book, its just that for cost I expected a lot more.
