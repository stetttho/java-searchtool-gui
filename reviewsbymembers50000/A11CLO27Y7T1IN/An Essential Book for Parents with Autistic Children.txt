 The authors present an excellent overview of behavior analysis applied to the treatment of autistic children.  There is a chapter on what methods have proven effective and what methods have not.  There is a terrific curriculum guide that shows Beginning, Intermediate and Advanced skills to  work on. There are two chapters on language development & speech  therapy that are very helpful.  If you have a child with autism, buy this  book.  If you are a teacher or practioner also buy the more comprehensive  guide "A Work In Progress.."  written by Ron Leaf PhD, published  in 1999.
