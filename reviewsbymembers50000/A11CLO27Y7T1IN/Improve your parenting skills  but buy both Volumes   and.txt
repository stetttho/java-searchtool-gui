 This is part 2 of a two volume set. See my review of part 1.  Although some parents may lean towards buying only one, you'll learn more if you read both volumes.   Much of the information in part 2 assumes an  understanding of the principles discussed in part 1.  Part 2 covers  communication and problem solving skills and how these skills can be  applied to solve sexuality, academic difficulties, drugs and alcohol use.   The last two chapters provide an excellent discussion on  compliance vs  oppositional/defiant behavior in children.  You may want to look up other  books by Marion Forgatch and Gerald Patterson.  They are basic researchers  in the field of child psychology and behavior who take their research  findings (and the works of others) and present them in nontechnical terms  for parents and mental health professionals.
