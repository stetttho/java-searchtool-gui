 "Preventing Failure in the Primry Grades" details a catch up program for the child who is seriously behind in basic arithmetic and reading skills.  It is aimed at teachers more than parents but parents will  find the information on teaching techniques very helpful too.  There are  chapters on mangaging your classroom, teaching (and remediating) reading,  developing language skills,  and teaching arithmetic.  Another excellent  book by Englemann.
