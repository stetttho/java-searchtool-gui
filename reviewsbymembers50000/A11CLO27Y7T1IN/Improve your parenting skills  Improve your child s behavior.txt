 Gerald Paterson and Marion Forgatch provide practical, useful and effective suggestions on how to improve your parenting skills and thereby improve the behavior of your children. Replace negative, coercive  parent/child interactions with more positive, reciprocal interactions.  Volume I covers basic family managment skills: how to give effecitve  instructions, how to set up household rules, how to design and implement a  basic point system and so on.  Part 1 teaches parents how to respond to  specific adolescent behaviors and establish consequences that result in  changes in their child's behavior. The principles in this book work well  with kids aged 8 through 16.  Some suggestions may not be as helpful for  older teens, 17-18 years old.  It's better if you read the book now, when  your child is 8,9, or 10 than wait until your child is 17.  Buy both  volumes 1 and 2. Volume 2 covers Communication Skills, Problem Solving,  Sex, Drugs, and Alcohol, School Problems and more.  The two books are an  excellent resource for child counselors and family therapists.
