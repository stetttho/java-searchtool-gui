 I am 48, 140 lb's overweight.  I nave NEVER exercised. I hate to walk, etc. and it is hard to keep up on any of the exercise tapes. They found 6 months ago I have an enlarged heart and chf. I can not get myself into exercise.  Do not have the money, or space, for a tredmill, and if it is to cold, hot, wet, etc. (if not 65-75 and not to humid,etc. not something I will walk in.)I do not walk. lol I have used this 3 times now.  I can not get past the .25-.50 of the 1 mile 'walk'  but I do it 2 times a day.  It is easy, and keeps me going.  I can make myself do it and right now pace it to myself, in time I can keep up.  In the past when I did walk, it was a slow shuffle along, even as a kid and I was at most 10 lb's overweight then. I got my weight 24 years ago when I became a mother.  Anyone can keep up with this.  and if you want harder, I am sure the 3mile one is harder.
