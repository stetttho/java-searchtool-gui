 This will be my 3rd printer since I got my first computer in summer of '96. It is the best one I have had (if I make cards I want the color on the cards to look like they do on the computer...this is the first printer that does that.) My husband takes a lot of landscape as well as sunset/sunrise photo's with our dig. camera and likes to print and frame them. With the photo print cartridge you can  buy, they come out looking just like they did in life. Great! It is very easy to fix a paper jam and it is the easyest printer I have ever changed the ink with. It is VERY simple.  I love this printer!
