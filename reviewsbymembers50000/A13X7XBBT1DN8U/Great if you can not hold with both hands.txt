 I do not have this yet, but my husband had a stroke 18 years ago so only has the use of his right side.  Any game that uses the touch pad he can not use, as he can hold with one hand but not do the other stuff.  This  (I hope) will make it so  he can put the game in the dock, and use the touch screen with the one hand he can use. (so there are some that need this and are not lazy, etc.)
