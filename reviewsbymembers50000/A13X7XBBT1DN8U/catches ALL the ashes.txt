 I burn incense time to time.  (with 3 dogs and 2 cats the house has that wet dog smell,etc.  and sprays make them cough.) The wood holders, never catch the ash, half the time they fall to the side and are everyplace BUT in the catcher.  With these they   look nice and catch every ash.  With 3 of them for the price I can put one in the living room, one in the back room, where the dogs eat, and one in the garage/game room.
