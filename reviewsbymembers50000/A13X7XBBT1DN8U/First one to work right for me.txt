 I am 48 and have a bad back. My daughter lives in another state so she can not help me.  My husband had a stroke in `89 & is paralyzed on one side...so he can not help me.  Ok, I can not use the air pumps at stations as they are very heavy, to heavy for me and I can not lean over for long that far.  I have tried cheap air pumps, they don't work for me. I even bought one for $79 and it is good but you have to hold it on the tire air stem and when I tried it, I lost ALL the air in my tire. lol I could not keep a good seal. (and that one took me over 10 min's and over 20 min's for my daughter to refill the tire....she was home for the weekend.) I need to be able to do this myself , no problems, when I need it. I tried this today (got it yesterday) and it worked GREAT!!!) First, the hose you use to attach to the tire stem is just the right size and screws on for a GREAT fit and seal! Next, it sits on the ground, a must for me, I can not lean over any longer then it takes to attach it. It also has a gage on it that helps. When it says 40, my tire pressure is about 33 (it needs to be 30) so I need to learn what is what, it goes 20-40 and when putting the air in..turn it off and it goes to right mark, it reads a tad high. But easy to learn what the right mark is from using it. Everything but the big hose you use for air matterss, etc. is stored inside and attached. I love it. Also, I have a ford taurus wagon and the air stem angles a bit to the side, even my daughter had problems (no problems with her Aztec as the stem is straight out) but with this hose, doesn't matter what the angle of the stem is, it works fine and is VERY easy to attach and use. If you have any problems, as I have, this works  great and worth every penney. Oh, it took me under 12 min's to do 2 tires! (including attaching and unattaching each tire.) I hope this helps some.
