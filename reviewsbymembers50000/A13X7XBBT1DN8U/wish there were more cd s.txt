 I am 45 and growing up we had 2 of his LP's..*smile* one was the star one and it had that song and some children see him I Love both and over the years have lost them and can't find his cd's (the were lp's then) from the 60's I guess it was. I don't like his music much but for me, his Christmas songs ARE Christmas.
