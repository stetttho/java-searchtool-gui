 I got these a few days ago and have already played 3 of the dvd's that have them on with no problem.  (tho there is a tiny sound when the disk is first inserted and starts up.....)  I want to use them on my cd's also as I have found in the last year, some of the ones that no longer play, I can not longer get, so want to keep all my fav's working ok.  (I do not like what I hear about a sound on the cd's tho as I like them pure and clear, almost like 'live' and have problems with my mp3 player for that reasen...not as rich as a good cd player.)...but I will try them on my cd's anyway.  Want to get more so all my dvd's can be protected.
