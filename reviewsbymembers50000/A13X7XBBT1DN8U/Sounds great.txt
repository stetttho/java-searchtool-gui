 I ordered this but I have not received it yet, I will edit this once I have.  But as to the person thinking you get to open new places to soon...coming from myself who hates any exercise and 2 times a week for 5 mins is to much...thos of us need incentive to keep going. We need to take baby steps and if you do only a bit and get something new, then you want to do a bit more,etc.  But maybe they need to make it so one can set it to take longer to open something up or shorter time, what works for the person.  I got this the other day. I like it but it won't let you say you can not get on the floor,etc.  At this time I have a bad back and can only do the warm ups.  I can NOT get on the floor and no cruches or sit ups, most of them,even the most easy, are on the floor,etc. I can not say I have to stand or sit in a chair, so at this time it is more then I can do.  Have to stay witht he R Simons one where you sit in a chair or wheel chair, but it is only 15 min's and won't but you if you miss a day.  In time this will be good but not now, was hoping hubby could use it too but he is parlized on  one side and can not get on floor, it won't let you input this kind of thing.  oh well, almost a great one. it has droped between a 2 1/2 and a 3 star now.
