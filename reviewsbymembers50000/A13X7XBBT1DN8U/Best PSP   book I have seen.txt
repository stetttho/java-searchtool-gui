 I looked at many of the psp 7 books and all the reviews said they were not for what I wanted the book for, mainly to fix digital camera and other photo's and maybe do some effects on them. Besides that, just to learn what psp 7 can do and how to do it. I needed some kind of book, saw a good review for this one so bought it. I am soo Happy that I did! It is great. very easy, well as much as any 'how to' book can be, to understand and with enough info that once I get better at things it still has stuff for me to learn. (many books are useless once you learn the basic's). I would recommend this for anyone that is new to dig. photo's and psp7, as well as those who have used psp for basic things but want to learn more advanced things for it. If you are looking for a book to help you learn and show you what psp7 can do, get this one!
