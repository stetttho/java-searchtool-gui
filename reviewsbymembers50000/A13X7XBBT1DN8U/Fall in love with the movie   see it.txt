 I saw this movie for the first time on Feb. 14, and plan to see it at least one more time before the DVD comes out in may. (I hope!!) I loved it, husband thought it was ok and happy he saw it..once.  It haunts me, I love the type of movie it is anyway.  But everything about it stays with me.  As others have said, I can not get the music out of my head..and not at all unhappy about that. I heard the cd of the London cast, and it was nice and had great voices.  But I think Butler's is the best for the part. It makes one care about the Phantom.  Makes you wish he could be happy, makes you (ok this may only be a female thing. lol) fall in love with the Phantom at the same time you are repulsed by how he controls and even kills. I knew I would like it if only for the music, as I love ANY scores that Webber does.  I have not been able to see any but what he turns into movies, but I have heard, if only on cd's, other of his works and love them all.  But I never dreamed I would fall in love with this movie the way I have. I can not even explain why.  I fear I will wear the DVD out once I do get it.
