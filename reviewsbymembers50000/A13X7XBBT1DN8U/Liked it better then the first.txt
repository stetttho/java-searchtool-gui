 I hated the org. movie, and still not wild about the plot.  But I am a big Depp and Tim Burtan fan, so that made it good for me. I was bored a bit with both of them tho I fear. I saw this one at the movies and 3 days later went with my 24 yr old daughter to see it again, as she was home for a vist and does not get much of a chance to see movies. We both enjoyed it.  It is with no doubt a Burtan movie, so if you are not into him, you will not be into this one.  It may not be as good as some of his others, but still has his 'stamp' on it. But then I love  Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas,  Corpse Bride, and  Beetlejuice. However I did like it well enough to buy it for my collection. (mostly my Depp collection but I tend to like the movies of Tim Burton's that Depp is in..like the two of them as a team.)
