 This is the only Pizza oven I have tried and as of yet we only cook frozen pizza's, that being said...It cooks them better then  the oven or my convection oven. The top gets melted and if not, I can melt it after the cooking with out cooking the crust anymore. or I can finish the chrust with out cooking the cheese anymore, if I want a more crisp crust. The reason it did not get a 5 from me is I like to not put heat in my kit. in the summer, I tend to like the ho use at 73 then. I do a lot of cooking with a crock pot to keep the heat down. This lets the heat out so I may need something differnt in the summer. It did my french crust pizza the best I have ever had it.  The prices have droped since it came out a few years ago, that makes it even better.
