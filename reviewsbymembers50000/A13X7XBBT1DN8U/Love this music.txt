 I have not yet recived my shipped cd, but I saw the movie 3 days ago and can not get it or the songs out of my head!  I am going again today to see it a 2nd time, can not wait for the dvd! Before I saw the movie, and since, I have heard the songs from the org. cast and they are good but feel that Butler's voice fits the part better.  Is haunting and at times rough, like the part. As to accent, he is to be a gypsy, so a slight accent I feel also is good for the part. It has been many years since I saw a movie I wanted to see a 2nd , or more, times before on dvd, but this is one of them.  My hope is the cd will keep me from going crazy with the songs in my head till the dvd is out. lol
