 I have been a fan of Bon Jovi since 1984.  In fact, in the list of a # of bands, some I still love, they have stayed #1 for me. I like all their albums tho not all the songs on all of them. My top 3 fav of theirs are Keep the Faith, Crush and now Have A Nice Day.  Have A Nice Day along with Keep the Faith are the only two that I love EVERY song on it.  With Crush a close 2nd.  The one  I like the least is Bounce. I was 28 when I first heard them and I am now 49 and still love them.
