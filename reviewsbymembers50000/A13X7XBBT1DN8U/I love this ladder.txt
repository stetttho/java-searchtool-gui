 I just got this ladder yeasterday and love it.  It is very hard for me to use step stools or ladders. being 5' I need it!!!  I am loosing but at this time am 280 lb's and it supports me fine.  It came by ups and no problems. It is easy, for it's size...being the 4 step, to set up.  Only thing that would help me more is if it had hand rails to use. the nice large steps helped to make sure I had shure footing. and the angle of the steps made it easy. Tho for me it would be nice if it had less space between steps,meaning for me a 4 step would be an 8 step.  I do nothave a good strech with my legs and they are very short, going backwards down a ladder if the step is not right under my foot as soon as I take it off the step, I have a bit of a problem and with this, as with any ladder, I have to step down , streaching, to get to the next step. (they need to make them for shore people.  :)   ). But I have had no problems with the ladder.  Even put new lights in my cealing fan. (about 8 ft above me or more.) So for me, this is a great ladder. Kathy
