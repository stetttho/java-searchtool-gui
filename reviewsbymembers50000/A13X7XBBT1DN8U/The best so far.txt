 My GF grills stay on the conter as I use them 1-6 times a week.  The old ones I would leave pluged in, take out the food, get 1 cp as hot tap water as I could, unplug, pour some in, close lid, wait for steam to leave, pour a bit more in. Then later would plug in (or the next time I use it in less then 48 hours.) let it get  warm and use a wet paper towl to get any the water/steam did not get.  EAsy enough but this I took the plates off (very easy) rinsed in hot soapy water, rinsed and dryed with p. towl, then put back on. (the plates go on and off easy.) Only problem is that the bugers we do are  the frozen Bubba burges, they say not to press.  I leave the lid open for half the time and turn the bugers but not sure yet with the temp. control if it keeps warm. Have to try more on that one.  I have tried all kinds of grills, even those with 'drain  holes'.  the grease just sites there.  you can see it run out on this one, on  any of the GF grills.  I do not experament much, in the last 8 years I have been using one GF grill or another, I only do bugers (all bubba that should not be pressed) or chicken tenders. Mine sits on the counter.  This one is not as large..and in the way, as the larges't one I use to have, and larger so holds more, then the small one I use to have.
