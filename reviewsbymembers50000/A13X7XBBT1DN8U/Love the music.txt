 I have never seen the play (the only way I get to see any brodway play is if it goes to movie) and when I saw this at the movies at first I was put off by the  theme of the lifestyle,etc.  Not my cup of tea..a full movie about  free sex (do not care if they are same sex or not tho) and drugs.  BUT....what stuck with me was the friendship and how they connected to each other and the songs.  So I bought the dvd, saw watched the movie again, and like it better the 2nd time around.  This time knowing the story, I just did not 'see' the drugs and sex (well you never see the sex to that is not a problem)  but got really into the friendships and how they all connected, stronger , this time.  So it is now one of my fav dvd's.
