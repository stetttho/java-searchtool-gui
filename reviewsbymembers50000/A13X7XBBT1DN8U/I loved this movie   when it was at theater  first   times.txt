 I saw this years ago when it first came out about 3 times.  I still love it. Depending on the day it gets between 3 & 5 stars from me. Seems a lot of my fav movies others don't like and as of yet I do notunderstand why.  My husbond loves this movie also. I also like High Spirits and Little Shop of Horrors. KattB
