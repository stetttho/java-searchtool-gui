 In spite of many interesting subjects described in the book, explanations about fundamentals of quantum theory seem to me quite insufficient, as like as they had been written in a hurry. I would have not understood many issues quoted in the book if I had not read before other publications about paradoxes raised by quantum physics. Another very strange choice is to place the chapter about interaction-free measurement at last, while I think this property is a necessary basic for a better understanding of properties of entanglement, above which the whole building of quantum computing relies. So, I wonder how readers without a previous knowledge of basic subjects can have dealt with the problems the book tries to explain. Surely, this book has been written for nonspecialists, as the editorial review states, but, taking into account the poor effort employed in explaining quantum theory, it could have detailed more facets about computing, and simply referencing other textbooks for physics arguments.
