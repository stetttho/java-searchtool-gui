 A kind of humour still current, gentle and delightful as the age allowed but a significant drawing of how the life of three bachelors aged about thirty can be. Maybe I recollect some very similar situations (with the due adaptations), I enjoyed it as a timeless humour, built on the art of the written word and the descriptive ability. It is a sample belonging a kind of literature, good level humoresque or adventurous, suitable for children and adults, typical and still vivid in the Anglo-Saxon tradition and worldwide known.
