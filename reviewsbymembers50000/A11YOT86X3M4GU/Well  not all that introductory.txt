 It is really a very good book, and even if I agree with the definition of  "pedagogical jewel" given to the quantum pinball example, I would  not define this textbook an introductory one, even if a non-specialist can  read it without many difficulties. I read it several years after my  studies, and it represented to me a good and amusing opportunity to refresh  or to learn subjects I didn't remember any more or I didn't meet in  university course.  And taking into account its low price, it is really  worth purchasing this book.
