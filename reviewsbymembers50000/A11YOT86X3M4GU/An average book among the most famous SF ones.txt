 I read that book after I happened to look at the (grotesque) film adaptation by Lynch. The book itself is not really better than the latter. Esoteric, repeatitive, obsessively descriptive of mind states and thoughts, there are many good ideas (worms, guilds and sisterhoods, stillsuits and many others) but they are attached to a weak structure and a poor and heavy writing style. To be honest, it is very hard to find a book of good SF that is also a good book, but Dune seems to have a bit less than the average narrative flow. Perhaps, if I were younger, I would be a fan of the Herbert's complex world, but now I have really got the opinion that the book has too many more pages than it needs.
