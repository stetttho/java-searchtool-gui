 The textbook, actually a collection of lectures, provides a lot of material and examples, and it tries to lead the reader from the basics of subject to the applications of wavelets. Despite of the wide range  presented by the chapters, the high reciprocal independence and the  completness of proposed path, as an introductory book I would prefer the  classical "Ten Lectures on Wavelets", even if Benedetto-Frazier  work could be more suitable to get at-a-glance what people are doing (i.e.  were doing at the moment of publication) with wavelets.
