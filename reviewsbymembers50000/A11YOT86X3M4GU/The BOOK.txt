 What can you say about a book like that? It is the BOOK. A rigorous, but not boring, path through the bases of logics. Since the first time I read, almost twenty years ago, it had no way to gather dust on my bookshelf, you  can always find the opportunity to peek some subjects from it.. The most  vivid explanation of what a formal system is, and the first time I met the  word "fractal". A strong and beautiful structure, connecting Western and  Eastern philosophies, computer science and math, physics and complexity.  The best example of how Science and Art can be seen as the same thing.
