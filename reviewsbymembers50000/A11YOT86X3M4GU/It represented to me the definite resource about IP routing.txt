 In my working activities I happen to meet sometimes, but not too frequently, issues about IP routing architectures. Needing to consolidate my background about the subject, I tried to read some publications, that, in spite of editorial reviews, did not satisfy me, being lost about TCP/IP details more than routing issues. This book help me to fix this cultural flaws and represented the definite resource about routing. Maybe I have not been able to fully appreciate it because I am not a network engineer or administrator, and some chapters become too detailed for people having general, and not specialistic, requirements. But I must agree that reading this book made me to know something I did not before, at a sufficient level of detail. That is what I need to state that a book is worth its price.
