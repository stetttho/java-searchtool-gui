 I have been interested for several years in subjects relating chaos, fractals and computer sciences, so I cannot help appreciating this book, which collects all of them together, offering me an exceptional opportunity to recall all these items, about which I happened to read many books in the past. But..., yes there is a "but". I found very few I had not already read. All the items are very interesting, but there are many other books that present them, and in a very similar way. Of course, I like reading new publications in those fields, in order to avoid them to fade away from my memory, but I should advise this book to people with a strong interest in the subjects, to bear all these repetitions, or enough young so they have not read the many issues published in early 90s. Comparing it to Godel, Escher and Bach, by Hofstadter the difference is clear. Whilst GEB gave me the impression of a new level of knowledge, the book by Flake remains in the common world. Whilst I am sure I would have never been able to write a book such as GEB, I think I would be able to write something not too far from The Computational Beauty of Nature, picking up from all the books I read. That is not negative rating, I do believe that TCBoN is a delightful book, and that is really worth reading, but it shares this feature with many other five-stars books.
