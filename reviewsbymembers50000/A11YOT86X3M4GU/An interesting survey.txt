 People with a scientific background, and working far from physics (as me), will find this textbook very interesting. A quick but also deep survey of what physicists are currently doing, in which students of _some_ years ago can recognize subjects whose birth they happened to study. Being my M.S. thesis about Boltzmann equation, I found very fascinating the chapters about diffusion theory, particularly the search for dendrytic solutions of diffusion equation. But whatever the thesis field could have been, the wide variety of described subjects is able to meet interest of every person who happened to study Physics in his/her education.
