 People facing networking problems, even if as user only, would like to  find answers for three kind of questions: What is a network and how does it  work? You can read the book by Tanenbaum Computer  networks to find it out.  Which requirements have I to meet to design a network? And the book  Practical Computer Network Analysis and Design by McCabe is good for this  task. How can I design it in order to integrate required services and  choose the right equipment to build it? And the book by Taylor does NOT  provide an answer, not even useful hints. Maybe it tries to, maybe it is  obsolete, the author takes more than five hundred pages (plus appendixes)  to say actually nothing but a long and never ending chat, in which many  subjects are often repeated, using a vague language. More details are  explained about protocols, but, despite the title of the book and inside  chapters, very little is said about their relation to network design.  However, you can find almost everywhere publications providing any detail  you need about protocols, so you don't need to purchase a textbook about  network design. And a bit more, but just a bit, can be found in the last  chapters about bridging and routing (that is why I think the book deserves  two stars instead of one). But for these last subjects, in my opinion, the  book provides you material to speak about networks in a pub in the same way  other people speak about sport or girls. But nothing else.
