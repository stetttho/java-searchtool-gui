 LOTR is the first fantasy book I have read, and, I could say, the last. Any other one about the subject I tried to read was not able to reach the same level, or also something comparable. Too deep the gap between LOTR and  the others, and, maybe, too difficult to reach the same thouroughness of  its structure, both from philology and novellistic point of view.  The  author is able to branch the story into different threads, to deal properly  with them, and then to join them again (people with scientific background  cannot help liking this "unifying" effort). The end is a bit sad,  leaving the memory of a world that no longer exists (or that have never  existed): a metaphor of human growth.
