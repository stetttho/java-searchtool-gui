 A general rule about science books states that   Comprehension*Rigor >= Background of the reader (all 2 Pi factors dropped) where by "comprehension" you can mean both "ability to be understood" and "amplitude of included subjects". The latter has the unfortunate feature that lhs terms do not depend on reader's characteristics while the rhs one does, but, for all practical purposes it works.  A book about the subject randomly chosen is likely to have such a factor far above the equality, but this one seems to be quite close.  However, that does not mean it is popular science: its ideal target are Physics students with at least a knowledge of "classical" (i.e. non relativistic) quantum mechanics and its main applications in electromagnetic fields.  I would have appreciated more material about experiments (after all, my university course stretches from 1979, when Glashow, Salam and Weinberg were awarded with the Nobel prize for their theory of electroweak interaction, and 1984, when Rubbia and van der Meer got it for the observation of intermediate vector boson), but I have to acknowledge that there was hardly any room left for such references, unless publishing a very heavy book, taking also into account the search for an equilibrium between educational issues and an updated sight.  Besides, the way environmental knowledge has been reproduced, with all notation misuse and omissions of non-significant terms or methods, represents a fresh and fashionable picture of current teaching (and learning) physics, at least about the subjects I remember (I have not studied, and I do not know, unless for popular papers, string theory, maybe present days students argue about that with habits unknown to me). I wish I had the book as a student.
