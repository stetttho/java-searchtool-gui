 A masterpiece in dark science fiction, which, behind a showing simplicity and a smooth flowing, hides a highly polished and well-timed language, even in its slang expressions. A personal prophecy about use of "final weapons", with an interesting reference to solid state physics (people with some experience in crystal growth may find dynamics of Ice-9 a bit inconsistent, but it is nevertheless interesting, and who remembers  the polywater affair?). A strange religion, exotic environments, politics, Vonnegut's seminal work mixes all up stimulating at a same time entertainment and reflection.
