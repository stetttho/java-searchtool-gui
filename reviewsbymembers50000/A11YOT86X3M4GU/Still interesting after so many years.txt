 I have just happened to exhume this book from my library, after it spent some years gathering dust above the shelf. In spite of the long time I have not being reading it, it still retains the full meaning it showed me when I was using in calculations relating radar domain definition. May be the textbook wins by far the comparison to the current vague and inflated computer publications, may be it is not a manager-oriented issue but it is for nearly specialistic use, you find in it clearly stated, and straight, answers to the questions you meet, or at least a definite reference where a more detailed explanation can be find. It presents interesting problems, and explains you how to solve them. I think it is the best you can say about a computer science book.
