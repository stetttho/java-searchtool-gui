 Although I have found many reviews too enthusiastic about the book, I have to agree that it has been very well written. And I think that even if the subject is more suitable to children, the language is not, so it represents a good reading exercise to non-English mother tongue readers. A pinch of fantasy, another one of thrilling and one further of humour make the book an enjoying reading, streaming with ease, that an even adult can perform, and he will not have wasted his time.
