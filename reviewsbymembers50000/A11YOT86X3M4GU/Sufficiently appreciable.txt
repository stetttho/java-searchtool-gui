 "Fair" is the suitable adjective I can use to describe this book: a fair average between thread and history deeds, between thoroughness and narrative speed. It is an interesting story in the environment of WWII, matching military issues and Holocaust items, which can be seen as the convergence of several witnesses, on the landscape of birth of the Israel nation. It is an advisable reading, even if not a milestone, written by a very flowing style. It is not an ideological issue, nor a propaganda pamphlet. It is a plain witness, as simple as taking part to a world war can be, and facing, and an unusual Jewish point of view of the Holocaust.  However, I have been disappointed by discovering that the photo collection inside the paperback edition is as half as the hardcover one.
