 My early interests in SF were oriented to the optimistic kind, such as the novels by Asimov and Heinlein, and I met dark authors only a few time ago. In spite of the surprise arisen by finding starships and exterior planets replaced with strange religions and oppressing social rules, the subtlety used in the descriptions of human relations and the complexity of built-up structures make the latter more agreeable to experienced readers. Unfortunately, that complexity seems to be quite difficult to turn to a well defined termination, and the story looks like suspended. I have no idea about how such a termination could be, and too often complex contexts cannot be reduced to simpler ones, so I do not afford to say that the author has failed something or the novel lacks in conclusion. But, to be honest, I slightly miss it.
