 The book has interesting features but presented to me several drawbacks. Though it tries to be self-contained in introducing the wavelet subject, the resultin theoretical structure is poor. and general properties of wavelets remain scattered for all over the book, leaving some gaps. Perhaps my opinion is biased by being used to classical introductions stressed on Multi Resolution Analysis. Moreover, the habit of carrying on calculation with explicit indexes, quoting intermediate results and unusual notations (e.g. denoting a function as x(.) instead of x(t) in order not to bind to a specificic variable) clutter the book with cumbersome expressions, even if in that form they can be straightforwardly rendered in computer routines. I just wonder how people without a previous knowledge about wavelet methods can have dealt with the textbook.
