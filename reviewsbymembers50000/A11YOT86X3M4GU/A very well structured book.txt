 Even if I have not yet finished reading it, I think it is really a very useful support to people working in contexts involving telco services. It presents a complete, enough up-to-date, easy, and quick-to-read overview about integration of voice, data and other network facilities. Overall, the author avoids the temptation to dig deeply into protocols (you can easily find tons of papers about) and prefers to clarify and strengthen the structure the different subjects are placed in. Each one is showed in the right time and is given the right room. Oh, I read that this book is very popular among management consultants. But it does not matter, I like it all the same. A succesful effort in unifying a so fragmented field as telecoms services should be unconditionally appreciated.
