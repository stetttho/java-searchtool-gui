 A description of data warehouse issues well balanced between business orientation and technical/scientific principles and problems is a very difficult task. Even if this book does not fully accomplish that goal, but it represents a very interesting step toward that. Meaningful digressions (for example use and classification of data models in a company environment) alternates with prolix explanations in which significant hints get lost (e.g. time dimension in calendar modeling). I think the authors would have been better of deepening the material at a  bit more advanced and principle-founded level (for example, it is usually considered a must referring to complexity formalism when dealing with binary trees as indexing technique), but I agree too that other readers may not: in Italy such books are considered, in spite of their generality, technical, but foreign professionals I have met consider them suitable, even if not mandatory, to business consultants. Using more formal approaches would have likely discouraged many potential readers.   Besides, I have appreciated the clear statement about technological convenience of relational versus the dimensional technology: though the latter is undeniably more advanced, in my experience conditions that make it preferable are very seldom met.
