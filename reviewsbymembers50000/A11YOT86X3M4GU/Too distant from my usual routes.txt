 Many books by D. Hofstadter are at the top standings of my personal parade, but in reading this book I found myself very likely too distant from my usual interests and preferred styles. The initial part is very interesting, but when the author carries on detailed descriptions about programs' features in conversational shape, I have been quickly bored, and I have given up attentive reading turning to an eagle eye approach. I would have been by far more comfortable with a more formal explanation, because, once I make the effort to follow the thourough description of what and how a program does, it is more convenient to study its algorithms. So, the book is surely very pleasing for people professionally involved in semantics, but I am not confident in its general interest.
