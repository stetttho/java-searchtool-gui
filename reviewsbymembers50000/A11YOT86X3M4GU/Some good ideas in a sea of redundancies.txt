 In spite of how interesting all references and quotes of Orientalists could be, discovering that it takes more than 300 pages to Edward Said to define Orientalism as a system of ideological fictions is a bit disappointing, after he repeated the same concept hundreds of times with different words. Well, that statement is true for almost all sciences, both social and technical, and surely for their development during XIX century. Once I have been warned by the author that Orientalism has been built above prejudices, and I have been given some significant examples of that, I would prefer not to go through a myriad of further instances to support the initial thesis. Besides, Orientalism's functional facet to Colonialism are widely mentioned, but poorly deepened. That would have required an interdisciplinary approach - cultural, political, historical, ethnological and, why not, scientific - whilst this book is mainly an academic report about textual analysis. Another interesting side, i.e. why Oriental studies are carried on mainly by Western people?, is explained in a few final pages, and in my opinion it would have deserved much more space. So, when Said admits in his 1994 Afterword (probably the worthiest chapter in the whole book) that he has no interest, or capacity, in showing true Orient or Islam, I think he achieves an excessive restriction of the subject "Middle East" (because in this essay "Orient" means that), limiting its suitability to a general audience (which I belong to). There are of course many appreciable hints, but the general style, with its obsessive repetitions, reminds me too much of the political prose common in the 70's, even if Said makes a visible effort to maintain a scholar objectivity. In summary, I did not dislike the book, but I probably lack the specific knowledge necessary to fully appreciate it.
