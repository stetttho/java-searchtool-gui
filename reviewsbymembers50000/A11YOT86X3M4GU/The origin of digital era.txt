 Harris has a distinguished and unique style in writing a thriller in a historical environment. Taking into account the Bletchley Park was among the most challenging tasks undertaken during wartime, and cryptography among the most elusive problems analysts had to deal with, the result is highly interesting, even if the thread reels out a bit slow. Several components contribute to the global structure: the academic remembrances of the main character (the mathematician Tom Jericho, through which you can detect the underlying and haunting figure of Turing), entangled with his sentimental troubles, the faithful description of activities and organization of Bletchley Park, echoes of U-Boot war, hints of events placed at the beginning of digital calculators (in a sentence, it is mentioned the possible construction of a calculator using transistors in place of relay-based "bombes") A must read for people who has appreciated Fatherland.
