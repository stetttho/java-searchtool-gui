 Ishiguro shows his usual peculiar and highly refined style, almost unachievable, and the elegant and skilled language screens any other feature of the novel.  You cannot help noticing how unlike and arbitrary is the sequence of leading events, and how, despite the involvement of the main character as a detective, no investigative work or logical inferring are wrought out in the pages, and all information, supposed to come out from thorough searches, are simply dropped in from out of the context.  So, the unlikelihood of the events fades into apparently delusional states, by which Ishiguro seems to stretch a weak fabric, far more than its breaking limit, in order to connect powerful and meaningful chapters by a pacing thread and to frame them in a historical dimension.  Self-introspection lives out of unaccomplished goals, and when an accomplishment is however forced, the result is a weak structure, which is by no means a fundamental flaw or shortcoming, because, after all, the whole novel, and what it leaves you, is just a memory.
