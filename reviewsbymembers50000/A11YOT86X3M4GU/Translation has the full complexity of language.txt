 I read the half of it the half it deserves (to borrow a Tolkien's expression), but I have no doubt about its uncommon qualities. The synthesis of cognitive science items, literature studies and personal experiences , together with an incredibly polished and refined language, into which English, French, Italian and others converge, makes this book a unique accomplished experiment. But I think it requires an unusual attention, and, unfortunately, I cannot afford to spend a very long time about translation difficulties, so distant from my daily activities. And even if Marot is neither Bach nor Escher (let alone Godel), and his poetry has none of their art, the strict entanglement between form and meaning Hofstadter successfully gives evidence to, raises interest also to the otherwise insignificant poem used as book's leitmotiv. Maybe, being Italian my mother tongue, my appreciation of the chapters about Dante' Comedy's translation could lead me to overestimation. The subject lacks of an appeal as wide as Godel, Escher, Bach, but the balance between a so personal style (the haunting memories diffused into the book) and a high level abstraction (the search for meaning), makes me feel the harmony of "the music of language".
