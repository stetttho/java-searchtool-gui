 This book is exactly what it pretends to be in the title. It is a set of practical techniques, with many examples taken from usual business environments. It deals a lot with dimensional modeling (I could say that it is a paper about use of dimension tables in a data warehouse), which is deeply examined, gives a fair series of tips about fact tables, and runs quickly over other issues, with a general speech about functional and technical architectures. The latter subjects have been left in a not well determined state, making the reader to consult other issues for further information. It could be a very useful book in order to understand and to get able to design a dimension modeled DWH. The author's language cannot be considered synthetic, and many times I have been left with the impression that the same things could have been told in much less pages. But, to be honest, I could say the same about most books published in the last years.
