 Having just been this book a bestseller, when I happened to read it I was very curious about the subject. But I have been quite disappointed by its content. Nothing more than a general autobiography, with some use of elementary economics terms (which can be a bit useful to non-english readers), the general level of the book is comparable to what you can find in many web sites. Not a hint can be found about the real problems and difficulties you meet setting up an activity of your own, and the text deals meanly with what people knows yet. However, I have assigned three stars because it is an easily readable item, and its general meaning, whatever trivial, is undoubtedly true. In a chapter, the author affirms to be a "best-seller", and not a "best-writer". I do agree with that statement.
