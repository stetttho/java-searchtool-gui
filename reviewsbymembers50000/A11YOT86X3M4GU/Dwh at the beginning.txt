 Data warehouse development relies on a scientific substrate, but usual target reader is not a computer scientist, nor a programmer, rather an advanced user who has to present dwh projects to management. So most books are mainly business-level presentations, and this book is not an exception. It contains some technical issues, more in the form of hints and tips than fully developed solutions, that have nowadays become common and wide-known features. Most books about dwh, OLAP and even mining look like as they have been written some years ago (typically late ninety) in order to present to a wide audience those new disciplines, and then submitted to further and slight revisions to work out new editions. In my experience, user community's skill has grown up, but many publications have not been able to keep its pace. However, though this does not seem not a mandatory step in a dwh basic education, it still retains all its historical importance.
