 To be honest, I have not understood, however not completely, what the authors want to say or explain. Interesting subjects are surely showed, but just lightly touched. Of course, you must agree that a profitable customer is better than a non-profitable one, and that maintaining her/his loyalty makes company to get the related revenue for a longer period. I think also that you may well acknowledge that new technologies do not suit to old organizations. But I am not sure that more than three hundred pages were necessary to say it. I have found some chapters much more interesting than others (for example The Tools For CRM), but if the question for such kind of books is "Which problems is this book helpful to solve to?", unless you consider a problem preparing a slide presentation, I have  not been able to find any.
