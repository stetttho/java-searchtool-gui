 How can you define classics in a literature of a nation who was born a bit more than two hundred years ago? A tale like TGG could be the right answer. Even if I have found the track a bit boring, it is the most representative subject that can be defined American epics. But what I really appreciate about Fitzgerald is his style of writing, the best I have ever met in American and English literature, which also retains its meaningful form (but in that case I have to pay much credit to the translator) in the Italian version. The final short digression about the green light is one of the most often seen quotations.
