 Surely one among the few best social allegories ever written, together with Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451 and Catch 22, and the harshest and least humorous among them. Though inspired by the Soviet regime, the mechanisms described in the text are suitable for most democratic and non-democratic contemporary societies. More than a prophecy, the novel represents a study of current social dynamics. Pressure for acceptance, mandate for substantial submission in spite of retention of a viewable independence, stratification of people by means of limited privileges are the pillars over which any sufficiently complex group relies upon. The thread develops from the particular situation of the chief character, Winston Smith, depicted against the environment created by the Party to his final struggle and breakdown, when he is forced to turn personal feelings from another person towards the Party, because "there is no love, except love of Big Brother, there is no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party". Even if the description of interrogatories and tortures is quite detailed and has been sternly represented in some film scenes, I have found two other issues as the most shocking in the novel: the speech of O'Brien (Smith's inquirer), in which he lines out the three stages, "learning, understanding and acceptance", that Winston is going to pass in order to cure his "mental derange and defective memory", and the picture of the fade remembrances of Winston's childhood, writing out the merciless way of how selfish a child could be, attached to Winston as an eternal sense of guilt, and which builds a parallel layer, more intimate and personal, about the subject of retaining memory of past events. Maybe Orwell has been too optimistic, because nowadays, as a consequence of media development, learning and understanding are no longer required: it is possible to obtain a direct acceptance.
