 At the moment, I do not know a long-term course training call center resources specialist, and people doing this job usually come from other field. The book is full of useful hints to help people with a good, but general, background in connecting it to the reality of call centers and every day activities in CRM.  As usual for this kind of books, it is not a detailed reference, but I found in it satisfying answers to many doubts arised about the correct use of words and acronyms.
