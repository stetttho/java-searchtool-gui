 Many years ago I was fond of Wodehouse's books. That very way of telling a story, dipping out a huge sequence of details with the ability of maintaining the reader's interest, marked a very characteristic style. The same style I am encountering in this Ishiguro's tale. I found very surprising how a Japanese author can acquire (absorb I think a more suitable word) the most British style, turning it into a so personal thread, in which a trip of few days becomes the occasion to flash back a whole life, spent in a screened service as a butler in a high gentry house, in which the protagonist has been having some opportunities to find himself "close to the hub of the wheel", receiving slight echoes of the main current events of the outer world: debates about Versailles Treaty, appeasement, the rise of German Nazi Party, anti-Semitism, the war. All that softened by the professional burden of the butler, by the local quarrels and arguments. So two main threads are followed by the protagonist, creating two competing tensions: the former backwards, i.e. a more and more precise depicting of lord Darlington, up to his final involvement with the Nazis, the latter the approaching to Miss Kenton's living place, along which the author, in a slightly deceiving way, builds what seem to be a desire of regain lost time. Both threads are left unresolved: you do not come to a complete knowledge of what happened to lord Darlington, and Mr. Stevens, the protagonist, finds Ms. Kenton married and waiting for the birth of a grandson. Such a literary joke is proper to the great ability of the writer, and makes a book a masterpiece not only in fiction, but also in the more subtle art of language use.
