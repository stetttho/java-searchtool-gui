 It is surely an enjoyable book, but I do not feel to agree the originality of all the proposed puzzles, as the editorial review states. To be true, many of mathematical games left me the sound of a deja-vu item, perhaps something reminding me of Sam Loyd's old games. On the other side, I have been surprised by the thinkerobics, that represented also a very good opportunity to train in English language, as I am a foreign reader. But the lack of an underlying structure, and the complete absence of a narrative schema, makes it a mere book of puzzles. I like puzzles, so I like the book, but I am not enthusiastic of it.
