 Following the path of the previous publication, The DWH Toolkit, the authors devote a large effort about dimensional modeling, but help keeping bound to it, and face wider subjects and issues. The structure underlying chapters, based on a project lifecycle, is very interesting, and surely quite useful to people involved in dwh projects. In spite of many criticisms that have been addressed to Kimball's methods, I believe that this book has a general validity, and can apply, in some ways, to any sort of dwh you are to implement, even if that is not a handbook to fix specific technical issues. It can be also a good textbook to improve general culture about the subject, but in this case I should advise to read it together with The DWH Toolkit, unless you have yet a strong background about dimensional analysis. References to hints and instances add a pleasing value , and avoid too high abstraction. Just a remark: similarly to the previously mentioned book by the same author, the weight of the whole explanation is significantly increased by the inflated language, which many times makes a thorough understanding of the text a bit more hard than the actual complexity of the subject.
