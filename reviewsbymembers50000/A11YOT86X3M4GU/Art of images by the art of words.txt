 More than other books by Ishiguro this one displays his subtle and fine art, and mastery, of the language, and his ability to build a complex and great structure founding it on an almost inconsistent base. That base, the main character's (Ono) previous history and background is being slowly and progressively formed along all the novel, and slightly referenced, when it is necessary to provide some more information to the tale.  It is remarkable how some particulars, either of the environment (such as bulldozer's noise) or of the behaviour of characters, match similar memories of the reader, or, at least, similar memories of mine. Maybe those matches made me to high rate the novel. Or perhaps I perceived some ambiguity in the language not in the author original intention: in spite of the definition he comes to give about "floating world" as "not permanent", I have read all the novel keeping in mind "unsteady", and understanding the meaning of the whole world. I simply discarded as a literary artifact other interpretations: the advantage of being a reader  is that you can give the sense you like to what you reading, so the same meaning becomes floating.
