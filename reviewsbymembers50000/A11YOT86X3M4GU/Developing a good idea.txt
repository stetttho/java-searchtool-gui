 This enjoyable "history fiction" novel represents a good development of a "what-if" idea, and it is really interesting to examine as that naturally leads to an already seen solution: beginning from a Nazis-dominated country, the description of the society turns out to be very similar to former Communist countries, where a blue-jeans cloth was considered symbol of freedom. Besides, the novel is well written, historical references are well chosen and the Holocaust described as a spinning out theme is a good fiction of a sceptical mind facing an unbelievable event. The protagonist, detective Xavier March, reluctantly enrolled in SS, resembles many other not-too-heroic characters (I have been always sympathetic with that kind of unfortunate). A casual event, a few days before Fuehrertag (Hitler's birhtday) will make him involved in a more and more complex web of history and politics. There is not a happy-end, which would have been very unlikely, but, in a someway optimistic foresight, March, even if beaten, is not defeated, for his sacrifice, displaying the great crime undertaken by Nazis, will give an active contribution to accelerate the fall of a social system, even if still fully empowered. Either you like a weekend book or a hint to further studies, the book is worth reading.
