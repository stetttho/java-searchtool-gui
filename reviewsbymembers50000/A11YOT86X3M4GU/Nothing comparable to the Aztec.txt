 It is always a difficult task to write a sequel of a successful book. But also taking into account this kind of difficulty, I didn't like very much that one. Of course it is a readable novel (Jennings is an expert writer),  but all the epic and historical backgrounds I found in the Aztec, has been  currently lost. It is an average work, and any interest it can retain,  derives, in my opinion, only by the sound of the original subject. I would  have expected much more by the author of the Aztec.
