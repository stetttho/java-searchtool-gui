 In spite of the title, which could have denoted a more specific subject, the book deals mainly about Galileo's events, told in the way anybody knows. The life of Galileo's daughter would have been a very interesting opportunity to exam this issue from a quite different perspective. This opportunity vanishes yet in the first chapters, and the tale of Suor Maria Celeste (the name she got as a nun) becomes a mere translation of her letters collected by Galileo. Besides, you can hardly find something new even among them. That facilitated history (tabloid-like) flows easily, but it lacks of reality: you can hardly believe that Galileo'daughter accepted so willingly the fate her father decided when she was a child. Surely a not remarkable book for people who have yet read something about the subject, but that can be very useful to High School students.
