 Though Wolfram is a key character in science and software development (even if I did not know that his contributions to particle physics and cosmology are considered "lasting"), and cellular automata are an interesting subject, if I consider that I have been waiting this book for so long a time (I preordered it one year and half ago), I have to recognize that it is not worth the long wait and its cost. To be honest, I do not realize which or where the new kind of science is. I do not understand whether it represents either the work of a genius (because Wolfram has really been like that) gone out of his head or a clever, and profitable, publishing operation of the CEO of a successful company, producing one of the best scientific sw products in the world. But the author's authority by itself does not turn a common book into an excellent one. The result is a slightly interesting, and heavily boring, book, with an accurate, and overvalued, editorial setting: a paperback and lighter edition would have been more suitable to a collection of Wolfram's results; you must have a very strong interest in cellular automata to really appreciate this book, and enough time and will to read its flat, inflated and repetitive style.
