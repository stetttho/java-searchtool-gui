 Perhaps the stress given to geometry gives evidence to the age of the book, but it still represents an example of how a collection of problems should be written. It is too entangled with mathematics to be defined an issue about mathematical games, but also fans of games can find out some enjoying items. Because, if much room has been given to proofs and resolutions, the boundary of elementary curiosity never goes out of sight, even if it can sometimes look like a far horizon. It is surely the best book about elementary problems, mathematical games and jokes I have ever read till now, and I have found its language as clear and straight as a non-English reader (like me) usually finds a non-English writer.
