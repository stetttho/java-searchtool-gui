 The book provides a lot of material but it left me the impression of a core material hidden in "a bit  too many" technicalities, being the textbook more likely suitable as a reference for a specialist (I am  not) than for a reader interested in the subject. I really appreciated the  chapter "Fractal Functions and Wavelets", a good description of  links beetween wavelets and fractals.
