 I regret that my shallow knowledge of biology and biochemistry did not allow me to fully appreciate this very interesting book, making me to search for references every time I needed to get a better understanding of mechanisms of genetics. It is not an easy-to-read book, and its fragmented style, which requires a thorough attention, does not help the reader. I remember that in university math courses it was said that "economists learnt how to use mathematics, whilst biologists did not", and I believe that this book is a good example of that (as a comparison term, I found much clearer the papers by Maynard Smith). But it is really worth reading it and facing these difficulties, and its price, compared to the deepness of its content, is quite low.
