 Let me start with what this book is not: this is not a book containing music instruction and this book does not deal with specific techniques. This book does intend to quell anxiety of adult learners and to dispel rumours about what the adult learner needs to bring to the table, in order to fruitfully attempt  to learn music-making. To that end, the author, more or less, succeeds.   The author approaches music performance as the physical activity it is. He deals with the various aspects of music performance, such as dexterity, sight-reading, rhythm, as neurophysiological skills. He explores auditory perception of music, dealing with the issues of being 'tone-deaf' and 'time-deaf'(unable to keep rhythm) and shows that the actual incidence of these debilitating conditions is quite rare. He also shows that stage-fright and anxiety is quite pervasive among professional musicians as well, as evidenced by the spread of the use of beta-blockers like Propranolol.   The, to my mind, biggest anxiety-quelling advice he gives is that learning music-making need not be focused on performing pieces from the established repertoire. In other words, don't learn music just so you can, one day, play Beethoven's 21st Piano Sonata, although that is fine as a secondary goal. Learn music-making, so you can explore the magic of music on your own and free yourself from thinking of music performance as a competitive goal where pressures of accuracy overwhelm the primary purpose of enjoyment.
