 This is an academic treatise. That's unclear from the popsci-like title and subtitle. Nonetheless, it's a very fulfilling work, once you digest it. The authors present their theory of the process by which creative thought operates, called Conceptual Blending. The process is subconscious and pervasive in everyday thought. Essentially, you metaphorically reapply concepts and relationships from the source domain onto a target domain. You're looking right now at a classic example: your computer desktop, where the source is a paper office ("folders", "files", "trash"). There are multiple and flexible ways in how the process operates. And this book deals with its theory, taxonomy, analysis and application. With the awareness obtained after reading this book, you can try to examine your own learning processes. If done with skill, it will aid your learning and imagination. And for the lay reader, that's the best reason to endure this academic work.
