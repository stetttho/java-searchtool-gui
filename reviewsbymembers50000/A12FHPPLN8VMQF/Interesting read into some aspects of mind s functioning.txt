 The author got curious about how his brain (and human brains in general) worked. He decided to find out. His experiences alongwith background information form the contents of this book. He divides his narrative according to different neurological aspects of everyday life: mindreading(social interactional cues); handling and emotional aspects of fear; observation and attention handling; humor; mood and stress management; and finally his experiences under a fMRI scanner.  There are some pretty nice observations correlating bioochemical activity to qualia and behavior but this book is not a detailed observation and analyses of cognitive activity. Readers familiar with popular neuroscience won't find much new material here. The prose is lucid and the book can be fun for newcomers to neuroscience.
