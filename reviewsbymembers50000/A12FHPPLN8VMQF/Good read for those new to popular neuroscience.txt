 This book's subtitle is misleading, although its main title isn't. This book is not about the how the genes actually allow complex thought, only that it's possible to reconcile a brain developed by genes alongwith a complex functioning mind. The author also addresses the apparent dichotomous ways in which the mind could learn and develop i.e. the nature/nurture dichotomy. He tackles it similarly to how Matt Ridley does, in Nature via Nurture. The narrative of the book starts with a general explanation of what genes do and how they go about doing it; examines the concept of learning and reconciles prewiring of the brain with subsequent flexibility; how genes guide brain structural development and the flexibility they possess in doing so, in particular, how limited number of genes help develop an enormously populated and complex brain. Now, if you have already read a few popular books on neuroscience or genes, this book has little new themes to offer. It's the same paradigm that most recent similar books reveal. This book is primarily useful to those who are reading their first or second work concerned with the biological treatment of the brain. In fact, if you are almost completely new to reading popular neuroscience, I suggest starting with Steven Johnson's Mind Wide Open. All in all, this is a well-written read.
