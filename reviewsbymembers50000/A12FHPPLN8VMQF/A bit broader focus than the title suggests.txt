 There are over 2 million distinct creatures on your cheek, chin and nose, and more on your forehead. You can't ever scrub them all off. They're pretty harmless anyway. Unless you're in an exotic location, sand particles from the Sahara desert are present in your room right now. In every cubic foot of air in your house, there are 3,00,000 odd items floating about, like micro insect limbs, sea salt, tire meltings ...etc This book reveals the present but unnoticed aspects of our daily lives. Using a chronological device of a typical day, the author examines typical activities like brushing, bathing, cooking, eating, even walking (and talking) and exposes the physical intricacies behind them. He also examines mundane products like toothpastes, soaps, cakes and reveals the components and their manufacturing process. By the end of the book, some of your notions, especially on "cleanliness", might get revised. A very interesting read.
