 My initial impression when I read a brief description of this book was that it would be a lot more juicy i.e. rigorous rebuttals of some sensational claims, than it really is. However, as it stands, it is an exposition of some common fallacies in amateur argumentation, and, granted, a few (not so juicy) illustrations.  Most, if not all, of the value of this book, can instead be provided by a resource such as fallacyfiles.org
