 This book addresses the dichotomy between the thesis of nature and the antithesis of nurture by presenting convincing but not overwhelming arguments for their synthesis as the right approach. The author presents evidence which link traits to a biological basis, yet which show variation due to environmental influence. But it remains unclear if a meaningful nature/nurture delineation can be inferred anymore, which would still be helpful.  The prose and presentation is lucid. Not very heavy on the technical details. Recommended.
