 This is a pretty good introduction to economics for the lay reader. Economics presents a peculiar problem, which tends to complicate any 'explanation' of it: any exposition of economics will tend to include normative economics. This book in no exception.   The author, when he sticks to topics that are mainly descriptive, like Comparative Advantage or role of subsidies in impacting international trade or inflation on economic growth, is quite lucid and those portions of the book make for informative and entertaining reading. When the author tackles topics like sweatshops or inserts his opinion of the right policy consequence of a certain economic principle, then he veers into commentary best left out of an expository work. I don't disagree with all of his views, but maybe he could have chosen a different model to undress.
