  This book essentially lists the major (classes of) enzymes, hormones & other important molecules that constitute the human body and provides a short description of each. For a popular science work, it can seem pretty dry. There's no engaging organization to the content. Think of it as a condensed encyclopedia of some of the major molecular systems. There are some interesting tidbits, but I wouldn't recommend this work.
