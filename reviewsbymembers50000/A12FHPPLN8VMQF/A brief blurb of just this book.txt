 Put off by science or just getting into it? Seems vast, confusing, complex and tedious? Why am I rephrasing the promotional blurbs!? Well, if you are ever curious at to what makes this world tick and how, this book will tell you what similarly curious ancestors did to satisfy their curiosities. Less of a science tour (although there's plenty of that in this 500+ page book) than a tour of scientific discovery and development. It's essentially A Long Story of Scientific Research; how we got here with sprinklings of what we have here. But it's not dry. And ultimately, for its target audience, that's the right antidote.
