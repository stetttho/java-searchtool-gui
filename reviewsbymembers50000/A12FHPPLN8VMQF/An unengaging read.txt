 In the preface, the author poses many naturally interesting questions like "Who will become the information aristocracy and who will becomes the infoserfs of the next generation?". The book proper, however, doesn't do much to answer them.   Primarily, the author rambles on vaguely about the possible synergy between humans and computers/robots in the near future. He also highlights the challenges that the complexity of recent and future technologies pose. There do appear some interspersed interesting tidbits, as well. But, in the end, this book is not really thought-provoking. If you are even moderately aware of modern technologies that pervade human societies in developed economies, you will not gather any novel impressions from this book.
