 I have to say up front that I do own a number of Systimatic blades and with this one exception am pleased with all of them. So why not this? I ordered it specifically to do what the manufacturer says it does - nice smooth rip cuts in hardwood. Without being some kind of saw blade genius and getting into tooth offset angle and all that I can't sufficiently explain WHY it doesn't do that, but I have tried it on Oak, Mahogany, and Walnut. Each time the cut I got was not particularly smooth. The tooth lines were clearly visible to the degree that your average woodworker would be forced to use a jointer to clean the edge - even if the edge weren't a joint (like the outside of a table top). Think it would simply take too long to try and sand all of that out. I have an 80T FS Tool trim blade that cuts the same thing like glass, which makes me think it isn't the saw. Ironically, though I don't see it offered here at Amazon, Systimatic makes a "Safety Rip" blade which, in my experience, puts a much smoother surface on rip cuts with fewer teeth than this one has done to date. And it's a little cheaper. It only has 20 teeth, I believe, and I've made full depth cuts through 8/4 rough sawn Red Oak with that blade with 0 complaints.
