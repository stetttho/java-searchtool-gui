 Certainly not the most expensive stacked set one could buy. That was probably the first motivator, and Systimatic is generally a brand name that I expect quality from. I've had my set for two years and a number of sharpenings now. I find that aligning the chippers to the outside blades is simple enough, the tolerances are accurate (two outside blades plus four chippers really does equal 3/4") and the additional 1/16" chipper has proven very useful. Though the company specifically says NOT to, I cut grooves for 1/4" ply in drawer sides to hold the bottom all the time with one full size blade and the 1/16" chipper. I just slow the feed rate down considerably. If you plane your lumber to anything other than exact increments of 1/8", dado shim sets are a worthwhile accessory, and do not come with the set. After several sharpenings, there is still plenty of carbide left on the teeth. If I had to replace it, moving a step up to their "super-fine" set with more teeth on the chippers would likely make for less time cutting dados, which are slow work, typically.
