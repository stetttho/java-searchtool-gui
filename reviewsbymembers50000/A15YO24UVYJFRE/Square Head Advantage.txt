 Though costly in comparison to other clamps on the market, these are a joy to use. You don't need two thumbs to operate, just slide the head into place and crank the handle. The part I have to say I like the most is the  square heads. You can lay a string of clamps across a bench for panel glue  up and they all stay put. When the piece is clamped, you can set it aside  and stand the whole thing up on edge out of your way. Rather than having to  have a wall to lean it against, a little floor space can hold a great deal  of panels while drying since they're all packed in together. The clamping  mechanism is very effective, and the plastic seems to resist most  everything I've spilled on it (glue, lacquer, etc.) and clean up easily.
