 The dust hood (buy it) prevents the outfeed table from folding but this is a minor inconvenience. The surfaces I got after planing about 700 bdft of mixed cedar and black walnut were still smooth, though the chips indicated  it was time to sharpen the blades. The claim is that your boards will be  snipe-free, but this isn't totally true. I encountered snipe on a fair  number of boards, though I will admit it is far less than I have gotten  with other (and sometimes bigger, more expensive) planers. I have a  dedicated 20a circuit I plug this into when I'm planing and it trips it  half the time, leading me to think, at least, that as the motor wraps up it  exceeds the 15a rating considerably. Once running, it stays that way all  day. No problems with clogging though I will second the issue of keeping  the rollers clean (done with the machine unplugged). Seems not to want to  grab oak over others. Don't know if that's a testament to the smoothness of  the cut or not agressive enough rollers.
