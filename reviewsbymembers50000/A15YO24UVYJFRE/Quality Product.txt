 Since I am not a framer and bought this for a home addition, I decided the best source for opinion would be a friend who is. I also talked to my local repair service about how often they see these guns come in. Both were completely convinced that the Senco gun was the best thing going. The repair service said "If you buy it, you'll never have to buy another." In use, this was a great tool. I adjusted the settings once and didn't fool with them for the two month duration of my project. I used the range of fasteners from 3 1/4" galv to 2 3/8" RS and it set them all with no problems. I don't know what "typical" recoil is supposed to be, but it was not significant. My wife and my grandfather both had a hand with the gun and neither had difficulties. The only thing I didn't care for was the little plastic boot that covers the teeth on the nose. Designed to protect the gun from marring surfaces, I didn't see the issue when it came to studs and sheathing. Frankly, I put it in my pouch and left it there. The teeth assured me the gun would bite and put the nail where I intended, especially in toenailing. Quick, comfortable, and balanced. After owning the 600, I'll never buy a gun that isn't a Senco.
