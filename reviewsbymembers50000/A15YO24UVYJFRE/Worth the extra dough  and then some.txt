 I can't say I bought these as a set but it would have saved me some dough if I did. I probably own 35-40 Jesada bits, and as many again from other manufacturers. I've tried many brands - CMT, Whiteside, Amana, MLCS, PC, and even foolishly chucked up a Craftsman bit for a good two minutes before it burned up. Jesada makes a big deal about their carbide and their grinding and sharpening process. I know my first reaction was that this was some kind of fancy sales pitch, but now that it's a few years down the road from that first impression, I'll stand by them and say that Jesada bits really stand up. They come to you sharp as sin and keep the edge longer than anything else I've found. I recently did an enormous blanket chest out of 5/4 Honduran Mahogany (if you've worked with it, you probably know why this is significant) and cut 112 dovetails with a fairly dated bit without having a single one splinter on me. They are admittedly pricey up front, but my experience is that bad tools make bad work, and bad work doesn't make for many return customers.
