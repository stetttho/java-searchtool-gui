 I wasn't looking for humor per se when I got this. I thought this might be a little glimpse into years gone by and some shrewd cowboy psychology or something - and to some extent, it is that as well. I found myself laughing a lot at some of the stories, despite Cooks attempt to handle some of the topics with "discretion". Great look at a different time and a different mentality. Can't think of a doctor I wouldn't recommend it to - they might learn something!
