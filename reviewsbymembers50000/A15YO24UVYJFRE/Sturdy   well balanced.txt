 Same boat as many others - replacing a drill of less juice that died recently and picked this one up. The metal chuck sold me on the idea over the cheaper version. I'm real happy with it so far - it has good torque, the chuck works well, and I like the reversible battery which comes in handy depending on just where you're trying to get in to. Call me finicky - my only suggestion for improvement if the guys from Milwaukee read this is to change the case layout. The battery doesn't fit in real well and the holders for bits only hold the real little ends. Some snap in slots for longer bits would be great.
