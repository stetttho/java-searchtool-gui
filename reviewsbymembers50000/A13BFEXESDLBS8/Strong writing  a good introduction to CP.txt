 As a woman with Cerebral Palsy myself, I was very interested in this book.  I found it to be well-written, clear, and honest.  It  demonstrates maturity, and is a good treatment of many facets of life with a disability.   In a previous review on this page, however, it was mistakenly assumed that Cerebral Palsy is a disease.  Although this is more than understandable, I would like to point out that it is, rather, a condition caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain before, during, or after birth.  Diseases are generally progressive, and many can be fatal.  Although the mobility level of a child with CP often decreases with maturity (due to growth) CP is neither progressive nor fatal, and a full understanding of both the book and the disability is greatly helped by the knowledge of this.
