 This is a well-researched book that answered many of my questions.  As someone who has always possessed many of the defining characters of unicorns (empathy, gentleness, sensitivity) I have often felt guilty that I  am not more of an outward leader in the traditional sense, and have tried  to mold my walk with God into more of the "Lion's" role.   (Dominating, aggressive, outward leader) This book is helping me to change  this, and rediscover my own strengths and purpose.  It is a very freeing  book for me, and I recommend it highly.  The binding, however, is not very  strong, and easily comes apart.  Handle it with care.
