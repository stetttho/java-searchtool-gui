 I was introduced to the 10,000 maniacs, and specifically, this album, by one of my best friends in 1989.  At the time, I was a young adolescent just beginning to heal the scars of incest.  In the lyrics,(particularly the song "Like The Weather,") I found a voice for my pain and frustration, as well as a hope that things might improve.  Because of Natalie Merchant's distinctive voice, it may be difficult to understand the lyrics until you have listened for quite some time.  However, each song has a very important message.  This album tackles such topics as child abuse, alcoholism, and illiteracy in a way that is both graceful and unique.  While the lyrics are sometimes melancholy, the melodies are upbeat, creating a much needed balance between intensity and playfulness. As a suicidal teenager, this album showed me that I could feel intensely and still have fun, something which I am glad of to this day.
