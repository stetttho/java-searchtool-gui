 In this book, a friendly lion helps a child come to terms with the reality of sexual abuse.  The use of an androgynous child should help both males and females to recognize themselves, and the discussion of common feelings related to abuse (such as fear, guilt, and confusion) is valuable.  However, as a survivor of sexual abuse myself, I was shocked and dismayed by the list of possible reasons abusers target children.  The lion tells the child that child abusers may be afraid to love adults, and that adolescent offenders may simply  be "curious about sex."  It is my opinion that these are not valid reasons to abuse a child. Such misinformation only detracts from the child's needs by "explaining away" behavior and making the abuser an object of pity.  As a result, a child may feel that it is wrong to feel angry or sad, because the perpetrator, being "afraid to love grownups," had no choice but to abuse. I am sure this is not the message the author intended to convey.  However, if I had read this book as a child, I am certain I would have felt terrible for my abuser and therefore locked myself further into silence.  If you must use this book, tell a child that much has been learned and acknowledged since its publication.  Also, look for books published in 1993 or later.  Great strides have been made in the last eight years.
