 I bought this horse both for myself and the many children I spend time with.  All (ranging in age from 4 to 12) have absolutely loved its softness and slightly weighted feel.  It has endured children biting, dropping, kicking, and pulling at it repeatedly without any signs of wear    This is a great horse for children over the age of five to carry around with them.  (The sheer size makes it difficult for very young children to do this)  An older child would likely find the bridle very interesting, and the sparkle appeals to all ages.  Toys R Us stores also sell this horse in green and purple.
