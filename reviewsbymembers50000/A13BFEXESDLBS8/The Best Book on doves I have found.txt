 As a dove owner,I have found this book to be a very clear treatment of dove species, behavior, and health needs.  The pictures are interesting and the information provided is far superior to other books on doves that I have read.  My only complaint is that more information could be provided on nutrition, but since most dove are such easy keepers (mostly eating seed, millet spray, whole wheat bread, vegetables, and grit) the information on this need not be extensive.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is considering adding a dove to their household.
