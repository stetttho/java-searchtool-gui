 This story is an interesting and creative take on the issue of individuality and the universal adolescent conflict of maintaining  individuality versus 'fitting in'  The novel demonstrates how narrow the  categories of "acceptable" and "unacceptable" can be by  allowing us to experience Stargirl's initial shunning, subsequent  popularity, and final decision that she must remain true to herself  regardless of what others may think.  Leo, the narrator, learns many things  from Stargirl,  including how much he can be influenced by the opinions of  others.  This book is well-written and clear, focusing almost exclusively  on the teenage characters.  (No parental dialogue is included)  As did the  fictional characters, some readers may find Stargirl's innocence a little  too much to believe, but hopefully, this will not prevent people from  reading and pondering it.  It is well worth it.
