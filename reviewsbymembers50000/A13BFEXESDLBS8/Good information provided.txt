 Very clear.  Covers feeding, housing, breeding, and genetics,as well as common diseases and household medicines that can be used to treat various conditions to which canaries are susceptible.  However, an owner who does  not want to breed might grow tired of the focus on breeding.  Also, owners  with canaries who were not handfed as babies may assume there is something  wrong with their bird because the book discusses relatively tame handfed  canaries and neglacts state that their tameness and willingness to be  handled is not true of birds who were not hand fed.  So be aware that if  your bird does not like to be handled, this is normal.  In fact, a non hand  fed canary who does not struggle when caught may be ill.   One final note:  Information and medicating are fine, but misdiagnosis can occur,so it is  good to also be have the name of a vet.
