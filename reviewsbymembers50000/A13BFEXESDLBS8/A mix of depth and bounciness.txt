 This CD is, on the one hand, quite a departure for lang in that includes several songs with upbeat, beach-themed songs which are quite uplifting. Fans of The Mamas and The Papas will likely see similarities between their  work and this album in terms of voice, tone, and overall theme.  However,  some songs do not seem to fit well with the overall theme, and shifted to  deep intropection without warning.  Although I usually like intropective  music, this was somewhat disappointing and caused a certain lack of  continuity.  It seemed, in certain places, that it was two separate albums.   Still,it has plenty of upbeat tracks which I listen to on a regular basis,  and is quite reminiscent of the music of the 70's in that regard.
