 This is a strong compilation of bodywork techniques written by the founders of each technique.  Accessible and thought-provoking, it  provides  theoretical as well as practical bases for each type of therapy.  The book  presents a wide range of options in a non-judgmental way, neither endorsing  nor discounting them.  This allows the reader to choose the method most  appropriate for his or her needs.   It is excellent for trauma survivors  who wish to reclaim ownership of their bodies, either in conjunction with  or separate from talk therapy.  However, one does not need to have  experienced trauma to benefit from bodywork. Therefore, I strongly  recommend it to all audiences.
