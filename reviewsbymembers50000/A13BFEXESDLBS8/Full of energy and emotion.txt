 A very good collection of the hits that made them famous, this album is brimming with intensely honest lyrics that make you stand up and take notice.  This album never fails to cheer me, provide catharsis for anger,  and generally do anything I may need at the moment.  In my opinion,  "Must be an angel" slows the album a bit, but the rest is strong.   It is perfect validation for a bad day, and great music to travel with.
