 I bought this book as a new parrotlet owner.   The pictures are vibrant and interesting.  However, most of the information provided is more along the lines of general bird care.  Therefore, this probably would not be suited for individuals with any previous experience with birds.  In addition, the book discusses many other types of small parrots, which, in my opinion, weakens the focus and does not allow for as much in-depth discussion of personality traits and behavior as the title suggests. If you have never owned a bird before and are considering the purchase of a parrotlet, this book may be precisely what you need.  However, if you are adding a parrotlet to an existing "flock," it may be more helpful to talk to other owners instead.
