 At last ... MCA has FINALLY released a COMPLETE compilation of Loveless' singles with that label.  Forget "Greatest Hits" (10 songs), "Sings Songs Of Love" (10 songs) and "20th Century Masters" (12 songs).  This is the CD that compiles all 19 of Patty's singles with MCA - from her first five pre-Top 40 singles through later Number Ones such as "Timber I'm Falling In Love" and "Chains"  and up to her final single, "Can't Help Myself From Loving You," with MCA.  The CD also boasts two #1's, "You Can Feel Bad" and "Lonely Too Long," released on her current label, Epic.  All songs are the original versions and presented chronologically with decent liner notes.
