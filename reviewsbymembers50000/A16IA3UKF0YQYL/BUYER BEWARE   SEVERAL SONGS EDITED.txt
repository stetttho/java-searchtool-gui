 All the major hits may be here ... but several have been shortened to cram all 51 songs onto two CDs.  Over half of the songs have been trimmed - some have earlier fades; others have lines, verses and/or choruses that have been shortened or edited out entirely.  Absolutely nothing on the packaging warns you about this until you open it and listen to the CDs.  Too late ... MCA and Strait have your money by then and you're stuck with two CDs that do not deliver what they should.  This should have been a landmark compilation.  Instead, this shameless ripoff deserves ZERO stars for MCA and George not being Strait with record buyers.
