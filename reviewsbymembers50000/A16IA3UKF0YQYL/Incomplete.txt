 I am always stunned by the song selection for practically every "Greatest Hits" collection that has ever been released.  This CD is unfortunately not an exception:  *  Why are we subjected to the Graham Stack remix of "Can't Fight The Moonlight"?   I do not understand why Curb did not include the version that was played on the radio.  *  The radio and "Aida" CD version of "Written In The Stars" features Elton John singing first followed by LeAnn on each verse.  The version on this CD features LeAnn opening each verse followed by Elton.    *  Where is "Looking Through Your Eyes" - a Top 20 Pop and Top Five A/C hit?  I can understand the exclusion of lesser hits - "Hurt Me," "These Arms Of Mine," "But I Do Love You," "Feels Like Home."  But why include an album track, "Crazy," at the expense of a bona fide hit?  *  Who determined the sequencing of this?  There's no order - chronology, chart success, song style - whatsoever.  Since LeAnn has recorded all over the musical landscape, the presentation here does not provide any flow.  This CD is saved by LeAnn's stunning voice and the songs - at least those in the versions that we remember.
