 This CD does the job it intends to - it rounds up all of Lonestar's Top Ten hits in chronological order in addition to three new songs.  ("I Pray" was eventually never released as a single.)  Other than the new tracks, this CD does not offer anything that is not available elsewhere.  This would have been the perfect place to include the A/C radio versions of "Amazed" and "I'm Already There" ... especially since "I'm Already There" was never released as a commercial single.  The biggest misstep, though, was not including the country radio version of "Tell Her."  The remix was a dramatic improvement over the album version that definitely helped propel the song to #1 on Billboard's Country charts.  This lack of effort makes this CD seem like a quick effort to capitalize on Lonestar's success and tide them over until their next CD, "Let's Be Us Again," was released.  Fortunately, the music is good enough to overlook this ... but, you do wonder how much better this could have been with just a bit more effort.
