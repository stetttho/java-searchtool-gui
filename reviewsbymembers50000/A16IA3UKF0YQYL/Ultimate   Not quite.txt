 ... for two reasons:  1. Where's Air Supply's final Hot 100 hit, "Lonely Is The Night," which also reached #12 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart? Its exclusion cannot be explained considering how cluttered this compilation is with forgettable album tracks ... a flaw of every Air Supply compilation that has been released.  2. Where are some of the group's other singles - "One More Chance," "Stronger Than The Night," "Evidence Of Love" - that did not chart?  For now, this is the best Air Supply hits collection out there. Hopefully, their record company will someday release a true singles collection that chronicles all, not most, of their hits.
