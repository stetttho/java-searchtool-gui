 I don't think it is unreasonable to expect a Greatest Hits album to include just that: HITS.  This CD may contain some of Ross' biggest hits from her 1980's tenure with RCA.  But, why is it cluttered with "endless" album tracks instead of so many singles that were questionably excluded?  Top 40 Pop hits such as "So Close" (#40) "Pieces Of Ice" (#31) and "All Of You" (#19) are all missing.  Other Pop and/or R&B hits such as "Work That Body," "Eaten Alive," "Dirty Looks," "Up Front," and "Telephone" are also absent.    Two other complaints:  * "Endless Love" is a solo version, not her duet with Lionel Richie.  * "Chain Reaction" is the original mix that peaked at #95 Pop.  Why not include the remixed version that reached #66 Pop that was never released on any other Ross CD?  To quote another bygone Ross single, "I'm Still Waiting" for RCA to release a credible collection of her best SINGLES.
