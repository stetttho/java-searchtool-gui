 This compilation covers Ronstadt's biggest hits from the late '70's/early '80's.  Some lesser singles were excluded:  *  "Rambler Gambler" (#42 Country) was the B-side of "How Do I Make You," but did not appear on the "Mad Love" album.  *  "Lose Again" (#76 Pop) and the Country singles "Crazy" (#6), "I Never Will Marry" (#8) and "Love Me Tender" (#59) are also missing.  My biggest grievance, though, is with the edits of the songs.  Many of the songs cut off 5-10 seconds too soon.  As a result, the songs end rather abruptly.  I don't know whether Asylum has or will correct this.  For now, I suggest tracking down a used vinyl version of this album.  The sound may not be as pristine, but the songs will at least be complete.
