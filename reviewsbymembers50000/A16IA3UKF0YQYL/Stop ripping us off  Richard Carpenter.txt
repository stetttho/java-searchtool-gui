 Sorry, Richard ... but enough with these compilations that blend the songs together and, worse, do not include the ORIGINAL versions of the songs the way we remember them recorded during Karen's lifetime.  Why must you continue to revamp your hits for these compilations?  Remastering is fine ... but, remixing is not.  Some songs are lengthened with new instrumental passages (e.g.  "I Need To Be In Love" is now 20 seconds longer) or feature added instrumentation (e.g.  "We've Only Just Begun" contains more piano than when the song was on the radio).  Some of these remixes are so horrible that they overpower Karen's voice making it sound as if she was standing too far from the microphone.   Your compilations should contain a warning on the outside of the package alerting the consumer that s/he is not getting what s/he thinks s/he is buying.  The proper way for you to honor your sister's memory is by compiling the songs the way they were heard on the radio ... and the way Karen would know the songs.
