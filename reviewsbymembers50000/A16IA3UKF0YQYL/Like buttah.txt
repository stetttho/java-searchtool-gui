 Bravo to Streisand and Gibb for successfully following up a collaboration from 25 years ago.  These types of reunions generally come off as cheesy, derivative and desperate.  Not this one ... Babs and Barry manage to recapture the magic of the original with fresh music and mature lyrics suited for such veteran artists.  While the album does not boast stand-out triumphs like "Woman In Love" or "Guilty" as the original did,  its quality is first rate and consistent throughout.   Music for grown-ups ... a guilty pleasure indeed!  (Now if only radio would catch on that people over 30 still want to hear something new!)
