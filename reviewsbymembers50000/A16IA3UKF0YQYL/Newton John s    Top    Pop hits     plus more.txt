 For the casual Olivia Newton-John fan (c'mon, admit it already!), there is no need to look anywhere else.  This CD has all of her 15 Top Ten hits along with five other songs that reached the Pop Top 40 ... in chronological order.  You will "honestly love" this CD ... truly "Magic."  Sure, you can quibble about some of the songs that were excluded.  But, if you want a more comprehensive overview of Newton-John's success, check out the two CD, 40 song compilation, "Gold," which boasts nearly every song Newton-John charted on Billboard's Hot 100, Country and Adult Contemporary charts.
