 Considering the amount of time this CD spans, it is surprising that only one single, "1974 (We Were Young)" (#31 A/C), was excluded from this collection.  This is one of the rare compilations that includes nearly all of the artist's singles regardless of how they fared chartwise ... and does so (almost) chronologically ("Lead Me On" actually preceded "Saved By Love").  Grant also includes "The Next Time I Fall" and "The Things We Do For Love" on one of her CDs for the first time.  The major plus (or minus depending on your point of view) is the availability of the single remixes for many of Grant's hits.  I personally never understood why Grant remixed her singles for radio.  Some were subtle (e.g.  "House Of Love," "I Will Remember You") whereas others completely reworked the overall sound of the song (e.g.  "Baby Baby," "That's What Love Is For").   Why mess with something that already works quite well?  Unless you can track down the actual singles, though, this CD is the only place you will find these remixes.   One demerit - "Every Heartbeat" fades 15 seconds sooner simply to fit all the songs onto an 80 minute CD.  Since this was Grant's third biggest Pop hit (#2 after the #1's "Baby Baby" and "The Next Time I Fall"),  this song seemed to be an undeserving choice ... especially since there were radio edits of both "Takes A Little Time" and "Like I Love You."  However, the tracklisting does forewarn you of this and the Limited Edition offers the full remix as well.
