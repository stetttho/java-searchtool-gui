 Yes, Lionel Richie was once a prominent member of the Commodores - lead vocalist, songwriter, musician.  But, Richie also had a very successful solo career.  Motown does not need to include Commodores songs on Lionel Richie compilations - both acts have had enough hits to fill separate and distinct collections.    As a result, many of Richie's solo hits are excluded from this collection:  "My Love," "Love Will Conquer All," "Se La," "Deep River Woman," "My Destiny," "Don't Wanna Lose You," "Ordinary Girl," "Still In Love," "Time," "I Hear Your Voice," "How Long."  The 2 CD import version of this CD does include some of these tracks.  However, the song versions on the import compilation vary - some are single edits; some are album length - which is not indicated on the tracklisting.  And, yet again, there are even more Commodores songs.  There is nothing wrong with the Commodores songs included here ... but, if I want to hear Commodores music, I will purchase a Commodores CD.  Motown - we are still looking forward to a truly "Definitive" collection of Richie's hits that will finally package all, not most, of his greatest hits together.  This CD is unfortunately the FIFTH compilation (after "Back To Front" and "Truly: The Love Songs" and before "20th Century Masters" and "Gold") that fails to do this.
