 There have certainly been enough Donna Summer compilations released in the United States.  This is not the most comprehensive ... check out "Anthology" or "Gold" for a greater selection of hits.  But, this is the most consistent collection released so far of Summer's singles.  All songs are single edits ... except "Love Is In Control" (album length) and "No More Tears" (a butchered edit of the 12" version first used on "Endless Summer").    Other compilations mix single, album and 12" versions ("Anthology," "Gold"), feature bizarre edits ("On The Radio," "Endless Summer") or miss some of her Top 10 Pop hits (e.g. "20th Century Masters").  For now, this is the best compilation around ... but, Summer will hopefully release one more that will compile all of her Top 10 hits along with her other Top 40 hits that are rarely, if ever, included on her compilations (e.g.  "Cold Love," "The Woman In Me," "There Goes My Baby," "Who Do You Think You're Foolin' ").
