 The success of "You Light Up My Life" is undeniable - 10 weeks at #1, Song Of The Year at the Grammys and Oscars and multiformat success (#1 A/C, #4 Country) that is sadly rare on today's narrowly programmed radio stations.  Unfortunately, the song was too huge which, along with Boone's image, hindered any subsequent singles from succeeding at Top 40 radio.  But, she is not the one-hit wonder many believe she is as this CD attests.  Boone increasingly focused on Country as her success in Pop waned.  This resulted in seven Top 25 hits including the #1 "Are You On The Road To Lovin' Me Again."  This CD adequately compiles many of Boone's singles.  However, this collection is far from complete.  Some of Boone's singles - "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" (#48 Country), "In Memory Of Your Love" (#61 Country), "See You In September" (#41 Country, #45 A/C) - never appeared on her studio albums.  Only "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" is included here.  Some of Boone's other singles - "California" (#50 Pop, #20 A/C), "Breakin' In A Brand New Broken Heart" (#25 Country), "Take It Like A Woman" (#44 Country), "It'll Be Him" (#46 Country) - are also excluded from this CD.  With Boone's catalog out of print, this compilation would have been the ideal place to chronicle all, not just most, of her hits.  You certainly cannot beat this CD's price and the songs included are Boone's most memorable singles.  But, there would have been ample room on this CD to make it a true "Best Of."
