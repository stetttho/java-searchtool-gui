 Lionel Richie's solo albums were always plagued by the same problem - great songs that simply went on waaaaaay too long.  (I have always been afraid to count just how many times "All Night Long" is actually sung during the album length version of that song!) It was almost as if this was done so that fewer songs could be put on each album.  After all, there would have been simply no room back in the vinyl/cassette era to squeeze on more tunes which explains why his early solo albums generally averaged only a scant eight songs.  This was particularly frustrating when you heard the far superior edited version of his hits on the radio.  Richie's hits collections have addressed this by including the single edits ... until now.  All of the songs on this collection - both solo and with the Commodores - are album length.  CDs may permit more music per disc than an album or cassette.  But, look at how many solo singles were STILL (no pun intended!) omitted:  *  Deep River Woman (# 71 Pop, # 10 Country, # 28 A/C) *  Se La (# 20 Pop, # 5 A/C) *  Ordinary Girl (# 101 Pop, # 9 A/C) *  Still In Love (# 10 A/C) *  Time (# 7 A/C) *  I Hear Your Voice (# 15 A/C) *  How Long *  Just For You (# 6 A/C) *  Long Long Way To Go (# 20 A/C)  So, if you purchase this, be prepared for songs that are much longer than what you are accustomed to hearing on the radio ... and wishing they had been able to make this collection more comprehensive than it already is.
