 What a terrible loss ....   This album failed to chart when it was first released in 1995 despite including a then new single, "Dim All The Lights."  I purchased the album back then - somewhat disappointed in the overall song selection.  Although all of Laura's Top 40 hits are here, the remainder of the album is mostly uncharted singles and album tracks.  I would instead recommend 2002's "The Essentials" which includes all of Laura's Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary hits except "All Night With Me" and "Hold Me."  Although only 12 tracks, it better summarizes Laura's career and more fully captures the power and versatility of Laura's phenomenal voice.    Rest in peace, Laura ... you will be missed.
