 This is easily the most comprehensive singles collection released in the United States of Hall & Oates' work.  I would have included "A Nite At The Apollo Live!  The Way You Do The Things You Do/My Girl" (# 20 Pop, # 12 A/C) instead of some their uncharted mid-70's material.  But, it is difficult to quibble with the selection of hits overall.  However, I would have preferred that RCA release these songs in their single versions.  Some songs are (for example, "Out Of Touch," "Possession Obsession," "Your Imagination").  These were the hits that were substantially revamped for radio from the album versions.  However, most tracks are album length.  This mars the overall collection since these songs generally drag on about one minute longer than necessary.  "She's Gone" is nearly two minutes longer than the radio version and sounds almost nothing like what is played on the radio.  Hall has obviously never heard that "less is more."  There are just so many ooh's, yeah's and no-no's that one song should have.  With most of their catalog available or scheduled for re-release, this would have been the optimal place to include the single edits not otherwise available on compact disc.  "Rock N Soul" does include single edits except for then new "Adult Education" and the live "Wait For Me."  But, it is a comparatively meager collection compared to this CD and 2001's "Very Best Of."  So, if you want the selection this compilation offers, be prepared to listen to the songs not entirely the way you likely heard them on the radio.
