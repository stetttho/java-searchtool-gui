 Why Christopher Cross waited so long to release a Greatest Hits album is stunning.  When his career was faltering in the mid-80's, his label should have tried to resuscitate his career with a compilation (padded by a few new songs) that could have reminded everyone why he became successful in the first place.  By the time this album was released, Cross was unfortunately better remembered as an '80's act than as someone still releasing new material.  This album does mark the first time that Cross' soundtrack hits ("Arthur's Theme," "Loving Strangers") appeared on one of his albums.  Yet, where's "Charm The Snake," his last Hot 100 hit?  Cross did not chart that often that any of his charted hits needed to be excluded for space reasons.  Some of his other singles (e.g. "Love Is Love (In Any Language)") did not make the album to make room for newer, forgettable album tracks.  Cross also indulges himself, but not the listener, by remixing some of his songs.  He thankfully did not touch his biggest hits, but these remixes are unnecessary.  Anyone who purchases a compilation wants to hear the songs the way s/he remembers them, not the way the artist wants to interpret them now.  Fortunately, the CD's tracklisting does clearly state which songs were redone.  Another compilation that is too little, too late.
