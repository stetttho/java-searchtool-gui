 Where do I begin to express my disappointment with this CD?  *  The overseas version was released in Fall 2004.  Why was this not released in North America until February 2005?  The wait would have been worthwhile if the North American version differed from the European version.  But, they are the same.  *  Where are the following hits:  "One Of The Living" (#15 Pop), "Show Some Respect" (#37 Pop), "Break Every Rule" (#74 Pop), "Look Me In The Heart (#8 A/C), "Love Thing," "Way Of The World"?  Yes, it is commendable that three new tunes are included.  It is also worth noting that some songs such as "Great Spirits" have appeared rarely, if ever, on a Turner CD.  But, there would have been room on both CDs to include at least two more hits.  And, did we really need album tracks such as "I Can't Stand The Rain" or "Something Beautiful Remains" that are readily available on other Turner CDs?  *  This CD mixes both single edits and album length songs.  Why?  "Missing You," "The Best," "Let's Stay Together," "Goldeneye," and "Better Be Good To Me" are all full length.  Again, if they had used the radio edits, there would have been room for more tunes.  Besides, you can buy the studio albums if you want the full length songs.    *  Some songs are not the versions you would expect.  "Proud Mary" is the rerecorded version from 1993.  Why didn't they use the 1971 hit version?  Also, "In Your Wildest Dreams" is not the version with Barry White.  *  The packaging is dismal.  No lyrics, chart information, song histories, musician credits ... even the pictures are all recent shots of Turner in the same outfit!  This is one of the most uninspired compilation packages I have ever seen.  For now, I would instead recommend "Simply The Best" and hope that another better compilation will be released in the future.
