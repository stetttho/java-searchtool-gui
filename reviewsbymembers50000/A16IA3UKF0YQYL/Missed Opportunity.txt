 This CD should have been a long overdue comprehensive collection of Dolly's singles for RCA during the 1980's.  But, RCA flubbed that with this compilation:  * "9 To 5" is the longer film version, not the 45 version that the average record buyer would be familiar with (and prefer)  *  "Real Love" was a #1 country duet (also #91 Pop and #13 A/C) for Dolly and Kenny Rogers.  Yet, this is a solo recording - where's Kenny?  *  "Don't Call It Love" - another alternate version ... this one is missing the background vocalists.  *  "Old Flames Can't Hold A Candle To You" - another remix that differs from her 1982 Greatest Hits collection  *  Includes "To Daddy" popularized by Emmylou Harris, not Dolly, at the expense of lesser hits such as "Potential New Boyfriend," "Downtown," "House of the Rising Sun," "Everything's Beautiful," "We Had It All"   RCA - We're still waiting for a truly "Essential" Dolly Parton compilation of her '80's work.
