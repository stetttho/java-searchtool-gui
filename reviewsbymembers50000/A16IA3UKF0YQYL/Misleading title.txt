 Don't be misled by the title - although most of the songs included were released to radio, they are not in their single edits. All tracks are album length - not the edited versions you would have been accustomed to hearing on the radio. Hornsby's songs do tend to drag on a solid minute longer than necessary which would have made the radio edits more enjoyable. This would have also been the best place to include these edits which are otherwise unavailable.   Several of Hornsby's "radio" hits are missing. "Harbor Lights," "Rainbow's Cadillac," and "Swing Street" reached Billboard's and/or Radio and Records' Adult Contemporary charts, but are absent from this collection. Uncharted singles such as "Talk Of The Town" and "Defenders Of The Flag" are also missing. Instead, there are live versions of hits he wrote for others - "The End of the Innocence" and "Jacob's Ladder" - that are too long and unrehearsed. (On "Innocence," Hornsby is not even singing with the melody he is playing on the piano!) On the plus side, this is the first Hornsby album to include "Set Me In Motion" from the "Backdraft" soundtrack and the songs are presented chronologically.
