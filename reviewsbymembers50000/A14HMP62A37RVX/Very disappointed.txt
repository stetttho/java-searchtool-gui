 I was looking forward to this movie, as I love anything to do with the Tudors, and find the time period fascinating, as well as the bizarre monarchy!  However, this movie leaves everything lacking.  Let's start with the music.  Lovely, but far too familiar.  They stole it from Gladiator!  I was wondering why I could anticipate the next note! Also some music and scenes were stolen from the movie Elizabeth.  Truly, no need for this.  A little original creativity, please!  Helena Bonham Carter is usually quite good in her roles, but she showed no emotion, and her perfomance is dull and flat compared to Anne in "Anne of the Thousand Days."  She never comes off as convincing, nor powerful, as the real Anne Boleyn was.  Henry seemed weak, as well, and the whole story is a Reader's Digest version, which, unless you are familiar with Tudor history, makes it very difficult for a viewer to truly understand the politics between Church and State, in those days, and how the chaos influenced life at Court and beyond.  I had thought I would purchase this, but won't bother, afterall, which is too bad.  For movies, stick to Anne of the Thousand Days, Lady Jane, and Elizabeth.  For accurate history, get David Starkey's The Six Wives of Henry VIII DVD, which will be time well spent.  Sorry!
