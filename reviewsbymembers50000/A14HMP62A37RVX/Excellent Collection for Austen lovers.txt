 Let's quickly ammend what the previous reviewer said!  First of all, this is an excellent DVD collection of excellent quality. The pictures are all crystal clear, the sound is striking, and the acting is fantastic.  BBC and Warner Brothers did a fabulous job of remastering these films from the 70's and 80's and I am thrilled I bought the whole set.  You can also buy each movie separately.  As for side B of certain movies, the disc specifically says right on it "blank disc."  This is because on some of them, the entire movie fits on the first side, thus side B is obviously unused.  If the previous reviewer actually watched the movies, they would see that nothing is missing, so let's hope they give their collection another try!  I for one am so glad I finally own these older, and more definitive version of Jane Austen's amazing works.  Enjoy it, as I have and will continue to do so!
