 I finally rented The Passion, today, to see what all the controversy was about, and how the movie was depicted, and quite frankly, I was very disappointed.  The acting was not the greatest, the story is not Biblically based, but rather taken from the visions of a 19th century nun named Catherine Anne Emmrich, and her book The Dolorous Passion.  Things like the scenes with Satan chatting with Jesus, the table and chair scene with Mary, the overflogging of Christ, the quick jump to an odd resurrrection scene, are simply Mel's version of what he believes happened.  I did not come away with any sense of salvation or Christ's teachings and purpose on Earth, but rather with a sad feeling that most people who rave about this movie have never read the Bible, nor have any grounding in history or theology, but will still take this as the Gospel truth, which it is not.  For a much more accurate portrayal of the life of Christ-the entire life of Christ-please rent or purchase the mini-series Jesus of Nazareth, starring Robert Powell, and get the true message of Christianity, no matter what denomination you are.
