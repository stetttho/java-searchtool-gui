 Once upon a time, I was reading a book in my bedroom, when my father came dashing down the hallway, all excited. He said there was a show on TV with people dressed up rather old-fashioned, who played chess, lived in underground caves, and read the classics.  He knew this show would interest me, and he was right!  My parents and I watched every single episode, and all the reruns and absolutely loved the gentle messages and lessons each episode taught, the great cast, the originality of the series, the music, the heartbreak.  This is one of the best series I have come across; other favourites of mine include Little House, Avonlea, Dr. Quinn, Alias, Joan of Arcadia.  This short-lived series deserves to be put on DVD and please release the CD again, too.  I wish this series would be resurrected and brought back to TV.
