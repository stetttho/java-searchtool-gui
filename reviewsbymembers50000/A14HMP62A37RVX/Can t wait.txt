 I am so excited that this is finally coming out on DVD.  This was shown in England, and is a wonderful rendition of Thomas Hardy's novel The Woodlanders, and perfectly cast.  It is great to see some of his less popular, but excellent, novels being recognized and brought to the screen.  Perfect for any fan of Hardy, 19th Century novels or anything about rural England.
