 This is a fantastic, and very accurate adaptation of George Eliot's novelette, Silas Marner.  The acting is superb, and with its fairy-tale like quality, very enchanting.  One of Eliot's most creative pieces, often wasted on the young who cannot appreciate the storyline, it becomes more endearing as you age!  This definitely needs to come out on DVD!
