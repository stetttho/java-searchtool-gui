 The previous reviewer did a wonderful job describing the series, and all I can say is ditto!  I just want to add that the DVD itself is very high quality.  The picture is so crisp, it looks like the movie was just made; not done in 1982!  And the sound, costumes, cast is the best of quality.  I never was able to see this on TV, and was thrilled when the DVD came out.  I have already watched it once, and dying to watch it, again.  Very faithful to Trollope's Barchester novels.  What a treasure-BBC at its best!
