 In a nutshell, this is a fantastic movie, with great acting, lovely costumes, lavish sets, and well worth watching, over and over, again. The scene of Anne in her last days, alone are worth a viewing.  Amazon, please set up a page for a DVD, so we can send a list of how many people want this on DVD to Universal Studios.  This should definitely be out on DVD by now, but we still await!  Thank you!
