 Hurrah!  I am so thrilled that this version is finally out on DVD.  Thank you, BBC!  I fell in love with this version while watching PBS in the 80's because it is THE definitive version.  Well, the DVD is even more so, because there is an incredible amount of scenes that were not even present in the video release, which I also own.  How much do I love this version?  Enough to have purchased 2 DVD's, in case something happens to one, and actually considering a third for viewing on my computer!! Fine acting, set and costumes to die for, the true feel of a classic BBC presentation, and completely true to the novel.  If you are a fan of Jane Eyre or simply looking for the best version out there, to add to your collection, this is the one for you.  Happy viewing!
