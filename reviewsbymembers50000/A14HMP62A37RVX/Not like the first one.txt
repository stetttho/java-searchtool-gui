 I really enjoyed Home Alone 1.  It was very creative and a fun, family holiday movie, with a lot of laughs.  The second one had such potential, but they ruined it in so many ways.  First of all, he isn't Home Alone, so the title alone is ridiculously incorrect.  He is accidently in NY while his family is searching for him.  Everything is so repetitive-from eating ice cream while watching movies, to the pranks he plays on the villains.  What I noticed most was the furniture in his hotel room.  It is from the house set of the first movie!  Look at the 4 poster bed, the tv, the tables, even the lamp and the decorations around the fireplace.  After all the money they made on the first movie, they couldn't even purchase new props?  Stick with the first movie-this one is just a remake with a lot of bad choices.  No charm, whatsover.  I gave it 2 stars for keeping the same cast and the lovely scene of the toy store.  But those 2 things are not worth the movie, itself.
