 Once upon a time, I had a terrible cold.  I dropped by the library and took out a copy of The Old Curiosity Shop, went home, huddled in my bed for four days, and devoured it.  It was the best cold I ever had!  Upon returning the book I noticed there was a whole collection of Dickens put out by Oxford...lovely hardcovers with illustrations.  Years went by and I saved my pennies and finally bought the entire 21 volume collection.  It was the best thing I ever did for myself!  Certainly worth every cent, I then continued to devour the rest of Dickens.  Oxford puts out fine books, but nothing as wonderful as this collection of Charles Dickens works, which ought to reside in everyone's library.  Buy it and you will begin to look forward to those colds!!
