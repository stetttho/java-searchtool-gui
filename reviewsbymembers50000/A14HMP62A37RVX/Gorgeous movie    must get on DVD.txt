 This was one of the first movies I ever saw Anjelica Huston, my favourite actress, in.  The movie is very faithful to the work of Joyce and for a rather short film, very emotional, powerful, and a true masterpiece, which just goes to show length doesn't necessarily mean good!  Beautiful costumes, stirring score, incredible acting, fantastic cast and very moving storyline.  Please put this Huston gem on DVD, where it belongs for all generations.
