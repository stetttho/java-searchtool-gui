 Looking at the other reviews surprises me.  I am pretty critical, when it comes to literary adaptions, even though Shakespeare was a playwrite.  I loved this version.  I finally got around to buying and watching it, after having read the play, once more.  It is comical, enchanting, magical, creative, and looks like a Merchant Ivory film, with a fantastic cast.  Yes, the music is okay, the costumes gorgeous, the settings beautiful and elaborate, acting excellent. The story shines, too.  You travel through each characters journey-Helena feeling betrayed, confused, jealous.  Hermia full of joy, then anger, frustration.  Bottom, literally a fool, laughed at, and probably the only one who was truly touched for life by the magic of the fairies.  Puck, humorous, foolish, mistaken, sorry!  Watch for his look of "Oops!"  If you enjoyed films like Much Ado about Nothing, Room with a View, or Emma, you will love this one, too!
