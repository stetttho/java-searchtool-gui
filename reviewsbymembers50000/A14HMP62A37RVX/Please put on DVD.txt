 This is the definitive movie version of Frances Hodgson Burnett's classic novel A Little Princess.  Amelia Shankley, along with the rest of the cast, do a fantastic job of portraying the riches to rags story of an orphan girl, who goes from every comfort in the world to living in a cold attic and working as a skivie.  The whole story revolves around how people should be treated, in every walk of life, be you rich or poor, a lady should always act like a princess, with grace, courage and a large and charitable heart.  Lovely music with a touch of sadness to it, beautiful costumes, and sets that look straight out of Victorian England (mud, noise, carriages and all) makes this a gem, a gem that should not be lost.  Please set up a site for those of us who would like it on DVD, now that the video is no longer available.  The WB version is so inaccurate, it isn't funny.  This is the version to watch and own.
