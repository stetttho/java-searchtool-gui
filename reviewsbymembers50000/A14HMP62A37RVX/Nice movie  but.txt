 This is a lovely movie, with great costumes, lush sets, nice music and a sweet story, but it isn't A Little Princess, by Frances Hodgson Burnett.  If you read the book you would be amazed at how far they strayed.  1.  The story is supposed to take place in England, not New York.  2.  The story is supposed to take place in Victorian times, not during WW1! 3.  The father really dies, he doesn't come back, and he dies from a fever, not on a battlefield.  4.  There is absolutely no locket in the entire book, yet it is one of the biggest storylines in the movie.  5.  The whole idea of the movie is to examine the riches to rags theme, how people treat you, how you behave like a princess no matter what condition you are in, and treat others the same way, and is a sound portrayal of the lowerclass life in Victorian England; cook, skivies, maids of all work, etc.  And the many homeless children on the street.  We don't even get to see Carrisford and his legal advisors searching for Sarah, all over the world, only to find out she is living in the attic one house over.  In other words, you are your neighbour's keeper.  If you want to see an accurate portrayal of this treasured novel, please watch the 1986 BBC production starring Amelia Shankely.  This movie, cute as it is, shouldn't even bear the title.  Oh, and completely forget her walking a plank to get to the neighbour's house.  That doesn't happen in the book, either.  Nor does the reading and stories at night, nor the attempt to get a necklace back, nor the sister escaping with the milkman, nor the spell on Lavinia's hair.  And Lavinia doesn't get Sarah's room, either.  That goes to a new student.  Sheesh.
