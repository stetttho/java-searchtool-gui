 I have been following the making of this film, for years now, and was thrilled to finally see it, today.  But it truly disappointed me and fell short of my expectations from a Polanski film, who "wowed" us with Tess and The Pianist.  Scenery lovely, costumes well done, sets very accurate to the early Victorian age, and very gloomy settings with fog, mud, and muck that you can almost smell London, as was.  Sadly, the greatness ended there.  Changes made throughout left the story rather bland and the acting was flat, which I am surprised, as the cast was excellent.  Poor directing can be the only fault, here. The only character who actually had some true spark to her, was Nancy.  Oliver rarely smiled or seemed moved, Fagin seemed too weak and meek, rather than the clever, twisted man he was meant to be. Even Bill Sikes did not have me shivering when he walked on a scene. Only the last scene made you swallow your tears back...the rest of it dragged a bit.  I have seen 5 other versions of this novel to film, and I have to say, this is not a favourite.  They also left out a great deal of characters, like Monks, Rose, her fiance, the Claypoles, and some of the gang. Nothing about the fate of Oliver's mother, nor Oliver living with Rose, nor what happens to Dodger and the rest of the thieving gang.  For a fuller story, see the 6 hour Masterpiece Theatre version; for another dark one, see David Lean's version. For better acting, see the musical. This would be similar to the musical, only darker and no singing and dancing-it isn't supposed to be a party, anyhow!  But too much was left out of this version, which is sad, because it had so much potential. I do think it is worth seeing, but only for those who have read the book, first and will realize what is missing, and can enjoy the movie for other artistic value.
