 Finally, Disney has put together the first season of the critically acclaimed series Road to Avonlea, here known as Tales from Avonlea. This series is based on the short stories by Lucy Maud Montgomery and was aired during the 90's on the Disney channel, every Sunday and Monday night-my husband and I became instantly hooked and enchanted. I consider this series even better than Little House or The Waltons. Breathtaking scenery, endearing storylines, gorgeous costumes, a fabulous cast, delicate music score and winner of many prestigious awards, this series deserves a lot of attention.  Perfect for children and adults, you will soon be wishing you, too, lived in Avonlea!  I cannot recommend this series enough!
