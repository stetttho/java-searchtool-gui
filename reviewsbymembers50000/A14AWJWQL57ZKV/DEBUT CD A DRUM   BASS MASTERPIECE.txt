 AFTER HEARING "68 MILLION SHADES" BY THESE GUYS I HAD TO HEAR WHAT CAME BEFORE IT. THIS IS JUST AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER. MORE OF A CLASSIC SMOOTH ELECTRONICA FEEL THAN ITS FOLLOWUP. HEAVY CLASSICAL TOUCHES ON SOME TRACKS AS THE TITLE WOULD INDICATE. VERY EASY TO LISTEN TO WITH NICE PRODUCTION. FANS OF LTJ BUKEM SHOULD CHECK THIS OUT. PRICE A BIT STEEP{IMPORT ONLY} BUT WELL WORTH THE CASH. AS WITH MOST ARTISTS THE EARLY STUFF IS THE BEST. 67 MINUTES OF TRIPPED OUT BLISS.
