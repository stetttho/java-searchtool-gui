 I can't believe that "FIRST WE TAKE MANHATTAN" is not on a "BEST OF COHEN". I would also rather hear the studio versions over the live. My advice instead is to buy "I'M YOUR MAN" and if you like that get "THE FUTURE". His newest cd is very good too. Mr. Cohen releases albums so rarely that 3 CDs in 13 years is not that much of an investment. If you want a good live tape I would seek out his PBS Austin City Limits video.
