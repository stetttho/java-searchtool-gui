 THE SOUND ON THIS ALBUM IS FANTASTIC FOR SOMETHING 25 YEARS OLD. EVEN THE NON-REMASTERED VERSION SOUNDS GOOD. THEN WHY IS IT SO MANY ROCK CDS RELEASED SINCE THEN SOUND SO STUFFY? MUST BE THE PRODUCER. "LA VILLA STRANGIATO" RANKS WITH "YYZ" AS MY FAVORITE NON-VOCAL SONGS OF ALL TIME. AMAZING WHAT 3 PEOPLE CAN DO.
