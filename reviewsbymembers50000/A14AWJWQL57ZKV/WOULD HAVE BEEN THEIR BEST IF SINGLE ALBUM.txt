 THIS ALBUM HAS SOME OF THEIR BEST WORK BUT ALSO SOME OF THEIR WORST {#9?}. CUTTING IT DOWN TO ONE ALBUM WOULD HAVE WORKED. ANYTHING GOOD LEFT OVER THEY COULD OF USED ON "LET IT BE", WHICH NEEDED BETTER SONGS THAN IT HAD. FOR WHAT THIS COSTS I WOULD RATHER HAVE "SGT.PEPPERS" & "MYSTERY TOUR".  1 STAR PER BEATLE.
