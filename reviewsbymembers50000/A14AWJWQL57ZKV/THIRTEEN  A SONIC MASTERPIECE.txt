 EVERYTHING BY GARBAGE IS GOOD BUT THIS SINGLE IS GREAT. BUTCH VIG & BAND {INCLUDING THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLES & MARILYN MANSON} ARE IN TOP FORM HERE. UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND BIG BUCKS ON THE IMPORT, THIS IS THE ABOUT THE ONLY PLACE TO GET "13". "BIG STAR"S ALEX CHILTON WROTE THIS BACK IN THE 70'S BUT GARBAGE MAKES IT GREAT AS THE ONLY COVER SONG THEY HAVE DONE. IF YOU WANT ALL THEIR B-SIDES WITHOUT PAYING A FORTUNE FOR THE SINGLES OR IMPORTS KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR A CD CALLED "THE G SIDES". IT HAS SOME OF THE RE-MIXES FROM THE FIRST 2 CDS + ALL THE B-SIDES. TOGETHER WITH THE DOMESTIC VERSIONS OF THE FIRST 2 ALBUMS IT PUTS ALMOST EVERYTHING ON 3 PLATTERS.
