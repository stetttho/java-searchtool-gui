 I have to go back 30 years to compare these guys to anyone else. King Crimson also merged many styles to make a new type of music. They even had "unclean" vocals {21st Century Man}. Akerfeldt and company continue that tradition. Mixing hard and soft better than anyone today, Opeth creates albums that grow on you the more you hear them. All I can say is buy this one first and then progress on through all five of their modern classics. It is great that there are still musicians that make this kind of music.
