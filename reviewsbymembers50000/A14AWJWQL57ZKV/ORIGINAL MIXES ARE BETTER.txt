 I LIKE YELLO MORE THAN MOST BUT I JUST COULD NOT GET INTO THE "RE-MIXES" I HEAR ON THIS. I KNOW WE'RE TALKING MORE MONEY HERE, BUT BUY "FLAG","STELLA" &"YOU GOTTA SAY YES" INSTEAD. THOSE ARE CLASSIC PIECES OF ORIGINAL MUSIC THAT SHOULD NOT BE MESSED WITH. RE-MIXES ARE FOR HARD-CORE FANS ONLY. "BEST OFS" SHOULD PROVIDE NEW FANS WITH A PROPER INTRO TO THE GROUP, AND THIS DOES NOT. THAT SAID, I CANNOT GIVE LESS THAN 3 STARS TO A GROUP THIS TALENTED. "FLAG" IS THE ONE TO BUY.
