 MOST BEATLE REVIEWS EITHER GO OVERBOARD WITH THE "ART" TAG(ONE DOLT COMPARED THEIR ALBUMS TO WAR AND PEACE) OR RIPPING THEM BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T FROM CALIFORNIA. THE FACT IS THAT PEOPLE LIKE DYLAN & BRIAN WILSON HAD NOTHING BUT GREAT THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THE BEATLES, INFLUENCING OTHER GREAT ALBUMS(PET SOUNDS). ITS JUST THE STUPID FANS OF THESE MUSICIANS THAT CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BEATLES WERE DOING BACK IN 1966-1967. IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT THE BEATLES WERE FORCED TO QUIT TOURING BECAUSE OF RIOTS THAT BROKE OUT AT THEIR CONCERTS AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T PLAY IF YOU CANNOT HEAR THE OTHER GUYS IN THE GROUP. SO THEY INSTEAD BECAME THE LEADING STUDIO BAND IN THE WORLD WITH THE HELP OF GEORGE MARTIN. THIS ALBUM WAS THE END RESULT. THIS MAY NOT OF BEEN THE BEST ALBUM EVER BUT IT IS STILL: FIVE STARS.
