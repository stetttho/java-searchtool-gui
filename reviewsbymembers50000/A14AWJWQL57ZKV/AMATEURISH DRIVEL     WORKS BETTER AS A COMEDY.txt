 I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW BAD THIS MOVIE WAS. YOU WOULD THINK WITH ALL THE TAX-FREE MONEY AT THEIR DISPOSAL THE PRODUCERS COULD DO BETTER THAN THIS PIECE OF JUNK. KIRK CAMERON? ARE THEY TRYING TO BE FUNNY? THE PLOT REMINDED ME OF A SUB-PAR ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE EPISODE WITH ITS CARTOONISH CHARACTORS AND BAD DIALOG. ANY PERSON WHO BELIEVES IN GOD SHOULD BE DEEPLY OFFENDED BY THE ELITIST ATTITUDE OF THIS MOVIE. "LEFT BEHIND" IS A GOOD TITLE SINCE IT REPRESENTS THE PROBLEMS IN SCHOOL THE PROCUCERS MUST OF HAD GRADUATING TO THE NEXT GRADE. THE ONLY GOOD NEWS IS THAT THIS MOVIE TANKED SO BADLY AT THE BOX OFFICE THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE SUBJECTED TO "LEFT BEHIND - AGAIN!".
