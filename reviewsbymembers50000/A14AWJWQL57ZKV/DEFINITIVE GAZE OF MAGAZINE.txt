 ONE OF THE BETTER "BEST OFS" IN TERMS OF SONG SELECTION AND KEEPING IN CRONO ORDER. SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THEIR "RAYS & HAIL" COMPO. DIFFERENCES ARE STUDIO VERSION OF "PARADE" +"THANK YOU","SWEETHEART CONTRACT &"THIS POISON". RAYS HAS LIVE "PARADE" & "BURN AGAIN" INSTEAD. WORTH THE EXTRA 2 BUCKS. SHOWCASES GREAT BASS & DRUMS AND HOWARDS' GIFT FOR WORDS AND DRAMA. ALONG WITH THE GROUP "WIRE", MAGAZINE SHOWED THAT PROGRESSIVE AND PUNK CAN BE COMBINED INTO SOME GREAT MUSIC. WHAT I FIND FUNNY IS THAT EVERYBODY LOVES THIS NOW BUT BACK IN 1979 CRITICS COULD NOT DEAL WITH THIS GROUP. MAGAZINE DARED TO BLAZE THEIR OWN PATH AND NOT STAY WITH THE MUSIC OF THE TIMES. INTENSE POST-PUNK AT ITS BEST.
