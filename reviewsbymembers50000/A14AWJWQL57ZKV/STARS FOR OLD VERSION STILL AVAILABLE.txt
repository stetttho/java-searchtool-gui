 IN REFERANCE TO THE BAD REVIEWS FOR THE NEW RE-MIX I MUST AGREE. HOWEVER I AM REVIEWING THE OLD VERSION STILL AVAILABLE. THIS IS BLUES-ROCK AT ITS BEST. BILLY GIBBONS IS A TRUE TALENT AT GUITAR.  "ASLEEP IN THE DESSERT" IS A GREAT INSTRUMENTAL & "ARRESTED" IS ZZ AT ITS TOP. I FOUND CASSETTES OF THIS & THE OTHER EARLY ZZ TOP RELEASES AT MY LOCAL 24 HOUR SUPER-STORE FOR FIVE BUCKS EACH. GREAT DRIVING MUSIC.
