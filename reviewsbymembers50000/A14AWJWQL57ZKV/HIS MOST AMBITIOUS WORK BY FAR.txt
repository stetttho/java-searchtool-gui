 THIS CD IS PERFECT FOR GUITAR FANS LOOKING FOR THEIR FIRST CLASSICAL CD. MALMSTEEN CREATES AN ORIGINAL PIECE FOR ORCHESTRA & ELECTRIC GUITAR INSTEAD OF HIS USUAL TYPE SONGS WITH VOCALS & DRUMS. THIS HAD TO BE HARD TO DO SINCE HE CAN'T READ MUSIC. THE PRODUCTION{24 BIT}WAS MUCH CLEANER THAN HIS USUAL CDS. THIS WAS ONE TIME THE IMPORT WAS WORTH THE EXTRA $$$. IF YOU ARE ALREADY A FAN OF HIS ROCK WORK YOU MUST CHECK THIS OUT.
