 TD HITS THE RIGHT NOTES ON THIS 85' RELEASE. FLAWLESS PRODUCTION VALUES PLUS SOME OF THEIR CATCHIER TUNES. MAKES YOU WANT TO VISIT ALL THE PLACES THEIR MUSIC EVOKES. BONUS POINTS FOR THEIR USUAL COOL CD COVER. MY "DOMESTIC" VERSION SOUNDED SO GOOD I CAN'T SEE PAYING EXTRA FOR THE "IMPORT" VERSION WHICH HAS NO BONUS TRACKS. "CENTRAL PARK" IS A BLAST.
