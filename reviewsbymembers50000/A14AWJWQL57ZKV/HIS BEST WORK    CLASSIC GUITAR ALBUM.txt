 Much better guitar sound than on "Edge", here he perfects neoclassical style metal. Unlike Yngwie, Tony spares us from screemie-meemy vocalists singing goofy Viking lyrics. Instead he creates 10 superb guitar songs and one nice keyboard piece. The drummer is excellent and the production is clean. Some of his guitar solos are amazing. Instrumental rock at its best.
