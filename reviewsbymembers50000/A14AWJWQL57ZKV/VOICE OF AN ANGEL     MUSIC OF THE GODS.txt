 LIZ FRASER HAS THE MOST UNIQUE VOICE IN MUSIC. SUCH A VOICE THAT "LYRICS" WERE NOT NEEDED. ROBIN GUTHRIES SHIMMERING GUITARS AND MUSIC FRAME HER VOICE PERFECTLY. "ORANGE APPLED" IS BEYOND BELIEF IN ITS EXECUTION. THEIR BEST MUSIC HAS AN ALMOST CHILDLIKE WONDER ABOUT IT. I AM ALSO GLAD THEY PUT IT IN CRONO ORDER SO WE CAN SEE THEIR PROGRESSION THRU THE YEARS. NICE JOB.
