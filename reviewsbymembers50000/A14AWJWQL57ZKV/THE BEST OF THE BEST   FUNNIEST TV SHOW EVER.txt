 ANYBODY THAT DISLIKES "THE SIMPSONS" IS DUMBER THAN HOMER ON HIS WORST DAY. THIS COLLECTION FEATURES SOME OF THEIR BEST EPISODES PLUS EXTRAS YOU DON'T GET ON TV. PLUS NO ANNOYING ADS! I WOULD RECOMEND THIS OVER VOL.1 SINCE THE EARLIER EPISODES AREN'T QUITE AS FUNNY AS THE "MIDDLE" YEARS. IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD THESE JUST MAKE YOUR OWN TAPES. EACH EPISODE IS LIKE A CHAPTER FROM A MOST RICHLY DRAWN BOOK THAT STANDS ON ITS OWN, YET BECOMES EVEN BETTER WHEN COMBINED WITH THE OTHERS. HOMER IS THE MAN!
