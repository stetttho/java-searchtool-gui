 GOOD SELECTION OF TUNES. I WISH THEY PUT THEM IN ORDER OF RELEASE SO IT COULD FLOW BETTER. CHUCK'S VOICE IS ONE OF THE BEST IN ROCK & ALEX PLAYS SOME GREAT SOLOS(SOULS OF BLACK,PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH)EVERYTHING FROM WEST COAST THRASH TO DEATH METAL IS PLAYED AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL. SUBTRACTING ONE STAR FOR WRONG ORDER AND THE FACT THAT CASSETTE BUYERS LOSE TWO TUNES. MUSIC ITSELF IS 5 STAR STUFF.
