 WITH THE RADIO-FRIENDLY VOICE OF JOE TURNER{RAINBOW} YNGWIE PUTS OUT HIS 4TH ALBUM. NOT BAD BUT TOO MANY 80'S STYLE HAIR-BAND SONGS. AND HE WONDERS WHY PEOPLE DON'T TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY. THE 4 STARS ARE FOR HIS BEST VOCAL SONG EVER, "FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT". THIS SONG TAKES OFF WHERE DEEP PURPLE'S "BURN" & "HIGHWAY STAR" LEFT OFF. ONCE AGAIN, THE LAST SONGS ARE THE BEST. THIS GUY SHOULD JUST PLAY THE GUITAR AND FORGET TRYING TO SELL ALBUMS.
