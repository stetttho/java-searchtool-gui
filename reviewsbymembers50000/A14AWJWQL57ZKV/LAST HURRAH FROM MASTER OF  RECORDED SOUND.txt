 ENO DESERVES A LOT OF CREDIT FOR EXPANDING THE BOUNDERIES OF MODERN MUSIC. FROM HIS EARLY STUFF WITH ROXY MUSIC TO HIS PRODUCTION WORK WITH U2 & BOWIE. THIS MAY NOT BE HIS BEST{BEFORE & AFTER SCIENCE AND GREEN WORLD ARE 5 STARS}, BUT IT IS THE BETTER OF HIS MORE RECENT SOLO ALBUMS. ROBERT FRIPP IS A BLAST AS USUAL. AMBIENT FANS BEWARE: THIS WILL KEEP YOU AWAKE AT NITE.
