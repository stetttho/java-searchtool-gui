 MARK KNOPFLER IS A FANTASTIC GUITARIST. THE WAY HE FILLS BETWEEN THE LINES IS SUPERB. THIS IS WHAT SETS HIM APART FROM MOST SINGER/SONGWRITERS. THIS & "MAKING MOVIES" ARE HIS BEST WORK. THE SONGS THAT WERE NOT OVER-PLAYED ON THE RADIO, SUCH AS "YOUR LATEST TRICK" & "RIDE ACROSS THE RIVER" ARE SOME OF HIS BEST. ONE OF THE FEW BANDS THAT DESERVE THEIR HIGH RANKING ON THE CHARTS.
