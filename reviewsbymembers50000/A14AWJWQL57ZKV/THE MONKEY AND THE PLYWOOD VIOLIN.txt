 Only Mr. Cohen could write a lyric like that. I rarely listen to cds for the words but this one made me listen. Cohen is also underrated as a musician and producer. A good example would be the song "First we take Manhattan". One of the best songwriters in the history of music for sure. "The Future" is next.
