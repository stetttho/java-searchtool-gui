 Just like Bowie in the 70's & 80's, Garbage is not afraid to change their sound. Combining genres in their own special way, Garbage releases yet another modern music masterpiece. One of the few bands that seem to be trying to make music THAT SOUNDS GOOD. From their first single "Vow" to all of their great "b-sides", Garbage has always delivered and this disc continues that trend. Shirley's voice has never been better or more wide-ranging than on this release. Ultra clean production highlights some very strong songs. BEST CD OF THE YEAR.
