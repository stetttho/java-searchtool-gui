 WIRE WERE BEYOND ANYTHING 1979 COULD PRODUCE. BANDS LIKE WIRE & MAGAZINE WERE NOT POPULAR BECAUSE THEY WENT AGAINST THE "PUNK" ETHIC OF THE TIME, WHICH SLAGGED ANYONE WHO KNEW HOW TO PLAY THEIR INSTRUMENTS WELL. THIS CD SHOWS THEIR PROGRESSIVE SIDE COMBINED WITH THEIR EARLIER "RAW" SOUND. MIKE THORNE BECAME THEIR "GEORGE MARTIN" TO FLESH OUT THEIR NEW SOUNDSCAPES INTO THE CLASSIC ALBUM THIS BECAME. WIRE AT THEIR PEAK.
