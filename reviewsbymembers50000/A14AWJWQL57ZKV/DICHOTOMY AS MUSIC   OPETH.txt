 Start/stop. Soft/loud. Growl/whisper. These guys got it all down to an art. Yet this disc plays like a unending symphony of ideas. Thats why this cd takes a while to get but it never gets old. The death growls work as a counterpoint to the clean vocals but will doom this talented group to cult status. Excellent production by Dan Swano makes the music jump out at you. Push play and repeat and let Opeth carry you away...
