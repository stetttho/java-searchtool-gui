 INSIDE OF THIS 74 MINUTE FANTASY RIDE IS SOME REALLY GOOD MUSIC BY BUCKETHEAD(BRIAN CARROLL) & BOOTSY COLLINS & BRAIN. THERE IS ALSO SOME STUFF THAT SEEMS TO BE AIMED AT 12 YEAR OLDS. IF THIS GUY EVER JUST CUT OUT THE [CRUD] AND REPLACE IT WITH MORE JAMS & IMPROVASATIONS ON GUITAR HE WOULD PRODUCE GREAT ALBUMS THAT DIDN'T NEED EDITING DOWN. THE WHOLE "CHICKEN COOP" THING IS STARTING TO GET OLD. AS IT IS I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY HIS STUFF JUST BECAUSE IT SHOWS WHAT A TALENT HE IS. I HOPE AXL DOESN'T RUIN HIM FOR GOOD.
