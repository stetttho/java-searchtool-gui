 THIS CD IS A MASTERPIECE OF SONG-WRITING AND PLAYING. RODDY'S PLACE IN MUSIC HISTORY IS SEALED WITHIN THIS DISC. GREAT SONGWRITING + SLICK GUITAR WORK FROM FRAME = AZTEC CAMERA. A LOST CLASSIC THAT ALL MODERN MUSICIANS SHOUD LISTEN TO. "WALK OUT TO WINTER" SHOULD BE ON EVERY CHRISTMAS COLLECTION. FIVE AND A 1/2 STARS.
