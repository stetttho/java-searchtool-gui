 THE FACT THAT 153 PEOPLE BEFORE ME HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THIS CD SPEAKS VOLUMES. "WHEN YOU SLEEP" & "WHAT YOU WANT" ARE STAND-OUT TRACKS THAT WORK WELL WITHIN THE ALBUM. IF BRIAN WILSON WAS BORN 25 YEARS LATER AND PLAYED THE GUITAR INSTEAD OF KEYBOARDS IS THE BEST COMPARISION I CAN COME UP WITH. THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS TYPE OF CD IS THAT IT GETS BETTER THE MORE YOU LISTEN TO IT. DENSE MIXES ARE GOOD THAT WAY. YOU MAKE THINGS TOO EASY TO HEAR AND YOU GET TIRED OF IT FASTER. SHIELDS KNOWS HE CAN'T TOP THIS SO HE IS SMART TO TAKE HIS TIME.
