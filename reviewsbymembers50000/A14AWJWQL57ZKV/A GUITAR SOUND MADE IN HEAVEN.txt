 BILL NELSON WAS A GREAT GUITAR PLAYER AND A PRETTY GOOD SONGWRITER/VOCALIST IN HIS DAY. THIS ALONG WITH THE BBC CD ARE THE BEST VALUE IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD/FIND ALL THEIR ORIGINAL ALBUMS. WHY THIS BAND WASN'T HUGE IS A STILL A MYSTERY. COMBINES THE BEST OF BOWIE, BEATLES, AND HENDRIX. A COUPLE OF TUNES ARE MISSING BUT STILL A GOOD SELECTION OVERALL. 19 SONGS! ONE OF ROCKS' MISSING LINKS.
