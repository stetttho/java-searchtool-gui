 THE MASTER OF "TONE" ALONG WITH EDDIE VAN HALEN. EARLY MATERIAL FROM THE ALBUM "MONTROSE" BY FAR THE BEST. LATER STUFF O.K. BUT SEEMED TO MISS SAMMY HAGER'S CO-WRITING LATER ON. GUITAR PLAYERS TODAY SHOULD LISTEN JUST TO SEE HOW IMPORTANT A GREAT TONE {AND EAR} IS TO THE FINAL PRODUCT. LAID OUT IN CRONO ORDER LIKE ALL "BEST OFS" SHOULD BE.
