 THE "ONE" TO BUY IF YOU CAN BUY JUST ONE. WHY DOES HE SOUND BETTER LIVE THAN STUDIO? {LACK OF A REAL PRODUCER?}. MALMSTEEN RIPS THROUGH A NICELY PACED SET IN BRAZIL. NOT TOO MANY SAPPY SLOW NUMBERS. UNRESTRAINED GUITAR PLAYING BY SOMEBODY WHO SHOWS HOW TO SOLO LIKE A MAN POSSESSED. BUCKETHEAD LIKES HIM - SO SHOULD YOU!
