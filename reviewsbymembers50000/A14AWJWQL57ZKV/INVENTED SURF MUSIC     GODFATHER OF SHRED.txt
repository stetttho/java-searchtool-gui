 GOOD COLLECTION OF A GREAT GUITAR PLAYER. THE LAST HALF OF THIS CONTAINS SOME GREAT STUFF THAT SET THE STAGE FOR THE GUITAR PLAYERS OF THE LAST 35 YEARS. WE COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT THE EARLY VOCAL STUFF WHICH SOUNDS REALLY DATED. IT TOOK PULP FICTION TO BRING HIM BACK INTO THE LIGHT & HE DESERVES IT.
