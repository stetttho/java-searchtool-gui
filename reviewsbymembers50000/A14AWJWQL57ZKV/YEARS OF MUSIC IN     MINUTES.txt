 THE GRANDMASTER OF NEO-CLASSICAL AXE MUSIC GIVES US 25 SELECTIONS OF VARIOUS STYLES ON HIS 7 STRING, 6 OCTAVE GUITAR. ONE CAN SEE WHERE VAN HALEN, RHOADS & MALMSTEEN GOT THEIR INSPIRATION FROM. COMBINING MOZART WITH HENDRIX IS WHERE ROTH LIVES AND BREATHES. AS HE GETS OLDER HE KEEPS REFINING HIS SOUND AND WE SHOULD THANK HIM FOR SINGING LESS THESE DAYS. ROTH LETS HIS EXPRESSIVE GUITAR DO THE TALKING FOR HIM ON THIS 2 DISC,PART LIVE/PART STUDIO RECORDING. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL GUITAR FANS.
