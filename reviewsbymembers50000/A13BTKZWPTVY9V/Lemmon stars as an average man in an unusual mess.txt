 Jack Lemmon stars as Sam Bissel, junk sculptor extraordinaire.  Sam works in the art department of an ad agency.  He feels that he is not getting anywhere in the advertising business.  Just as he is about to ask the boss  for a raise, he is summoned to his boss' office and promoted to an account  executive.  Meanwhile, the best friend of Sam's wife moves in next door  awaiting her inheritance.  She has just gotten a divorce that is not yet  final, but in order to qualify for her uncle's inheritance, she must be  married.  So Sam gets elected to play her husband.  Her relatives think he  is her husband (Mr. Ebbets) and his boss and his client think she is his  wife (Mrs. Bissel). What a mess!  Meanwhile, Sam's real wife get's left out  of the business dinner with the client and Sam's "other wife's"  real husband shows up.  It's great fun to watch.  You almost need a score  card.  Even the mail man didn't know who to give the mail to when he saw  the men leaving for work!  All of you Jack Lemmon fans will enjoy  "Good Neighbor Sam."
