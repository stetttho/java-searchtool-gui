 This film depicts a classic westward journey. Not the usual family voyage, but single women yearning for home and family in a California valley. Their journey begins with the women, the train boss (Robert Taylor), and the men whose work it is to help get the wagon train and the women to their destination. One night, however, all but 4 of the men desert the train. The next morning, the boss decides to "make men out of the women", so they can complete the trip. The struggles, heartaches, and accomplishments of these women are lived out in their quest.  The realism of this story is compelling. You, the viewer, will want to revisit this movie often and share it with your family and friends who admire bravery and strength when it shows up in ordinary people.
