 Where most movies made nowadays are full of noisy spectacles and special effects, "Harvey" is as real as real as can be (or is he?).  We just can't see him. (Or can we?)  Jimmy Stewart's portrayal of Elwood P.  Dowd could never be duplicated. He plays Elwood with the sort of dry humor  that tickles everyone's funnybone!  He makes Harvey real to all of us.  His  sister, Veta Louise Simmons, played by Josephine Hull (who also starred in  Arsenic and Old Lace with Cary Grant) gives a wonderful performance walking  the line of she does/doesn't believe in Harvey. My favorite of the minor  characters is Aunt Ethel Chauvenet. Her reaction to meeting Harvey and her  comment about Mrs. Frank Cummings have me in stitches everytime I watch  this movie! I also like the advice that Elwood's Mother gave him--his  choices were "to be oh, so smart" or "to be oh, so  pleasant." He chose to be "oh, so pleasant."  That is a good  description of Elwood P. Dowd. No matter how ruffled everyone's feathers  are getting around him, he remains "oh, so pleasant."The version  of this video I bought has a dialogue by Jimmy Stewart at the beginning. He  speaks about his experiences  while making the movie and while he was on  the road doing the play. He said during just about every performance of the  play a fidgity child would call out "Where's the Rabbit?"
