 "Vogues of 1938"--If you are looking for a movie with a really thick plot, this is not for you. However, if you are really into fashion design (as a doer or as an observer), you are in the right place. "Vogues" is jam-packed with fashions! This movie could be (and probably is) used as a supplemental "textbook" for fashion design classes. There are many beautiful dresses shown in the story. The climax of the movie is a wonderful fashion show. Get your sketchbook ready when you watch this one!
