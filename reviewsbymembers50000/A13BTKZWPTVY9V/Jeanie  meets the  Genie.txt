 Before Barbara Eden played a Genie on the home screen, she played the fiance of a man (Tony Randall) who had a Genie. This film is a lot of fun to watch.  The Genie (played by Burl Ives) tries everything to please his master, but to no avail. All of his good works turn into problems.  This is a light-hearted comedy which should be reproduced for public viewing. We all need a laugh now and then (especially now!).  And this film will fill the bill. Encourage the video and DVD makers to bring back "The Brass Bottle".
