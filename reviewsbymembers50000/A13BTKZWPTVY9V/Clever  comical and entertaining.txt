 that's how I would sum up the delightful movie entitled "The Invisible Woman".  John Barrymore plays a "nutty professor" who has invented a machine that makes people invisible.  His volunteer  (Virginia Bruce) is a fashion model.  Her boss, who needs a lesson in  kindliness, is played by Charles Lane (a familiar face in many movies and  TV).  The plot thickens when a group of criminals find out about the  machine and decide that being invisible would be just the thing to aid in  their "profession".  This merry escapade winds up with a clever  surprise ending.  It holds fun in store for all classic comedy buffs.
