 Irene Dunne gives a wonderful performance as Theodora Lynn in Theodora Goes Wild. Theodora is the author of a steamy novel written under her pen name. Living in a small, straight-laced New England town, she doesn't dare  tell anyone that she is the writer of the "Hottest Novel of the  Day!"  Only her Uncle in New York knows her "wicked" secret.  While paying a visit to her publisher under the guise of a visit to her  Uncle, she meets the artist (Melvyn Douglas) who did the cover of her book.   Romance blossoms when he arrives unexpectedly in her hometown posing as an  out-of-work gardener. The town gossips have a field day!  This is an  excellently made movie. One I really enjoy as I am sure you will, too.
