 "Pioneer, Go Home!" is great fun to read.  I read it as a teen in the spring of '61 on a trip from Ohio to Florida. Mom, my Aunt and I went to the movies soon after we arrived.  The movie was "Follow That Dream" starring Elvis Presley.  As it turned out, the movie just happened to be based on the book I had just read on the way down to Florida!  I read the Reader's Digest condensed version at the time.  A few years ago, I was able to find a copy of the book.  It really is that good!  I have read and reread it many times.  It is always fun!  I would recommend it highly to anyone who loves fun books and has been to Florida in the 50's or early 60's. You will like the movie, too.  This portrays a more natural Elvis than his usual movies do.  The story takes you back to 50's Florida when it was unique in its own way.
