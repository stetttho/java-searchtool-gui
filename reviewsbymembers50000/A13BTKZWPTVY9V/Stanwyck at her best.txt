 Christmas in Connecticut is a romantic comedy all of you classic movie buffs will enjoy.  It centers around a single working girl (Barbara Stanwyck) who writes a cooking column for a ladies magazine.  Her writing is so convincing that her boss (Sidney Greenstreet) believes it all--husband, baby, and farm in Connecticut! So he arranges to have a sailor and himself invited to spend Christmas "on her perfect farm." What to do? Here she is, a gal who can "only cook on the typewriter." Well, bring along Uncle Felix to do the cooking.  All goes well until she is asked to flip a flapjack.  Did she do it? Well, wait and see. This movie is full of fun and romance (the old-fashioned kind).  It's a holiday treat for young and old alike.
