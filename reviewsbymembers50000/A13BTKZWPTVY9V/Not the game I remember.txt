 I played Chutes and Ladders as a child (4th grader or so) in the 50's.  This game has gone through radical changes since then. It used to require knowledge to play it. It had an entirely different format. There were several straight ladders lined up in a row across the board. Between each ladder and the next was a chute. The game was played as follows: Answer a question correctly, advance one rung of the ladder.  Answer enough questions to get to the top of the ladder, advance to the bottom of the next ladder. And so on across the board. Each ladder represented a grade in school. However, when a question was answered incorrectly, the player went down the chute to the bottom of the ladder he or she was currently climbing to begin climbing that ladder again.  The winner was the first player to complete climbing all of the ladders. The original version was created to challenge your knowledge. It was a difficult game as I recall.  The version in the present format is just meant for amusement, in itself a good thing, but by no means a challenge.
