 A sailor, Bake Baker (Fred Astaire) looks up his former dance partner, Sherry Martin (Ginger Rogers) while on leave.  He finds her working as a singer and dancer at a dime-a-dance club.  He arrives at the club with a  group of his shipmates, all but Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott).  As Bilge  arrives, Sherry's sister, Connie (Harriet Hilliard) has just been denied  entrance to the club without an escort, so she decides to tag along with a  very bewildered Bilge. Connie is dressed in the typical  "schoolmarm" attire.  Bilge and his buddies thinks she is an  "old crow."  Surprise, surprise! The lady becomes a sultry babe  after donning a glamorous gown from her sister's wardrobe with some help  from Kitty (Lucille Ball) and a very young Betty Grable.  Unaware of her  transformation, Bilge makes his move on Connie. (In case, the name Harriet  Hilliard doesn't ring a bell.  She is Ozzie's wife, Harriet Nelson. She  sure doesn't look like Harriet-the-housewife in this flick!  No wonder  Ozzie flipped for her!)  Naturally, with a cast like Astaire and Rogers  there has to be singing (by Fred, Ginger and Harriet) and lots and lots of  dancing by Fred and Ginger, the patrons of the dance club, the crew of the  navy ship and the cast of the musical show they later put on to help pay  for restoration of the ship that was left to Connie by her father. One  dance number (done to the tune of "I'm Putting All My Eggs in One  Basket") is especially cute performed when Bake and Sherry are  practicing for their show. The plot isn't very thick, but you'll love the  dancing and singing.  There is a wide variety of dancing.  This movie  really shows off their repetoir. It's alot of fun!
