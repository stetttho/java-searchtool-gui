 Whenever Billy Wilder (Director) and Jack Lemmon (Actor) get together be prepared for laughs and a great motion picture. In all of their collaberations watch for authentic locations. "Irma La Douce" is  no exception. It is the real Par-ee. Oo-la-la! The scenes are shot in  actual locations, outside and inside (not just studio scenery like the  others give you).The story is based on an honest, naive man who falls for a  "Lady of the Evening" played by Shirley MacLaine. He doesn't want  her to "work", but she considers it a profession.  What to do? He  conjures up a rich customer for her (himself in disguise) to keep her  income up and her off the streets.  Jack's character, Nestor, gets in  deeper and deeper as he tries to finance this proposition. Finally,  jealousy (of himself!) takes over.  I don't want to spoil the story for  you! I can tell you that you will have fun watching this one.
