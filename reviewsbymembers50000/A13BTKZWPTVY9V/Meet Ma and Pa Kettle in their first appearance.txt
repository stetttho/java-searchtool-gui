 Hop in the old truck with Bob (Fred MacMurray) and Betty (Claudette Colbert) and head for the hills of rural Washington State.  Betty is unprepared for what awaits her--life on a chicken farm!  Bob is gungho for  the idea, but Betty has never gone near the kitchen to cook, much less to  "put up all those canned goods" that Bob expects her to do!  Down  the road apiece live Ma and Pa Kettle and their hard-to-count-how-many  children.  Ma is an expert quilter and Pa is an expert borrower!  You will  experience life along with them going to the county fair, the weekly  dances, planting a garden, everything right down to slopping the hogs.   This movie is great fun to watch.  I read the book, too.  Try to get a  copy, if you can.  It is Betty's real life story.  The movie is based on  the book.  I am sure you will be well entertained by them both.
