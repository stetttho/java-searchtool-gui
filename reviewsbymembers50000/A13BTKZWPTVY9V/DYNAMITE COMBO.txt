 Musicians Jerry (Jack Lemmon) and Joe (Tony Curtis), witnesses to a gangland killing, don feminine attire to escape the Chicago mob.  On the train to Florida with an all-girls' band, they meet Sugar Kane (Marilyn  Monroe) and on arrival in Miami they meet a "rich" millionaire  (Joe E. Brown). Two very unusual romances blossom between this quartet!  I  first saw this movie when I was 12.  Jack Lemmon has been my favorite actor  ever since!  He's a riot!  Wait till you see him on his date!  The story  takes place in a beautiful 20's-style woodframe hotel.  Be ready for a million laughs when you  watch Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe and Joe E. Brown in  "Some Like It Hot!"
