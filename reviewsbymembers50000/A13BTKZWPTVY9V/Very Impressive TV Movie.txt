 This is a wonderful visual presentation of Orson Wells 1939 Halloween special radio broadcast. His version of H. G. Wells' book "War of the Worlds" was relocated to the USA, Dexter Mills, New Jersey to be exact. The location was chosen by a dart throw! The movie goes into details of how the sound effects were produced. Astounding and surprising! The actor who played the radio news announcer had listeners on the edge of their seats with his realistic emotions. So realistic, in fact, that the interruption of news bulletins is no longer allowed in any type of broadcast to this day! I bought a cassette tape of the original radio broadcast. I can see how this could have started the panic that it did. Especially since, back then, they were no commercials during the show. The people who tuned in late didn't know it was a show! The people in the studio had no idea what a stir they were causing! I believe you will be as impressed with this film as I am. I hope they produce it for sale on DVD very soon.
