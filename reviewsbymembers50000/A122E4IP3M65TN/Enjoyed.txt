 I did enjoy this story.  I believe Mr. White put his heart and others feelings into this story.  Love can hurt, especially when you love so hard and Mr. White explained that in his story along with the emotional baggage it brings.  Overall a good read, the story faces reality and I did enjoy to novel.
