 I enjoyed this version of Shaft.  I enjoy watching Sam Jackson, I believe he is a great actor, and will add enjoyment and entertainment to any film.  Compared to the first Shaft, personally, I don't think you can compare this to the 1st Shaft with Richard Roundtree.  That Shaft is in a catagory of it's own.  As far as a follow-up is concern, you might want to catagorize this a the follow-up to the original Shaft.  All in all, the actors (all) were great and I did enjoy the movie.
