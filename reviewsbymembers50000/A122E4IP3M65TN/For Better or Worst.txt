 Excellent read, you never know what changes life may bring about...What happened in this story can happen to anyone, however, this particular couple were able to move on in their relationship after infidelity showed it's ugly head... That's why couple's really need to "listen" to the vows they're repeating and live by them...It's hard, but it can be done...Great story with a good ending...
