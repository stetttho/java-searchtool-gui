 Very well written.  I have always enjoyed Ms. Rays novels, she is an excellent writer and she has a way of keeping your nose in her books.  This particular book was really good because it was so true to life, and I really liked the questionaire in the back of the book.  This story holds all of the components to make a "best seller".  Hats off to you again Ms. Ray...
