 I was disappointed after reading this novel.  I had a hard time getting into the story at first, but I continued reading  and just as the story was getting good, death steps to the plate. After that chapter, I could not get into the story because of his death.  That put a shadow on the entire story as far as I was concerned.  All in all, I did not really care for this story, I felt the story was to long and after a while just to much...
