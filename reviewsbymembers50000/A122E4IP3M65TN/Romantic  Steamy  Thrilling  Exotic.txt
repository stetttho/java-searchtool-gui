 Overall a great read...  I was very impressed how the author was able to capture my interest and own it until the end of the story.  The overall substance of the story overwhelmed me.  The author was able to guide me through the story as if I actually knew the characters.  I again was awed with the sensual content of the story and the steamy and exotic love making scenes.  This story is about a young lady encountering the demons of lust but pleading to be loved and appreciated for who she is.  Sashas' mother died in childbirth; therefore she never knew her mother and her father raised her the best he could consider the situation.  All in all, Sasha was looking for someone to love and appreciate her and she thought she found it with Cole, however, Cole was married and could only give but so much of himself.  Phoenix the basketball star, young, fine and alluring hired Sasha to be his personal consultant,however, Phoenix had other intentions and throughout the story you will see how these two men played a large part in Sashas' life and the impact of both men.  Again, I did enjoy this book, and I understand Ms. Thomas is a new author therefore, I would like to welcome and encourage her to continue writing, this was a great book and a serious story with substance.  "You've got to love and respect yourself" first and foremost...
