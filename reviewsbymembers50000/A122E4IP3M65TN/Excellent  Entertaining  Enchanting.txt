 As always this was a very interesting book.  This book bought closure to the Quinten Parker saga.  I felt somewhat possessive of Quin, I really would have preferred that he and Nikita made a go of it, but due to her untimely dealth that was impossible.  It is good to know that he was able to find love with someone and, hopefully he and Rae will live happily ever after.  I admire the way the story was bought to a close and in the end, all parties involved appeared to be happy.  I felt as if that  was the end of a story well told, and sort of sad to see the saga end of Quin Parker, Nikita, Maxine,& etc. but life must go on and I did enjoy this episode.  Donna, you did it again, this is an excellent book and I enjoyed it as I always enjoy your writing.
