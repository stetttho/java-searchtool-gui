 Overall, this was a story about lovers that went their seperate way during their  college years and reunited in their adulthood.  Rosie, a bright young energetic entrepreneur ready to face the world, but afraid to take another chance at love because of being hurt the first time.  Lamar a bright, good looking young man returns home to a new job, and to learn that his ex-girlfriend from college resides in the same town.  The two meet up after a 12 year break.  Lemar still has feelings for Rosie, but he is also a little nervous about reuniting because of the way they broke off.  Rosie has a secret that she kept from Lamar for 12 years, but it is that secret that brings them together again.  All in all, I did enjoy the story, very romatic and entertaining.  Ms. Anderson, you did a swell job and continued success with you literature.
