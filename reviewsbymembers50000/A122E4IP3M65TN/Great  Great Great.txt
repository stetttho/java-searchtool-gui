 Great book, good read.  I loved this story, it had all of the components needed for a good read.  I like the way the author played out each character and their life story and how it all became a full circle in the end.  I especially liked Rasheeda and Danny... Great story with alot of substance to keep one interested and thirsty until the end.  you did a great job "Slim"...
