 Love can be so overwhelming sometimes...  This book is very intense, very sad but true...Eric has proven to the public that he is extremely imaginative, spine-tingling, exhilarating, and over all demanding your attention from start to end.  This novel is about love and hate and how very thin the line is between both passions.  Excellent read, cound not put it down...Very very good...Again, Eric exceeded all expectations... He is indeed in a class of his own...
