 Great book, Good story telling, I really enjoyed the the theme of the story.  Sad about Hope and her personal issues which affected the entire family including friends.  In the end, it all came together and the family was able to heal and look to the future, but I did enjoy the story and this is the 2nd book that I've read by the author, and to be honest, both books were good to me.
