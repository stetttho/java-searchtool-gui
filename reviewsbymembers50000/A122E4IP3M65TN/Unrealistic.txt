 Personally, I did not like the story, I thought it really did not have any substance. The female was so unsure of herself, and it almost ruined her life and someone elses. This is something that can be a problem in reality no need to make it a fantasy. I really lost interest in the story when the female character decided to have her baby although she did not love the father, then attempted to go through the  marriage ceremony again.  I don't think so.....  that was a bit much....
