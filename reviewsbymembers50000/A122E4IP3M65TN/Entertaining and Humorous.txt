 I read this book in 1 day!!  That is just  how great it is,  and Brenda is an excellent writer....I really enjoyed this book and all of it's characters....Jaylin is one funny man with an incredible sexual appetite however, he also has some hang-ups that he needs to correct....All and all this is a good book and you won't put it down until you finish, and you'll want more just like "Jaylin"!!
