 Excellent writing, I finished this book in a 24 hour period.  Could not and Would not put this book down.  I've read Ms. Johnson-Hodge books before, but, this one hit home.  I lost a friend to AIDS, so I could really relate to this book.  I cried all day long, it was as if I knew these people personally. Some thing in life we take for granted, but, this is "The Real Deal" and we must realize this disese is nothing to play with.  Thanks for putting it into words and and excellent story.  I enjoyed this book immensely...
