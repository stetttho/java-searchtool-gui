 I really did enjoy this book.  At first, it was a little slow, but, then it began to pick up and I could not put it down.  This book is about falling in love, but, loving the right person.  Sometimes in life, we put obstacles in our own paths which makes it hard for us to the forest for the trees which is sad.  Two people whom really loved each other, but, 1 person mad a choice earlier in life that affected his future.  The future has a past and we all need to remember that.  The ending was sad, Mr. Man not being man enoug to break off the relationship pulled a disappering act, but, life goes on...  All in all, I did enjoy this book and Ms. Rice writing.  I am going to buy her newest novel "Reinventing Woman....  Keep up the good work my sista !!
