 I read a Twist of Fate first, then Preconcived Notions.  Both books were great.  Ms. Williams writing is to be commended.  She really knows how to grab you into the lives of the characters.  Again, good writing with substance.  I only wished that Imagany would have kept in touch with her sister Zabree, perhaps if they did not loose communication, Zabree would not have turned to drugs to avoid thinking about the abuse she absorbed by her father.  Another thing, incest is a sinful matter one that should be taken very serious, I only wished Ms. Williams would had touch that subject a bit more than what she did.  It somewhat was left untouched being that the father was killed and you never heard anymore of the incest thing.  Overall, good read and good writing.
