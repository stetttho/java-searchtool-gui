 Not to b negative but, I would have preferred if this story were a bit more interesting.  The plot was good but, it was,nt as catching as I would have preferred. College life is so different from  real life  and I believe you see various situations that you take for granted in college, and once introduced to  9 - 5 life, you see things for what they are and not what you desire them to be.  I believe this young man had a hard time reaching maturity which bought on problems in his adult life.  Sometime you have to reach out to people and not take what others may say, but research for yourself and gain the real answer.It appeared this young man held a grudge because what happened to their relationship when they were students and could not overcome the past, which bought problems  in the future.  Get over it and move on... To me that part was boring and I could'nt get past that chapter.
