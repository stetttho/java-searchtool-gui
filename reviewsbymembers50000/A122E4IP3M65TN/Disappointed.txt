 I love Eric J. Dickey but it appeard he did not put much into this story.  E. Lynn Harris I've not been able to get into his literature. ( a personal thing)Marcus Major story was alright, the only story that I really got into was Colin Channer.  I did enjoy his story and the message from his story.  Sorry guys, expected more, but I won't give up on ya...
