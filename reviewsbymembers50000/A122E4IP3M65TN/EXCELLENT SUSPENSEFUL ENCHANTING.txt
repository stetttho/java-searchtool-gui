 I really enjoyed this book.  Not only was it a fast read, but a good read, at one point, I could not put the book down.  Addition is addition, but, I never thought of being addicted to sex.  Zane was able to focus on her addition and the problems that the addition caused in Zoe personal life and professional life.  Jason, Zoe husband was a little different.  Personally, I thought he should have informed Zoe that he was adopted prior to their getting married, but he didnt, that piece of information came out later.  All in all, this was a fantastic book. the family relationship was tight and thank God because if Zoe married anyone else, her ending might not have turned out the way it did, and everyone was satisfied in the end.  This book should be made into a movie, it is just that good and I will continue to read her writing.  Zane, may the force be with you...
