 I really did enjoy this book, Ms. Savoy is the type of author that knows how to keep you interested in her writing. I really did enjoy reading about Jarad and Ariel.  Im glad that they got together although I knew they would but I liked the way Ms. Savoy stretched it out (their getting together.)  Overall, it was a good read, and I will continue to read her literature...
