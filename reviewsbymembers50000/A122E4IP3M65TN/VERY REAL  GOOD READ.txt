 THIS BOOK TOUCHED MY HEART.  I ENJOYED READING THE ENTIRE BOOK FROM START TO FINISH.  LIFE IS SO SHORT, AND I'M GLAD THAT LILLY AND ADAM REALIZED THAT FACT.  I ONLY HOPED THAT ELEANOR AND JONATHAN GOT TOGETHER TO ENJOY EACH OTHER, AND SHAYLA HOPEFULLY FOUND SOMEONE TO LOVE AND CHERISH HER.  AS FOR LILLY'S HUSBAND MYRON, I'M SURE IN HIS LIFETIME, HE WILL REAP WHAT HE SOAR... IN LIFE "FAITH" MAY BE ALL WE HAVE TO LIVE FOR, SO I GUESS THAT OLD SAYING "LET GO AND LET GOD" IS TRUE... I BOW TO YOU MS. FRANCIS FOR WRITING SUCH AN TOUCHING STORY AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, LIVING PART OF IT.  MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS AND HEAL YOU SO THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE TO ENTERTAIN US WITH YOU WRITING.
