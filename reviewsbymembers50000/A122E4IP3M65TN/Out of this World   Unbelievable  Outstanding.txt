 Absolutely out of this world.  Words can not express how much I enjoyed the "Jaylin Saga" from book #1 "Two's Enough Three's a Crowd, Book #2 "My Way or No Way" and last but not least "book #3 "Change Don't Always Come".  I would like to compliment "Brenda Hampton" on her exceptional writing skills.  Ms. Hampton is an author who knows how to captures ones attention and secure it until the very end AND THEN, make you yearn for more...I also applaud Brenda for having a vision to create #3 paperback books about the same group of characters and continue to keep your interest in their lives to a point of no return. That alone is phenomenal!  I was extremely satisfied with the ending of the "Jaylin" saga (book #3) with him and Nokea getting married.  I was also proud of Nokea coming to Jaylin after Nanny B contacted her and Nokea realizing she loved Collin's but was IN LOVE with Jaylin...Touche~   As for Scorpio, well, you win some, you loose some, however, I would have liked to find out what happened to Stephon, Jaylin's cousin and how he made out....Nanny B is in a class of her own....Thank God she was always there for Jaylin and able to care for him and offer sound advice.  Overall, this was an excellent book with an exceptional and satisfying closing which brings closure to a magnificent saga.  Thank You Ms. Brenda for a rewarding journey in the world of Mr. Jaylin Jerome Rogers!!
