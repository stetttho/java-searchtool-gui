 I did enjoy this book.  The entire story was enchanting and entertaining.  I especially loved the way Ms. Hailstock bought the lovers together and the changes they went through which I'm sure any couple could relate to in order to stay together, but not only stay together, find true love and happiness.  I'm glad in the end the couple were able to overcome the obstacles in their relationship especially after having there secret exposed.  I guess if it is meant to be it will happen...
