 As always, Rochelle did it again.  It was such a plesure to read this book, and also to hear about the entire gang.  Vanessa, Joshua, Matt,Eve, David, all the family.  I just love the way Rochelle ties in the family tree.  I enjoyed reading this book, after all, I can remember when Emily was born, and Christopher, I can remember when he met his father (Matt) for the first time.  A true love story, Emily grows up and so does Christopher, they did well for themselves.  I totally enjoyed this edition, and continue to keep us reading good and interesting material.
