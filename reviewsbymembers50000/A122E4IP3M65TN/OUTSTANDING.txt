 Great story, it was good to pick up where I left off. I loved the way Ms. Thomas bought everything  and everyone together again without missing a beat.  Matt & Kaitlin finally got together in spite of all the problems they edured.  Just as happy for Sabrina & Preacher, however, I  wanted AC and Kaithlin younger sister to find a mate, but, I KNOW Ms. Thomas will probably bring us  up to date in her next book...
