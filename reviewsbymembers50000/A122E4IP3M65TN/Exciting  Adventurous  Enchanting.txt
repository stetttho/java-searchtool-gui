 I really enjoyed this book because it had all of the ingridients to make it a good read.  Reading this book was some what like watching a movie.  I was very impressed by the creativity used to keep your interest in the story.  The "Prince" was enchanting, exciting, handsome, classy and a real catch, however, his lady friend did not have the traits to make a "princess" bride, but, that is what made the book exciting the formula that worked and the end result was a real love match.  The love making, kissing, disagreements, running for their lives was so real...  I did enjoy it and look forward to other books by Tamara Sneed.  Hats off to you !
