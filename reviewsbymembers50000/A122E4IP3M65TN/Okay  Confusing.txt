 Well, I do alot of reading, but, for some reason I just could not catch on to what this sister was trying to say.  It appeared to me that she was more aware of the skin color and overall sex which does not make the man, at some time you need to come outside of the bedroom.  I understand that she was an older woman, however, at times I thought she was much younger by her actions and words.  I don't want to tear this book apart, but I think the story line was a little under developed.
