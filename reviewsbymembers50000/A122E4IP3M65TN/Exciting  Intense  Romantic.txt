 The story started off a little slow, however, as I continued reading the story sort of grew on me.  Well, overall a good story with real substance.  Great writing and story telling about a group of people that made money by acting out different con games. Dante, Pam, Big Slim, Scamz, Jackson, Robin and others played games with people lives and that is dangerous.  I really do believe that Dante was looking for love in all the wrong places, Pam was to selfish to love anyone other than herself.  Scamz forgot what love was long time ago when he sold his soul to the devil.  Poor Jackson, a man without a country and Robin, again, looking for love in all the wrong places.  EJD proved again to be in a class of its own by writing material that will live on... Great job Eric, and as always, I enjoyed this book and look forward to others.
