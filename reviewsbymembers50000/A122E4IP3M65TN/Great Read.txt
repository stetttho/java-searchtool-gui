 This was a good book with a story that just kept you wanting more.  True to the game is what it is all about.  It reminds me of the "day" when the game was played that way, but time has changed and so have the players. This  story did remind me of 'The coldest winter ever" and Capital City too.  Good story with subtance and makes you want to read more and more...  I did enjoy it very much and looking forward to other stories written by Ms. Woods...  Hats off to you my sista...
