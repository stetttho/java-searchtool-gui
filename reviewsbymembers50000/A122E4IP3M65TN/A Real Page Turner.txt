 Again, Connie has delivered a great story line which is the sequel to her best selling novel"P.G. County".  Good story telling of greed, jealousy, bitterness, adultry and betrayal.  This story will capture your attention and hold it until the very end.  Although it's been a while since P.G. County was published, the sequel picks right up where the other book left off and I was able to roll right along with the entire story non-stop.  Great writing, great characters and I look forward to her next book.
