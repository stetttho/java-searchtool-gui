 We'd had this DVD/VCR for 4 months and had a little flicker-and-flash from the power company.  Not even enough to reset all the clocks on things, and the Panasonic is dead.  What a waste--and power surges aren't covered by warranty.  This device is WAY too sensitive.  We also didn't like the way the fast forward worked on the VCR--not enough fine control  for passing over commercials.
