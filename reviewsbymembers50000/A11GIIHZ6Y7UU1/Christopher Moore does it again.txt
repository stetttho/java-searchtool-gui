 If you haven't read his other books, read them first, or you may not be able to truly appreciate their appearances in "The Stupidest Angel".  When the "Warning" at the front of the book has you laughing out loud, you know it's going to be fun.  This was a very quick read, but it will have you laughing all the way through.  Definitely a keeper!
