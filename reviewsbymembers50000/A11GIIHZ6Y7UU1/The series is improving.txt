 In "Smoke and Shadows", Tanya Huff didn't seem entirely comfortable with Tony being a full-fledged main character.  "S&M" is much better, but the relationships and repartee that make some of her other books so enjoyable still aren't fully there.  We don't have a regular secondary character for interactions--Henry is just a minor figure.  The Vicki/Henry/Mike or Claire/Dean/Austin chemistry is missing.  Some of the characters are getting a little more depth (Amy has potential), but Tony seems pretty much on his own.  Still an enjoyable book and a good story.  An improvement over the "S&S"; hopefully it's a trend.
