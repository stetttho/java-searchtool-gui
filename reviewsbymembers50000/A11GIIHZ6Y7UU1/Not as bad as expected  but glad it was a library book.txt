 After reading all the reviews, I expected another sex-fest like Incubus Dreams.  While there was sex in this book, it didn't seem QUITE as pointless.  Laurell K. Hamilton is an engaging writer; it's too bad she ran out of things to say.  While I enjoyed reading this book, when I finished it, I felt like "so what's the point?"
