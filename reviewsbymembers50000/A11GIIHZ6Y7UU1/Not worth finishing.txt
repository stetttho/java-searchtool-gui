 I had high hopes when I started this book, but it quickly became tedious.  Too many characters, too many disjointed scenes, not enough plot.  After getting half way through the book, it just doesn't seem worth the time to finish it.  Given the grammatical errors in the book, I was surprised to find out that the author was a reporter, and even more so to find that he had been an editor.  Stick with Hiaassen.  If you want good, zany writing in a different setting, try Christopher Moore (Practical Demon Keeping et al).
