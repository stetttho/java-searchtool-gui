 I own all the earlier LKH books, but after the disappointments of latest books, I decided to wait and just check this one out from the library.  I'm glad I did.  The first part of the books was actually pretty good and on track; I didn't see why so many people had problems with it, other than the spelling/grammar.  Then it really bogged down, and I started to understand.  ***SPOILERS*** Yeah, it was fine to have Anita and Ronnie patch up their differences, but the scene dragged on and on and ON.  If that's the kind of boring relationship I had with a friend, I'd probably just let them go on their merry way.  And what was with the sex with new characters?  It just seemed like LKH needed some filler, so she decided to throw in gratuitous sex scenes.  If she had just omitted the middle section of the book, it would have been a much better read.  Just because a scene has sex in it doesn't mean it can't be boring.  Several new characters were added with no apparent purpose.  Wicked and Truth?  Byron?  What's the point?  Unless they're going to play major roles in future books, they could have been left out.  They were just more padding.  It seems like LKH got paid by the pound for this one.  Not as bad as many reviewers said, but I don't know that I'll even add a cheap used paperback version to my LKH collection.
