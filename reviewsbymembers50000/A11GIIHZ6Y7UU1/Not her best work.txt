 After reading some of Ms. Handelands's recent works (Blue Moon, Hunter's Moon) I picked up this book expecting the same wit and crisp writing.  Even though I enjoy romance novels, I found this novel tedious and not worth reading in full.  I did skim through it, and found some of the basis for her new series.  I'm glad to see that Ms. Handeland's works have improved so much.  Her recent werewolf books are almost on a par with the early Anita Blake books, but this one just wasn't worth the effort.
