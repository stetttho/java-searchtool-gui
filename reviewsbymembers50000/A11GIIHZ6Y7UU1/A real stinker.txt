 This was one of the few books that I almost stopped reading.  The plot was transparent and the characters unlikeable.  The heroine was dull and whiney; the hero was a self-absorbed jerk.  "Oh, no one will ever love me because I'm so horrible; I'll just act more horribly because of it."  Marcus admired Kate for being fiery, when she actually was a spineless wimp.  My first Cheryl Holt book, and probably my last.  If you need to read it, try the library first.
