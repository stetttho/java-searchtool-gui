 Picked this up at the library, expecting more dumb fluff like "Office Space".  Instead we got a great dark comedy!  Yes, some of the language and behavior pushes the envelope, but it IS rated R, so what do you expect?  Very clever, twisted plot.  Some jumping around, took a while to figure out, but a great movie.  Be sure to watch the credits!
