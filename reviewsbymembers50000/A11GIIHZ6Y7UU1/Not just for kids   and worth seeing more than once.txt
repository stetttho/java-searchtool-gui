 I read "Ella Enchanted", and really enjoyed it.  I saw the negative reviews for the film on "Amazon", and checked it out from the library.  Now I may have to buy it.  As other reviewers have noted, this is NOT the story told in the book.  The film takes the basic premise and changes the story entirely.  But--it is a FUNNY, FUNNY film.  Kids might enjoy it, but there's plenty in there for the adults.  Just listen to the music selections--it's aimed at people who were in high school in the 70's.  Lots of subtle sight gags and puns.  If you like Monty Python or Airplane, you'll probably get a kick out of "Ella Enchanted."
