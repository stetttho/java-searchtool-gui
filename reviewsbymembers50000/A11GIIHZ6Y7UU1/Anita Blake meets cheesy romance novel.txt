 The protagonist will remind you a lot of Anita Blake, only more of a spoiled brat.  It makes you wonder why all the strong female leads in this type of book are written in the first person, and are tiny, dark-haired, dark-eyed women.  The book started out well as a paranormal adventure, then degraded into a cheap bodice ripper.  The "secret" that we discover about Mia was pretty obvious.  There are lots of loose ends, and the romance between Mia and Kyrin was poorly developed.
