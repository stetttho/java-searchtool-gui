 Thankfully I checked this book out of the library.  Since I hadn't been impressed by "Noble Intentions", I didn't want to take a chance buying this one.  I can read about anything, but this was such drivel I just skimmed over the book.  From what I read, the writing was poor, the characters annoying, and the "love scenes" insipid.  I won't waste my time with another book by this author.
