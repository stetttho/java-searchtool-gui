 I bought the first "Undead" book on a whim, and loved it.  I bought the next 2, even when MJD "upgraded" to hardcover.  Now I'll just wait until the library gets books in the series.  The latest "novel" (it's almost a short story) was a disappointment.  Betsy is getting tiresome, the characters aren't showing any growth, there's not that much humor any more, and there doesn't seem to be a good solid plot.  I won't be buying any more books in the series.  They're overpriced in hardcover and there's not much to them.  If you can, wait for a library copy.
