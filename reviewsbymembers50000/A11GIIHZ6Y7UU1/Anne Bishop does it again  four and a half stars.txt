 I was worried about this book--how could you have a sequel to the Black Jewels Trilogy without it diminishing the story?  Most sequels are a disappointment.  Not "Kaeleer's Heart".  It wrapped up some questions left over from the Black Jewels in a very satisfying way.  The trilogy wouldn't have been as powerful if this story had been included; reading it later as a separate story gave closure without spoiling the rhythm of the original series.  The other stories in the book were also very enjoyable, and it was a pleasure to visit the characters again.  On the negative side, the writing didn't seem to be quite as flowing and elegant as that in the original series.  Readers should read the original trilogy before reading these short stories in order to get to know the characters and to get a full appreciation for Anne Bishop's talent.   The only other negative impression I had about the book was that some of the character's behaviors and speaking styles didn't seem to mesh completely with the original series.  Not a surprise, really, given the years that have passed since the publication of the last of the Black Jewels trilogy.  None of these issues were enough of a detriment to keep this book from being one I'll read again--Anne Bishop is one of the great fantasy writers.
