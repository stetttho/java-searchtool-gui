 I had been looking forward to this addition to the Madeline Bean series for some time.  I found it a bit of a disappointment.  The book struck me as an author's excuse to use a trip to Hawaii as a tax writeoff.   "Let's see, what to do today.  THIS sounds like fun.  Now how can I work it into the book?"  It just didn't seem to have the strong plot that some of her other books have had.  That said, Jerrilyn Farmer is a talented writer.  Her books are enjoyable.  This wasn't bad, it just wasn't up to the level of the other books in the series.
