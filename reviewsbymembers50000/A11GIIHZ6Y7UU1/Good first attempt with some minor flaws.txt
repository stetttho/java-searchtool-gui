 I really enjoyed this book, although I don't think it deserves some of the rave reviews.  The material was fresh and funny, but there were a couple of problems with the style of writing.  The editor needs to do a little more work.  Some of the grammatical mistakes were distracting.  The style of writing was also variable.  Sometimes it was very enjoyable.  Alot of the time it was uncomfortable, reading more like a movie script than a novel, with the "set" described in painful detail.    Taking into account that this is a debut novel, it was really a great book.  I wouldn't put it at the same level as Christopher Moore or Tanya Huff as some of the other reviewers did, but I'll look for more books from this author.  If the freshness and humor continue and the writing improves with practice, A. Lee Martinez could become one of my favorites.
