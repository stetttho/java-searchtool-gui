 I've enjoyed previous books by Jane Heller, but this one was a stinker.  Mel, the main character, is a mean-spirited workaholic.  Her magic change of character at the end of the book just wasn't believable.  I disliked her through the book, and didn't like her better at the end.  Why did Ethan like her, anyway?  The only thing she seemed to have going for her was good hair and big boobs.  Her personality was rotten.  There was also a petty attitude regarding women paying alimony.  Why shouldn't they?  I was left wondering if Jane Heller got stuck with a nasty divorce settlement.  I won't be rushing out to buy any new books from this author.  Try the library for this one.
