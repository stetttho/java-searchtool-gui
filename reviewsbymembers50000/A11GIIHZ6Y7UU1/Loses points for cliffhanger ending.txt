 I'm a big fan of fantasy series, but one of my pet peeves is a book that ends with a cliffhanger.  It just seems greedy on the part of the author to force you to buy another book to get closure.  That said, this was a fun read.  I don't know that I'd compare it to the early Anita Blake books as some of the other reviewers did, but it sure beats the recent plotless porn from that series.  Still some work to go for it to be up to the level of some of the other fantasy series like Jim Butcher's Dresden Files, but worth checking out.
