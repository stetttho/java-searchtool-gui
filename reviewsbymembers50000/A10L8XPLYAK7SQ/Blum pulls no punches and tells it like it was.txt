 The history of the Jewish Brigade Group and the soldiers who served in it is not always pretty. The Brigade did distinguish themselves in battle but they also wrote their own rules after the war. They knew what their mission was and did everything they could to accomplish it. Blum tells all of the details and does not sugar-coat anything. It is a very well written history and makes to attempt to apologize for nor glorify the actions of the men who served.
