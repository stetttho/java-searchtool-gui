 ***WARNING - Nitpicking Plot points *** Again James Brady gives us a great story about Marines in action against unbelievable odds. Again, his book will probably disappoint military history buffs due to bad editing. Though I loved the story of Captain Port and his ad-hoc group struggling to get out of China, as a military history buff, I couldn't get past some of the glaring inaccuracies. Marine Officers' swords have never been strong enough to behead a man with one chop. Marine Infantry units didn't carry flamethrowers until well into 1943. Even fanatical 1st Sergeants will set aside uniform regulations to take care of their Marines. His intercepted radio reports talked about things happening in the weeks following Pearl Harbor that didn't really occur until well into 1942. Am I nitpicking? Probably. But if you're going to write a piece of historical fiction, then its crucial to get the facts straight. Even though its a great story, it lacks credibility because of these holes. I enjoyed reading it except when these errors popped up. Great story for people who want to root on the good guys. Not so good for military history buffs. Try reading the first novel in "The Corps" series by WEB Griffin instead.
