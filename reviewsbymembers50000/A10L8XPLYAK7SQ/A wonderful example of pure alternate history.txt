 Too many alternate history stories focus on some sort of alien intervention, unusual manipulations of space/time, or some other improbable or unbelieveable event. Though many of them are very entertaining, they don't reach the level of this work from Flint (I do love 1632 and 1633!).  The best "what if" stories involve one small, seemingly insignificant event that occurs differently. Here we have Sam Houston not suffering an injury in battle. Seems harmless enough, but that one event having another outcome might have changed the course of history.  Flint's work is obviously well researched and involves accurate historical figures as well as fictional characters based on historical research and could easily be real. This book is a great addition to the genre and brings readers to a period in time often overlooked by history classes and which more Americans should learn about.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to play "what if" with history.
