 I absoluetly loved this book. So very realistic and compelling. The  characters, both human and minervan, are engaging and well devloped. The  story could very easily be considered both alternate history or straight  sci-fi. This book has been overlooked by many sci-fi fans by Turtledove's  more well-known books. That to me is a shame. I would love to see a sequel  to this book to see how Earth and Minerva grow together and how each  affects the other's societies. Read this book once and then read it  again. You will enjoy it from cover to cover. This book is proof that Harry  Trutledoveis one of the masters of Sci-fi/Alternate History.
