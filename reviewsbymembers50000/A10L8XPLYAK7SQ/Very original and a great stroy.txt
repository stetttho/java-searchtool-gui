 One word of advice. Before you begin reading this book, go to the back and read the Appendices. They will give you enough of the backstory to enjoy the book a little more. It was a little difficult trying to imagine all of the historical changes that had happened to be able to follow this alternate timeline but once I read the appendices, the story was much easier to follow. Stirling has once again written a very original story and created a vibrant world with very believable characters and events.
