 I had very high hopes for this book. For one, I was very impressed by "The Coldest War". Brady did an excellent job capturing what life must have been like during Korea. But... This book does vividly describes the "Amphibious Landing in Reverse" (As many Marines refer to it) and what the Marines and soldiers went through in their fighting withdrawal. The book breaks down in a simple way...too much repetition. Too many times we read about a letter Verity writes to his daughter with the explanation that "Madame will read it to her". Too many times we read the phrase "trudging on frozen feet" and how many times can he tell us that "The Chinese who were wounded were left to die"? There are so many repetitions in this its pretty clear that the editor either wansn't up to par or didn't care enough to point these out. Did I mention that it was repetitous? Fortunately, I purchased this book in electronic format for my ebook and I won't feel guilty about having it take up space in my bookcase because I hate throwing books away, wouldn't really recommend it to anyone, and can simply delete it with a clear conscience. If you want to read about the Chosin campaign, I strongly suggest you read "Breakout: The Chosin Reservoir Campaign, Korea 1950" by Martin Russ or "Colder Than Hell : A Marine Rifle Company at Chosin Reservoir" by Joseph R. Owen. Both are much better than this and are more factual (being non-fiction and all). Kudos to Brady for trying to tell this story in this fashion, but get a new editor and buy a new thesaurus.
