 Huebner wrote this story in very vivid detail but at times it is very  difficult to tell what is dialog and what is narration. Some of the scenes  in this book are very graphic and bloody. So much so at some points, it  seemed excessive. Huebner managed to avoid falling into cliches but did get  repetetive in describing similar characters, scenes and events. Overall I  really enjoyed this book but I wish it would have been a little easier to  follow. Not quite a page turner but good nonetheless.
