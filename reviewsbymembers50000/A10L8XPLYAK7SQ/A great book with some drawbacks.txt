 I have been waiting for this book to come out since I finished the previous volume. I could not wait to see how things turn out and Turtledove  did not disappoint. I enjoyed the book from cover to cover but I have one  complaint. Did so MANY of the better characters have to be killed? I got  progressively depressed as person after person who I was rooting for get  killed off. Harry probably wanted to capture the horrors of war and present  that too us. In that he did really well. This book, like the rest in the  series, is very easy to follow and is so well thought out that it hardly  seems "Alternate".  Thanks Harry. I'm looking forward to the  next war.
