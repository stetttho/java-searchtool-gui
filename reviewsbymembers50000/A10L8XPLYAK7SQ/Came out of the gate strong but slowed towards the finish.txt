 I absolutely loved "Once a Hero" and "Rules of  Engagement" and could not wait to see what Esmay would do next.  Instead of climactic battles with the heroine we love, we get weak  political fighting, a rushed marriage, shocking revelations that are almost  too contrived and a fizzled ending. A disappointment at best but I still  read it all the way through. Now its on to the first 3 books in the Heris  Serrano series. If you're going to buy this one, find it in a used book  store.
