 This clearly is not the end of this series. I guess a lot of us were expecting it to be a trilogy but I think this is going to be an ongoing saga. All three of the books in this series are great. I have read each numerous times. One of the things I like best about this book was that there is more development of other characters. This has turned out not to be a book about Mike O'Neal, not that it would be bad if it were, but this book allows us to explore more of the characters that make these books great. Ringo clearly wants to go further with this series. It is such a complex world he has created and I look forward to the next installment to see what else he has up his sleeve.
