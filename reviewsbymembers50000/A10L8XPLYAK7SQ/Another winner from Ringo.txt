 I love John Ringo. It's as plain as that. Having read and re-read "A Hymn Before Battle" and "Gust Front" I eagerly purchased this collaboration between Ringo and another wondeful author, David Weber.  I was not disappointed. The story of Prince Roger and his Marine guards is well-written and keeps up a good pace. This new universe is full of imainative characters and creatures and is sure to please many sci-fi fans. Ringo is clearly one of the best new authors to come along in a number of years. I can't wait to read the next one.
