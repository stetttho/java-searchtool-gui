 I picked this book up as a last-minute purchase before getting on a plane. By the time I landed, I was so into the book that I sat at my arrival gate for 30 minutes so I could keep reading the book. Not only does Bradley tell  the story of the battle for Iwo Jima, he tells how each of the flag raiser  came to be on the island, how they grew up, how they lived and how they  died. A tragic story but one that will touch any Marine or Corpsman.
