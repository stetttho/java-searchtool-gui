 Oh my [...] Gosh. This is the book I have been looking for for MONTHS! I'm student teaching very soon and I have been seeking a book to help me with all the practical things that are taboo in University education classrooms. This book will be my bible when I student teach. I have had it for a few weeks and its already bookmarked, highlighted, and showing signs of wear. I can't believe how helpful this book has been. I have recommended this to every Teacher Candidate I speak to. If you are now or will shortly be a rookie teacher.... BUY THIS BOOK!
