 I consider myself to be a huge Harry Trutledove fan. I have read most of his books and have devoured the Worldwar, Colonization and The Great War series. As soon as this book was available I rushed out to buy it.  While it wasn't a complete disappointment on its own, it will be if this is the end of the series. A better title for this book would have been "The Ginger War". So much time was spent on various ginger smuggling and tasting that it grew tiresome very quickly. (does ANYONE stay in a Lizard jail once arrested?) Over all it seems as if this might be another bridge to a new Worldwar/Colonization series which hopefully will bring us forward a couple more decades and will bring the true conclusion to this series. As it stands now, there is just too much left hanging. The few interesting sub-plots were just overhwelmed by all the ginger crap. If there will be a new book after this, I suggest you wait until it comes out, buy this one in paperback (it is a fairly quick read; you'll end up skimming much of it) and then pick up with the new books. I love ya Harry, love the books, but was disappointed with this one.
