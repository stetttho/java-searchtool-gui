 If you only need a general resource for looking up countries, cities and  such, this book will do just fine. If you need specific information about a  continent or region, find a more detailed book dedicated to that area. In  most cases the lat/long of places was fairly accurate but many of the  things I needed to refer to needed a finer coordinate. It also will go out  of date fairly qucikly with the fast changing political climates of some  areas. Great for stable areas, well developed countries, large to medium  cities but not very effective beyond that.
