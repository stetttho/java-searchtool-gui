 Being an avid ebook fan has its advantages. I have read the 1st 3/4ths of this book and let me tell you, John Ringo has a fan for life if he keeps this up. The thing I liked most was that he did not focus on the hero of the 1st book. Most authors would have, but Ringo decided to expand his story and introduces us to new characters along with some survivors from "A Hymn Before Battle." Ringo kicks up the pace from the 1st book and maintains its amazing realism. Earth has been invaded. Even though its a tired one, the cliche "You can't stop someone who knows their right and keeps on coming" is very apt for this book. Earth's defenders come together to fight the invading Polsleen in a story rich with courage, sacrifice, honor and a little intrigue. Very well written and difficult to put down. There are times when I feel these books should be categorized as Alternate History instead of straight sci-fi. Once this book is released by Baen in its entirety you can bet that I will re-read the entire thing. Rarely have I had such anticipation for a book to be released. Keep up the good work Mr. Ringo, I'm hooked.
