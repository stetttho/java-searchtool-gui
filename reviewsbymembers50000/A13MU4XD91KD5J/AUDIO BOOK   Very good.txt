 This is a very well written and well read book on tape.  The authors tell you a brief description of each of the American presidents from Washington to Clinton.  Because there is a lot of material to cover in four cassette tapes, it is a BRIEF summary of each president's term in office.  At the same time, it is a fascinating story that analyzes and draws parallels between presidents who served decades or centuries apart.  Instead of going chronologically through each presidency, the authors have broken it down into several chapters.  Each chapter has a theme such as accidental presidents - or vice-presidents who became president after an assassination or unexpected death.  Then each of the presidents who fit in that category are described in that chapter.  It was very easy to follow and very interesting to hear the parallels between presidents so many years apart.  Because it is a brief history of each president, you will find many places where you can stop the tape and come back to it again later.  It's not an action story though, so it might not keep you awake if you are driving late at night.  I mostly listened to it during daylight driving hours when I didn't need the radio to help keep me awake.
