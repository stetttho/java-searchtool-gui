 I rank this book ALMOST as good as The Killer Angels, and right up there with Gods and Generals and The Last Full Measure.  Nevin did an excellent job of making a page-turner novel based on a segment of American history  that I think most Americans don't know much about.  I've lent the book out  to friends who have also loved it.
