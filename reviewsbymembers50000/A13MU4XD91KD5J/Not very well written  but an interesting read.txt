 Overall I enjoyed reading this book in order to learn more about the Mexican War.  The chapters are short so it was easy to read a chapter each night before going to sleep.  It's very well documented with endnotes to  the sources he used.   I had two problems with this book.  First, it needs  more maps.  There are a few maps spread throughout the book, but there are  long stretches where he tries to describe in words the geography and the  troop locations without the assistance of a simple map.  I bookmarked one  map in the middle of the book which was a pretty good overview of Mexico,  and I kept flipping back to that map to get a sense for where things were.   His explanations of the tactical and operational level of the war would  have been much better with more maps.  (Have an atlas handy when you read  it).     Second, his writing style in this book is choppy.  While it IS  interesting to read about where the lieutenants of the Mexican War went on  to command and / or death in the Civil War, Henry makes it difficult to  follow because he takes mid-sentence tangents to tell what would happen  twenty years later in Virginia.  After you read the tangent, you need to go  back and reread the beginning of the sentence to figure out what he was  talking about in the Mexican War context.     These were minor frustrations  though.  Like I said, overall I enjoyed reading the book and learned a lot  about the Mexican War from it.
