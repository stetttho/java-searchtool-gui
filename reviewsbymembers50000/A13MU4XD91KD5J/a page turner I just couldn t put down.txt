 I agree with Steve Clark's review of this book.  It was an excellent book to read.  Like Steve wrote, I agree that a Parrish family tree and a few maps would have helped, but still...  My wife first got me into historically-based fiction with Jeff Shaara's Gods and Generals and then David Nevin's 1812.  I was really excited when she got me this book that was not only historically-based fiction, but also NAVY oriented! 8-) Martin has an excellent writing style.  The only thing that I didn't like about the book was I thought it was too short.  I enjoyed it so much I wanted the chapters to be longer...  Each chapter would have made a really good book I think.  Anyway, if you are a lover of naval history and or historically based fiction, then this is a must-read for you.
