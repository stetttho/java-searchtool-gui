 I listened to this book on tape while driving across country and I REALLY enjoyed it.  A very fascinating story, and it was very well read on tape.  I also thought it was neat that they had audio clips of Truman's actual  speeches in the book on tape.  From what I have "learned" so far  in my education, I think the book is accurate.  The book has many wonderful  anecdotes about Truman.
