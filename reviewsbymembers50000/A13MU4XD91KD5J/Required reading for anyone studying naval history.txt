 I read this book as a midshipman in my efforts toward professional development as a future naval officer.  This is an EXCELLENT book.  Admiral Woodward provides insight into some very important lessons learned from the  Falklands War - the first time the Royal Navy went to war since WWII and  using weapons systems that had not been tested in battle and the first war  in the age of instant satellite news networks.  I couldn't put the book  down.
