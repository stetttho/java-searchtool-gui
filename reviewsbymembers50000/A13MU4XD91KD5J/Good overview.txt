 I agree with unambiguo's assessment of this book, although I think unambiguo might have graded it a little harshly.  If you are even somewhat knowledgable about the UN, you will find errors of ommission or oversimplification in this book.  As a result, I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is really interested in learning about the UN.  However, for someone who is familiar with the UN, I found the book pretty humorous.  I would suggest an alternative title of this book be, "The Lighter Side of the UN," because I am afraid a beginner reading this book to really learn about the UN might be misled.
