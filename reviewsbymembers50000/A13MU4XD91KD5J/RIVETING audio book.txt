 I listened to this book on tape while driving across country, and I didn't even notice the hours or the miles flying by because this book was SO good.  I didn't have to stop and stretch or use the rest areas.  You can read the other reviews for the contents of the book itself, but if you are looking for a book on tape to listen to - I HIGHLY recommend Ghost Soldiers.  It's a well-written book and it's very well read on the tape.  My only caution would be to have some kleenex handy for the end of the book.  After I listened to the book on tape, I took a look at the hardcover book in the store just to see the pictures and the maps, but I was able to follow everything in the story without them.
