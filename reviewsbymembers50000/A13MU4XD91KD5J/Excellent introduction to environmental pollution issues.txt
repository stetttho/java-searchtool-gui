 This was a text book for my Environmental Security class.  I learned a heckuva lot, and I really enjoyed reading it, too.  It's well organized and helps you understand some technical issues relating to the environment without going over the non-technical major's head.  The study/homework questions at the end of each chapter weren't too difficult and helped a lot in learning the material.
