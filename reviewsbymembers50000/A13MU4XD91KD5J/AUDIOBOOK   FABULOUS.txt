 I love listening to books on tape, so I like to look for reviews by people who have LISTENED to the book on tape because it's a fundamentally different review than just the book itself. As far as the content of the book, you can review the other readers' reviews.  This audiobook was top notch!  Well written and read with great skill on tape.  The reader has an excellent range of voices, accents, and dialects to use for each of the different characters in the book.  It didn't matter if a couple of days passed in between listening to parts of the book.  As soon as I pushed [play], I could tell which character was speaking based on the voice.  I also liked that they played a short segment of music at the beginning and ending of each side of each tape so you could tell when the side was over - not a BIG deal, but a detail that shows how much effort the producers put into making this a good book on tape to listen to.  It's a fascinating story of a very critical time in American history, and I would highly recommend the AUDIOBOOK (and I'm sure the non-abridged print version is of equally high standards).
