 This book is extremely well written and very informative.  I picked it up as a reference for a term paper, and initially I read just the section pertaining to the term paper.  Whenever I opened it to read a passage for the term paper though, I found that I just couldn't put the book down because it was so interesting.  While on Christmas vacation, I went back and read the rest of the book.       I rank this book right up there with Clay Blair's "Silent Victory," and I highly recommend it for anyone interested in learning more about the development of the American intelligence community at the highest levels of government.
