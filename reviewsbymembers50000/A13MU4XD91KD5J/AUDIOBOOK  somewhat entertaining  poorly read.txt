 I love listening to books on tape, so I like to look for reviews by people who have LISTENED to the book on tape because it's a fundamentally different review than just the book itself.  As far as the content of the book, you can review the other readers' reviews.   While this book was somewhat entertaining to listen to, the mispronunciations and cheesy voices the reader used made it almost unbearable.  Anyone who knows the slightest thing about the US Navy is familiar with Mk as the abbreviation for "Mark".  Everyplace in the book they talk about loading or shooting a Mk-48 torpedo, the reader says, "em-kay forty-eight," instead of "mark forty-eight".  It got on my nerves.  He also invents his own pronunciation of the GIUK gap.   It's difficult to keep track of which character is which because the reader has a very limited selection of voice impersonations.  Just about every character came across as some macho, gruff, deep-voiced and cussin' cowboy.  Luckily there were very few lines of dialogue by a woman.  I think the reader just spoke in his normal voice for those few lines, but it was hard to picture a woman saying the lines with his voice.   I agree with one of the other reviews I just read that said it didn't deserve any more than one star.  The plot was entertaining (at least I preferred listening to that tape than I did listening to the latest election news on the radio), but totally unrealistic and unbelievable.   If you are shopping for a book on tape to listen to, I recommend you skip this one and continue your shopping.
