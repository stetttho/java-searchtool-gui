 What a great story-teller.  I have listened to almost all of his books on tape and enjoyed every single one of them.  I almost feel like I know him as my own personal friend just from listening to him on his books on tape.   True Love was no exception.  When I saw it on the shelf I HAD to get it and  I wasn't disappointed.
