 I listened to this book on tape driving to and from school.  It's very interesting to listen to.  I was a little surprised how much time the author spent speculating about FDR's and Elanor's sexual relations (with  each other and with others), but there's a lot of good anecdotes.  It  bounces back and forth in time a bit, but it's not hard to follow what  period they are talking about.
