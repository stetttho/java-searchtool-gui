 I disagree with B. Borden's review of these books.  These three books are my three favoirte books of all time.  Killer Angels is absolutely the best.  The writing style in Gods and Generals seemed so close to the Killer  Angels that you would think it was the same author.  The books  cross-reference one another.  After reading Gods and Generals I had to read  Killer Angels again and it just FLOWED so smoothly!  The Last Full Measure  gave me a sense of closure by completing the saga.  I would probably give  The Last Full Measure 4 stars, not quite as much of a page-turner as Killer  Angels and Gods and Generals, but still VERY good reading.  (My wife makes  fun of me because I had a few teardrops roll down my cheeks reading the end  of The Last Full Measure).
