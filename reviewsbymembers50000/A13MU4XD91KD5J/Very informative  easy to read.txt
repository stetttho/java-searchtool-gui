 This book was an assigned reading for my International Law and Organizations class, and I was really pleased with it.  It's very interesting and easy to read (unlike a lot of other things we've been assigned to read).  This book covers the history of the UN's first fifty years, and it deals a lot with people and personalities.  Each chapter is about a crisis or event in the UN's history such as the 1967 Six-Day War, and each chapter is divided into much smaller sections of not more than a page, so it's easy to find places to stop reading, put the book down, and then be able to pick the book up again and continue reading without much effort in remembering where you left off.  The other book we were assigned for this class provided the nuts and bolts of how the UN was formed, how it is organized, what's in the charter, etc.  This book provided an excellent, practical view of how that organization and charter have been put to the test over the last fifty years.
