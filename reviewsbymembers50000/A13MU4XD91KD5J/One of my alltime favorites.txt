 My roommate and I were on our college sailing team when this first came out in the theater and we were mezmerized.  What a GREAT movie!  In that TV sitcom that Jennifer Grey is in now, she made a joke about what a bomb  "Wind" was and I winced.  The photography and the sailing in this  movie are just so awesome!  I echo everyone elses comments in that I can't  wait for it to come out on DVD SOMEDAY!
