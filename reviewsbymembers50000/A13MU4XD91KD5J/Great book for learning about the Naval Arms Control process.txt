 This is a very well written, easy to follow, and interesting book to read.  I read it and briefed my Maritime Strategy class on it at the Naval Postgraduate School, and I really enjoyed reading it.  It covers the Naval  Arms Control process through the Washington Conference, the Geneva  Conference, the 1930 and 1936 London Conferences, and it draws out some  very important implications those conferences had on the outcome of World  War II.  The only minor drawback to this book is that it focuses almost  exclusively on capital ships.  The author makes mention of the auxiliary  ships and submarines here and there, but pays little attention to the  underlying themes.  I don't recall reading anything about the British  persistence in seeking the abolition of submarines or the regulation of  submarine conduct that eventually came out in the 1936 London Proces-Verbal  (taken verbatim from Article 22 of the 1930 London Naval Treaty).      Overall, I think this is an excellent book for anyone who wants to learn  about arms race issues or the naval arms limitation conferences.
