 While I think the book itself was interesting, the reader on the audio version of this book was downright annoying.  The author read the introduction, and I think it would have been fine if he had read the entire book.  The guy who reads the rest of the book uses a really deep voice and tries to sound really profound and dramatic while reading passages that are very simple and require no drama whatsoever.  It reminded me of a Saturday Night Live skit where they mock America's Most Wanted and overly dramatize a really simple event.     Now, maybe they pronounced some military terms differently back in WWII, but the way the reader mispronounced things like "corpsman" (he says "corzman") really irritated me.   Please don't get me wrong - I'm not trying to detract from the amazing battle the Marines fought on Iwo Jima.  Yes, those who fought on Iwo Jima sacrificed a lot for our country and demonstrated incredible acts of heroism.  The author cites statistics such as the casualty percentages and number of medals given out which are staggering.  That was the interesting part of the book.  The life story of each of the six guys who raised the flag was rather mundane.  I would have been satisfied with one cassette about the landing and the battle over the island.  The extra three cassettes worth of talking about what ordinary average guys the flag raisers were I could do without.     My recommendation:  If you've got some time and nothing else better to read, then read the book, but don't waste your time with the audio version.
