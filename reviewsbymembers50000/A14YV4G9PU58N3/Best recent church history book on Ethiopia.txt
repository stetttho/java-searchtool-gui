 Hege's book is the best recent book available on the growth of an  Ethiopian Christian denomination.  It starts out with a strong focus on the  early work of expatriate Mennonite missionaries, but in its coverage of  later years, it shifts completely to a discussion of the Meserete Kristos  Church and its Ethiopian members. Hege's work is based on 1st hand  knowledge, archives, and pesonal interviews, including many Ethiopians.  This is a book written in a library from all 2nd hand sources. Just as  Gustav Aren's volume on the origins of the Mekane Yesus church is a widely  cited work for the late 19th and early 20th century, Hege's book will be a  primary source on certain aspects of Ethiopian church history in the second  half of the 20th century. Those who dislike Christian missionaries will  dislike the book, but not because it is poorly written. My problem is  that it is such a good book that nobody will return my copy to me.
