 I just met Mrs. Byrne's dictionary at the home of a linguist.  A houseful  of brilliant linguists, and almost none had heard of any of the words.  But  they laughed and enjoyed them tremendously.  Now I'm ordering a  copy. Though the author's intro says that all the words have been found  in at least one reputable dictionary, some of these appear to be nonce  words (no more established in use than a sniglet), while others are merely  obscure.  But both kinds are entertaining!
