 Dr. Amsalu Aklilu (AA) has produced this fine dictionary as a complement to the English-Amharic dictionary that he earlier produced together with Mosback. As a multilingual scholar, Amsalu brings broad knowledge and skills to the formidable task of lexicography.  And the results show his expertise.   The entries are all given in Ethiopic script, with a phonetic pronunciation guide.  This is followed by a brief definition (sadly, usually just one definition), and then various derived forms.  His many derived forms are a rich resource, distinguishing this dictionary from Leslau's. (Leslau's contains both English-Amharic and Amharic-English sections in one volume, so Leslau's still has a special status.) Leslau's is more readily available outside of Ethiopia, but if you want to work with Amharic and English, I suggest you buy AA's dictionary, also.
