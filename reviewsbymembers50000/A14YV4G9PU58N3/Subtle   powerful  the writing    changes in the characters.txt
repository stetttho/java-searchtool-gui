 My favorite by Goudge, by far.  She takes you there on a flying carpet of words so that you can see, smell and hear, visiting the homes and lives of the rich and weak, the poor and strong, the bitter, the loving, the young, the old, and helpless.  Central to it all is the Dean of the Cathedral, only now in his last year is he being truly changed under God's hand.  And his "watch" is a timepiece, but also his alloted time on duty.  Interesting things happen during his watch! There are characters we love, rejoice with, sigh for, and laugh at.  We see the joy of a little girl receiving a gift of a parasol (though the Dean's joy in giving it exceeds her joy in receiving).  But his wife, who has greater riches, does not rejoice in what she receives.  Though non-Anglicans may need a bit of help with certain terms and concepts, grab the book and enjoy.  Then share it with a friend, while you run off to get Goudge's Green Dolphin Street.
