 Kane's dictionary is a compilation of every Amharic dictionary available to him, both Amharic-foreign language dictionaries and Amharic monolingual dictionaries, including unpublished ms.   The entries include a large number of archaic terms, included for completeness, and probably useful for reading old writings, but not used in spoken Amharic.   It also includes a number of neologisms, new words/phrases coined to meet the needs of science and technology. It's expensive, it's massive, but for a serious scholar, it is invaluable.
