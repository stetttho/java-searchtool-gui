 Reading the English title, I bought the book thinking it would help me understand Tigrinya grammar.  It could be a very good grammar, but I can't tell.  If you know the Tigrinya language and want to study the grammar, then buy it.  If you don't know Tigrinya, then this book will not be very useful in helping you learn it. However, a thorough knowledge of Amharic will help you understand some of this book. The software forced me to rate it with stars, but I would have prefered not to do so since I can't read it. This is not a criticism of the contents of the book, only a warning to be aware of the language in which it is written.
