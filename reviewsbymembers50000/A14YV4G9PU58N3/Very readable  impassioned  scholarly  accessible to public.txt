 Crystal has done a difficult job well: he has produced a scholarly book about the "death" of languages that is readable by non-linguists, but also useful to linguists. "Language death" means that the last speakers of a language die, leaving nobody alive who knows and uses the language.   Just as many people are actively involved in preserving species from extinction, Crystal argues that preserving languages is also important.  He argues clearly and passionately for the value of every language, however small its population.  Each language is part of mankind's intellectual accomplishment; as we lose each language, we lose some of our collective humanity. I was disappointed that Crystal does not credit the work of missionaries in stimulating ethnic awareness and promoting literacy among many minority language groups, rather mentioning only cases where they have been detrimental to language use (though he does not document any such cases). The book is highly readable, the topic is timely, the price is reasonable: read the book.
