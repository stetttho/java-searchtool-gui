 It must be said at the outset, this dictionary is not different than the fine one produced by Amsalu Aklilu (AA). For those not acquainted with AA's dictionary, all entries are given in the traditional Ethiopian syllabary, with a phonetic pronunciation.  Entries are alphabetized in a way that treats vowels and consonants as equally important, different than Leslau's or Kane's dictionaries, where vowels are taken into account only if there are words that have the same consonants. The definitions are very brief and include very, very few secondary senses.   The book contains a number of entries not found in Leslau's dictionary.  Those who want to work with Amharic will benefit from having a dictionary produced by an Ethiopian, but if they already possess a copy of AA's, they will not want to duplicate their purchase by buying a copy of both this one.  If they do not have AA's yet (not readily available outside of Ethiopia), then this is a good choice.
