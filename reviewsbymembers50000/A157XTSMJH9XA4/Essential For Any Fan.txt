 Love the character of The Joker? Want detailed information on his long-lasting career in comic books? Want stories from various era's of his existence, ranging from the oldest to the more recent (oldest being 1940's and more recent being 1980's, by the way)? Well, instead of rushing to this year's Batman convention to chit-chat with a fellow devoted Joker-nerd, and instead of buying dozens of separate comic books, pick up The Greatest Joker Stories Ever Told. It's all you need! With some commentaries by the writers, plus a superb collection of fully illustrated comic book stories (which are the majority of the book), this is the perfect buy. A must-own!
