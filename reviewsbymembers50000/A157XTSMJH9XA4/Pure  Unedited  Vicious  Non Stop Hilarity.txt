 This is one of the funniest stand-up shows I've ever seen. Lisa Lampanelli -- the proclaimed "Queen Of Mean" -- keeps the jokes running at break-neck speed, with all of them being hilarious. Just be warned, she doesn't get the nickname for nothing. Amazon.com shows this DVD as rated PG. I have suspicions that is false information. There is plenty of adult language to go around, and the subject of most of her material is very racy for children. Not only is "Take It Like A Man" extremely questionable for young viewers, but undeniably questionable for the easily-offended. She has a great sense of humor, and the majority of it revolves around making fun of certain types of people. As her saying goes, "It is fun to make fun of everybody". She shoves it to white people, black people, gay people, hispanic people, christians, muslims, jews, and much more. If you are at all proud of who you are and can't take a joke, avoid Lisa Lampanelli! This is raw, mean humor, intended to bring us together by laughing at ourselves. A fine job she does at that. Just don't be taken by surprise when you find yourself laughing to death over completely politically incorrect jokes that are sure to make even the meanest of comedians blush.
