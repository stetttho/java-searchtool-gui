 Simply put, Elseworlds graphic novels take familiar comic book characters and place them in altered realities. Here, we have Batman and his diabolical enemy, The Joker, in "The Wild". The Wild is a place of sorcery and mystical legends. The "Dark Joker" is a maniacal wizard set out to obtain an ancient power and reign in all of his madness over the people. The "Bat-man" is a winged creature-like humanoid that, through his bloodline, is destined to protect The Wild from the Joker and his evil army of barbaric followers. And though the line between good and evil can at times be blurred, these foes are determined to do what they've come to accomplish.   Elseworlds comics are obviously a lot of fun, as pretty much every rule is thrown out the window and the only limit is the writer's and artist's imagination. While I don't believe Batman: Dark Joker - The Wild is even as good as most normal Batman vs Joker stories set in the classic Gotham City, I do believe that it stands well on its own as quite an interesting piece of work. It takes everything we love about the two characters and warps it into a gruesome yet often times poetic story. Through both the writing and the artwork, there seems to be an underlying beauty beneath the brutality. It's not extremely hard to follow, but the graphic violence and dark themes are certainly unsuitable for children. And that's one thing that really drives it home. No mercy. This is a pure, to-the-core battle between two iconic characters in a world full of a strange yet engaging atmosphere. All in all, it's definitely worth a purchase for any true fan of Batman and/or the Joker.
