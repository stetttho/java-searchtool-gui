 Repulsion is a Polanski classic. The story is not overly complex: Carol, a young woman who has a repulsion to sexuality and especially men, is left alone in her sister's apartment for a couple of days. As a result, Carol's head begins playing tricks on her when her paranoia of men and rape grows unbareable. She resorts to quite drastic actions when hallucinations plague her life, having no choice but to let the madness take over.  Polanski delivers a very decent suspense/horror/thriller flick with this, but for a frequent viewer of these types of films, I did not find it to be extremely scary or creepy. While there is one part where I jumped out of my seat, Repulsion is more interesting than frightening. The key to this film's horror is undoubtably it's sense of dread, fear, solitude, and the sheer spookiness of the unknown that such a disturbed mind can create. The viewer is drawn into the tiny and twisted world of Carol, and is forced to observe the chaos unfolding for this unfortunate story. By the end of the film, the line between reality and fantasy is quite a blurred one. The ending does not try to be something of an enormously clever twist, but rather puts the final piece of the puzzle on the story. The last shot of the movie is a somewhat confusing image as far as what it means (those who've seen it know what I'm talking about). The viewer is left to come up with their own take on how all of this happened and what that last shot had to do with it.  Although I don't believe Repulsion is a very deep movie, I also don't believe it is a simple way to pass the time and enjoy a fright or two. I believe Polanski has given the audience something beyond any common cinematic analysis. Here, we are treated to something rare: a true experience.
