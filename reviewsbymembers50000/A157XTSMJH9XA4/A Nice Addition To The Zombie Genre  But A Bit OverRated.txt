 Plot: When toxic chemicals that reanimate dead bodies are accidentally pumped into the air, contaminating the rain (which soaks a graveyard), corpses come back to life and seek living victims. A small group of people must try to fight them off. But as the number of dead bodies grow, it seems that this is, in many ways, the end. How long can these humans survive before becoming just another pile of "braaaaaaaaains"?  The Negatives: I had expected The Return Of the Living Dead to be a zombie flick that was so silly it could be considered a comedy (like a "black comedy", as most people would refer to it). However, although there is an obvious lack of seriousness, I felt that there wasn't really anything to separate it from any other cheesy zombie flick. It wasn't quite silly enough to be a comedy, yet wasn't frightening enough to be considered horror. I had a few small laughs, but for the most part, there really wasn't that much fun poked at the living dead and the movies that feature them.   The Positives: The question might be, "If not humor, then maybe outrageous gore or some good 'ol zombie action would make this film worth watching?" Well, there isn't a whole lot of gore, but there are some pretty nifty corpses. Not only do we see the average mutilated bodies to make up the walking dead, but also a few gooey skeleton monsters that are, sadly, rarely seen in movies anymore. This would probably be the main reason to see this -- a few good corny zombie scenes. Another positive aspect is, believe it or not, a surprise ending! It may not be the most clever one in the world, but I sure didn't see it coming.   To make a long review short, most zombie fans have seen much worse movies than this. The Return Of The Living Dead is worth a look for any living dead fan, but I'd still strongly advise a rental before purchase. Three and a half stars for some good ol cheesy fun, nonetheless.
