 Sent on a rescue mission into the jungles of South America, Arnold Schwarzenegger and his group of commandos encounter another visitor among the trees -- and it's not human. The vicious hunter from space slaughters the group one by one, eventually having Arnie as the last living human in the vast jungle of death. But to the creature's surprise, this particular man is going to be much more difficult to destroy!  Predator is as much of an action film as it is a sci-fi film. Before the extraterrstrial is fully introduced, there are a few military shoot-em-up scenes to satify any action-film fan. Then, without warning, one of history's greatest movie-monsters rips it's way into the plot. The story is very well paced, and the superb acting, editing, cinematography, and score push it even further. Regardless, the greatest aspect of the film is undeniably the predator itself. Neat gadgets (including numerous weapons and a cloaking device) show the surprising intelligence of the creature. The pure savagery and barbaric appeal it has really puts fear in the viewer! It's facial features are indeed terrifying, the body-suit and costume used are extremely realistic, and in the simplest of terms, the predator is the coolest monster ever to appear on screen. This is a masterpiece in every way. Predator is a must-see for any action fan, monster fan, and even horror fan. An untouchable classic!
