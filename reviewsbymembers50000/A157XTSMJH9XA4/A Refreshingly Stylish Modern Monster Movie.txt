 Basic Plot: When a brother and sister driving along a desolate desert road witness what appears to be a man dumping corpses down a chute in the ground, they attempt to investigate. What they find is a horrific surprise. But even after they flee in terror from the hellish scene, the mysterious man catches up with them. They soon find themselves out in the middle of nowhere with their only company as a few locals and the baffled small-town police. There is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. Before long, they discover the vicious predator isn't even human. And, to put the icing on the dreadful cake, the answers of why it is here and what it wants are revealed!  Few modern-day horror films include original, interesting, and iconic monsters. Well, Jeepers Creepers does! Although a superb cast and talented crew contribute to the greatness, the best part about it is the creature itself. Despite a few scenes (that are actually so realistic you can't tell CGI is used), the monster is the product of a very believeable full-body-suit, not cheap computer tricks. Before the inhuman identity is revealed of The Creeper, it's wardrobe is eye-poppingly awesome. Like the darkest of the darkest superheros, his long trench-coat flaps in the wind and his rugged hat shades his evil face. Like some kind of demon-cowboy, he's intimidating to the characters, yet mesmerizing to the audience. Eventually, of course, the clothing comes off and one hell of a creature is presented. I won't give a description of that -- you've got to see it for yourself. All I can say is that monster fans will not be disappointed!  In short conclusion, this is a great comeback for the old-fashioned creature flicks. It's not very scary, but it's a whole lot of fun! Jeepers Creepers excludes over-the-top gore and sexuality, trading in another cliche storyline for an unforgettable experience of pure monster mayhem.
