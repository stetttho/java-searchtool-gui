 Sparing you a briefing of the weak and equally useless plot, "Creature Unknown" is one of those direct-to-DVD horror flicks that are more fun than they are scary. The reason it's worth three stars is the monster. Ignoring the recent craze of CGI, the crew created a full-body suit for the actor playing the creature -- and the hard work certainly payed off. The costume is very realistic and keeps the viewer interested. But, sadly, that's all there is to this movie. The only reason you should rent "Creature Unknown" is if you're a monster fan who enjoys the simple pleasure of seeing a murderous creature rip apart naive teenagers (including decapitations and gut-slashing). Not to mention, decent special features such as bloopers, a documentary on the film, and a documentary on the creature.
