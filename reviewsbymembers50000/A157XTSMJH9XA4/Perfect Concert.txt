 It may only last a little under twenty minutes, but this concert is worth every penny. This is live footage (black and white, by the way) of The Cramps performing at the Napa State Mental Hospital. Of course, the interest here should be more focused on the raw rocking energy flowing from the band, rather than the patients allowed on tape. Don't expect to witness a disrespect to the severely mentally ill on camera -- any patients incoherent enough to cause harm or deeply embarrass themselves were not allowed to attend the concert. On the other hand, there are a few patients who aren't afraid to show their abnormal behavior (yeah, you'll know 'em when you see 'em). As the other reviews point out, there is a woman who can't resist grabbing the microphone and screaming into it, but Lex keeps his cool and interacts with the more out-going patients quite gracefully. In the midst of all the madness (excuse the pun), there are eight songs played to the fullest by easily one of the best rockabilly/psychobilly (whatever you want to call them) bands ever. Seeing it/hearing it live is much better than any album can give you. Forget the tameness that might occur in a recording studio. The band delivers an amazing performance here that makes you feel like you're there! The special features, although, are nothing to brag about. There is some short concert footage of other bands, but for the most part you are tortured with scenes that don't even belong on a home video, much less a mass-market DVD. For instance, there is footage (I guess it's supposed to be "art") of a man jangling around metal objects (such as pots, pans, and garbage) for what seems like an eternity (really, I think it lasts for twenty minutes or so). So trust me, the special features are nothing to become excited about. The true glory here is the concert. And if you like punk/primitive rockabilly music, then you must buy this. Wonderful footage.
