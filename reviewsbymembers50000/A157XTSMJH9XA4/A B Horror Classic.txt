 House By The Cemetery is another fine film that is often missed among horror lovers. While it's not a masterpiece, it is a very satisfying killer flick.  Trimming down the movie's plot to it's essentials, HBTC presents the story of the horrifying legend of a man, Dr. Freudstein, who has been living in the basement of a creepy house for many years -- surviving off of the cells of living humans he captures. The Boyle family, who've just moved into the house, are the most recent unlucky bunch to meet the zombie Doctor and face his diabolical intentions. Will they escape? Or will they just become a few more bodies in Freudstein's mass grave of a laboratory?  Fulci attempts to throw in a little "twist" for the ending, and I suppose he succeeds, even though I, for one, was a little confused by the ending. It seems interesting, but the meaning of it is not too clear. Nonetheless, you can be assured that even if you miss any underlying cleverness, you should still be able to enjoy this good old-fashioned piece of horror. The only complaint I have is of the english overdubs. I warn you: the vocal actors are horrible. But hopefully you can ignore it and only use it as hate for the victims. Mwahahahaha...
