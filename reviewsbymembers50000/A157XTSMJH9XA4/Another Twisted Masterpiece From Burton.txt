 Here's the plot of 1988's "Beetlejuice", significantly simplified: A young couple who've recently died find that another family is moving into their house. They must haunt their home and drive the family away, but find it nearly impossible to do. So, new to the afterlife and oblivious to the danger involved, they seek assistance from the kooky bio-exorcist Beetlejuice to help them freak the new family out. But the spirit realm's menace of a ghost has some choatic plans of his own.  As for some of the cast and crew:  Tim Burton as a director has almost always succeeded in delivering spectacular films, and this is no exception. His strange visual style is mesmerizing as usual. Danny Elfman's theme (as well as the rest of the score) is brilliant. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin were obviously great choices as the recently deceased couple. Catherine O'Hara and Jefferey Jones fit quite well as the parents of the invading family, with their goth-daughter played by the heavenly Winona Ryder. And, last but not least, the character of Beetlejuice is portrayed perfectly by Michael Keaton.  And for my personal opinion:  Keaton stole the show, no doubt about it. I think the main reason anyone should see this is for the whacky charismatic character of Beetlejuice. From some of the best one-liners you'll ever hear, to the nutty antics he applies to practically everything he does, he's one of the greatest characters ever to grace the screen. Superbly supported by an extensive cast and crew that knew what they were doing and everything that was needed for a classic comedy of twisted themes, there is no denying the power of such a film. This is a must-see for sure (and for most, a must-own).
