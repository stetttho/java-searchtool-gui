 I am a fan of many styles of music, but ordering a CD of gregorian chant was a stretch for me. This is my first album of the genre, but I'm certainly not disappointed! Lost In Meditation: Meditative Gregorian Chants Volume One is everything you'd expect it to be. With gregorian chant music, there never seems to be too much diversity in the songs. This is because you shouldn't buy the music as if it were your favorite band -- it is completely atmospheric music. Whether used for meditation, background music to everyday activities, or a soundtrack to a much needed relaxation session in your solitude, gregorian chant is a peaceful and almost heavenly way to enjoy some time off in another world (often in a world where you can't help but imagine monks shifting through the humble rooms of a monastery). This particular selection of chants is perfect for the genre as far as I'm concerned. It is an all men choir, and the vocals are in perfect harmony. The recording quality is excellent, with just the right amount of reverb to bring the singing to life. For any fan of gregorian chant, or for anyone newly interested in it, this is a great CD to satisfy your chanting needs. And with a price like this for 21 tracks, you can't go wrong!
