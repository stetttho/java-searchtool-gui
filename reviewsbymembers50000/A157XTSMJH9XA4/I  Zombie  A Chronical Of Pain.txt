 Basic Plot: The main character is hiking in an unknown area when he is bitten by a strange and obviously very ill young woman. He is forced into the lifestyle of a hermit when physical and mental decay sets in, as well as a strong urge to kill others and eat their bodies.  With a decent amount of gore (including a few scenes that'll definitely make you squirm), above-average acting for a low-budget B-movie, and an undeniably original and fresh concept for a zombie flick, "I Zombie" certainly deserves a rental. A purchase, on the other hand, you should think twice about. I found the storyline to be a bit tedious and the overall feel of the film to be very amature (which I suppose could be a good thing for some B-fans, but this was almost student-film level). It's irresistible to any zombie fan such as myself, and I'm glad I saw it. Originality is very intriguing to any viewer, and this certainly has that. But it doesn't have much more to separate from any other straight-to-DVD horror flick. And who says that's a bad thing?
