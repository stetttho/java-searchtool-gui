 This, while somewhat clever in it's climax, is not a film of too much complexity. The plot is quite simple:  Dr. Martin arrives at the small asylum where he plans to begin his psychiatric work. His qualifications may be impressive, but all the interviewer insists he do to get the job is decide which one of the patients is the previous Dr. Starr. Here, the madness begins. Along with Dr. Martin and his tour guide Max, you hear the four patients tell their stories (don't worry, they don't verbally narrate it all the way through -- it's acted out). A woman who has witnessed a dismembered body come back for revenge, a man whose suit gave life to a dummy, a girl with a bad side named Lucy, and a man who wills his soul into his home-made robots make up these stories that cover the majority of the film. After he's heard the stories, Dr. Martin insists that the rules of his employment are absurd and does not want to guess which patient is the former doctor. But shortly after, whether he likes it or not, he discovers who the mysertious Dr. Starr is, and all hell breaks loose.  The Asylum is quite a satisfying treat of a film. The ending is truly unpredictable (for most people, anyway), and a decently creepy collection of madness and murder makes it worth viewing again and again. Certainly worth the money.
