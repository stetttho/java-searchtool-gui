 This album -- their first album -- is, in my opinion, essential for any lover of 60's punk/rock and roll. The Kinks were a wonderful poprock band that had a bit more edge than The Beatles. Their music mainly consisted of slightly overdriven guitars, primitive drumming, fine adaptive bass lines, and vocals that are less confined than other bands of this era and more energetic. Yet I must warn you, this is not exclusively the "harder" material by The Kinks. While you'll get rockers like "All Day And All Of The Night", you will find that most of the songs are more melodic and even hillbilly-ish. The Kinks did a fine job at not only early hard rock/punk music, but also rockabilly and poprock music. Still, in the end, I find this album quite satisfying. Within time, there will be few songs you'll skip while jammin' out to these somehow missed 60's tunes by the band that was equally under rated, The Kinks.
