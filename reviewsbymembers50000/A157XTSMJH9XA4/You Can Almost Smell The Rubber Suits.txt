 (NOTE: this review is NOT for the "50th Anniversary Edition", rather the cheaper of the two available on Amazon)  Simplified Plot: The year is 1999, and a group of space aliens (women wrapped in aluminum-foil, basically) intend to dominate the Earth. They have gained control over the gigantic monsters of MonsterLand (an isolated island used to observe them safely) and have set them loose upon our cities to wreak havoc. The humans race is in definite danger, but what can we do? Can Godzilla and the others ever brake away from this spell? Will we survive this massive attack governed by these other-worldly enemies? It seems like hope is in sight when we temporarily break the diabolical spell over the towering creatures, but then the aliens unleash their secret weapon: King Ghidorah! It's now an all-out battle between the monsters! Who will win? The humans? The aliens? The monsters!?  For those curious, here are the included monsters (by their original Toho names, anyway):  Godzilla  Mothra  Rodan Gorosaurus  Anguirus  Kumonga  Manda  Minilla  King Ghidorah  Baragon Varan   Now for my personal opinion... Some people have complained that the storyline focuses way too much on the human/alien struggle rather than the monsters. I completely agree. Despite a few screen shots of the mayhem unfolding in the cities, most of the beastie action takes place at the final battle scene -- where they all end up side by side to defeat Ghidorah. Indeed this scene is spectacular, but can one scene make a movie worth purchasing? After all, most of the film is a bore-fest where the humans are trying to figure out what the aliens are doing (and eventually, how they can stop them). Well, the reason to buy this is simple -- probably the same reason you're reading these reviews. As long as you're a fan of the cheesy rubber-suited creatures of old cinema, Destroy All Monsters is a way to enjoy the child-like fun of seeing your favorite Japanese monsters all in one movie, and essentially all in one battle. As long as you don't mind the stinky storyline and the lack of constant action, this should make a great addition to your DVD collection if only for the last big fight.        As for this particular DVD edition, that's where the trouble comes in. Let it be known that there is no menu page, so chapter-skipping is not an option (not even with the chapter skipping button! what the heck?). So basically you're buying a VHS that doesn't have to be rewinded after each viewing. Also, for those who've read about the bonus soundtrack CD, it's not included with this edition. The print and audio are fairly decent, yet it's these little things that make you think twice about owning this particular DVD edition.  In conclusion, Destroy All Monsters is a great movie for any lover of giant monsters flicks -- especially lovers of Godzilla and his legendary foes. It is the reason I gave four out of five stars. I just don't think the cheaper DVD is a very good buy, even for somebody that doesn't mind bare-bones DVDs. Still, even after knowing the negative aspects from other reviewers, I ordered this and can't say I'm disappointed. Just be warned, if you don't like crappy DVD's, you might want to consider buying the "50th Anniversary Edition", even though it's a bit more expensive. It's probably worth it.
