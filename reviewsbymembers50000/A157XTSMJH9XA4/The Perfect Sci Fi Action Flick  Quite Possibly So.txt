 Plot: A cyborg from the 2029 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has arrived in the present (which, for the sake of the film, is 1984). In this near future, machines are rising to near domination over humans. The reason he has been sent back in time? To terminate. You see, in this seemingly hopeless future, there will be a man who is capable of leading an army that conquers the machines. The cyborg must terminate the mother of that child -- Sarah Connor. Also sent back in time is the "good guy" of the story -- Reese. Reese has been sent ot protect Sarah from the cyborg, to be sure the child is eventually born. But, even with Sarah's natural determination to live and Reese's passion for his duty, the incredibly advanced humanoid machine will be one tough cookie to beat! Can they terminate the terminator? Will our future ever be safe from the rise of the machines?   A wonderful storyline, a heart-pounding score, great direction by James Cameron, and an overall grim feeling of futuristic mayhem are just a few of the aspects of The Terminator that make it a scifi classic. Is it Schwarzenegger on screen with his mechanical brutality that attracts so many? Or maybe the terrifying ride along with Reese and Sarah trying to escape this madness? Maybe we'll never really know why this is such an amazing movie. Still, time and time again, nothing compares to the darkly action-packed experience of The Terminator forever frozen in time with your DVD copy. You don't really need a reason to love The Terminator, you only need the film itself!
