 Some people argue that Mortician is too simple, and take the "brutality" concept too far. Well, those people don't have to listen to this music! Yes, Mortician has never focused it's sights on the technical side of death metal music. But they have certainly given a select crowd exactly what they want: the heaviest music available. Mortician combines the primary aspects of death metal with the blast-beating feel of grindcore. While some of their songs contain a more hard-rock feel with the drums laying metal beats over the down-tuned guitar/bass and super low death-grunting/growling, most of the time -- at one point or another -- they just can't resist the brutality of blast-beats. This, along with the fact that they use too many film samples, is the only thing I might complain about when it comes to this wonderful band. Which brings me to my next point. On this album -- a 37-track feast of live recordings from 2000 to 2002 -- there are few samples before the songs. And those that do accompany the band as intros are much shorter than the album versions. This, combined with the number of songs and the fact that it is live, makes Zombie Massacre Live probably the best Mortician album available. Indeed a must-buy for any Mortician fan or metalhead who is interested in the band.  For those fans who are wondering, the line-up is: Will Rahmer on bass/vocals, Ron Kachnic on guitar, and Roger Beaujard on drums (yes, live drums on this album).
