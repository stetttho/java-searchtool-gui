 Who can argue? The Kinks were a great band. They mixed elements of rockabilly, early punk, and poprock to form one of the best sounds from the "British Invasion" era. Ray Davies was an excellent songwriter and the band always played to their fullest. For sure an underrated hit that lives on today and will probably continue to grace our speakers for years to come. They're truly a musical treat, and that's especially apparent with this early compilation album of some of their best work. While some stand out more than others, these are all keepers. It's one of those CDs that you pop in and don't bother to fool with. You just let it play and have a good time. That's what The Kinks are all about. Raw and energetic fun with plenty of catchy melodic appeal fit for any fan of 60's rock and roll. For anybody interested in this band, "Well Respected Kinks" is a must-own.
