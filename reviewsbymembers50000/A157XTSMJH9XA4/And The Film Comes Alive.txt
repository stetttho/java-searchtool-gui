 If you have seen "Session 9", then you know it feeds on the atmospheric effect that most movies exclude from their experience. One of the tools used to create such an atmosphere was the score. As a musician who enjoys writing "visual" music fit for scoring a film, I tend to take notice of the soundtracks/scores of films in pretty much every one I see. And boy did this one catch my attention! Not relying on orchestrated music or actual melodies to fit the film, Climax Golden Twins -- an experimental musical duo that happened to be chosen for Session 9 (and thank goodness they were) -- delivered quite a feeling through their eerie sound effects including white noise, scratches, and unintelligible synth-like warped instruments. Do not expect any "songs" from this album. You won't be playing these tracks Friday night with your Led Zepplin cover band at the bar. This CD is solely for your atmospheric pleasure. Much like the film itself, the "Session 9" soundtrack will place a feeling of unease in your stomach and a fear of the unknown surrounding your every move. Forget all of those ancient organs blasting and chains rattling, this is true horror in all of it's dread. Just don't listen to it alone in the dark, as you might not have enough courage to get up and turn the light back on. If you liked the movie, you should love this. And if you haven't seen the amazingly under rated psychological-creep-out thriller known as "Session 9", then order or rent the DVD as well!
