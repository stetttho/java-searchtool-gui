 Basic Plot: John Russel has lost his family (a wife and daughter) through an auto-accident. Torn apart yet determined to continue life, the pianist/composer moves away to a gigantic old house. But before long, he realizes he's not the only one inhabiting the fortress of creepiness. And, believe it or not, this ghost has a good reason for disturbing the peace.  The Changeling surprised me by using just as much (if not more) plot as it did horror. The horrors you'll experience in this film are usually more psychological than visually freaky -- although you will get your share of classic ghost-related images and sounds to help you along. I was expecting a fright-fest, yet instead found quite an interesting and well-constructed storyline. Overall, The Changeling is a great film to satisfy both of your horror needs: Some spooky haunting and an unraveling mystery.
