 ACDC is a band of iconic proportions, and it's easy to understand why. Especially with their now legendary album "Back In Black". You might be wondering if purchasing the whole album is worth it; if every song is just as good as the popular classics such as "Hells Bells", "Shoot To Thrill", "RocknRoll Ain't Noise Pollution", and the title track. Well let it be confirmed, my friends, from start to finish this album is a keeper! The energy never gives in, and the music rocks itself right off the rocker throughout the whole thing. And the louder it is, the better it sounds! ACDC is a prime example of how any musician can show off and steal the show, but it takes five great men like the ones found here to pull together and make an absolute symphony of headbangin' goodness that stands the test of time. "Back In Black" kicks the listener just as hard as it did in the 80's, and I have a feeling it doesn't plan on quiting any time soon. It's the kind of music you can't get out of your head -- and I mean that in a good way. So pop it in, crank it up, and let the wild spirit of rockroll surge through your soul!
