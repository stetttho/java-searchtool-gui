 "Unbreakable" was an intensely dramatic film with a brilliant storyline and conclusion that will stick with me for a long time. Yet there is one thing some people might overlook when viewing it: the score. As a musician/scorist (although not employed as one), I have great respect for people like James Newton Howard. He has delivered some amazing scores. And I would have to say this is possibly his best (in my opinion, of course). Opening with "Visions", you are taken back to the beginning of the movie. I can just imagine it in my head -- when the title "Unbreakable" hit the screen as that drum beat kicked in. Every bit of emotion in the film is brilliantly captured in the score. Orchestra and all, Howard brings the experience back to us. By the end of the album, you have witnessed the magic and emotional intensity of "Unbreakable" all over again. If you loved this film as I did, you'll love this. And if you haven't seen it, order or rent the DVD as well!
