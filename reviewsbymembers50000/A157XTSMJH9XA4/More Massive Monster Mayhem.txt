 Do you long for the old days when miniature replicas of cities would be destroyed by the rage of a man in a rubber suit? When huge monsters battled to the death, endangering all of mankind in the process? When a lone Japanese man would lay his eyes upon the sky in terror, screaming "Gojira"? Well, there's no need to fear, because Godzilla 2000 is here!   Even when we Americans butcher the character with horrendous CGI and weak attempts at a more horrifying King Of Monsters, the Japanese have stuck to their iconic sea-beast in all of it's glory. If you feel that craving for the cheesy experience only old 'Zilla flicks can bring you, don't think that they stopped in the 70's! The only difference here is the date of the film. We still get that tail-swinging, fire-breathing, building-smashing, road-stomping, monster-beating growler of a giant known as Godzilla. With great pride, the Japanese preserve this wonderful character persistantly through many films, and we're lucky enough to have them releaseed over here in the US. So, what are you waiting for? Experience the raw, corny terror of Godzillla 2000 today!
