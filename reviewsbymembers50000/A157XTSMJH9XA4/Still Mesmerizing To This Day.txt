 The Plot: Strange fossils have been discovered in the Amazon, which appear to be those of an unknown human/amphibian species. A small group of scientists undergo an expedition into the murky jungles and swamps to see if they can find anything else to benefit their research. What they find, however, is much more terrifying than fossils. It's the real thing! The living, breathing legend: the creature from the black lagoon!  Out of all of Universal's classic monsters from the pre-60's era, The Creature just might be the best. Unlike The Wolfman, Count Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, or The Mummy, The Creature isn't very passable as human-like. It lurks in the depths of it's lagoon, only to emerge on land when needed. It's body has two arms and two legs, yet is far from a modern-day man. It is supposed to be the missing link between man and fish (for those who believe in such an evolutionary process). And when these humans encounter it, horror is the only thing it brings out of the water with it! With unknown beings invading it's world, The Creature must protect itself and it's land. But this time, there's a weakness: the beautiful woman of the expedition crew. Mesmerized by her grace, The Creature is eventually taken advantage of when the humans are determined to kill it (after losing about half of their men). Indeed, it seems to die at the end, but a sequel (Revenge Of The Creature) assures us that there's very little you can do to keep this thing down! And why not keep the legend going? The monster itself would be just as effective if used in a modern-day movie. The costume is a perfect fit, and the actor portraying the gillman is superbly cast (technically, there are two actors: one for the underwater scenes, and one for the land scenes, but you get the idea). No monster fan can truly say he's seen the best in black'n'white cinema until he experiences the timeless creep-out fun in The Creature Of The Black Lagoon.
