 Although The Road Warrior is technically the 1981 sequel to 1979's Mad Max, it does quite well as a stand-alone film. The narrator explains the events of the first film at The Road Warrior's beginning. The world has been degraded to desert-stricken chaos, and "Mad" Max (Mel Gibson) is the road warrior, a lone traveler across the desolate roads. He has lost his family, and as a result lost most reason to live. He is a "shell of a man", as the narrator explains. All he knows is survival. And, seeking to prolong that survival, he is in search of the holiest of possessions in the post-apocalypstic world: gasoline. The only ones able to survive in the new world are those with the skills of the road, as all other are destroyed and robbed of what little they have -- especially the much needed fuel. Max runs into trouble in the form of a murderous gang that are determined to become the rulers of the wastelands, lead by the barbaric Humungus. The gang's most recent plans are to over-run a small community of desert-dwellers for their fuel. Without originally intending to do so, the road warrior befriends the community and ultimately sees that they must all work together to defeat the gang and Humungus. With the help of a feral child, the goofy side-kick, and the group he now feels obligated to protect, Max takes on the enemy with road-raging speed, down-n-dirty combat brutality, and primitive determination, packing The Road Warrior with gritty action that's satisfying to any fan of the genre. As one of the most classic action characters, Mel Gibson has marked his place in cinematic history with The Road Warrior, and we can relive the adventure time and time again through DVD. So strap on your leather, grab the nearest sawed-off shotgun, hop in your dirt-caked hunk-a-junk car, and refuse to let the legend die!
