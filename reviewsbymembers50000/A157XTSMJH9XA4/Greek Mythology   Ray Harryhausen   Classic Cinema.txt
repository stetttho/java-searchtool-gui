 Basic Plot: Perseus, the son of Zeus, must battle legendary creatures and defeat the very forces of darkness that threaten the life of his bride, who -- if he cannot save her in time -- will be given in a horrific sacrifice to The Kraken, a giant monster of the sea.   Clash Of The Titans has it all -- Greek gods, mythical beasts, good vs evil -- all wrapped up in a spectacular tale of action-packed heroism that would satisfy any fantasy fan. But also, to my extra delight, there is plenty of room for fans of Ray Harryhausen's amazing special effects. The monsters included are excellent mixes of live actors and Ray's famous stop-motion animation, giving a viewing experience like no other that beautifully sculpts his imagination around the film. Also, the DVD has special features, including breif commentaries by Harryhausen on each creature featured in the movie! Now how cool is that. Make no doubt about it, this is a true classic that needs to be seen by any fan of fantasy or adventure films -- The Kraken alone is worth a rental! And, for more Harryhausen greatness, check out 20 Million Miles To Earth, The Beast From 20000 Fathoms, Jason And The Argonauts, The 7th Voyage Of Sinbad and others also available through Amazon.com.
