 Ash (Campbell) and a few of his friends have rented a cabin among the rural woods in the middle of nowhere. They discover an old book and a tape recorder in the basement. The book turns out to be the Necromonicon and the tape recorder contains readings of its incantations. Yikes! After playing the tape, ancient horrors are unleashed through the woods and the cabin becomes a nightmarish slaughterhouse. One by one, they're possessed by demons. And the only way to finish off an out-of-control demonic zombie freak? Total dismemberment! As his friends succumb to the evil spirits, Ash must fight them off in a bloody battle of unstoppable terror. Evil shows him no pity as he fights for his life as well as his soul.   Mixing together a sick sense of humor, bucketloads of gore, and a simple yet frightening story, I believe The Evil Dead succeeds at becoming the epitome of a great horror flick. This is a cult classic if there ever was one, and it certainly deserves the reputation. I recommend it to any fan of the genre. You must see it to believe it!
