 Donnie Darko was an amazing film. It was quite sad, yet in a beautiful way. And I truly don't believe it would have been as good as it was if this score had not been included. Nothing fits the brilliantly sombre mood of the film like these tracks. Using a piano, a choir, cellos, violins and plenty more, in some ways, Michael Andrews created a soundtrack to life. Most of these songs are recognizably melodic and, in short, "pretty". But this is the complete fill of the Donnie Darko mood. Through darkness and through light, it is all on this album. A perfect CD for your solitary listening. And of course, Gary Jules' version of "Mad World" is on here to close the album. Could it be any better? I think not. Giving the film possibly one of it's greatest touches, Michael Andrew's score/soundtrack will surely bring you audible (and in a way, visual) pleasure time and time again.
