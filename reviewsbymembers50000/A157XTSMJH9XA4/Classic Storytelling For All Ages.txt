 Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures In Wonderland (as well as its sequel, Through The Looking-Glass) has, of course, marked its spot in the history of entertainment as an excellent children's story. True proof that "they just don't make 'em like they used to". Now, with the advances in computer technology, we're able to enter this strange and delightful world through a live-action movie with mesmerizing visuals. But it's not just the special effects that make this worth watching. A superb cast of well-known names bring the characters to life through wonderful and original performances. This cast includes (to name a few) Gene Wilder, Tina Majorino, Whoopie Goldberg, and the hilarious Martin Short as one of the kookiest Mad Hatters you could ask for! The film as a whole balances itself well, between the playful imagination of a child and just the right amount of a maturer feel for adults. And that's definitely a refreshing touch! So, if you long for an escape into a fantasy world of simple joy and amusement seemingly lost within today's cinema, pick up 1999's Alice In Wonderland and treat yourself to a timeless adventure.
