 Basic Plot: The diabolical duo of doom -- the goofy "Dr. Carnage" and his whacky ape-like creation "Max Assasin" -- have been unleashed from the cartoon dimension and into our world via a DVD produced by Satan himself.  Terror Toons is the type of horror-comedy that gets trashed by so many people who were expecting something different when they slid the DVD into their player. I'm here to tell you, if you're not a fan of the cheesiest, dumbest, kookiest film making available to the public, then this is not for you. TT presents a warped reality of murder, gore, and silly gimicks that -- as far as I can soberly tell -- makes no sense whatsoever. And that's how I like it! From over-sized slaughter weapons, to clownish sound effects, to hammy acting, to ridiculous rubber-masked killers, this film's got it all. There's even a spontaneous disco dance breakout. Just be warned, only devout "so bad bad it's good" fans will enjoy this. Those and, of course, people who are stoned out of their mind.
