 Lewis Black is undeniably hilarious. He is a delightfully explosive man, letting out his aggression in the form of politcal humor. And we can cherish his agitated opinions through this DVD packed full of comedy.   With Unleashed, we are treated to three of his half-hour stand-up specials (including the two regularly shown specials of Comedy Central's Friday Night Stand Up), as well as "Taxed Beyond Belief", where he teaches a class of young-adult students about taxes (of course, in a completely comedic manner). Also here for your viewing pleasure are special features, including his Comedy Central segments for The Daily Show regarding the 2000 Republican and Democratic National Conventions.   Still, regardless of his appearances on The Daily Show (which are indeed funny), his stand-up comedy is his greatest art and the best part of this DVD. One of the greatest apsects of Lewis Black's stand-up routines (besides the fact that they're non-stop hilarity) is that he makes fun of everyone and doesn't give you the impression he's taking sides. Focussing on his well-executed job of making us roll over in laughter, he knows exactly how to present his jokes -- even if the joke is less than perfect, he'll say it in a way that makes it perfect. He's got that timeless charisma about him. He's a real character!   All in all, if you like people who make anger seem funny, and make serious political conversation seem pointless, then Lewis Black is your kind of man. And, more importantly, Unleashed is your kind of DVD. This is stand-up at it's greatest.
