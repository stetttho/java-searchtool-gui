 Plot: Melvin is the epitome of a scrawny geek pushed around by everyone else. But when a prank meant to embarass him goes horribly wrong, he ends up falling into a barrel of toxic waste -- transforming him into a huge, messy monster. Driven to fight evil, he becomes the hero of the small town of Tromaville. He does everything from busting murderers to helping old ladies across the street. But low-life criminals aren't all that's standing in his way. The corrupt mayor of Tromaville wants him dead -- and will go to any lengths to stop this sudden appearance of justice in his rotten town.  Knowing little about the freaky superhero known as The Toxic Avenger, I was expecting a light-hearted horror/action film about a monster crime-fighter. It was even listed in the horror section. But what I got instead was a highly comedic popcorn flick with plenty of laughs, intentionally hammy acting, cheesy yet witty lines, and bucketloads of violent fun. Toxie and the other characters (including a blind woman who ends up as his lover) were obvious evidence that this is not to be taken seriously. TA is a completely absurd tale that will stupify any viewer. There are a few sublimal hints at how ridiculous some parts of society have become, but come on, who would watch it for the morals?  To top it all off, this particular DVD edition is a great purchase for anyone who wants to own the movie. The film's presented in its original, uncut version, and the menus are busting at the seams with special features. The people at Troma sure do know how to have good old fashioned fun, and The Toxic Avenger is clear proof. It's one of the dumbest movies you could ever see. And just remember -- that's a good thing! Unrated for Violence, Nudity/Sexual Content, and Language.
