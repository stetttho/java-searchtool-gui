 Let it be confirmed: The dead are rising in an unstoppable, lethargic trance and consuming the living! What began as a mysterious phenomenon on that grim night of 1968 oozed into the horrifying wake of dawn and continues to rapidly spread across the country -- endangering the entire human race. The day only brings light to the terrible truth ripping its teeth into humanity. Can we ever stop the dead? Ever?!  The third installment in George Romero's Living Dead trilogy, Day Of The Dead delivers everything we loved about Night Of The Living Dead and Dawn Of The Dead, multiplied by a million! Night was filled with a grim atmosphere full of terror for its time. Dawn took a bit of a lighter approach, and piled on more zombies and more gore. Day follows the chain and throws a buttload of zombies and over-the-top gore like it was a walking dead fiesta! Tom Savini obviously had a lot of fun with the makeup. Day is busting at the seams with scenes of eye-popping zombie effects that will have every fan applauding in their seats. Not to mention lots of military vs dead folks action as well as dark but charming humor. If you like your zombie flicks hot off the fryer with all the trademarks of a classically fun film, Day Of The Dead is a must-see. Definitely worthy of its spot in the legendary trilogy.
