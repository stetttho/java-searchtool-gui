 Basic Plot: Dave Buznik's (Adam Sandler) already less-than-perfect life takes a turn for the worse when he is sentenced to Anger Management and must live the next few weeks of his life with Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson) -- a nutty therapist who causes more problems than he solves.  Anger Management is one of the best Adam Sandler comedies I've seen, and the fact that Jack Nicholson is in it as the second main character makes it all the better. Their personalities go great together and really fit the story. And believe it or not, there's not just great acting, but a great script too. Hilarious scenes and jokes are overflowing throughout the movie with charm and classic fun. While it does have a romance back-plot, don't worry about it teetering between genres -- this one is a knee-slapping comedy all the way. And with some great supporting actors and actresses such as John Turturro, Luis Guzman, Marisa Tomei, Allen Covert, and Woody Harrelson, it's the perfect blend of talent and comfortable atmosphere to make Anger Management a keeper.  Not only is the film itself a great buy, but the DVD is packed with all sorts of goodies including feature-length commentary by Sandler and director Peter Segal, deleted scenes, "My Buddy, Jack" featurette, an anger survey game to see whether or not you have problems of your own, a making-of featurette, and a hilarious blooper real. Couple that with crystal-clear audio and picture and you've got an amazing deal.  As for this particular viewer, not very many comedies I see in theatres or through rentals make me think "Hey, this is something I need to own", but Anger Management is one of them. With Jack's funniest, whackiest side shining through and the obvious comical chemistry between the cast, it's no wonder why this won over my heart. I suggest any Nicholson and/or Sandler fan pick this up for plenty of laughs, memorable scenes, and unforgettable lines!
