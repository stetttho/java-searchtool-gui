 Plot: In the small town of Moorehigh, back in the late 1950s, a doctor-gone-mad was murdering people in an effort to save his wife who was destined for her ultimate end because of heart problems. The neighborhood stoned him to death, but his young son was never found. However, a modern-day psychiatric facility holds a John Doe patient known only by his nickname -- Dr. Giggles -- and, of course, it's him. He escapes the asylum and returns to his hometown to exact revenge for his shattered childhood -- his only company being witty one-liners, various murder devices, a maniacal drive to kill, and plenty of laughs to go along with it.  I was expecting a flop of a slasher movie that would fail to rise above any other film in the genre, but entertain nonetheless. What I got was a definite cut above the rest. One of the greatest choices made for the film was casting Larry Drake as the diabolical Dr. Giggles. An undeniably creepy man, he fit perfectly into the role. The majority of the acting and script were also surprisingly well executed, but Drake really made this movie worth the five stars. Playing around with a darkly humorous atmosphere and equally impressive dialogue for the amusing doctor of death, I felt the character was one of the greatest slashers ever produced. Put that together with some decent gore and you've got one hell of a killer flick. By all means, if you get the chance to snatch up Dr. Giggles for a price that suits you (sadly, it seems to be a rare find), take advantage of the situation! It's clever, it's bogus, and it's a whole lot of fun.
