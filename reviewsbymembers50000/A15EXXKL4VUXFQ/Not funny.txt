 Let's stack this lame, formulaic retread against some cartoons that are actually watchable:  The Simpsons was consistently brilliant for 8 years and can still hit some high marks.  Futurama was original, superbly-drawn, and although it was inconsistent its best episodes were as good as anything.  The Family Guy was (and is) sometime hilariously twisted.  Compared to these shows, Sealab 2021 is nearly useless.  It's visually crappy.  Its characters aim for quirky, but come up short and fall squarely on annoying.  The plotlines try to wring some humor out of bizarre situations, but it's a lost cause -- there's just no reason at all to care.  I really don't understand why people like this show.  I know it's on late at night, but I don't think I've ever been stoned and bored enough to get into lame, numbing garbage like this.  Along with the static anime, this is a low point for Adult Swim.
