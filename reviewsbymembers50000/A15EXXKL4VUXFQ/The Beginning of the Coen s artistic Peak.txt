 Overall, this movie is great.    But look closely at the first 5-7 minutes, the introduction up to the yodeling and the title credits when the plan is hatched. This intro is perfect filmmaking, ingeniously paced, hilariously written, and oddly very touching. The whistled, bluegrass Beethoven's 9th gets me every time ...    "Raising Arizona" also launched a decade of creativity by the Coen brothers unmatched by any modern directors I can think of. See this, and then see all the others. Great stuff.
