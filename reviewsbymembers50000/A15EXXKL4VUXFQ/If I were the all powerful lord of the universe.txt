 ... I would kidnap David and Gillian and hold them hostage and force them to play me sad and beautiful songs every night, with harmonies so heartbreaking and tender they'd make me cry, and then they'd cry since they've been kidnapped by some maniac, taken from friends and family, and are never given a night off, and we'd all cry and cry while I command them:  "Play slower! And sadder!" until it was just one note ... slow as mollasses ... perfect harmony ... high and lonesome ... true love and heartbreak ... all in the same neverending moment ...  Anyways, it'll probably never happen (probably ...), so this DVD is as close as I'll get to my private David and Gillian show.  Compared to the studio albums, you can really see their chemistry on the stage, and you also get a taste of their knack for making cover songs their own, like Pocahontas.  Pure high and lonesome love.
