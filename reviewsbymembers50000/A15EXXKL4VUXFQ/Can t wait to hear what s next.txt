 I like this album a lot, but I don't quite love it.  IMVH - BNTH,D! - O (that's In My Very Humble - But Not That Humble, Dammit! - Opinion, for those of you new to the innernet) it's good, but not quite great.  It's plagued in a few places with shapeless songs, subpar guitar playing, and cheesy lyrics (I can't hear someone crooning "Final Fantasy" without thinking of some dumb video game for chrissakes! and dreams being over ... wings falling ... sounds like a lost JFK speech). BUT -- and here I'm talking a Sir Mix-A-Lot style, king-sized but -- they sound so good and so unique I can't stop listening to it and can't wait to hear what they do next.  These guys can SING!!  I haven't heard soul vocals like this since ... well ... ever.  At their best moments on this album those brooding vocals blend perfectly with the driving slow-groove rhythms for pure magic. A little time hitting the songwriting notebooks, and some more time in the clubs and the studio tightening up, and the next thing from this band could be mindblowing.  I'm looking forward to it.
