 If, say, you're sitting around playing cards or trivial pursuit or Russian roulette, slightly buzzed, with this album on in the background, and you don't start doing the subliminal-beat finger tap, toe tap, head nod, or torso sway, then your cold, cold heart must pump ice water through your diseased spider veins.  And if you actually give this album a dedicated listen, and don't find a single riff or melody memorably catchy and fun, then your mind is a wasteland of forgotten references and partially remembered indie newspaper reviews shot through with a reptilian, limbic-brain impulse to affect a studied cool that has about as much soul as a pair of saline implants.  This album won't change your life, make you think really deep thoughts, or give anyone a reason to wear torn T-shirts or black lipstick.  It's just fun, catchy, upbeat rock n' roll that you'll enjoy for at least one summer as you hang out, drive around, and do whatever it is that you do.  For some, this is apparently not enough.  But if you understand that sometimes this is exactly what you need and nothing more, buy the album and you won't be disappointed.  For you lemmings who came in here to squeeze out a one-star review while dropping a name or two to show the "wisdom" that stands behind your "taste," go back to reorganizing the labeled jars of your leavings by volume and texture, or whatever you do when you're not pissing on something to prove that yours is bigger.  Bah!!
