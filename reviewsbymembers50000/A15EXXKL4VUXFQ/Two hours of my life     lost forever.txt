 I saw this movie at a free advance screening.  Not walking out was one of the biggest regrets of my life.  I look back on the two hours I spent in the theater that night as some kind of delirious and miserable fever dream.  Anyone who likes this movie is either brain damaged, Ned Flanders, or a little bit of both.
