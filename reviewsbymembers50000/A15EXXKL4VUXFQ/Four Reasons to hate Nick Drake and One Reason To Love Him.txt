 Four reasons to hate Nick Drake: 1.  Folk music, haunting vocals, sensitive and bittersweet lyrics -- all for sissies!  I'm a wartime reviewer, so I have to judge success on these matters. 2.  Mellow, melancholy music recorded by a guy who killed himself at 27 -- you're kidding, right?  That's not real life, it's a cliche from a screenplay written by a goth pothead freshman at NYU. 3.  Bunch of yuppie hipsters ... driving around in their shiny new VWs ... playing Nick Drake to pretend that their souls haven't been crushed by an adult life consisting of crass commercialism and empty sex ... well I hate 'em all.  And no, I'm not jealous. 4.  Every open mic night has at least one Nick Drake wannabe, and, if you can believe it, they're usually even worse than the aging ex-frat boy in a hawaiian shirt accompanying Margaritaville on a casiotone. One reason to love Nick Drake: 1.  This CD, and any of his original releases, has some of the most beautiful music you'll ever hear.  If you truly hate Nick Drake's music the part of your brain that forms fond childhood memories and tells you to stop and smell the flowers is probably damaged or missing. If you've never heard much Nick Drake this CD is a great start.
