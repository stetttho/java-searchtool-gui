 I'm giving this book a low rating because it promised so much more than it delivered. The book's promise is a skeletal theory about Eliot's motives (basically, he flees from sex and toward religion, treating his women  shabbily in the process). Plastered over it are two sets of supposedly  parallel stories of women traumatized by their tangential relationships to  the Holocaust. None of these stories are believable, least of all Eliot's -  and *he* actually existed. This book has been so heavily plotted that  the reader keeps tripping over the places where its seams have been  stitched together. The copious quotations from Eliot and Baraka serve as  Cooley's version of characterization. They don't work. Her characters just  dance around each other in a pretty theoretical ballet. A poet commits  suicide because she read about the Holocaust in the newspaper - it sounds  good, but when you think in terms of real people, honestly, how believable  is that? Not to mention that I'm tired of that old cliche, The Woman Who  Feels Too Much. If you're dead set on reading this despite the  negative press, like I was, you should know that you can skip the  interminable middle section (the diaries) with impunity - the book is  structured so that what little information from it you may need later is  repeated again before the end.
