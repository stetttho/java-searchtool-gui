 - by which I mean, even if you have all the individual issues, it's probably still worth shelling out full hardcover price for this fat little work of genius. The double-sided poster which serves as the book's dust jacket is an amazing, intricately wound diagram of the Corrigan family tree in all its seedy glory. The endpapers are new material - the back endpaper has a moving (although stiffly written) little essay by Ware about how the book started out as a way he could vicariously work out his feelings about having been abandoned by his dad, and he actually met his real-life dad for the first time while writing it. Of course this isn't "the first true graphic novel," as a previous reviewer dubbed it, but it's remarkable for its relatively complex symbolism and the compelling way it intertwines Jimmy's fantasy life with reality. The book's sole flaw is Jimmy's one-dimensional nature - he's always pathetic and never, ever comes out on top, and that might be rooted in the author's own insecurity. But who cares? Buy it anyway, it's amazing.
