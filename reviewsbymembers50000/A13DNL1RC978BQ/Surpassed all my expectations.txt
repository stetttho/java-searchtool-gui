 Sick of academic feminism, I really thought this book was going to be a slipshod piece of etymological scholarship. I picked it up to laugh at it.  Imagine my shock when it turned out to be a smart, feisty, personable,  positive, constructive, angry, liberating book - oh yeah, and fun. The  sheer pleasure Musico finds in life and words is exhilarating. Reading her  book is like talking to your best friend - she's stubborn, kind of crazy,  and I still don't agree with all her politics, but it's damned hard not to  like her or to respect where she's coming from. Also, she has some sound,  specific, and clearly stated advice on how to keep from being raped/mugged  - that alone is probably enough to make the book worth reading. I do  think the majority of college-educated, pro-choice American women will get  a kick out of this, if they can get past the embarassing cover (buying this  book felt very much like buying a box of tampons - this is fallout from the  author's relentlessly sex-positive attitudes). However, extreme feminists  will probably find it overly personal, insufficiently rigorous, and too  focused on the lives of women of the demographic I mentioned above.
