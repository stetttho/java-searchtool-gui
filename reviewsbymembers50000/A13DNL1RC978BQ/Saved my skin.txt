 With zero setup experience, I got conscripted for a rush job repackaging some spaghetti code legacy MSIs - I figured, they usually give this stuff to the junior folks, so how hard can it be? In three days I installed InstallShield and managed to completely trash my dev machine (it will no longer install *anything*). There are two problems with the free online MS/InstallShield documentation: it's structured as a reference, and it's not always correct (for example, on where to sequence nested MSIs, InstallShield 8 Help, MSDN, and support.microsoft.com give three different answers, some of them mutually exclusive - InstallShield was wrong). Baker's book is not comprehensive but it provided a solid and cohesive foundation for an understanding of Windows Installer, and supplied me with the intuition necessary to guess the correct answer from ambiguous docs. It took three hours for me to skim this in a cafe, and has probably saved me at least three to five days of barking up the wrong tree.
