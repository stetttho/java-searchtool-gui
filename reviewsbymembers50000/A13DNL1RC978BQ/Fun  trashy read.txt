 Hellenga excels at decking out his Danielle Steele-level story in  highbrow trappings - Florence, the Love of the Written Word, Harvard, etc. - thus relieving the American reader of any guilt typically associated with  summer beach books. But don't be intimidated: the language and the plot are  really pretty simple. It's the sort of ripping yarn I'd give to a bright,  imaginative twelve-year-old with aspirations toward some book-related  career. Yes, it's somewhat exploitative and occasionally condescending  toward women, but ultimately it's no more sexist than the rest of the world  - if anything, I would criticize it more for *pretending* to be a liberated  woman's novel. In defense of the writer, I have in fact smelled another  woman getting her period - "damp dog smell" is a pretty poor  description though. As I recall, Marion Zimmer Bradley described it  slightly better in "The Mists of Avalon." But I digress. Contrary  to what the back of the book suggests, there's not too much sex here, and  what little there is is often couched in coy reflections and indirections.
