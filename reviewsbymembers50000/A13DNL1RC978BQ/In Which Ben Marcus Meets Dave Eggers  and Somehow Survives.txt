 ... In some ways, "New American Women" seems like a sequel in which the wide-eyed child-journalist has been touched by a corrupting, baser metal. Maybe Marcus has been following Neruda's dictum about impure poetry, because his writing seems not only less lapidary and more disappointingly earnest, but also laced with crude (but rather funny) jokes and coarse self-deprecation.  Thematically the book seems to be about the mysterious ways in which women fold inward into stillness, and how men fail to live up to the ideals of women and fathers ... well, as much as anything these days can be said to be 'about' anything. The self-conscious eagerness to please, like a dog insistently doing backflips in the center of your field of vision, is embarassing... P.S. NAW is much easier to read, maybe too easy. Maybe I read it too fast - all in one night. Read it slowly.
