 this album is for you. I found it pretty boring at times, but I'm not a great Smog fan either. I don't know if the comparison to Lisa Germano is really fair - Germano is much more melody- and texture-driven, whereas Dall's music is extremely spare. What they have in common is a calculated ghostly creepiness. Jim O'Rourke and Bill Callahan (Smog) back Dall up on this. Oh, and the cover really is utterly gorgeous, esp. on vinyl.
