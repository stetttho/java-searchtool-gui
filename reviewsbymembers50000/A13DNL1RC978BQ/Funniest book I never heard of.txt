 Apparently this book was a cult hit when it was published, but I only know one person my age who's ever heard of it (and it's his absolute favorite book of all time, which should tell you something). Horse Badorties is a crazy ex-hippie who got so high on organic seminola in the 60's that he just never came down. His first-person narration of his hapless, paranoid, chaotic, unsanitary life is a real trip that kept me in perpetual stitches. Warning: despite the rest of Kotzwinkle's track record (he's most famous for writing E.T.) this is not a kid's book. There's some sexual language and situations and a girl gets raped in it (to which Badorties is utterly indifferent).
