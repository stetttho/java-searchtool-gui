 ... fun escapist reading for a lazy Sunday. The collection is dominated by feel-good stories whose ideas and plot twists are familiar, often predictable. Buoyed by a few charismatic selections (like Janet Kagan's  "The Return of the Kangaroo Rex") which make up for their  shortcomings by going at a good healthy clip and keeping the laughs coming  in. William Jon Williams' "Prayers on the Wind" and George  Turner's "Flowering Mandrake" offer moderately interesting twists  on the tradition of the theocratic and the First Contact story  respectively. I had been particularly interested in reading Vernor Vinge's  novella "The Blabber," but it goes like the literary equivalent  of a clip show: if you've already read "A Fire Upon the Deep"  it's all too obvious, and if you haven't the story will probably seem  pointless.) For more consistently innovative picks but a bit more of a  tendency toward name-brand authors, check out James Gunn's "Road to  SF" series.
