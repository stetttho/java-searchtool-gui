 The back cover led me to expect a lot of golden age sf, but a good amount of this stuff is probably recent enough (1970) to qualify as good *new* stuff. (Although some of it is embarassingly fascinated with things like hypnosis and the Campbellian dogma of America/Earth's eventual superiority over all other alien races.) Dozois seems to have gone to some trouble to dig up some solid stories from lesser-known writers, some almost totally out of print (C. M. Kornbluth, Murray Leinster, Leigh Brackett, H. Beam Piper). I also appreciate that he's knowledgeable enough about his field to ensure a fair representation of women writers without his needing to visibly lower the bar to let them in.
