 The back-of-the-box version of this story - a teenage teacher from bumbletown ventures into the big city to find her lost student - really makes a lot more sense than the actual plot, where her motivations are left more or less inexplicable behind the cloak of her reticence.   The movie is more valuable for local color and Cultural Understanding than it is for characterization; it's a re-enactment of a true story, and pretty much all the characters are playing what they really are - the adorable little farm kids really are adorable farm kids in real life, etc. Recommended for students of Mandarin as the vocabulary level is pretty simple.
