 Import prices nonwithstanding, this should be the first HSH album you get. As of early 2002, only two of his albums are available domestically - "Manic Expressive" and "Home is Where You Hang Yourself" - and they're less consistently good than this. This album of all remixes features the same repetitive, silvery groove of his solo tracks, but the variety in singers and lyrical mood mitigates most of the monotony that "Manic Expressive" fell prey to. Be warned - of the 9 tracks on this album, 4 also appear on the 2nd (remix-only) disc of "Home is Where You Hang Yourself." But this album is better - the tracks by Elastica and Logic in particular are acerbic, buoyant, and irrepressible.
