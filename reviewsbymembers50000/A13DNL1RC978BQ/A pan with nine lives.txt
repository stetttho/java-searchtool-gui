 I am a careless and brutal cook and destroy cookware all the time. I can't use nonstick because I'll ruin pans by leaving them on max heat and forgetting about them. So this one was worth the high price because I've had it for almost two years now and it's still good as new. Handwashing seems to leave a little discoloration after heavy use so every so often I pop it in the dishwasher for a gentle scrub (though that's not recommended, you can still do it). This pan cooks so quickly and evenly that it's hard to mess up. Foods brown nicely but don't burn. The handle is sturdy and never gets too hot. I often use this this in place of a wok, but it's really too shallow for that and has a bit of a spatter and spillage problem if you try to rapidly stir-fry. I wish it came with a lid. Also, I have not been able to cook eggs in it - they stick to the bottom like glue no matter how much butter I use. But a good soak and a couple minutes of elbow grease cleans that right up.
