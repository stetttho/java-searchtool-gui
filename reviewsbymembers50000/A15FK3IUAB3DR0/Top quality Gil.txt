 A gloriously mature CD from the Brazilian master, filled with treasures.  Thank heavens that those who do not speak Portuguese will have translations of Gil's brilliant lyrics, which cover diverse topics from quantum theory  to the true story surrounding a rescue (by one of Gil's band) of a drowning  boy in Bahia.  And the music,  including a lovely guitar homage to Joao  Gilberto that showcases Gil's instrumental skill, is equally marvelous,  drawing from a number of different styles.  Gil's voice retains its beauty,  warmth, and playfulness, especially on "Pela Internet"--a  reference to the song "Pelo Telefone," the very first recorded  samba--where he teasingly imitates Mick Jagger as he sings "I can't  get no...connection."  Highly recommended.
