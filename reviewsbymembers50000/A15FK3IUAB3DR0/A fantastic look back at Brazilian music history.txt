 Carmen Miranda alert--or rather, not Miranda herself, but many of her songs, sung by the fabulous Ney Matogrosso.  For any who haven't heard his voice, it's a wonderful instrument: flexible and expressive, sexy and strong.  And these classic songs, written between the 1920s and the 40s, are just made for Ney, who always pushed the envelope with his wild costumes, flamboyant performance style, and vibrant dancing. The collection, which Matogrosso compiled with the help of music researchers, doesn't miss a beat.  Among the best: Dorival Caymmi's ever-popular "O que  que a baiana tem?" which receives a performance that succeds in being both traditional and fresh at once; the tongue twisting, irresistibly danceable "Bambo de bambu;" the delicious "Vatapa," also by Caymmi and given a particularly sexy interpretation by Ney. Those who know Brazilian music will recognize "Adeus Batucada" not only from Miranda's rendition, but also from Virginia Rodrigues, who a few years ago did her own version in a slow and sensuous style.  Matogrosso begins almost in a whisper, caressing every word, and growing more powerful as the song continues and the percussion enters.  From the richly romantic ("Teu Retrato") to the folkloric ("Urubu Malandro," very playfully done), this is a definite winner.
