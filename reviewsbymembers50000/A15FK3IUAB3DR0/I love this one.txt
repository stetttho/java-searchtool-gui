 This double CD of Maria Bethania's most recent (I believe) live performance is a remarkable collection, and one that essentially traces the whole of her career, from "Carcara," her first big hit, to songs from her newest studio recording A FORCA QUE NUNCA SECA. It's brilliantly organized: the first part is composed of songs about life and nature, including some wonderful traditional tunes by Dorival Caymmi. The second section focuses on romance and love: the best here are Caetano Veloso's and Waly Salomao's "Mel"--which earned Bethania the nickname Abelha Rainha or Queen Bee--and Chico Buarque's marvelously feminist "Olhos no Olhos." The third group covers politically oriented compositions, and if you don't speak Portuguese try to get someone to translate the words of the Gilberto Gil/Torquato Neto anthem "Marginalia II." It's incredible. The final song is a very interesting selection from Chico's repertoire, the not-very-often performed but great "Na Carreira." While a very, very few of the tunes are less than stellar ("E o amor," anyone?") the selection is generally fabulous and Bethania's beautiful interpretations and silky caressing voice never disappoint.
