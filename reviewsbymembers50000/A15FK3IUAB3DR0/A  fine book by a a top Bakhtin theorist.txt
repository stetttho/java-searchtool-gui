 Here is an academic book that anyone interested in language, literature, and cinema should love.  Beautifully written (as few academic books are), it applies the cultural criticism of Russian writer Mikhail Bakhtin to a  diverse selection of novels and films, but most notably to those from  Brazil.  It is a match made in heaven, because both Bakhtin and Brazil  believe in carnival (the joyful festivities that take place just before  Lent, known in the States as Mardi Gras) and the carnivalesque (where rules  are suspended, the oppressed take center stage, the powerful are mocked,  and the body is celebrated). 	Stam begins by providing a clear and  thorough overview of Bakhtin's precepts and terminology (dialogism,  chronotope, heteroglossia), showing how his writing can fill in the gaps  left by other theories and illuminate both artistic texts and everyday  life.  He then moves on to discuss the conjunction between Bakhtin and film  theory specifically, providing elegant analyses of Bunuel's  "Exterminating Angel," Godard's "Two or Three Things I Know  About Her," Welles's unfinished "It's All True" (much of  which was shot in Brazil), Brazilian classics such as  "Macunaima," and "Mar das Rosas/Sea of Roses."  and  several others.  Along the way, he takes in such issues as the grotesque  and magical body, the subversive as well as the pleasurable potential of  carnival, the uses of cannibalism, and cinematic eroticism.  This  wide-ranging study takes in everything from music (by Brazilian composers  Caetano Veloso and Chico Buarque, plus rap) to the influence of the Yiddish  theater on Woody Allen's "Zelig."  An outstanding book that's a delight to  read.
