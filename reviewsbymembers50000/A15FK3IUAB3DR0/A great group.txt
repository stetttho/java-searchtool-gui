 First, let me make a correction to the Editorial Review for this record. It regards the group's name: "Parede" means "wall" in Portuguese, not "a parade" (which is "desfile").  That said, this is a great group, and a very important one. Pedro Luis is a fantastic songwriter with excellent lyrics for those who understand the language. And the group has amazing percussion: they're Cariocas (natives of Rio) who grew up with the great carnival samba schools, and the samba beat forms the initial impetus for much of their music. But that popular rhythm is combined with other styles--paricularly rock--and transformed into something new.   I highly recommend them.
