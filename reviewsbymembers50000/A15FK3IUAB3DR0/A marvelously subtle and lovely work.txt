 Bebel Gilberto is a true child of Brazilian music royalty, and she is keeping the dynasty going in excellent style.  Daughter of bossa nova genius Joao Gilberto and Miucha--a fine singer in her own right, though  less well known in the United States--and niece of the brilliant,  unequalled Chico Buarque, she has inherited an absolutely beautiful voice  and superb songwriting ability.  Her CD succeeds in marrying the  traditional rhythms and hypnotic melodies of bossa nova with a fresh,  modern sound, thanks to producer Suba, and guests ranging from Amon Tobin  to percussionist extraordinaire Carlinhos Brown.  Sung in both English and  Portuguese, the music ranges from soft and romantic to high-energy samba to  delightfully jazzy.  For me, a special treat is her wonderful cover of  Chico's gorgeous and sexy "Samba e Amor"--but everything's great.
