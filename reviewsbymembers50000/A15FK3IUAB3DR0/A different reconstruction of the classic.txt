 This version of "La Sylphide," reconstructed by Pierre Lacotte  for the Paris Opera Ballet, takes its inspiration from the Marie Taglioni  original--not the better-known and more frequently danced August  Bournonville choreography for the Royal Danish Ballet. Of course, any  revival of a lost ballet is speculation at best, given the lack of any  record or universally recognized form of dance notation at the time.  Yet  the result is nonetheless fascinating: the story remains the same and the  general movement style is quite similar, but the actual steps and the music  are thoroughly different.    What makes the dance shine are the fabulous  performances of Ghislaine Thesmar (Lacotte's wife) and Michael Denard, who  both display a wonderful lightness, superb elevation (the height of their  jumps), musicality, and fine acting ability--always a help in a video where  you can go close-up on the faces.  The duo were one of France's most  celebrated partnerships in the 70s, and they have a remarkable  "chemistry" and quite similar long, lean body types that make for  a beautiful line together.   The filming is fairly good too,, which adds  to the pleasure--especially considering the usual difficulties of  transfering dance to screen. Certainly, balletomanes will want to compare  versions of what is generally considered the "first romantic  ballet," and the one that made pointe work an absolute necessity for  ballerinas.  Very much worth watching.
