 Although Chico Buarque topped the list of the century's most admired composers in Brazil, he has a far smaller following in the US--perhaps because his brilliant lyrics are never translated into English. But this live double CD, made during his most recent show in Brazil, is astonishing. Among the songs are some that he has never before recorded, including his own "O Meu Amor" and "Terezinha," from the film and theatrical versions of OPERA DO MALANDRO, respectively. (Both were written for women and, as usual, Chico has no problems taking on a woman's voice.) His performance is passionate, the melodies miraculous, the rhythms wondrous, and the lyrics, as always, sheer poetry. The musicians and background singers have played with him for years, are also very fine. And how can anything that opens with his magnificent "Paratodos" go wrong? I have not stopped listening to it from the moment I bought it.
