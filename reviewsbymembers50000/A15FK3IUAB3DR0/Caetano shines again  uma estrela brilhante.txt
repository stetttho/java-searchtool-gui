 This is an absolutely fantastic soundtrack, the perfect mixture of  classics from Vinicius de Moraes' original play and the 1950's film,  accompanied by great new material that captures the Brazil of today.  In  particular, Orfeu's "samba enredo"--the type of "story  samba" that the carnival groups present each year in their parade--is  a true work of genius.  Shifting smoothly from the traditional rhythms of  samba to rap and back again, Caetano and Gabriel O Pensador achieve a  thoroughly modern, engaging, and DANCEABLE masterpiece. To me, this is no  unnecessary remake.  In general, Brazilians, though in love with the music  from the first screen version, have never thought highly of the film  itself, because of its fairy-tale misrepresentation of their reality.  And  for those who think that the rap is something "imported" just for  the sake of appealing to an international audience, it's not so.  That is  the music listened to by many Brazilian youths, especially those in the  favelas or shantytowns where Orfeu takes place.  Just as in Carlos Diegues'  TIETA, for which Veloso also composed the soundtrack, the music is an  integral and deeply appealing part of the film...and enchanting on its own.
