 Common's "BE" is long overdue!  I've always known Common as a poetic, intelligent, introspective and elogent artist.  But I always felt he'd toil in the shadows of Nas, Jay-Z, TuPac, Black Thought, Mos Def, Talib Kweli and the likes mostly because he lacked the charisma, street edge or political bite some of these aforementioned artists had.  Coming back from the brink of irrelevance with his 2002 LP "Electric Circus", Common stepped his game up with this intelligent, fun and soulful LP -- something so distinctive, I don't think we, as hip hop fans, would've gotten an album of this kind and of this high quality from a Nas, Jay-Z or Talib Kweli.  Common's "BE" is perhaps the most significant hip hop album of this kind to come around since Mos Def's "Black On Both Sides" or perhaps some of A Tribe Called Quest's early material.  Behind cool, jazzy beats, Common rhymes about everything from love ("Go", "Love Is ..." and "Faithful") to pontifications on Chicago's characteristic street life ("The Corner") to what it is to be young, educated and Black with dreams as big as the sky in the new millennium ("Real People", "They Say" and "It's Your World"). A full, complete and dynamic view of this life highlights an album that masterfully jumps from one subject to another to paint a bigger motivational picture: "BE".  Be successful, be bold, be loving, be independent, be honest and be true to one's self.  Common's "BE" couldn't come along at a better time -- one of several saving graces in hip hop music that hopefully gets the crossover/commercial/mainstream recognition to help present a more balanced, more significant and intelligent image of hip hop music than the norm that gains commercial success.
