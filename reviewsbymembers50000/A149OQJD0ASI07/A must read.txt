 This book is a collection of fond memories, hindsight perspectives and intimate behind-the-scenes tales from the Dodgers' dugout during the late 1950s and early 1960s.  Paul Gutierrez is a great writer and seasoned reporter!  This book is a quick read (even for non-sports fans) and very much detail-oriented (that Gutierrez definitely put time and effort into this book).  I read this book over the course of a week and enjoyed it so much I almost felt compelled to write the author (LOL).  Recommended.
