 R.Kelly was at his best when he was still ridin' wit Public Announcement.  He's always out and on the radio kinda like Mariah Carey, so I think his talent and genius are sometimes taken for granted because of this.  I guess because this was R. Kelly's debut and New Jack Swing was on its way out, this album will always standout as his best to me ... well, 12-Play gives it a good run for its money.  But as far as I'm concerned, his LPs go down from this debut.  Buy this album, if for no other reason, just for the single "Honey Love"!!!!!!!!  It's a 10-star song that'll get you "in the mood."  IF you haven't already heard this song from waaayyy back in the day, you've been deprived!  This track is convincing proof they don't make music like they used to.  This track alone knocks any and everything by Usher, Babyface, Anthony Hamilton, Maxwell and John Legend out of the park.
