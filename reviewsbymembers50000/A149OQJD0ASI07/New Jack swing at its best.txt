 Everybody remembers the 80s for Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Rick James and Janet Jackson's megastardom.  Although he never truly crossed over the way more urban superstars did in the 1990s and into the 2000s, Bobby Brown circa 1988 was like a male version of Mary J. Blige on the hip hop and R&B tip.  Back in the day, he was fresh, he was cool and he was THAT IT flava of the moment.  This is one of my all time favorite albums ... you can listen to it all the way through without skipping.  There's only one Bobby Brown & though he was foul coming at Usher the way he did in that 2002 incident, technically he was right: Usher circa-2004 was tryin' 2 channel Brown's 88 image, vibe and success.  In his day, Bobby was a racier, more urban, more down and more explicit version of Michael Jackon -- that real BAD BOY type that dudes respected and ladies feened 4.  "My Prerogative" and "Every Little Step I Take" were his smash dance tracks.  "Roni" and "Rock Witcha" were his smash slow jams.  Though if I remember correctly, like Janet Jackson on Control, just about every track on this album got released either as a video or radio single.  This album was that good and continues to be that good!  Highly recommended.
