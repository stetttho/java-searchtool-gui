 Let's revisit 1994 ... you had En Vogue, Salt N Pepa, TLC and Mary J. Blige.  This was THE time that black women in music were trumpeting girl power, independence, assertiveness and demanding respect from their men (LOL)!!!  Before Destiny's Child glossy girl power antics and Lil Kim's post-modern feminism, TLC's CrazySexyCool was absolutely trailblazing in girls singing about sex (albeit safe sex), manipulating relationships and using men as play things the way some men had previously used women.  The material sounds dated and indistinctive now because of everything that's changed in music b/c of albums like this one, but TLC still has some great, great stuff that takes me back to my junior year in high school.  Be on the lookout for "Creep", "Red Light Special," "Kick Your Game" and "Waterfalls" as the album's timeless jams.  Most importantly, pay special attention to the lyrics ... you'll appreciate it more when you realize that women weren't singing like this 10 years before.  R.I.P. Left Eye.
