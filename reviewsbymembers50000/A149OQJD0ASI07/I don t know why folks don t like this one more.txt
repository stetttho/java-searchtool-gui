 At this point in the late 1990s, Nas was trying to balance his grimey, hood and introspective side (the one everyone loves) with his desire to pop champagne bottles and celebrate a more commercial appeal.  I actually think it's cool to floss as long as you represent at the same time and I think I Am is the perfect example.  He toes the line between these two ethics -- look at more commercial tunes like "Hate Me Now" with Diddy and "You Won't See Me Tonight" with the late great Aaliyah AND THEN compare them to the deeper, poetic flow of "Nas Is Like" and "NY State of Mind II" and "Ghetto Prisoners."  All great tracks, but polar opposites.  Don't sleep on "Favor for a Favor" wit Scarface, combining greats from my two favorite cities (NYC and  H-Town).  "Big Things" is a track to play for anyone in your social circle that thinks rap/hip hop music is ONLY about negative messages.  Nas breaks it down for them!  Highly recommended LP and probably the most easy to listen to straight through of any Nas LPs.
