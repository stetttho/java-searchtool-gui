 because it's Mary, this album just didn't deliver the way it should've.  We all love Mary because she's unique and she's real. This is perhaps Mary's most "uninspired" offering, but I do think it's an above average album overall (at least by today's standards).  This album was hyped b/c Mary was coming off 2001's LP success plus 2002 Grammy success. Bottom line she did too much to try to serve different kinds of listeners (the old school heads like me that've been down since she first dropped as well as the pop-music bandwagonners who got on with No More Drama).  Then, when you consider she reunited with Puffy for this one it yielded the expected or perhaps unanticipated result of trying way TOO HARD to recapture her circa-1990s sound.  Another tragic flaw.  Overall, this was a great album-- just inconsistent.  My personal favs are Don't Go, It's A Wrap, Press On, Willing & Waiting, All of My Love and the beautiful, beautiful "Special Part of Me (classic Mary)."  Not Today with Eve was her most successful single & is still a decent listen.  I honestly think this album was BETTER than No More Drama ... it just didn't have the standout singles to match.  Don't sleep on this LP.  You won't have to hit the skip button while you listen to it, you just may not be as inspired by all of the Blige tracks as you usually are.
