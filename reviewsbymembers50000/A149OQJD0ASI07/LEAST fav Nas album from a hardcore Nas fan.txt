 I didn't even get into Nas until his spring '99 "I Am" had me stuck like a crack pipe.  So after going back into his catalog for this LP and Illmatic and hearing everything AFTER I Am, I can honestly say this is the one Nas album I can't get into.  The singles he pushed to sell records are cool, "If I Ruled the World" with Lauryn Hill and "Street Dreams" (the remix is hotter!).    "Affirmative Action" was aiight & I really liked "I Gave You  Power" which really displays Nasir Jones' creativity and talent as a sheer writer.  I consider myself a hardcore Nas fan, but most of these tracks just put me to sleep.  This is a must have for Nas fans, but I wouldn't push this LP on folks you tryin' 2 put up on Nas at his best.
