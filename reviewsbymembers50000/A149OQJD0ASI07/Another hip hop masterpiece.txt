 PE is another hip hop music icon that'll be talked about in 100 years as pioneering the heart and soul of America's truest art form of self-expression, joy, pain, heartache and real world problems and solutions.  You don't know hip hop and you definitely know hip hop music at its highest, purest form if you don't own, know of or even heard this album.  It's overwhelming Afrocentric (par for the course circa popular hip hop 1989-mid 1990).  For all listeners, you'll definitely get a strong sense that PE has something to say about Black Empowerment and challenging the status quo.  For white listeners, please don't be scared off by this album's Pro Black sentiments.  PE's Pro-Black messages are NOT anti-white ... PE's very much about self-help.  I can remember seeing tape of a documentary back in 1993 of a PE concert they performed waaayyy out in the boonies, somewhere in Middle America where minorities are an entity the local yocals probably only saw on TV.  Point is, they talked to several members of the overwhelmingly white, big hair, mullet-sporting crowd and to my surprise and delight, the crowd "got it."  They spoke with respect and admiration of PE and explained themselves how they thought it wasn't offensive and that PE was just promoting Black empowerment and for more people to get education, question society's way and know their history.  Powerful stuff (both this album and that documentary).
