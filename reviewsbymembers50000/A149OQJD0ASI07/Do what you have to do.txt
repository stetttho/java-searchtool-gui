 What does it take these days to get REAL talent noticed? How is it artists like Calvin Richardson, David Hollister, Raheem DeVaughn and Donell Jones take backseats to flavorless, colorless, pre-packaged robots that dominate MTV/BET rotations and airwaves?  If you're tired of the aformentioned regurgitated mess that is most of PROMOTED contemporary R&B, give CR's "2:35PM" a good listen.  I copped this CD in summer '04 after seeing CR's video for "Not Like This" latenight on BET ... (incidentally, I never saw that video again).  CR's got that old school soul and sings with a deeper, more sincere vocal approach that more than compensates for the fact he's not gonna blow you away like Joe, Brian McKnight or Maxwell.  Personal favorite tracks are "I'm Worthy," "Keep on Pushin'", "More Than A Woman" and "Not Like This."  Highly recommended album for spending quality time with'cha girl or just for chilling after a long, hard and tiresome day.
