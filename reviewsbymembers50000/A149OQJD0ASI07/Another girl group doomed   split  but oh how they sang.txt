 Of all the girl groups to blossom in the 1990s, this one by far and away was the best at singing (yup, TLC and Destiny's Child might've been more popular but neither group could touch En Vogue voice for voice among group members).  That being said, En Vogue really should get credit for, much like Salt-N-Pepa and Mary J. Blige, blending elements of hip hop, girl power and overwhelming sassy-sexy-soulful femininity into urban music where it hadn't been before.  If Mary bridged hip hop to R&B, En Vogue pretty much did the same to that 1950s doo-wop style that was masterfully resurrected and appreciated circa 1991.  "(My Lovin')You're Never Gonna Get It," "Free Your Mind" and the remake of "Giving Him Something He Can Feel" are all classic En Vogue flava.  I guess groups -- and girl groups in particular -- are doomed to split up when they go on tour and have to hear fans critique everything about them (who's the prettiest? who's the best singer? blah, blah, blah).  But unlike so many imitators to come along and try to pimp the En Vogue hip hop/R&B sound, En Vogue really was the real deal.  TLC, Destiny's Child and the Supremes are probably the super groups of the 20th Century, but En Vogue blazed a trail that laid the groundwork for two of the aforementioned to follow.  Recommended LP.
