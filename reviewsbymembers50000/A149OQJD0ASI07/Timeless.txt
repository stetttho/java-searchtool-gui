 B2K took notes ... and ran N'Sync/The Backstreet Boys/98 Degrees took notes ... ran Dru Hill took notes ... and ran 112 took notes ... and ran Jodeci took notes ... and ran Boyz II Men took notes ... and ran New Edition took notes ... and ran  But the J-5 set the precedent and their music keeps going and going and going!!!  Michael was still Black, the brothers were gettin' along, LaToya's clothes were still on, Janet was makin' us fall in love with her on "Good Times" and the craziness that was Joe and Katherine's relationship was still a well-kept family secret.  In between, you'll get this CD of timeless classics from the Jackson 5 -- "The Ultimate Boy Band ... Period."  "Dancing Machine," "Never Can Say Goodbye Girl (No, No, No; No, No, No)," "Rockin' Robin," "I Wanna Be Where You Are (Oh!)" ... the list LITERALLY goes on and on and on.  And to think as soon as the Jacksons first hit it big, Mainstream America tried to quell their thunder by pushing so-called more "mainstream" (read between the lines) family acts like the Osmonds and the Partridge family (as if?!?!?)  This was just another time and place in life.  This album captures a more pure, innocent time in music.  Highly recommended album!
