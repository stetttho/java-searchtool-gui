 OutKast had been out for a minute but this album made me become a true fan and recognize their creativity.  This album is crunk, it's exciting, it's brilliantly put together and a fine example of hip hop at its best.  OutKast is pioneering and yet so fantastic they're almost mainstream now -- but in a good way (OutKast is the anti-Black Eyed Peas, LOL).  Stankonia just continues OutKast's everchanging shape that keeps taking hip hop to higher levels.  If you've listened to Southernplayalisticadilacmuzik, ATLiens and Aquemini, you probably know to expect the unexpected on this album.  Stankonia is one of the hip hop albums I always throw up in debates as proof that good hip hop can still simultaneously make you dance/groove and think at the same time.  That Andre 3000 is deceptively very, very political, but you gotta pay attention or you'll miss his messages.  Highly recommended LP. Fun and crunk with hidden social/political commentary. One of my all-time favorite albums.
