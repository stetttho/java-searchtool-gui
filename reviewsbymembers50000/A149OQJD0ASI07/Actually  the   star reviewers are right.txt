 I can't think of a track on this LP that's below perfection. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect to The Lost Tapes is that it contains several tracks that should've and were originally planned to be put on his "Nastradamus" album in autumn 1999.  So many reviewers talk of Nas being at his lyrical low point or being just uninspired in the late 1990s -- which couldn't be further from the truth.  This album proves that!  Personal favorites include "Poppa Was a Playa," "U Gotta Love It," "Doo Rags," "Everybody's Crazy," and "Purple."  Of all the Nas albums, this is probably the one to bump in ya ride (check out the basslines in 90 percent of these tracks).  This album makes me wonder if most artists really record 40-75 songs for every album before whittling it down to 15-20, why oh why can't they include their hottest 15-20 on each LP like they used to do back in tha day?  Highly recommded Nas album for all hip hop fans ... right up there with Illmatic and Stillmatic as a part of the definitive Nas collection!
