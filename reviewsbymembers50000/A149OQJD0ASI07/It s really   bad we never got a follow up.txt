 Lauryn Hill's album greatly contributed to the ever-expanding world of hip hop artistry.  With Mary J. Blige bridging the hip hop sound with soulful R&B, you gotta credit Lauryn Hill with blending reggae with hip hop and R&B.  I just got through listening to this album last night for the first time in a while and it still brings back fond memories of my junior year in college when it first came out. Any album that can pull you back into time so vividly is nothing short of classic!  But I call this a 5-star masterpiece because we haven't seen anyone daring to imitate Lauryn's vibe on this album ... which should show how unique and creative it is.  Personal favorite tracks are "Doo Wop (That Thing)" which shows that venomous mouth on L-Boogie when she really feels compelled to grab your attention.  "Lost Ones," "Ex-Factor" "Nothing Even Matters" with D'Angelo and "I Used to Love Him" with Mary J. Blige are other standout tracks, but this is an album of a dying breed in that you really can listen to it all the way through.  Don't sleep on the hidden bonus cut "Be Alright," I actually awoke one morning about a year ago with this song in my head and couldn't even remember when I'd last heard it.  That's magical music right there!  Highly recommended for picky R&B listeners who favor a Mary J. Blige-Faith Evans-Lauryn Hill-Aaliyah kind of hip hop vibe (notice I didn't put Alicia Keys-Beyonce-Ashanti or Keyshia Cole in this category yet).
