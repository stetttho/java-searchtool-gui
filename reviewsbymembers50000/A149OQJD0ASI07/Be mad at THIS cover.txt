 I love me some Mary J. Blige and this album wasn't bad, just her weakest in her portfolio.  But what was she thinking with this cover?  Does that look cool?  Was that some art director's idea of unique even in 2001?  Okay, okay, back to the album ... I'm hatin' on this offering from Mary for one reason -- this is her first album I've EVER had to skip songs on.  Mary's trying her hand on this LP at more songwriting & more power to her for trying to add skills, but avoid TRACK 8 (Where I've Been featuring Eve) and TRACK 9 (Beautiful Day) with all abandon!!!!  She re-released this album in spring 2002 with new songs and a slightly different arrangement.  I personally would recommend getting THAT version instead (it's got all of her hit singles, No More Drama and Family Affair along with a track she later won a grammy for, "He Think I Don't Know" which is vintage Mary).  Crazy Games, also not a bad track at all on this album version, gets replaced on the re-release.  The re-release also has a dance-track version remix of No More Drama ... another reason I suggest buying the second version first.  Overall, again, this isn't a bad album ... I'd buy this before anything from Keyshia Cole, Ashanti, Teairra Marie, Olivia, Sharissa, etc.  It's just this is definitely NOT up to Mary J. Blige's usual standards of greatness.
