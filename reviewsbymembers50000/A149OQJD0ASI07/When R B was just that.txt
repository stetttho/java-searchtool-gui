 This is a Babyface classic and in my personal opinion the only "must-have" Babyface LP that should be in any R&B lovers collection.  Babyface (who, incidentally graduated from my high school -- Indianapolis North Central representin' ... sorry, had 2 do a quick shout out) is a megaproducer who'll go down in history and always be remembered for his hitmaking with basically everybody who's anybody.  However, as a singer and solo artist, his career for the most part rightfully took a back seat to more seasoned and charismatic vocalists of various stages of late 20th Century R&B (Keith Sweat, Bobby Brown, Al B. Sure, R. Kelly, Brian McKnight, D'Angelo, Maxwell, Usher, Joe ... there was always someone out harder and stronger e'ery time 'Face dropped an LP of his own).  However, listening to "For the Cool in You" 13 years after its release is a sweet reminder of the way things used to be.  Back in the day, R&B singers didn't HAVE to have rappers and multiple artist collaborations on their LPs to get noticed -- and "For the Cool in You" is an LP that's 100% 'Face and 100% R&B.  Babyface doesn't have a powerful voice or a deeply soulful voice.  I can only offer that his swagger is more laid back and more conservative.  But sometimes less is more.  That's what you get here.  The title track, "Lady, Lady, Lady," "And Our Feelings, "Never Keeping Secrets" and "When Can I See You Again" are all slow to midtempo tracks more appropriate for down time, perhaps low background music at your desk/on the job or just plain old great music to unwind to.  Babyface got the ladies hooked on this LP b/c he comes correct with clear, simple, honest and heartfelt lyrics.  This album is proof you don't always need Usher's kind of high energy, Janet Jackson-esque dance-track-ability or beggin' ass Keith Sweat's persona to tell that special someone how you really feel about them.  Short, sweet and cool.  Recommended LP!!!!
