 Man, this album is incredibly hard to find and even harder to find on CD (ebay, anyone?).  "Delancey Street" was the very first rap song I loved enough to learn word-for-word.  Wazup wit Dane?  I mean I wonder what ever really happened to him.  Hip hop in 1987-88 was just innocent, pure and untouched before the "killa crossover" and push toward the mainstream pimped, exploited and diluted the art for the almighty dolla.  Cop this LP (if you can find it) to get a taste of vintage hip hop back in the day before it went commercial (You can thank Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer for taking hip hop to the suburbs & making it the big $$$$ machine it is today, but I still think hip hop's paying for selling out to the degree it did).
