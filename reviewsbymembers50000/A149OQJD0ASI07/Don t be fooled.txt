 I kinda got into Young Buck's vibe in '04 when he was first coming out big.  I liked the lead single "Let Me In," not so much because it was groundbreaking or saying something that hadn't already been said in hip hop, but because of Buck's energy.  I guess I was kind of expecting him to come hard like a amped up, crunk, Southern-fried DMX.  I was actually pleasantly surprised and yet somewhat strangely disappointed to find Buck's flow is cold, but his debut LP overall lacks that raw energy of the lead-off single "Let Me In."  "I'ma Soldier" gets the album off to an encouraging start ... setting the tone, but once you get past the lead single, I found this CD somewhat conservative.  Buck's a promising storyteller & I really think more hip hop heads should really embrace more lyrical content to really separate lyricists from the MC/rock-the-party types.  This isn't a bad LP but any means ... Buck's clearly stayed on his grind to refine his rhyme skillz.  All I'm sayin' is not to expect this album to get you hype.  I wasn't so much expecting a pop, dance-type album (far from it).  I just had an initial expectation to really sense the raw energy and emotional release you get hearing someone like a DMX spit.  I wanted to relate, to feel his pain and to really hear him bring it, given some of the more street, hardcore but brutal honesties of what I understand was much of his life (...)  Lyrically, I think it's fair to mention Buck along the greats from the South of the moment ... Luda, T.I.P., Chamillionaire, but maybe he should kick it wit Scarface or Willie D. to bring more intensity to his rhymes.  Buck's style is just very laid back ... which isn't a bad thing, just be prepared.
