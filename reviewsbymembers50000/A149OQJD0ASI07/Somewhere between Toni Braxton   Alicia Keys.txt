 Roberta Flack has that old-time soul music and I can't think of a better RF album to own than this one.  She came along at a time in the 1970s when R&B was expanding its sound from a predominantly doo-wop/Motown heavy flavor to a more experimental light feeling, yet deeply introspective sound (think 1974).  I saw Roberta live in concert in NYC three years ago and she truly shows great musicianship, great pitch, great voice and outstanding abilities to connect with an audience.  All of her classics are on here ... "The Closer I Get to You" (My personal favorite Roberta song), "Killing Me Softly" (Come on, How many of you REALLY thought the Fugees originated this song in 1996?) and "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face."  I liken Roberta to a modern day mix of Toni Braxton and Alicia Keys.  She's got a subtle, understated and yet distinctive voice ... kinda like a Toni Braxton that really can blow, but doesn't go for overpoweringly multi-octave songs as much as a young Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey did.  And, yet, she plays the piano and really has a mastery of understanding how to use it to enhance her music without it overshadowing her voice.  That's what I call talent.  You won't find a single song on here that's "overproduced" (which is what so many producers do today to mask an artist's lack of talent!).  Put this album on during a slow day when you're in a good mood and just want to appreciate the little things that help make life worth living.  This album will serve as a reminder if not a history lesson of a different time in music -- Minnie Riperton, Roberta Flack, Diana Ross, Betty Wright, Chaka Khan and Aretha Franklin were on a truly higher level of entertainment and soul back in the day!
