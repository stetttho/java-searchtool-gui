 Toni Braxton really can sing and she's one of several artists still around whose talent gets ignored because she's not the latest "flavor of the month."  This debut really was back in the "good ole days" as far as her career ... remember that Babyface sound was just coming in with artists like Toni and TLC.  She won a couple of Grammys for this album and they were well deserved.  This isn't necessarily a happy, uplifting kind of album, but it's a cool, smooth vibed LP that's perfect for every mood of modern day relationships as "relationship" type music goes.  "Seven Whole Days," "Another Sad Love Song" and "Love Shoulda Brought You Home" are the midtempo, though scorned lover-inspired tunes that made Toni famous (though my dad still laments 10+ years later that Toni's music is "never happy").  Everybody either remembers or should know that "Love Shoulda Brought You Home" was the blockbuster single that emerged from the soundtrack of the 1992 hit movie "Boomerang" -- I'll never be able to hear this song without that Halle Berry-coined phrase from the movie going through my head ("Love? Don't talk 2 me about Love!!!! Love, Shoulda Brought'cha ass home last night!!!!" -- a timeless catchphrase, at least in Black America).  Her quote, unquote "happy" song on this LP is "Breathe Again," another hit single conjuring images of deep love on another level.  Toni's music is less soulful and more distressed than even Mary J. Blige's early stuff, but Toni's always had the better voice.  She's not quite a Whitney or Mariah, but she's definitely above Mary J., Janet Jackson and Aaliyah -- top female R&B artists who all shined in the '90s.  This is, however, another "must have" CD for all 1990s R&B fans.  This debut was easily one of the Top 10 albums (in popularity and sales) of the decade.  Recommended.
