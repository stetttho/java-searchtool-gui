 Vintage Whitney.  You're not a music lover if you don't own this album.  On this album, Whitney's at her best --- a level, vocally, very few (maybe Betty Wright or Minnie Riperton can top her) artists of any generation can hold a candle to.  R&B contemporaries & future R&B aspiring stars, listen to this album!!!!!  Notice how there's only 10 tracks & they're all of "out of this world" quality.  If you can't make an album close to this in quality, you shouldn't be in the business.  Whitney's debut is pure fire!!! I actually got back into this album in 2005 ... it came out 20 years earlier when I was in second grade and I can remember learning & singing "Greatest Love of All" among classmates back in the day.  From the pop-candy sounding "How Will I Know" to the inspirational "Greatest Love of All" to the deeply soulful "You Give Good Love" to the smooth grooves of "All At Once," this was Whitney coming out to the world -- Janet Jackson and MaDonna were the other megastars of the day and she just totally destroys them vocally here.  We all know Whitney's well chronicled, shall we say, "issues" ever since.  But if she ever gets herself back together again, I'd love to hear her try to top this LP.  This album takes me back to my childhood when true "singers" sang while male & female strippers posing as "singers" knew their place (LOL).  Classic, classic, classic album. A must have for true music lovers.
