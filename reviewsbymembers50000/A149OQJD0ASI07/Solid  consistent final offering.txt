 Never been a huge Jay fan, though I do acknowledge his many contributions to hip hop and respect his gangsta. Dude stayed on his grind year-in and year-out, harder than anyone else to emerge from the 1990s hip hop era.  Obviously, true hip hop heads should own his first LP "Reasonable Doubt". I do, which is why I bought his last album "The Black Album" expecting a return to his pure hip hop roots.  Good news is Jay-HOV delivers.  True hip hop albums aren't commercial with dance tracks & sing a long hooks and you won't find that here.  True hip hop albums can follow a theme from song to song all the way through & that's the "Black Album".  Each song is the piece of a larger picture or a larger message/statement.  "What More Can I Say?" is perhaps the best track on here.  Jay brakes down his case for why he should be considered the greatest of all time to do this.  I'd easily put Nas, Kool G. Rap, Rakim, Ghostface, Scarface and definitely TuPac above Jay lyrically ... but when you consider how successful he was at toeing the line between commercial success while staying true to the hood, it's conceivable that Jay did that better than any of the aforementioned artists.  Back in the day, rappers sought the approval from their peers and not validation by SoundScan record sales, so on that note, I can only acknowledge Jay as one of the best to ever do it.  "Dirt Off Your Shoulder" and "Change Clothes" are perhaps the closest commercial tracks, but they fit the theme of Jay growing up, changing styles and moving onto different and better pursuits in life.  Can't play the hood forever, but don't be afraid to take it with you & rep it hard even when you find yourself in different surroundings.  That's an underlying theme of this album & Jay's quite the chameleon.  Recommended for fans of Jay-HOV that liked Reasonable Doubt.  If you're looking for commercial tracks to dance 2 and put you in that "up in da club" mood, try another Jay CD.  that's my 2 cent ...
