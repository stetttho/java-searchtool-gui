 Musiq Soulchild's debut, in my mind, is the only one from his portfolio worth having.  He's got talent, he can sing and this album has a great, classic vibe that really captures the Neo-Soul Movement circa-2000.  If you're into artists like D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Raheem DeVaughn, Jill Scott and India Arie, there's nothing that won't stop you from loving this album enough to give it 4 stars.  And while I consider myself a hardcore D'Angelo and Jill Scott fan, I come back to Musiq's debut saying ..."well, this dude was bound to fall off."  Musiq doesn't bring anything new to the table and quite frankly grew a bit stale with following LPs which sound the same to me.  But you gotta love the fresh appeal of a new artist and this is that Musiq LP for me.  "LOVE" is the classic song I'll always associate wit Musiq b/c he hit the nail on the head when he sings "LOVE/So many people use your name in vein ..."  This is one of those soulful, slow grooves that soothes the mind, heart and soul.  His breakout single "Girl Next Door" is also vintage Musiq, singing about the love of his life ... quite ironically this song came out the same summer as the hit movie "Love & Basketball" which revolved around a love story between a married couple that started off as childhood friends and grew to be lovers.  Like I said, if you're really into NeoSoul, cop this LP.  If you're lukewarm or somewhat skeptical about this album, I'd either borrow it to listen or download the aforementioned hit singles and then decide.  But this is THE Musiq album to add to your music collection if you must choose one.
