 Dru Hill wasn't too far to the right like cleancut, goody-goody Boyz II Men, but they also didn't toe the line between adult sexy & borderline filthy the way Jodeci did from time to time.  For lovers of beautiful R&B music, this is the Dru Hill album to buy.  Skip the first six tracks (decent songs).  This album begins with Track 7 "You Are Everything."  Dru Hill has a rich, harmonious and very soulful sound I was feelin' back in tha day.  Everybody knows Sisqo was the best singer, but, at least here in the group, he wasn't as flamboyant or arrogant as when he went solo.  From, Track 7 on down you'll be mesmerized ...  The only sad part of this album for me is that my favorite song, "The Love We Had Stays On My Mind" I later found out was a remake from the late 1960s/early 1970s.  Sampling and remaking hit songs isn't necessarily a bad thing (I still like Mary J. Blige's cover of Chaka Khan's "Sweet Thing" ... but then Keyshia Cole's remake of "I'm Goin' Down" is a travesty!).  It just really hurt me to find out that the best ever Dru Hill song wasn't really theirs.  This still remains a recommended CD purchase though.
