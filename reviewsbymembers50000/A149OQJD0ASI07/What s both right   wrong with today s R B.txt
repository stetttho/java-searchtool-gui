 Don't get me wrong. I do believe Usher has talent. He can sing and dance his ass off ... unlike several wannabes coming out behind him.  But his whole hustle is just getting so stale and predictable to me.  For all I know he recorded every single one of his albums he's put out so far in the same studio session back in the mid-1990s.  I like a lot of his songs, but I just don't see any attempts at versatility from him.  "Nice-and-slow," "U Don't Have to Call," "Yeah" and "My Boo" just sound like they're all the same album to me.  He's been out way too long to just be coming at us the same way.  Look at Mary J. Blige ... God love her, say whatever you want about her singing and her style, but her first album "What's the 4-1-1" with its Friday night, house party feel was NOTHING LIKE the bluesy, heartachy "My Life" which was nothing like the radio friendly, hip hop & R&B packaged "Share My World" which was NOTHING LIKE the pop-inspired though uneven "No More Drama."  I'd just like to see him break out of that predictable, overexposed-type of R&B singing.  Summer turns to fall, the joints get weak and before you know it (like James Brown), some new jack who relates to a younger audience will come up just like that and take Usher's spot.  I'd just as soon listen to Sisqo, Case or Brian McKnight who can sing better than Usher or Ginuwine who can outdance Usher.  But where are their careers now?  No versatility = Short shelf life.  Usher step your game up.
