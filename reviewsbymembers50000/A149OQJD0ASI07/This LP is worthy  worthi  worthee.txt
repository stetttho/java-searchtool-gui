 Tony! Toni! Tone! was THE post-New Edition, pre-Boyz II Men & Jodeci "IT" group of R&B of the late 1980s/early 1990s.  This LP is chalked full of that vintage late 1980s sound (mostly but not limited to Teddy Riley's pattened "New Jack Swing").  The best thing to say about this Greatest Hits package is that, unlike several artists who release GH CDs, this album is "very much true" to its name.  I grew up on Tony! Toni! Tone! and all of their radio hits (pretty much what everybody wants nowadays anyway) are on this album.  "Baby Doll," "Anniversary," "It Never Rains in Southern California," "It Feels Good," "Whatever You Want," "Boys & Girls," "Little Walter," "Lay Your Head on My Pillow," and "I've Been Thinking 'Bout You."  All of these jams were radio hits between 1988-1993.  If you're new to Tony! Toni! Tone!, imagine a group that blended pieces of jazz, soft rock and bluesy background tracks with (what was) contemporary R&B.  This group is above the sappiness of your typical "boy band" -- this isn't a dance group b/c they actually sang, wrote, produced & played instruments.  Yet their overall musicality is somewhere between Boyz II Men's 1950s-inspired harmonies and Jodeci's "grown folks music" kinda/modern day sensuous.  Just listen to their all-time best track, soft summer love ballad "Anniversary" and you'll be hooked.
