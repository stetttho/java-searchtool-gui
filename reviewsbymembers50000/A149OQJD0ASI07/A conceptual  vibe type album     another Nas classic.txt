 Again, this ain't gonna get you crunk, amped up or ready to fight except for maybe Nas' most street and in-ya-face jam "Made You Look."  You gotta remember this is Nas circa 2002 coming off the smash success of Stillmatic, perhaps his most inspired, raw LP of his career.  He had the Jay-Z beef still being talked about plus his moms' died (RIP Ann Jones).  If you keep all of this in context, you're ready to appreciate God's Son as another "real hip hop" album with a laid back vibe and a lot of fire.  My personal favorite tracks are "Made You Look," "Revolutionary Warfare," "Thugz Mansion" wit TuPac, "Get Down" and "Book of Rhymes."  Check for the next to last track, "Dance" which is an ode to his decessed mama.  This is the special kind of track I'd say separates Nas from the hordes of rappers out today. Nas ain't rappin' 'bout nothing that nobody regardless of age, race, sex and class can't relate to on this track.  You gotta feel him on this one.  Oh, and "I Can" was an okay song ... great video! Again, it'd be corny if 50, Luda, Jay-Hov or Juvey tried to do something like this, but b/c it's Nas it's actually touching and promotes a message that we all should be sure the kids here know (you can be what you want to be).
