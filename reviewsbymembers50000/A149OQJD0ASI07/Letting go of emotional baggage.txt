 You've got to buy this album alongside OutKast's "Stankonia" to really appreciate its brilliance.  For those that didn't know or don't remember, Erykah had a relationship with OutKast's Andre 3000 and had his son.  Both of these albums were released on the cusp of that heartache-filled, teary-eyed breakup.  OutKast put out arguably its biggest selling album (at the time) of its budding career and enjoyed crossover success with the real life-inspired, melodic "Ms. Jackson", a tale of a baby daddy tryin' 2 do right by his seed who tolerates being mistreated by his Ex and babymama's mama for the good of the relationship with his seed.  Well, Erykah's somewhat muttled, but clear rebuttle is a song "Bag Lady" that richly carries this emotional, soulful LP "Mama's Gun."  Reppin' 4 woman scorned by a lover they thought they'd always be with, Badu vividly paints a picture using a bag lady as a metaphor for the need to let go and move on (song lyrics: "Bag Lady, You gon' hurt yo back ... dragging all them bags like that/ I guess nobody ever told you/ All you must hold onto, is you).  This isn't a happy album ... kinda like Mary J. Blige's "My Life."  But for those who've REALLY lived life, this is one you've gotta have in your collection for "those days."  Also check for underrated treasures on this album "Green Eyes" (breakout lyrics: My eyes are green b/c I eat lots of vegetables ... It has nothing to do with who's on your arm now) and "Orange Moon."  Gotta love the He Said, She Said relationship wars that are true to life and produce some of the best art from pain, misery, sorrow and shame.  This is one of those such LPs.  Recommended!
