 Blackstreet, a makeshift new R&B group made up of some of the broken pieces of Teddy Riley & early '90s group Guy, hadn't really established a unique, indistinctive and signature sound on this 1994 debut.  It's not a bad album, just not distinctive R&B.  Cop their sophomore set, "Another Level" (1996) first (That was the blockbuster!!!!).  Then if you're curious what their debut LP was like, get this one.
