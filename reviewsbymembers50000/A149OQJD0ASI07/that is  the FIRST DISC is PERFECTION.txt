 You can pretty much break the tracks on these discs down the middle ... 1979-91, when Michael Jackson was a poor black boy (disc I) ... and 1992-1996, when he'd completely morphed into a rich white woman, straight hair, high-pitched voice, eccentricities 'n all.  As far as Greatest Hits compilations, Disc I is probably the best ever ... you'll get every one of his classic, masterpiece tracks on this disc:  "Bad," "Billie Jean," "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'," "Rock Wit You," "The Girl is Mine," "P.Y.T.," "She's Out of My Life" ... just absolute masterpieces.  I was a very young kid when Michael was at the absolute heighth of his superpowers (circa 1982-85) and he'll always be the biggest 1980s icon to me.  If you're a fan a kinder/gentler MJ times -- pre-sexual molestation/identity crisis MJ, trust me, and skip disc two!  That disc has songs I almost can't even remember or just bare to listen to.    Disc 2 really serves more as a visual aid in how MJ had totally lost touch in a number of important ways.  Buy this album, but don't expect a quality 2-disc product.
