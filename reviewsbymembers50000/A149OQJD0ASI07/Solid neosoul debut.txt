 I personally would recommend buying Jill Scott's sophomore opus "Beautifully Human (2004)" FIRST.  But you can't go wrong starting with this album if it's indeed your intro to Jill Scott.  Who is Jill Scott?  An around the way girl from North Philly whose as strong, feminine, positive and real as any black female singing talent since Mary J. Blige.  Oh, and did I mention this girl can SANG?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?  "Gettin' in the Way," was the song that introduced her to the world ... this black women's anthem to handling the "other woman."  It's sassy and jazzy at the same time.  Yet, "A Long Walk" -- her second single -- was the song that won me over.  You gotta remember that circa fall 2000/spring 2001 the neo soul movement was running strong in the United States with Erykah Badu dropping "Mama's Gun," D'Angelo back out with "Voodoo" plus debuts from India.Arie, Angie Stone and Musiq Soulchild.  This album will make you remember that time more than anything, though I honestly believe Jill's second album "Beautifully Human" is the better album because there's EVEN MORE JILL -- more substance, more love of self and love of life.  If Mary J. Blige = modern day Aretha Franklin and Erykah Badu = modern day Billie Holiday, then Jill's gotta be a modern day Ella Fitzgerald.  If you like any and all of these singers, you're gonna love Jill Scott.
