 This album was VERY underappreciated for a variety of political reasons.  TuPac was many things to many people ... loaded with contradictions, like this album that ranges from the inspirational high of "Keep Ya Head Up" to the G'ed Up "I Get Around."  But isn't life also a contradiction?  (Yes) And doesn't the best art imitate life? (Supposedly, yes)  If you've just gotta have a TuPac album to really understand his poetry and what made him standout from so many rappers, cop either this LP or preferably, TuPac's 1991 debut "2Pacalypse Now."  Those albums are literally being studied in college classrooms (deservingly and appropriately so!) as I write this review.
