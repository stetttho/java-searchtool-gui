 Mary's fourth album "Mary" was nothing like it's predecessors ... and yet was in a way another groundbreaking album.  This is perhaps her most soulful LP in her entire catalog. It lacked the raw hip hop energy of What's the 411 & Share My World.  It's another vibe album.  It's beautiful, but I'd be lying if I didn't say it's not an album your average teeny bopper, Screw head, corner thug or around the way gurl can relate to.  I was in my senior year of college when this album dropped and it took time for me to appreciate how great it really was.  This was one of many signs that I was growing and maturing just like Mary and her style.  All That I Can Say, the lead off single, is representative of this album's laid back feel. She was definitely off of the My Life misery and onto a stronger, love-yourself ethos here.  She definitely makes a concerted effort to deal with mature, adult relationships that only those who've truly "lived life" will feel -- i.e. she jumps from singing of finding the love of her life to the scorn of finding out that love has cheated to singing from the perspective of "the other woman."  Other great tracks include Your Child , No Happy Holidays, Beautiful Ones (my personal favorite) and Don't Waste Your Time.  Her classic, classic track here is I'm Not Lookin' with ole dude from Jodeci.  The Love I Never Had is a close second (Note: This is a track she later won a grammy for best live R&B vocal performance for in 2001, I believe).  If you're into old Stevie Wonder cuts, you'll probably love this album more than any other offering from Mary.  This LP is not recommended for music consumers under 19, but it's probably the Mary album I'd play first when moms & pop get 2 bragging about "back in the day" cats and how contemporary R&B has lost it's soul.  Mary's gotta resounding answer 4 dat!
