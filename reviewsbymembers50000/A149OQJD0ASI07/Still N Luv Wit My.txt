 I had just moved back to Houston from Seattle when this LP dropped and was in heavy radio-rotation around H-Town.  Being away from the South for so long actually made me come back with a greater appreciation for Southern hip hop and the H-Town sound.  This probably isn't the album 4 you if you're looking for a Nas' "Illmatic," Jay-Z "Reasonable Doubt" or Wu-Tang "36 Chambers" type of album -- lyrical masterpieces.  That's not to hate on Paul and Cham b/c they got somethin' 2 say.  This is definitely an album you can ride 2 ... N Luv With My Money is still one of my favorites.  It's really too bad Paul and Cham fell out after this album though I'm not sure I'd even want them to try to top this LP if they got right again.  Fun, fun, fun hip hop album. Recommended for those who like to chill, have a good time and ride to some highly entertaining hiphop music.
