 I love Donell Jones' music and I'm a big fan of this CD -- minus the song "Freakin' U."  It's not that it's a bad song, I just think it really doesn't fit the overall tone of love and lovemaking (Is he singing to that special lady or just an "overnight wife"? I choose the former) on this album.  I find the other 11 songs to be absolutely beautiful.  "Freakin' U" is a track he could've given to Jaheim.  This album really is for true Donell fans ... those who can get into his Michael Jackson-like voice and see the brilliance of his songwriting and production skills (Otherwise, I think too many would listen to this LP and dislike it b/c it's not your typical Usher or Tyrese or Omarion or Chris Brown kind of R&B).  DJ's not the dancer/showman/high energy type.  He's got a more mellow, laid back style -- not something all music listeners are prepared to appreciate.  That being said, everyone's doing "Top Tracks" listings.  Here's My Order (Best to "Second-Best" though I really do LOVE all these songs):  1)"I'm Hoping It's You" -- 10/10, smooth vocals & excellent writing 2)"Comeback" -- 10/10, sick, hypnotic beat 3)"You Know That I Love You" -- 10/10, old school, soulful sound 4)"Where You Are (Where I Wanna Be --Part II)" -- 9.5/10, excellent vocals 5)"Guilty By Suspicion" -- 9/10, great storytelling, great writing 6)"Still" -- 9/10, great production & appropriate, simple question ... "Do you still believe in love?" 7)"Life Goes On" -- 9/10, Catchy beat, interesting writing (semiautobiographical tale?) 8)"Put Me Down" -- 8.5/10, excellent pulsating, chilled out beat 9)"Gotta Get Her Outta My Head" -- Dance beat accompanies another track with interesting story 10)"Do U Wanna" -- 8/10, blazing laid back track 11)"Don't Leave" -- 8/10, another blazing laid back track  Like I said, if Usher, Mario, Tyrese and Chris Brown are high on your R&B tastes list, this CD may be a little too mature and laid back for you.  But, if you can get into Babyface, Raheem DeVaughn, Carl Thomas and Brian McKnight -- cats a notch below Joe, Maxwell and D'Angelo vocally, but make up for it with a special something -- cop this DJ CD.  You won't be sorry.
