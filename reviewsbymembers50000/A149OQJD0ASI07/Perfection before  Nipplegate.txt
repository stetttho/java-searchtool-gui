 This album's bangin', pure and simple! If you don't know why, you need to buy this album.  Back in the day before Mariah and Mary J., an iconic performer and entertainer rivaled Whitney Houston and MaDonna for pop music supremacy.  I grew up listening to Janet through the 80s and 90s. This album perfectly captures her better days.  This album is a compilation throwback to a day when artists only put the finest tracks on their album (no filler) and if you had a blockbuster LP -- like Control & Rhythm Nation were -- it meant you put out 5+ singles from your album (so they all had to be fire).  Hard to pick a favorite Janet song -- it's like picking your favorite child.  *Come Back to Me -- Favorite slow jam *24Play -- Favorite sex jam *When I Think of You -- Best radio-friendly jam *Pleasure Principle -- Best Janet song that was made into video *Control -- Favorite anthem song *Nasty Girl -- Favorite dance track  This is an album you can listen to all the way through with high energy and an urge to replay each song.  Very highly recommended LP to add to your collection whether you're a pop/R&B fan or not.
