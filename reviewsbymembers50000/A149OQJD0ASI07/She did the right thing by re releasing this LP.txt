 Mary had her biggest singles of her career with this LP, but the original version of No More Drama was probably the weakest album overall of her career -- and this is coming from a diehard Mary fan that doesn't let a week go by without listening to her music.  The title track with its "Young and the Restless" soundtrack was oddly appropriate given all of Blige's past documented troubles.  Family Affair was a huge, smash dance track back in the day circa 2001.  You'll get crunk to it, but I never truly thought this kind of track was vintage Mary (though I still enjoy it).  Mary's vintage-sounding material on her include "He Think I Don't Know," "PMS" (I'm a dude, and straight, and yes I loved this one) and well as "Flying Away."  I also really, really liked "In the Meantime" ... and the poem at the end "Testimony" really added a creative and personal touch to this LP b/c it's Mary.  I'd have given the original recording of this album 3 stars (okay), but it's repackaging (good to great) was closer to the quality material we expect from artists like Mary.
