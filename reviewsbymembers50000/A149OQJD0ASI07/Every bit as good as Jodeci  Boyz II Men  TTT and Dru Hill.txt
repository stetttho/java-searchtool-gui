 Mint Condition was one of those groups of the '90s that played the background behind Jodeci, Boyz II Men, Tony Toni Tone, Dru Hill (and to a lesser extent, 112).  But technically, Mint Condition had better production and could hang with any of the aforementioned as singers, entertainers and musicians.  This Collection is a great listen for MC fans and a good introduction to potential new fans.  Their standout tracks were the radio hit singles "You're Breaking My Heart Pretty Brown Eyes" and "U Send Me Swingin'."  They're both slow groove-kina songs with high energy and great sangin'.  I only gave this LP 4 Stars instead of 5 b/c it didn't have their last great radio hit from 1997-98 "If You Love Me (Like You Say You Do)."  I LOVED that song back in the day and really felt like that single would've made this album absolutely complete.
