 I actually own this Eve album and not her debut.  Funny thing is, somebody in Eve's camp told her to soften her image and go pop to sell albums.  If that's all you want from hip hop, party/club/radio-friendly music (not meant to sound condescending or belittling, but just stating facts) then buy THIS album.  However, even though I wasn't a fan and never was a hardcore Eve fan, I recognize game.  Eve was on a whole 'nother level on her debut "Ruff Ryder's First Lady (1999)."  She was still down with DMX 'n crew, and her music, in my opinion, was better 4 it.  Hearing tracks on her debut album like "Love Is Blind" (which also had a great video to match the song's tale of women not toleratin' domestic violence), it's hard to hear her rappin' along side Gwen Stefani (great artist) on the poppy, popcorn-flavored "Let Me Blow Ya Mind."  She just totally went from one extreme to the next and her music lost the edge and the sociopolitical bite it otherwise had.  I don't mind the pop, crossover kinda music (it does have its place), I just find myself purchasing and championing more of the underground, real hip hop stuff b/c it doesn't get played on the radio anymore if a rapper's not maintaining the radio status quo.
