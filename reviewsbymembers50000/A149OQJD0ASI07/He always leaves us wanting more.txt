 It's too bad this dude doesn't get the hype and play that R. Kelly and Usher command. Then again, maybe that's the good part.  This cat has just a decent voice, but musically he understands how to use it and how to create a standout track!  The title track kind of symbolizes what DJ has to offer, lots of laid-back grooves that have a very personal and sincere feel to them (not just that next R&B song on the radio).  "He Won't Hurt You Again" is a song straight from heaven as far as I'm concerned.   "All Her Luv," "Shorty Got Her Eyes on Me," and "Think About It" are tracks meant for Friday nights, dimly lit candles and any time you've got to chillax with that special someone (or alone if you prefer).  Quality, quality album. More artists should take the time to craft classic material instead of just rushing out music every year.  I'd take this cd over most of R. Kelly's and anything put out by Usher anyday.  If you're trying to discern my R&B flavor at this point to grade my review, consider the following: I think cats like John Legend, Raheem DeVaughn, Calvin Richardson and Donell Jones are vastly underappreciated b/c of a culture that promotes throwaway, forgettable but radio-friendly music.  Cop this Donell Jones LP if you don't own any of his other albums.
