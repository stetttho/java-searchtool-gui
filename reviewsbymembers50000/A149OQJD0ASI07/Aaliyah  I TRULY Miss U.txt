 Ashanti probably is a nice enough girl, but where's the talent?  This last full length LP just shows how limited as an artist she was.  Can't sing, can't dance and can barely walk in high heels.  If it weren't for the successes of Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul and Aaliyah, who weren't the greatest singers, but could hold it down as true "entertainers" Ashanti probably would have no career.  Concrete Rose should be the end of the line for a chick that'll probably end up working a desk job at Murda Inc. in a few years.  Stay away from this LP (and this kind of , dare I call it, "music" for that matter).  Uninspired album with little to no value to the hip hop/R&B landscape.  Get a Mary J. Blige, Faith Evans, Aaliyah, Monica, Brandy, Fantasia, Keyshia Cole or Toni Braxton album before you even consider buying Concrete Rose.
