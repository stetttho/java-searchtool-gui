 Nas will forever been remembered, praised, honored and respected for Illmatic which was nothing less than hip hop history.  This album rightly deserves to be mentioned up there with TuPac's 2Pacalypse Now, Public Enemy's Fear of a Black Planet, Jay-Z's Reasonable Doubt, OutKast's Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, Eric B & Rakim's Paid In Full and any other of the "best" rap/hip hop CDs of all-time.  If you don't own this CD, understand its artistry, respect the gangsta or relate to the poetic imagery of the content of THIS album, you don't know great music and you certainly don't respect the genius of hip hop at its best.  I can honestly say I love every track on this album, but if I've got to pick a personal favorite it's "Life's A Bitch."  This is ironic to pick this track given Nas lets his boy AZ outshine him ... but rewind the lyrics over and over, feel the heat and sincerity as AZ spits & you can't help but fall in love with this track.  Classic! Masterpiece! Perfection! Hip Hop History!  A must have for all rap/hip hop fans.
