 This book on Allen Iverson just came far too soon.  Allen Iverson is my favorite current NBA player partially b/c he shakes up the status quo -- not necessarily because he wants to make that his objective, but quite poetically, he's doing it just by being true to who he is.  This book is a tale about a kid from the wrong side of the tracks, that basically struck it rich but admirably remains "the same" as opposed to "assimilating" just to make his economic & financial counterparts feel comfortable around him.  No true criticism of Larry Platt's writing style.  If he wanted to go deep into Allen Iverson's undocumented youth and youth exploits, that's fine too.  Bottom line is this book, while it has several defining moments, just isn't a compelling enough read because it was written still TOO SOON.  A.I., love him or hate him, totally revolutionized the NBA and the image it projected to Middle America.  I'd love to read a book about his life when he's 50, 60 or 85.  I'm sure he'll be on "60 Minutes" doing a "My Life & times" segment.  Whoever writes the book about his life just before that interview will surely have a No. #1 best-seller.
