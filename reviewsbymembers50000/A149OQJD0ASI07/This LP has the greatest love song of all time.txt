 Buy this just for the timeless, classic Rick James/Teena Marie duet "Fire and Desire."  For those who write James off as a pseudo-P Funk rip off artist with minimal vocal and production skills, listen to this one track.  He sounds incredible here. Most of his pop-sounding hits like "Super Freak" don't do his vocal talent justice -- but you'll gain a new respect for him if you haven't already heard this track.  And Teena Marie is another under-rated gem ... Mariah, Whitney, Lee Ann, Celine and any other top singer known for dumbfounding vocal gymnastics could take a lesson from her.  This review is written by a lukewarm RJ fan, so take that into consideration.  But the single track "Fire and Desire", in my opinion, is the greatest love song of all-time.   I literally hit rewind button over and over and over on this track b/c I don't want it to end.  Highly recommended purchase for fans of true singing and great music.
