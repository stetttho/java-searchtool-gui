 Who in the world wrote the "Amazon.com Review" above?  Or maybe the question is, what far away universe is he from?  This isn't a movie that the Academy-types shower praise on, but it's definitely a classic, classic film among the All-Time greats for those with ensemble casts that don't fit neatly into one category be it "comedy," "drama" or "suspense-filled thriller."  It's got elements of all of these!  True, the movie's signature point is the fact you had three of comedy's all-time greats in Redd Foxx, Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy together in one big flick -- something most people watched this film for.  However, bringing this trio together brought together different kinds of humor -- humor ranging from some gutt-bustingly hilarious moments, some intellectual humor and some more subtle moments of comedic genius.  If the Amazon.com Reviewer was expecting a bunch of coonin' and J.J. Evans-type of physical comedy, then his review is fair game.  In reality, Harlem Nights had an understandable, easily followed story line and plot, an entertaining twist-ending with moments of joy, comedy and drama all mixed in between.  Don't be fooled by the Amazon.com Review!!!!!    This is a highly entertaining movie -- it's Not of GodFather trilogy greatness -- but then again it's not really meant to be.  This one is slightly more family-friendly (say 10 and up) and, in my opinion, is just one of those movies that hits you from a bunch of different angles of entertainment.  Highly recommended and by a consumer who doesn't spend hours upon hours watching movies or hittin' up movie theatres as a consistent way of biding away free time.  Watch this movie.
