 Believe it or not, I can listen to every Nas album including this one EXCEPT for It Was Written.  This isn't a great album by Nas' standards, but I'd say it's a decent listen with a few glowing gems (like 90 percent of rap albums these days).  By now I think everyone knows this album was originally supposed to be the second disc of I Am but Columbia wouldn't wait for Nas to finish both discs so they ended up being two different albums.  By the time he got ready to release this one in fall 1999, it had been heavily bootlegged so what you have left is this offering of mostly B-quality material.  My personal favorite tracks include "Project Windows" with Ron Isley (best line "The liquor stores miss him/Then it plays out/So many ways out the 'hood/But no signs say out, mental slavehouse), "Some of Us Have Angels," "Come Get Me," "Last Words" and the sensuous "Big Girl."  So much of what was supposed to be on this album ended up on the 2002 release Lost Tapes (cop that one along with this album at the same time if you want to really hear this album in its entirety).  Otherwise this CD is recommended ONLY for hardcore Nas fans.  Newbies: Check out Illmatic, Stillmatic, Lost Tapes, Streets Disciple, I Am and God's Son in that order.
