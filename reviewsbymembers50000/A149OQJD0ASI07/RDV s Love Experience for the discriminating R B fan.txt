 While the world was gushing over John Legend and Anthony Hamilton for the better part of 2005, those underground music lovers where up on another cat.  Enter, Raheem DeVaughn who put out a lush, warm and emotional LP "The Love Experience."  I don't know what else to call this dude other than a breath of fresh air who put love back into R&B music instead of the tired, overused 1990s replacement: lust.  Do people really know anymore what it is to really love someone else? Or to feel that kind of love themselves?  I heard about DeVaughn in a magazine album review section and I recalled the writer pointing out that he outsold Legend at competing concerts in Washington DC one night.  I figured if all those black folks were lining up to see him more than Legend (who I do consider to be talented in his own right), DeVaughn must be something special.  I was right!  I don't smoke green, but I might consider (LOL) it after listening to this LP with its airy, edgy and soulful, dim-the-lights-and-feel-love mood.  One of my cousins who has the most discriminating of tastes in music overheard me playing this CD and she almost didn't want to give it back.  Hit single "Guess Who Loves You More?" "Ask Yourself (A Question)," "Breathe," "Sweet Tooth," and "Green Leaves" are all my personal favorite tracks.  However, this is an album you can put on and listen to all the way through without skipping.  WARNING: This isn't an uptempo album -- so if you're looking for Usher and Ginuwine-type R&B, then buy Usher and Ginuwine.  Raheem DeVaughn is an R&B artist and grown man with grown man talent and grown-up style.  Again, this LP is for the discriminating R&B music lover.  Highly recommended!!!!
