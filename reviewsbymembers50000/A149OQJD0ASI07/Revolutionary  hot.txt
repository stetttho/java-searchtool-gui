 Yeah, it's too bad more folks that listen to/buy hip hop music today have noooo concept of how hip hop started and these pioneering ladies.  Rappers like Queen Latifah and Sweet Tee were assertive ladies sayin' something and havin' fun doin' it.  To think what passes for the top female rappers of today ... Lil Kim, Trina, Missy Elliott (Da Brat, Eve, Rah Diggah and Foxy had some skill but all fell off), Shawna and Jackie-O ... none of 'em could've hung with these back in the day chicks.  They had to have heat back then and really be comin' wit something nice b/c these strippa shows of today wouldn't have gotten respect from the streetz, da fellaz or da ladiez.  This album is for hardcore hip hop fans ... I'm not sure anyone who'd even buy a Kim or Trina album is prepared for this.
