 What's so powerful, so deeply introspective and so tellingly artistic about this CD is the emotion, honesty and suppressed anger it contained in documenting the experience of a young black man in Los Angeles circa 1992.  Remember, this album came out right around/just before the infamous '92 post-Rodney King verdict L.A. riots.  A significant historical note is that journalists started turning to rappers for social commentary after this development.  If you want a true education in Hip Hop 101, this is one of several masterpieces to start with.

There is a difference & more hip hop heads should know.
