 Ludacris "Word of Mouf" is the kind of album hip hop needs to keep things light-hearted, entertaining and fun.  I think back to old Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, Digital Underground, Kid-N-Play, Keith Murray, Redman and Method Man ... cats that made fun music without totally selling out (aka Nelly).  This album is that kind of music!  "Rollout" was played to death on the radio circa Dec. 2001/Jan. 2002 when this album dropped.  It's a jeep banger I couldn't even hear back in '02, '03 or '04, but I can finally hear it again now (LOL).  "Move ..." was the jam that actually got me to finally jet to the record store to peep this LP.  It's cool stuff predominantly.  If you're looking for crunk cuts, I'd pass on this album.  Or if you want some sort of inspiration, again, I'd pass on this album.  But if you just want a fun album to ride to, enjoy being young and zone out to, give "Word of Mouf" a listen.  Shout out to LUDA!!!!
