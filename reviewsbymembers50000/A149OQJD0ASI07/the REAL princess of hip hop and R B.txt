 The one and only returns on this sophomore set minus R. Kelly (we all know why), sporting a new sound via Timbaland and Missy Elliott and a more mature image.  Gone is the "street but sweet" girlie girl who sang of love and life beyond her 15 years on debut LP "Age Ain't Nuthin' But a Number."  On followup "One in a Million," Aaliyah's song is that of a woman, lending smooth vocals to the sometimes bouncy, pulsating and hypnotic "If Your Girl Only Knew" and title track (Your Love is)"One in a Million."  Her standout love ballad, perhaps the biggest of her career, was "The One I Gave My Heart To."  And I don't know an around the way girl who didn't think "4 Page Letter" circa late 1996-early 1997 wasn't THE female anthem at the time.  Aaliyah's forthcoming album "Aaliyah" (2001) blew up for a variety of reasons, but I think hardcore Aaliyah fans will always hold onto this LP as vintage Aaliyah -- her best stuff.  Aaliyah had a charm, a beauty and a spirit all her own.    Like Mary J. Blige in the hip hop community, Aaliyah was a true entertainer and innovated a new sound.  She continues to occupy a lane that e'erybody's still try'na get all up in (Ciara, anyone?).
