 I was one of those feelin' da F-A-B-O back in tha day when he first came out.  It was never that Fab was trailblazin' a new path or was some kinda great rapper that just stood out from the pack.  But he did have flow, had clever wordplay and, in general, just made fun music.  I don't listen to this LP half as much since '02/03, but it's not a bad album by any means.  Lyrically, Fab's not a Nas, TuPac, JayZ or Biggie, but he's not fugazy like Ja Rule or a Lil Zane either.  I listen to this album now and it's just a consistent reminder of where hip hop was circa summer 2000-2001 (pre-Sept. 11).  It was at a somewhat innocent, glossy and somewhat shallow & materialistic state.  (I know, some of you are thinking how's that different from hip hop's eternal image? LOL)  Seriously though, Sept. 11, the Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina has changed the game just like it's had effects on every angle of American society and particularly a naive youth culture that's slowly started to see the world's not as rosey as they probably thought.  "Ghetto Fabolous" would probably be considered weak by 2004-06 standards, but just take it for what it was back in tha day.  My personal favorite tracks are "Ma Be Easy," "(Holla Back) Young'n," "Keepin' It Gangsta" and "We Don't Give A ..."  Note that "Trade It All" with Jagged Edge was later the soundtrack theme to 2002's hit movie "Barbershop."  And I'm hatin' that Fab's collaboration with Lil Mo "Superwoman" wasn't on this LP ... that was what put most up on da F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S anyway.  I haven't bought a Fab album since and don't plan on it, but if you have to have one "Ghetto Fabolous" is probably the way to go.
