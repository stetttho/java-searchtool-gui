 This album is almost NEVER mentioned among Mary's masterpieces like What's the 411 and My Life.  I like to think of it as her most contemporary R&B album of the 1990s and it's outstanding! Her first LP was groundbreaking b/c she was the first to emerge big-time with that hip hop edged style (though truth be told Michel'le actually did it first with Dre--sorry Diddy). And her second LP was very, very bluesy while maintaining a hip hop flavor.  Share My World is complete with raw soul and all the hot hip hop stars of the moment droppin' through like Lil Kim on I Can Love You Better Than She Can, Nas Escobar on Love is All We Need.  This is the one Mary album I can bump in my ride ... classics like the aforementioned with Kim and Nas are bangers.    Classic slow grooves like Seven Days and It's On with R.Kelly grew on me, but really are oustanding tracks.  This album was Mary's step forward from the My Life misery (and was also the first she produced without Puffy).  It's an album you can vibe to and bump when you just wanna chill at the crib or throw on at a summer barbecue.  Classic, classic material.
