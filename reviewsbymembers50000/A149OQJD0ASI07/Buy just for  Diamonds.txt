 This really is a decent enough offering from Slim Thug though folkz who been up on Boss Hog since way before Houston became "Tha Spot" in Hip Hop last year will tell you he has better material.  As far as repackaging the H-Town sound for the mainstream, commercial release, "Already Platinum" is solid and consistent.  "3 Kings" with Bun B and T.I. is the radio single most of y'all probably heard (it was a video too) ... nice flows from all three, but don't expect a great variation in topics and content.  You gotta know what to expect and what you're dealing with, so in those regards, it's pretty easy to appreciate this album as another strong if typical LP from da South (not meant to be an insult).  I'd buy this album (again) just for the track "Diamonds" ... great bass, a pulsating, syrupy beat highlighted by Slim's baritone.  That'll probably go down as my all-time favorite Slim Thug track.  He don't need to be Chopped & Screwed ... Dude's voice is chopped & screwed (LOL).  Oh, and don't sleep on "Miss Mary."
