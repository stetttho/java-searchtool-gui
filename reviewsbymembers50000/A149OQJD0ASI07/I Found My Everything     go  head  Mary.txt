 I only gave this album 4 stars b/c I personally don't believe in perfection. I'm an amazon user who knows how many of these listed albums get over-hyped with glowing reviews (i.e. Britney Spears, Ashanti, well, really most of commercial music out these days).   But this album deserves all the good reviews posted by the true Mary fans that copped this LP today. Vocally, I think this is Mary's BEST album by far. I could only listen to 3/4ths of it over lunch today, but was lovin' it all. The track with Will.i.am could've stood alone without him.   This is a destined classic in the vein of "What's the 4-1-1," "My Life" and "Mary." It's definitely an album that'll bring new Mary fans onto the bandwagon & cement her place as the Queen of Hip Hop Soul. There's only one!  Instant classic is the Mary joint with Raphael Saadiq, "I found my everything" ... I thought I was in church!  Trust. Vocally, this album should give Whitney Houston hope she can get herself together and get all the way back if she wants.  (I love me some Mary 2 death, but I NEVER thought I'd make this last statement--This LP is that good!).
