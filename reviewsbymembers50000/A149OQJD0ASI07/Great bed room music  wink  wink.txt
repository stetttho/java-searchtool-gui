 I actually really like Faith. She's got a great voice and some classic, classic tracks on here.  My only complaint, besides riding the wave of Mary J. Blige to come up on the hip hop and R&B tip, is that soooo many of her songs on this LP are indistinctive and lack emotional range.  Yes, I know, vocally, she can outsing Mary J. and I'm well aware that Faith's background vocals made "My Life" the success it is. But, well, um, what happened here on her own debut LP?  "Soon As I Get Home" is a hip hop/R&B love ballad masterpiece as far as I'm concerned ... by far, my favorite Faith song of all time.  The hypnotic, bluesy "No Other Love" and the Biggie Smalls inspired "You Used to Love Me" are the standout tracks on here.  Everything else, don't get me wrong, sounds like beautiful, but indistinctive R&B.  I can listen to old Toni Braxton, to Mary J., to Lauryn and Aaliyah's stuff and get a stronger sense of emotional range and stylistic versatility on there LPs.  I think as am album you may want to check out other Faith LP's like "Keep the Faith" and "Faithfully" which I understand to be stronger LPs anyway.  Faith's got a multi-octave voice like Whitney Houston, Kelly Price and Mariah Carey ... which is part of the reason why I guess I'd question why she didn't have more emotionally-compelling material to work with on this LP (think, Kelly Price's rendition of "As We Lay," Whitney's "One Moment in Time" or Mariah's "HERO" ... Faith's music, as an entire album, just lacks this kind of emotional bite on her debut).  Buy Faith's debut for the three aforementioned tracks or to complete your collection if you're a more hardcore Evans fan.
