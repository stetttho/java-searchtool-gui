 This album is "that one" that will always be mentioned with love, heart and recollection from the hip hop generation (those who were in high school & college when Mary first dropped in '92).  We all know the Blige story ... the heartache, the pain, the abusive lovers and the ongoing yearning for a better life. People feel Mary b/c Mary feels us!  This is that album that caught Mary at her lowest point in life which ironically produced some of the truest, illest, realest stuff of any artist (rivaling classics like Stevie Wonder's Innervisions & Songs in the Key of Life if you ask me).  This is not a happy album, but a vibe album you put on when you're going through something in life and feel like nobody else can relate to what you're experiencing.  The title track, I'm Going Down, I Never Wanna Live Without You, Be Happy and You Gotta Believe are my personal favs.  This album is the one I'm constantly throwing up to friends who think Usher, Faith Evans, Ashanti, Beyonce and the likes are doing groundbreaking R&B.    All of Mary's albums stylistically are different with different vibes while countless R&B singers today make song after song after song (and some good stuff, I'm not hatin') in the same spirit/vibe.  This is Mary's emotionally cathartic album ... and given all the ups and downs of her life, it's a reminder that bad times don't last but classics like this LP do!
