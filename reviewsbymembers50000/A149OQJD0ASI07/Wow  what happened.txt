 I kind of got on the Brian McKnight bandwagon late by most hardcore fan standards ... with the release of Back at One.  On this album, he has a mix of smooth, slow grooves, heavy ballads and contemporary jazz-flavored R&B.  I think what set him apart at the time of this release circa late 1999-early 2000 was the fact he wasn't just another crooner making pop, radio-friendly music.  The title track is the heart-felt ballad that was actually pretty big back in the day.  Definitely a Valentine's Day kind of song.  I think I fell in love with more of his smooth grooves though ... the stuff you can turn down the lights to after a hard day of work and unwind to ... you know, those precious moments of the day when you're trying to get right so you can go out and deal with the outside world again.  If that's the kind of atmosphere you like, listen to laid back tracks "Stay" (the best song on the album!), "Lonely", "Cherish" and "Shall We Begin."  Also, the single "6,8,12" is not to be slept on.  Again, this album isn't a party starter (unless you're setting the mood to put it down on that special someone).  When I think about it, this is actually R&B of a dying breed -- high quality stuff the ladies and fellas can groove to.  Too much R&B tries to just grab one group or the other. BM's Back at One succeeds at bringing the two together.  Highly recommended LP.  I still listen to this album from time to time and I'm continually amazed by how much BM fell off afterward. Does anyone even hear buzz about new LPs from BM anymore?  The last BM song I can even remember hearing on radio or in a video was "Love of My Life" back in 2001 off of the "Superhero" LP.  Vintage stuff, but what happened to him after that?
