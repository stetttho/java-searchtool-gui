 This is about as solid a two-disc set as you're gonna get out of any hip hop artist as far as I'm concerned.   Nas fans will love this CD ... inspired rhymes, great production and a cool hip hop vibe for us 25-35-year-olds who lived the Golden Age (1988 for those too young to remember or relate).  For young bucks who just wanna get crunk or hit up the next party single, you probably won't care for this LP.  But for all my street dudes, you should be able to appreciate Nas' latest sampling.  Ever since he dropped that first single "Thief's Theme" in summer '04, I was feenin' 4 this album.  Personal favorites are "Thief's Theme," "These Are Our Heroes," "Virgo," "Suicide Bounce," "Just a Moment" wit Quan and "Rest of My Life."  Check for other creative tracks "War" and "Bridging the Gap" featuring Nas' pops Olu Dara ... all listeners, pay special attention to the lyrics of this track. Nas drops some science showin' how hip hop music is just another great extension of prior black music art forms like blues, jazz, R&B/soul and yes, rock & roll (we invented that too long before the Elvises and Pat Boones took the credit).  Recommended for those who want to understand why old G's say they love "real hip hop".  Highly recommended for hardcore Nas fans and music lovers who bump rappers like TuPac, Mos Def, Common, Talib Kweli, Chamillionaire (yes, Cham!), (some) Jay-Z and Scarface.  One
