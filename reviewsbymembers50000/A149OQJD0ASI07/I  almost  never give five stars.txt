 But D'Angelo probably comes closest this side of Michael Jackson's masterpieces back in tha day (not to say that the two are even in the same category artistically).  Soul, soul, soul ... that's a HUGE factor that separates the D'Angelos, Raheem DeVaughns and Calvin Richardsons from wannabe R&B icons like Usher, Tyrese, Omarion, Chris Brown, Mario ... (did I miss any of today's quote-unquote "top R&B talent?")  This LP Brown Sugar should be required listening for any up & coming male vocalist that even aspires to one day be big-time.  "Brown Sugar" and "Lady" are my jams.  This is one of those LPs kind of like Mary J. Blige's "My Life" and Erykah Badu's "Mama's Gun."  Deep soul-flavored music with a deep-rooted tale/life experience(s) behind it/them.  The Great's always leave you wanting more & I personally put D'Angelo in that category.  Dude, can you please bless us with another classic? (LOL). Cope this LP!  It should be among the first purchases when it comes to contemporary hip hop-flavored R&B.
