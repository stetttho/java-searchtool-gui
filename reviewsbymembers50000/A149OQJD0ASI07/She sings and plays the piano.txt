 Okay, I'm not hatin' because Alicia really does have big-time talent.  She's singing and playing the piano at a time in the industry when more female vocalists are spending time strippin' and posin' -- tryin' 2 distract you from the fact that don't have skills.  Alicia, thankfully, isn't in that category. Outside of Beyonce, she's probably the next best female artist of the decade.  I own this CD and it's not bad, but it's not all that compelling or passionate once you get past her radio singles "If I Ain't Got You," "Karma" and the catchy, luscious "You Don't Know My Name."  I do believe this album is an improvement over her debut CD, but overall this album doesn't tickle my fancy like a Mary J. Blige, Lauryn Hill, Faith Evans, Jill Scott, Janet Jackson or Aaliyah CD.  I'm not saying this LP is bad ... just as an LP, it doesn't hold my interest song-to-song.
