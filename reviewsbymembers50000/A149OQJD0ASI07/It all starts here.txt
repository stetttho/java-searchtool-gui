 No Mary J. Blige music consumer should have any of her albums before this one!  Thirteen years after her '92 debut, it's still a timeless masterpiece. I didn't know anyone back in tha day that didn't think this album was tight.  And to this day I still don't know anybody who doesn't like it upon hearing it.  This is the album that drew her comparisons to Chaka Khan and Aretha Franklin (and I'd even go as far as to say country singing great Loretta Lynn -- Mary has her "every man", err, "every woman" relatable qualities).  Sweet Thing is my all-time favorite Blige jam! I know Chaka did it first, but Mary's version is so good even my moms loved it.  You Remind Me is another classic. Can't You See What I've been going through is tight.  Love No Limit was a great video but I kept hearing it on the radio until I loved it.  This is an album of a dying breed ... one you can listen to without skipping ahead (although you might end up replaying a few over and over b/c you can't get enough).  Highly recommended purchase for all music consumers!
