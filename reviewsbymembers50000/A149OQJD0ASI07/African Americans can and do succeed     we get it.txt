 It's good to see the variety of newer, unexplored subject matters that movies like these tried valiantly to portray back in 1999.  Particularly if you like the refreshing comedy angle TV shows like "Everybody Hates Chris" uses, you'll more than likely get into this movie.  "The Wood" is another buppie (Black Urban Professional)/black middle class slice of life/coming of age kind of movie.    It's decent enough with a solid story line, good acting and good writing though I'd recommend seeing 1997's Soul Food, 2000's Love & Basketball, 2002's Brown Sugar and 1997's Love Jones before watching this one.  Aside from seeing a good black movie where the focus isn't on race, violence or some grim circumstance (althouth these films do have a significant place), the only truly special moments I took away from this film were a couple of unforgettable catchphrases.  I won't give them away.  Watch this and you'll know what I'm talking about when you hear them.  If you or anyone in your circle is the kind of person that's always throwin' up timeless funny movie quotes, this is another one that's got some unforgettable gems.  Other than that, unfortunately, I don't think "The Wood" will be talked about that much in say 10 years.  Nothing groundbreaking here.
