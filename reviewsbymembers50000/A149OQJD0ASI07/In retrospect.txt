 There was an awful lot of sexual tension between He-Man and TeeLa but unfortunately this series went off the air before that relationship could go further (LOL).  Seriously though, awesome cartoon series.  I grew up watching shows like this one, Transformer's, Voltron and Thundercats.  This show had surprisingly great writing with good action and tangible plots given what passes for "good" cartoons these days.  The "EvilSeed" episode is my all-time favorite ... it also makes a good point that sometimes you have to put aside differences and beef with your perceived enemies to bring about the greater good.  Cartoons now lack the moral center that the 1980s classics seemed to project.  Highly recommended purchase for 80s cartoon & action cartoon fans.  He-Man would take apart Johnny Bravo, Jimmy Neutron and all of the other cartoon heroes kids think are cool today!  This DVD set is one I plan on showing my kids.
