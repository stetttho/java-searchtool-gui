 I'm listening to it now at work and it feels just like it did my senior year of high school when this album dropped. Incidentally, Tabitha Duncan went to my high school ...  but a few years before me (I'm not that old).  At any rate, I actually kinda miss that 1990s R&B sound ... smooth, cool, slow, laid back slow jams. "I Like" will take you back or catch you up if you a new jack not up on what's a dying breed of old school R&B soul.  Classic, classic track, indistinctive album by a group that jumped on the bandwagon after En Vogue and TLC blew up.
