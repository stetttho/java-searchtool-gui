 Scarface been holdin' it down 4 da Souf & reppin' H-Town 4 a minute.  Everybody knows lyrically he's in that line of All-Time Greats with 'Pac, Biggie, Nas, Jay-Hov, Rakim and KRS-One.  4 da most part any and all of 'Face's solo albums are cold (he's what made The Geto Boyz as hard-hitting as they were when they first came out).  This is my personal favorite 'Face solo album 4 2 reasons:  "On My Block" which was an oustandingly vivid track with a sick video.  "In Between Us", the track he did wit my boy Nas.  Lyrically, this is the best union since TuPac & 'Face did "Smile" back in tha day.  Highly recommended artist & recommended LP.
