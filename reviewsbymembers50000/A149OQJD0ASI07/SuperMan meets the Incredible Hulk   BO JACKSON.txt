 In my opinion, one of the greatest athletes to come along post-1970s (that generation had Ali, Wilt, Alcindor, Hank Aaron, Jenner, Hamill, Franco Harris, Evelyn Ashford, Archie Griffin, Bjorn Borg, George McGinnis ... some of the biggest names in sport!).  Fast. Big. Strong. (Did I mention Fast? Big? and Strong?)  This dude had all the physical gifts and the "can do" mentality of a super hero come to life!!!  Never seen anyone like him and probably will never again.  It's ironic that this two-sport All-Star, seeminly indestructible had his career hobbled to a stutter that fateful Jan. 1991 day on a football field.  This book gives you the inside on how a young Bo Jackson (aggressive and physically awesome even as a young kid) came all the way from Bessemer, Alabama, rose through elite football and baseball ranks to become the late-1980s megastud on the same dais of Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky before his injury.  It's an interesting tale with behind the scenes looks at how teammates and competitors in both the NFL and MLB interacted with him -- or should I saw competed in awe -- how Jackson came to hate Steinbrenner and how his family kept and continues to keep him grounded.  Here you had an athlete with ...  Carl Lewis' speed Herschel Walker's size Reggie White/Ray Lewis strength Jim Brown's physical toughness Barry Sanders' explosiveness  ... and a "No feat too great or too tall" mentality ALL HIS OWN.  Bo was a champion who's athletic career was cut short too soon, leaving fans to always ponder "what if".  This book celebrates memories and reflections on "What was."
