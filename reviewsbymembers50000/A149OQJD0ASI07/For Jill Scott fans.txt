 One of my roadies copped this double disc set back in '02 ... Jill was still beaming from the success of her 2000 debut, "Who Is Jill Scott?"  If you loved that album, you'll love this one.  Everybody knows Jill is the real deal.  She can sing better than all but maybe a pair of female artists out today and she knows how to sell a performance.  The Live versions of many of her songs off her debut are on this set.  Perhaps the most gratifying and entertaining aspect of this offering is the fact that you'll listen to her sing, knowing all the words along but you'll be blown away by the crowd reaction!!!!  I think I enjoyed trying to imagine what the crowd was reacting to as much as her entertaining, off-center riffs on some of her best studio work from her debut CD.  I really do think this is for Jill Scott fans because if you haven't heard her debut or sophomore LPs, some of her humor and commentary captured in the live performances on this set will be lost on the listener.  Highly recommeded LP.
