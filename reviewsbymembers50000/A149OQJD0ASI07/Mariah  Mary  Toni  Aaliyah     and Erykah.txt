 Badu's the last of what I personally considered to be THE breakout, defining ladies of 1990s R&B.  Each brought something new (and/or came with a certain style/flavor FIRST in the '90s) to the table.  As much as D'Angelo gets credit (and rightfully so) for jumpstarting the late '90s/early '00s Neosoul Movement, I really felt like Erykah was part of that pioneering clique with this 1997 debut LP.  In my book, Badu was the first female singer to incorporate the jazzy, bluesy element of the old days with contemporary hip hop and R&B.  Before, Lauryn Hill (solo anyways), India.Arie, Alicia Keys and Jill Scott, Erykah was holdin' it down solo on this tip.  "Baduizm" is the album that brought the comparisons of Badu as the reincarnated version of Billie Holiday.  Highly recommended LP!  Joints to check for on this album:  1)"Next Lifetime" -- A story of reincarnated love (this was also arguably one of the decade's top videos ... pitting Badu as torn in a love triangle with Method Man and Andre 3000).  2) "On & On" -- the special, unique "Baduizm" life perspective gets broken down.  3) "Appletree" -- you just gotta hear this one to understand.
