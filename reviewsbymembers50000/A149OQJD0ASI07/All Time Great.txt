 Stevie Wonder was and continues to be a once every few generations kind of genius!!!  There's not enough words in the English language to appropriately articulate how GREAT he is as a musician and how OUT OF THIS WORLD "Songs in the Key of Life" remains.  --Best R&B album ever made in history --Best soul album ever made in history --Best double-disc album set ever made in history ***Strong candidate for one of the greatest albums ever made by any artist, anywhere, anytime and any place in history  If you're black, white, Puerto Rican or Asian, young, old, straight, gay, religious, secular, a music lover, music hater or just plain music deprived, this album's for you!!!!  Can't say enough.  Deserving of 10 stars!!!  I'd put this album up there against any of the best of Michael Jackson, James Brown, Whitney Houston, the Beatles, the Temptations, Prince, Little Richard, Louis Armstrong, MaDonna, Boyz II Men, Elvis, U2, the Rolling Stones, Jimmy Hendrix, Aretha Franklin, Bob Marley or ANY of the other all-time greats I might've missed.  Even better than "Innervisions" for those Stevie Wonder diehards.
