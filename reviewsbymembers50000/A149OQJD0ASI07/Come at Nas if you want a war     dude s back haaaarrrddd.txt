 This album is the best example of what Nas can do when he's inspired or perhaps just angry!  Illmatic may go down in hip hop history as Nas' best if not one of the genre's best, but I think Nas spits more fire on Stillmatic than on any in his career.  He'd been gone since 1999 and you got Jay-Z challenging him for the thrown.  On Stillmatic, the sleeping King of NYC awakens and comes at the hip hop world with avengence.  I was living in Texas when this album dropped ... couldn't hear nothin' but Big Moe, Lil Flip and the Color Changin' Click (Paul Wall & Chamillionaire when they were cool) on the radio.  But I was bumpin' Stillmatic in my ride for a good six months -- no doubt!  "Ether" is his comeback to Jay-Z and it totally reshaped the game of battle raps. I still get chills hearing this track.  "Got Urself," "Second Childhood", "Poison" and "Every Ghetto" are my favorite tracks.  The intro was bangin' as well and really sets the tone for a cold-blooded Nas bout 2 rip this album.  "One Mic" just might be his most recognized track ever and was very creative.  Also "Rewind" is one I'm sure your token-rappers of today are trying to duplicate.  Also, don't sleep on "What Goes Around" and "Destroy & Rebuild."  Nas was feeling some kinda way when he did this album. Pure fire guaranteed!!!  Like I said, Illmatic was Nas' perfection. This is a masterpiece that I'd rival with any album of the new millennium.  Highly recommended for all!
