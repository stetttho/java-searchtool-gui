 Jodeci is one of those super groups that comes along only every so often ...  -The Temptations -The Four Tops -The Commodores -The Jackson 5 -New Edition  I'd put Jodeci in this line reppin' 4 da '90s before Guy, Boyz II Men, Tony Toni Tone, Blackstreet, 112, Dru Hill and Mint Condition (which are ALL great groups).  Jodeci's music was actually kind of groundbreaking when they first came out because their lyrics pushed & redefined the boundaries of love and lust.  I think every group that came out behind them borrowed something from Jodeci.  Although their other albums had some jams, this debut album is the only MUST HAVE to complete your R&B collection.  Highly recommended album!!!  Perfect Valentine's Day, Wedding Night, anniversary, birthday or Girl-Just-Because-I-Luv-U music.
