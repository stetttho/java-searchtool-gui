 The King of Hip Hop & P Funk Age rap music!!!!  It's interesting to remember how when Snoop first came out circa 1992-93-94, only the youth was feelin' him even though his music incorporated sooooo much of the flavor of our parents' 1970s generation.  Now, 2006, Snoop's so big, he's mainstream ... you got little old ladies in the suburbs and Wall Street suit-wearing types who think they cool if they like some Snoop (I ain't made though--LOL).  This was Snoop's classic debut and as far as I'm concerned the only Snoop LP you definitely need to make part of your rap music collection.  All of the Snoop albums after this one were hit and miss if you ask me.  Which tracks are the highlights of "Doggystyle"?  All of 'em.  This was a surprisingly solid and consistent release, looking back, given that right around the mid-1990s is went rap got overexposed, track listings ballooned from 10-12 to 19-25 and overall ALBUM quality for about 80 percent of hip hop artists dropped off noticeably.  Only fools would pay $18.99 for one of "those" CDs.  Fortunately, Snoop's "Doggystyle" was one of the last in which you really did get your money's worth.  Recommended.
