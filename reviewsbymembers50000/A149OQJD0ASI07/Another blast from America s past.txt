 I grew up watching the old re-runs of the Little Rascals in the 1980s and watching those shows are some of my most vivid childhood memories.   In retrospect, why can't viewers accept the fact that this show featured good, clean innocent childhood fun AND yet also had some racist undertones consistent with the times?   To say this show wasn't groundbreaking and hilarious, is to ignore the facts. But to say that this show, looking back, didn't have some racist undertones is also to ignore the facts.   Look at Amos-N-Andy. A large portion of the Black Community in the 1950s refused to watch this program because of its overtly racist undertones, and yet a lot of those same people will admit today that it's hard NOT to laugh at some of the humor.   You just have to be honest and be real when watching old footage of Hollywood shows like these.   I'll continue to laugh when I watch these episodes, but in adulthood, it's hard not to also think back to what living in the 1920s and '30s was like for my family -- it wasn't always all fun and games (and no doubt, we all know that TV & Hollywood images have proven to be equally empowering & damaging for a number of reasons).   Little Rascals should serve as the ultimate history lesson.   Great writing & great comedy are timeless. This kind of racism, no matter how blatant or hidden,is dated.   These DVDs attest to that.
