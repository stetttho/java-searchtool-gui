 I reviewed this printer earlier and gave it 3 stars, an average of the 5 stars I would have given the first one I bought, and the 1 star I would have given the second (which jammed a lot).  Well the second one eventually jammed beyond fixing (couldn't get the red error light to go out), so I contacted Samsung.  Much to my surprise, they sent me a new one through their RMA department, shipped second day air (I'm supposed to send the old one back to them).  I just got the replacement, and it works as well as the first one I would have given 5 stars to.  The Samsung RMA guy I deal with was courteous and efficient.  If only I had known earlier!  So now I'm less leery of Samsung's quality control than I was, and very impressed with their RMA practice. BTW, this printer has been discontinued, but is still widely available, with growing rebates.  I assume that Samsung is trying to clear out old stock before coming out with a replacement model.  Anyway, with the rebates this printer is now even more of a bargain.
