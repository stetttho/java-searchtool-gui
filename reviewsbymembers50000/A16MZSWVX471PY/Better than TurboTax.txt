 I switched to TaxCut this year because I am unwilling to put up with TurboTax's "product activation" inconvenience, but I used TT for many years, and also checked out this year's TurboTax (ex-wife's copy) for comparison purposes. The programs share several annoying flaws: 1.  Neither works right on a network, which is nonsense; lots of people have home networks for sharing printers, internet connections, etc., and it is often convenient to do at least some work on one's business computer.  In the case of TT, given their piracy paranoia, I presume this is intentional, so lots of people at an office can't share a single copy on a network.  What's TaxCut's excuse?  TurboTax at least tells you, up front, that they "don't support" use on a network.  Tax Cut doesn't (or, if it does, I missed it).   2.  The quality and quantity of help and technical support have been going down year by year in TurboTax, whether within the program, by phone, or on their web site.  This year, TaxCut is no better, help-wise, than TT (dunno about past years for TC, since, until this year, I was a loyal TurboTax user).  Neither is really acceptable this year if you have a problem, and neither is as good as TurboTax was a few years ago.  I encountered problems with both programs that I only managed to fix because of people on newsgroups and boards--no thanks to Intuit or Block.  At TurboTax, things may be slightly worse, simply because they're having to devote so many resources to dealing with product activation problems.  But Tax Cut is no great shakes in the help/tech support areas.  And past TurboTax experience suggests that both will only get worse as April 15 gets closer. 3.  Both TT and TC are obnoxious about hawking their other programs/services/tie-ins. I find the TaxCut interview process slightly better designed than TurboTax's, as I didn't have to mindlessly click "no" to inapplicable questions as much with TaxCut as with TurboTax.  TaxCut also makes it easier to deal directly with forms.  For people who don't know what they're doing, but don't have ultra-simple returns, TurboTax's more mindless approach may be better. But all in all, the programs are very much alike, to the point that I assume a lot of espionage and comparison is going on between them.  I'd give Tax Cut a very slight edge on functionality, and it's considerably cheaper.  If you don't object to Intuit's product activation nonsense, I'd still give TaxCut an endge. Of course, I *do* object, very, very strongly, to TurboTax's product activation nonsense.  I find it completely unacceptable, and I will not buy TurboTax, or any other Intuit product, as long as they're using it.  Lucky for me, Block doesn't have the nonsense, and is a more-than-acceptable alternative otherwise.
