 I liked the first one of these so much I got a second one.  The first one has given me no problems at all.  It set up with ease, worked well with both parallel and USB hookups (I was switching between two computers), prints quickly (although the wait for the first page is a tad long), and has excellent print quality. So, given the cheap price, I bought the second one because switching was inconvenient.  It performs just as well as the first, EXCEPT it jams.  A lot.  Maybe every 25 pages, on average, if I use the top output.  It doesn't jam much using the front/bottom output, but then the printed sheets fall on the floor.  (I don't have room enough to set the printer back).  The first one almost never jams either way.  The second one also makes considerably more noise than the first. I'd give the first one 5 stars, and the second 1 star, so I've split the difference.  If I'd figured out the problem with the second one quick enough, I'd have exchanged it.  I don't know how common problems are, but I'm suspicious of Samsung's quality control. Incidentally, I had no problem removing the stupid stickers cleanly on either printer.  Maybe Samsung has used different adhesives on other batches.
