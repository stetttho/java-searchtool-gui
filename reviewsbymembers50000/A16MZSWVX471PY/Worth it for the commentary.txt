 For years I regarded Citizen Kane as a good but not great film, and I never really understood why critics and serious film buffs kept putting it top of the list.  Now I understand, thanks mostly to the Roger Ebert commentary on this DVD, which focuses on the technical, production and compositional aspects of the film.  Ebert's commentary on this disc is simply the best I have ever seen on a DVD--time and again Ebert points out and explains brilliant touches and conceptions most of us wouldn't have noticed on our own, and he does it in an earnest, non-condescending, explanatory way.  Illuminating and insightful.  The Bogdanovich commentary is from a different perspective.  It's a little too in-groupy, "me and Orson," for my tastes, but it doesn't merely duplicate Ebert, and adds to my understanding and enjoyment of the movie, even if it's not the eye-opener that Ebert's commentary is. The companion DVD-Documentary is also illuminating.  Now for the first time I understand Welles's strange lack of success in Hollywood, despite his reputed (and undoubted) genius. This is the kind of DVD that could turn an ordinary person who just likes old movies into a raving, drooling, film buff. Highly recommended.
