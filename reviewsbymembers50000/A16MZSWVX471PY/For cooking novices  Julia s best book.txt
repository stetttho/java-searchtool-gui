 This unassuming book, a companion to Julia Child's original WGBH TV series, doesn't have many recipes, certainly isn't comprehensive, and has only pathetic, tiny, black and white illustrations.  But it's loaded with detailed explanations of the basics--what to do, why to do it that way, what will happen if you do it the wrong way and (sometimes) how to fix things that have gone wrong.  The book is really almost a programmed learning text on cooking, although it isn't presented as such.  I don't know of a better cookbook for novices, who can soon follow it to create really impressive dishes that will earn accolades, and help keep up their interest in cooking.  Not all the recipes are classics.  Some are the author's innovations, but make the point that, by combining basic techniques, interesting new dishes can be done.  For example, the two sauce "Lasagne a la Francais" is unlike any Lasagna you've ever had--but wonderful--and makes perfect sense once you've been through the earlier recipes in the book on whose techniques it builds.  If I were looking for a book for someone who didn't really know how to cook, but wanted to learn, this is the one I'd get.
