 When I was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes, I immediately bought half a dozen books on the disease, and friends and family gave me a few more.  This is absolutely the best of the bunch.  It's comprehensive, and covers as much (or more) as any other book on the market.  It's well written, and obviously done by somebody with a brain who doesn't just parrot somebody else's propaganda, but has some wit and skepticism.  It also provides good starting points for further research, so you can keep up to date.
