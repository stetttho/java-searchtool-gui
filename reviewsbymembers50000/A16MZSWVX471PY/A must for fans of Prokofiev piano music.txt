 This 3 CD set includes all of the Prokofiev piano sonatas (including both versions of No. 5 and the tiny, interesting fragment of No. 10) along with the complete Visions Fugitives, Sarcasms, the Four Pieces (Op. 4), and Toccata.  All are extremely well performed, and the recording is excellent (a surprise, since this is a re-issue of an '80s Sony digital recording, and many of those were unbearably harsh-sounding). Ms. Nissman demonstrates a very high degree of musicianship on these recordings.  Literally every one of these performances is a candidate for best-ever recording of the particular piece.  Considering the biggies with whom she is competing (e.g., Pogorelich in Sonata No. 6, Horowitz in No. 7, Richter in No. 8), that's saying a lot.  Throw in the good modern recording, and buying this set becomes a no-brainer for people who like Prokofiev's piano music. I can hardly wait for Nissman's forthcoming Prokofiev Piano Concertos series, especially No 2, which has never had a totally satisfactory recording (if only someone could combine the good points of Browning's and Feltsman's versions of that one).
