 This book is recycled from the Globe's coverage of Kerry over the years, and is fairly comprehensive.  But there's precious little analysis, and virtually no new "digging"; it's pretty much the reader's task to put things together.  The reader should not think of this book as a biography, but as an edited scrapbook of newspaper clippings.  Bush partisans will find it pro-Kerry; Kerry partisans will see it as a hatchet job.  It's neither, although it does provide plenty of ammunition for both sides.  But a lot of reading between the lines is required to get a sense of the man's character.
