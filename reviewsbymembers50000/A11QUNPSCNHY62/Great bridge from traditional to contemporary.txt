 If you are seeking ways to develop your own creativity, while still accessing the support of a few "rules", this book is one you may want to explore. You'll be able to use the techniques in the book to start a whole new quilting experience. As a some-time printmaker, I am fascniated with the possibilities of printing my own squares, then using them to assemble Dancing Quilts. I really like the book, and only stumbled a little on a couple of the diagrams. Careful re-reading got me right back on track.
