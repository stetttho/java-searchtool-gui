 This book has a wonderful introductory section, followed by the exhibit catalogs for Quilt National for 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001 and 2003. It's wonderful to have them in one volume. But if you already OWN all the catalogs, you should know that this book is just the same, except the individual books' introductory sections (jurors' statements, etc) are omitted. If you don't own all the aforementioned exhibit catalogs, you'll abosolutely love having this book in your collection! It would make a stunning gift for upcoming holidays, as well.
