 The previous reviewer who stated that this is "one technique done over and over" clearly only looked at one PAGE of this book. There are at least SIX distinct techniques, along with multiple gallery examples for each, ideas for combining trad blocks with unique "transitions", beautiful color photos, an ending section on combining leftovers and layered throughout is a wonderful narrative of design basics and creative encouragement! Quilters who like watercolor quilts should check out the Garden Lattice technique - stunning! And the Irregular Checkerboards will appeal to Nancy Crow fans. There are art quilts, baby quilts, pictorial quilts - my personal favorite is Searching for the Light by Marilyn Felber. This book will be a boost to anyone's creatvity and imagination (providing you have some to begin with!).
