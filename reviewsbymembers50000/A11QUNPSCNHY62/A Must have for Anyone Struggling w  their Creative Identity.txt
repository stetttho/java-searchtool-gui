 THIS BOOK. What can I say?? I've read probably a third of the articles so far, and EVERY ONE of them speaks to me at some level. This collection is written by people who understand the life and issues of artists or would-be artists. And they have good, practical advice for getting through some of the rough times we all face - externally and internally. I think the thing that appeals so much is that this is not one single author (or two), but 22 voices speaking almost as one. It's a powerful way to be led into and through the creative maze.
