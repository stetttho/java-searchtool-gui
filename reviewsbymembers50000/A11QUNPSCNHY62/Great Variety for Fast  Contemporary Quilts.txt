 I like this book SO MUCH more than the original Stack the Deck. The variety in this book is great, and the concept is easy to follow. Plus, the quilts look GREAT. My hand-dyed fabrics really shine in these quilts, and I can showcase special pieces with ease. The Red Onion quilt is my favorite, although I was really attracted to the floral squares one, as well. My only issue with the book is that the borders shown are fairly plain-jane - some different examples would be nice. But hey - if that's the only thing wrong, I can find borders (or create some) for myself!
