 Since there is no book description to-date, I guess I'll be the one to tell you: This book is a companion to the template set by the same name. The template set is NOT included but can be ordered (from the author) for $60, plus another $20 if you want a holder for them. The book relies on your buying the templates. It gives tracings of each in the back, so you could make your own, but as most quilters know, there is a big difference between homemade sheet-plastic templates and laser-cut plexi-templates, both in accuracy and safety. Just be aware: an additional purchase is almost certainly required with this book!! I wish they'd said that up front, and I'd have passed on this one.
