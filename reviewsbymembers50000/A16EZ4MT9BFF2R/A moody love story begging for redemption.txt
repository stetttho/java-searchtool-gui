 This is the story of a journey of the heart for Theresa Osborne, a researcher-writer for the Chicago Tribune and a divorced mom with a young son, Jason. When Jason's dad takes him for a summer visit, Theresa's  journey begins at a deserted beach on Cape Cod where she finds a message in  a bottle. The message Theresa reads quite obviously tugs at her soul as  she proceeds to share it with her hostess at the bed and breakfast where  she's staying, with her co-workers back at the Tribune where she returns  one day early, and with her boss, who does her the favor of sharing the  message with Chicago. Theresa sets out on a mission, with the paper's  encouragement, to find out who the message was written by and the story  behind it all. Using her job's resources, she tracks down the author in the  Outer Banks of North Carolina. He is Garret Blake, a terse ship-builder and  restorer whose discomfort with the world around him is alleviated only by  his passion for the sea. Kevin Costner (Blake) does well with roles that  don't require a lot of overt emotion and he does well here. Robin  Wright-Penn as Theresa was very good as the reporter who gets all too  caught up in her story. A special mention of Paul Newman here doing yeoman  character work as Blake's father Dodge, who understands his son's pain all  too well and who tries to help all around him keep their emotions in check  and headed in the right direction. The movie's downfall comes from a  meandering plot from screenwriter Gerald DiPego ("Phenomenon")  and a decidedly downbeat denouement. However, the acting, locations, and  direction of Luis Mandoki are good, bordering on excellent.
