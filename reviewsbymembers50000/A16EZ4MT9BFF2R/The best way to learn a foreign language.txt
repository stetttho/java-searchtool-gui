 [Subtract one star if the inclusion of written material is essential to you.] I've tried many methods over the years to learn Spanish including audio tapes from other trainers, but nothing has worked as well as the  Pimsleur Method. The Pimsleur Method is designed to teach you a foreign  language the way you learned your native language: by listening, active  listening.  When you were a child and you learned your native language, you  weren't reading books or writing phrases, you were actively listening to  the people around you and learning to respond.  These courses are  structured in the same way. I first encountered the Pimsleur Method with  a small set of tapes (what's called on Amazon.com as the "basic"  set) which I used once daily on my 35-mile commute to and from work.  I  found a retained more Spanish than at any time before in my many attempts.   Since the basic set was working out so well, I went on to purchase the  full, unabridged set that you're investigating right now. I like the CD  format because it's more durable and it gives me the ability to create  tapes and MiniDiscs of the lessons for my use outside the home.   The  lessons are a half-hour daily and the course is designed that you spend  only that half-hour listening and responding.  If you can stick to the  program, you'll find yourself fluent and understanding in a short  time. I'm currently working on "Pimsleur Spanish II" and I'm  hoping to become more fluent as time passes. If you want to learn a  foreign language, give these courses a try.  If you're really unsure you  want to make a heavy financial commitment, try the Basic Set first and see  if Pimsleur works as well for you as it's working for me.
