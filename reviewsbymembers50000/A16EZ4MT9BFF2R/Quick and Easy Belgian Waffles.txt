 There's really not much that can be said for this small and elegant machine other than it makes great Belgian waffles, provided YOU make great batter.   The waffle maker itself is compact, stores easily, almost completely idiot-proof as it has two glowing attentuators on top.  One indicates power to the appliance; the green tells you the waffle maker is ready to make waffles or that your waffle is ready. There's a locking mechanism to keep the lid tight while the waffle is baking.  The waffle will NOT stick if you used a cooking spray like PAM (butter flavor?) or Mazola ahead of time as recommended by the manufacturer. Sunday mornings are fun again!
