 Finally a good ballet instruction book that's encouraging and doesn't talk down to adult beginners.  The more ballet classes I take, the more I realize how well this book distills the important aspects of ballet.  Sketches and photos showing correct (and incorrect) body positioning are appropriately used.  When I started ballet, I picked up a handful of books, and I always reached for this one when I had 10 minutes to learn a new tidbit.  The brief history of ballet in the final chapter is added bonus.  If you're an adult beginner, start with this book and the David Howard videos, plus a good teacher once or twice a week.  You won't be auditioning for the American Ballet Theatre, but you'll become a proficient dancer pretty quickly.
