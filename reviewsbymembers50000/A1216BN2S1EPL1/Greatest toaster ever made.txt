 This machine is the best toaster ever -- all my goodies come out evenly browned with just the right crunch factor.  But it's best to think of it as a toaster, not a toaster oven.  Let's talk about the "40% faster" advertising claim:  this set me up to expect toast in microwave time.  Not.  It takes just as long as a pop-up toaster.  But it does a far, far superior job.  And let's talk about the "blinding light" complaint from some reviewers:  Not.  The machine uses visible light in the cooking, so imagine a 60 watt light bulb in a box -- it's not a problem at all.  But it's weird at first how the light goes on & off to control the temperature.  The little buzzer at the end of the cycle is melodic and pleasant.  The quality is excellent, and the controls are sensical and well designed.  All-in-all:  This is one awesome machine.  I'm emotionally bonded with mine, and I'm generally cranky about gadgets that don't meet advertising claims.  This machine just makes such darn good toast & browns my bagels so perfectly that I can't part with it.
