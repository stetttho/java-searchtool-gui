 Cosi is one of the most beautiful ensemble operas ever written, but alas, this video doesn't bring out its best. There are surely worse ways to spend an afternoon, but probably better ways to spend your money. It's palatable, but nothing like the great CD of Bohm's Cosi with Schwarzkopf and Ludwig. Contrary to the other reviewer, my copy did have some English subtitles -- but they were generally out of sync and useless for the ensemble pieces where the individual voices were unfortunately indistinct and mushy anyway. The best video of this opera is the 1994 Vienna production conducted by Harnoncourt with Gruberova and Stratas -- it is the best opera video I've ever, ever (did I say ever?) seen & heard, and I have a collection of 50 or so.  Try to find that one, or stick with the Bohm CD, to grasp the true beauty of this Mozart masterpiece.
