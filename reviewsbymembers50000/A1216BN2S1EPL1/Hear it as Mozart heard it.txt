 This set is a must for any true classical music fan.  It's played on a Clarke fortepiano that was buit in 1988 to replicate Mozart's Walter fortepiano, including the hammers which are covered with antelope leather, and the dampers which are covered with elk & deer leather -- just like the original instrument.  A fortepiano doesn't have the sound volume of a modern piano -- the "improvement" that permitted large concert hall performances.  What it has instead is a clarity in pitch and lack of reverb -- and oh my, what additional beauty this brings to Mozart's solo piano works!  These sonatas  and small pieces are so intimately played that they rival my Brendel collection.  For years I made the mistake of avoiding Mozart's piano sonatas believing they were merely "teaching pieces" that didn't display Mozart's creativity.  In addition to the great fortepiano, Jos van Immerseel's sensitive musicality, and Mozart's consummate craftmanship, this CD set is perfectly recorded in crystal clear digital.  Pure enjoyment.
