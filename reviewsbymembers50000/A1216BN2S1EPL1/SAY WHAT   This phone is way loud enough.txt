 This phone is excellent in every way.  I totally disagree with the handful of reviewers who complain about low volume on the handsets.  I'm prone to believe they have competition from screaming kids and a loud television, or hereto unrecognized hearing loss.  There are 3 volume settings (low, medium, high).  I can hear my callers perfectly on the low setting, but I generally keep it on medium to overcome background music and other white noise in my household.  I've never needed the high setting or the boost -- not even when my ears were plugged from the flu, and not even when I walk my dog all the way around the block.  I have one caller for whom I even turn the volume down to low (we've all got at least one friend with a booming, rock-the-walls, you-don't-have-to-yell voice, right?).  All the other reviewers' remarks about the phone's assets are true, so I won't bother to reiterate them.  It's the best phone on the market, especially if you need 5.8 GHz to avoid interference with your computer wireless 802.11 network (which is 2.4 GHz), or if you need the extended range & clarity it offers over 2.4 GHz.  Finally, as a matter of personal taste, I prefer the sleek, cool, trendy styling, and small footprint of this machine over any others I examined.
