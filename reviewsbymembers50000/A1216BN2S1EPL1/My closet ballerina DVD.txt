 What a great time I have with this DVD!  I only bring it out when no one else is around to see how hilarious I must look!  But that's the great part -- I just relax and have fun.  Sure I can't do all the moves (not yet anyway), but who cares?  I get a fantastic fluid motion workout.  Most of the Pilates/Yoga tapes & DVDs are so slow, one exercise at a time.  And the aerobic-type, high-impact bouncing is so "over."  But this ballet workout DVD is just perfect.  I get a fantastic workout and use lots of muscles.  At first, while the dancers performed a series of movements multiple times, I would only get one series right.  It moves right along!  But gradually I caught on.  The music is beautiful and you can select either a classical or a contemporary soundtrack for the background.  There's so much material -- lots of workout segments, plus segments on ballet, dancers, NYC.  You'll never get tired of this one.  Truly a great DVD -- but you gotta relax and go with the flow, 'cause you won't be able to do it perfectly at first, and maybe you never will.  I absolutely love this treasure -- think I'll sneak off and pop it in right now!
