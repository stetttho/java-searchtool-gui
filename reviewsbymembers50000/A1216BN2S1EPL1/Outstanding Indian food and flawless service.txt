 Outstanding restaurant! Raga has the winning combination of excellent food and attentive, quality service. We go as a group of four, and share the dishes we select. Every single plate I've had is excellent! And these are distinctive entrees -- it's not one of those restaurants where every plate has the same sauce or seasonings. The cooks here know what they're doing. The service is first-rate, and the prices are good. Two little tidbits: as for white wine, they didn't have a Gris/Grigio on their winelist (a blunder IMHO since Chardonnay & tangy Indian food don't blend well on the palate), so you might call and ask if you can bring your own if this is important to you. Second tidbit: the parking situation in downtown Kirkland can be very challenging, especially on a Friday or Saturday night. Give yourself an extra 15 minutes to find parking on a residential side street to the north of Raga, and then enjoy a pleasant stroll down to the restaurant. Leave time before or after to browse the art galleries too. Bon appetite!
