 I feel so bad for the author, but not bad enough to keep this book.  It's being returned.  Although the written content is excellent, 10 of the meager 18 photos of Motherwell's work are problematic -- nine have been inadvertently cropped during the printing, and one is both cropped and printed upside down.  These books should have been withdrawn and reprinted, but instead, Columbia University Press tucked a little sheet into the dust jacket explaining their regret.  It's hard to believe they proceeded with the distribution of this book, and retail it for $46.  This is unconscionable in any book, but especially an art book on a noted figure like Motherwell.  Please note that Amazon says the other reviewer's comments are based on a different edition.
