 The author's premise is that the cell is a nano-machine, and by examining and understanding the cell, we can learn lessons for bionanotechnology.  He then proceeds to provide a lovely undergraduate text, replete with wonderful illustrations, about cell biology.  So if that's what's you're looking for, go ahead and buy it, but if you want to learn about bionanobiology, you should look elsewhere.  Maybe the title was merely trying to capitalize on the nano-trend and current high interest.
