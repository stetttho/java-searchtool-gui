 This opera video is well-done in every respect, but it's not what I expected, so let me share my experience with you. The director, David Pountney, interprets the traditional "Little Mermaid" fairy tale in a Freudian vein:  Here, Rusalka is a young girl on the threshold of sexual maturity who longs to be an adult -- and longs for her Prince.  In her imagination, her sisters become the water-nymphs, her Grandfather is the Spririt of the Waters, and so on.  Not exactly the traditional production of this opera, but it's very well-done, and the singing is excellent (not outstanding, but excellent).  If you're an opera buff, you'll probably enjoy it anyway.  Please know, however, that this opera is sung in English rather than Czech; naturally, there are no subtitles.  Why, oh why, did they spoil the libretto and the arias that are part of our canon?  I guess I can appreciate the artistic setting, but I'm a purist when it comes to the composer's music, and in opera, that includes the human instrument.
