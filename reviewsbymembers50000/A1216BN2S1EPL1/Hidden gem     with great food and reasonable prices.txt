 This lovely little restaurant is tucked away in Park Place across from the QFC.  What a place for such a charming restaurant!  The decor faithfully transports an Italian cafe to the Eastside -- it's a perfect romantic date restaurant with candlelight, respectable wine list, and excellent food.  Plus, the prices are very reasonable.  I've eaten here 4-5 times, sampling everything from scratch minestrone soup to pizza to miscellaneous pastas and linguines, and have found every meal a culinary delight.  Call ahead to check entertainment and specials -- they occasionally have live jazz, and they have fixed menus for special times like Valentines Day.  I highly recommend this gem for a satisfying Italian dining experience.  It rates far above a pizza place, but it isn't a downtown gourmet Italian place that will deplete your wallet for the entire month.
