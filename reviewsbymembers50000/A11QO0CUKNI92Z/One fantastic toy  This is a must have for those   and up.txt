 This toy is wonderful. The item description provided is exact. It teaches letters, phonics, spelling, and writing. It even teaches BOTH lower case and upper case letters! Especially neat; when your child presses a letter, for instance D, it says the letter D than the phonics sound (if you have the switch set to phonics) and then the little screen clearly shows just how to write the letter properly. I plays a couple song notes as it shows the first line being drawn downward then up and into the curve for the letter D. Then, it invites the child to write the letter D in the writing space below. As the child writes, it continues to display the correct motions to write the letter D properly so that the beginner child can easily copy the motion. My 3-year olds first attempt was definately messy but you could see her concentrating on copying the screen and you could see the 'rough outline' of the attempted letter. This is a great toy. Traditionally, these electronic toys have not been taken out much at our home. However, I feel this will be used. And I have recently discovered that the electronic toys like this that fit on a lap work perfect in the car. They don't have to compete there with trucks and little 'busy toys', your child is occupied and learning something without much to divert him/her, and you can travel in peace-for a time. You simply can't go wrong with this toy.
