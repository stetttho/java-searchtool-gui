 My three girls prefer these little ponies to the regular sized My Little Ponies. I also prefer them because my girls are not into 'grooming' them, only playing with them, so the standard sized ponies are always very matted looking. These little ones are jointed in the neck, cute, and colorful. They are made very well. The tins do bend fairly easy but they bend back just as easy and it hasn't been a big problem for us as the ponies are usually loose in the storage bin and not always put back in the tins nor are the tins always used when the ponies are. My girls love putting these ponies on the My Little Pony dance studio which spins them around. Very fun. My girls have no interest in the big ponies since these came along, including my 2 1/2 year old. We bought the first series of six some time before Christmas and now we have purchased the new series of six more. I hope they keep coming. If your girl likes to brush the hair and do the dress-up hair bow thing, then this probably won't be best for her. But if she just likes to play with ponies or enjoys setting up cute collections, this might be perfect for her as well.
