 A great toy. Well made. Lots of tiny parts that might get lost but can't help that with this type of product. Comes with these little plastic pellets to use for animal food but I got sick of fishing them out of the fish tank and such in order to dump the water out between play. We threw the pellets away and use grape nuts cereal now. It is the same size as the pellets but when the kids are done, we just have them put all the little accessories in a small storage box we gave them for their pet shop. Then we just dump the thing upside down in the sink and wipe down the surface. The grape nuts go right down the sink and we don't have to worry about each of those plastic things in our old plumbing system. If you don't like mess, the kids can play of course without all this and it is fun too. Just make the pellets dissapear from the beginning and they'll never know what they missed! And it is still alot of fun with just their imagination. We have had this for over a year and my 4 and 6 year old still play with it every few days with all kinds of little animal figures. A good buy.
