 We were looking for a wagon for our kids to play with together NOT for us to use very often to transport them around. This wagon is perfect for the kids. My kids ages 6, 4, and 2 have a blast pulling eachother around the backyard. The wagon has never tipped even when they ram it into a wall. It does not tip when they get in and out either. The wheels stay still as they climb in and out but it seems to pull easily for them. My 2 year old can even pull my 4 year old in it. The back and sides are a great height to not worry about them falling out backwards or sideways if they keep their bottoms down in it and it is so much fun when being pulled, they are usually giggling until it stops rather than thinking about standing up. The side rails may be removed easily and put back easily but they don't fall out on their own. I guess it is a bit easier to climb in with the rail off but my kids don't mind climbing over and never remove the rails...even the 2 year old climbs over fine although she is a climber. I have fit all three children in this for a short pull and it is very cramped with them complaining of "whose sitting on whose this or that". But two fit comfortably and would be able to be pulled around face to face for quite awhile. The wagon is also easy to maneuver. This wagon is awesome for kids to just play with and we plan on keeping it in our backyard for our grandkids. It has been 6 months out in the weather and thus far, it shows no wear. A great buy!
