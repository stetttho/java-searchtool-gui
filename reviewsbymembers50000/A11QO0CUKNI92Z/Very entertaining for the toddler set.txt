 This toy works just as it advertises..imagine. You place the princess with the magnetic base at the top of the 'ramp', press a lever and she spins down the ramp and onto the dance floor where she twirls around to the music for 10-15 seconds. Or you can place 3 or 4 on the dance floor, press the piano key, and they will all spin around together. If the batteries are fresh, you can get 4 to spin but 3 or less at a time work best. My two year old played with this four hours the first day and it has been used at least an hour every day since we got it a week ago. My four year old also enjoys it. She uses it with her kittie cat set that has the magnetic paws. Anything magnetic will work because the dance floor simply has a few magnets that spin around when the button is pressed. Simple but mesmorizing to little ones as they pull the princess off and place them back on. Since it is magnetic, they don't have to try and fit or push anything into a slot to make it work. This toy is one of the best I have come accross in along time...so much is just junk out there these days. The only negative I would say is that the surrounding background 'fencing' stuff doesn't stay on at all. So, I just got rid of them and my daughter could not care less. It has nothing to do with it's functionality. A great buy!
