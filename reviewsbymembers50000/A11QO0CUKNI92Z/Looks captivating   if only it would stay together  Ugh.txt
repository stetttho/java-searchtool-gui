 My four year daughter was captivated by this in the box at Toys R Us. She loves mermaids and fairies and this toy grabbed her...it appears to have alot going on and it is very 'sparkly'. It has two tiny, adorable fairy dolls that supposably can interact with the playset in many ways such as 'flying' around in a circle when they are clipped to a leaf that spins. At Toys R Us, my husband and I gave in and stomached the price at the cash register. Once home, we put the thing together which was relatively easy, just lots of things to snap and stick. Our girls were all over it...for about an hour. Reason being, it falls apart very easily. Each flower petal attaches seperately and they pop off so easy that after a few days, you couldn't even open and close the flowers to 'hide' the fairies because the petals just snap off when rotated even though they are suppose to move this way. In addition, one leaf has a kind of clip that the child is suppose to attach the fairy too so that they can spin the leaf around and it appears the fairy is flying. Neither my four year old nor my persistent five year old could manage the clip and I even had trouble, although my oldest did eventually figure out a way to balance the fairy and it stayed up for a few rotations. Today, a month after purchasing this expensive piece of pourly designed plastic, I gathered the many snapped off pieces and through this thing away. What a waste! Don't buy this toy. It looks enchanting but it is one of the cheapest toys I have ever had in six years of motherhood.
