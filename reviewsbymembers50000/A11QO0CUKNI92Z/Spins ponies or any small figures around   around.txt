 My three girls ages 2, 4, & 6, have enjoyed this toy. The three disks move around the turntable and one of the disks spins around and around at the same time. My girls use these with their favorite My Little Pony Tiny Tin sized ponies as well as the regular sized ponies. They also set up many other figure collections including their Care Bear figures and their collection of plastic dogs, cats, & animals. They pretend it is a ride and the figures are waiting turns. It has provided a good amount of 'play-time' for the investment. A good price for the fun they have had with it. The one thing I would change would be to have all three disks independently spinning while they all rotate around the turntable rather than just the one disk. However, not a big deal. I especially like that this toy is so versatile. So many toys can't be used with any other figures than what they were specifically designed for and this is not the case here. If your kid likes playing with any little figure sets, watching things spin & twirl, and has imagination...this has lots of possibilities.
