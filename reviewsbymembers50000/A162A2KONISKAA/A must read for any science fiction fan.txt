 I learned of this book through a friend's recommendation, and as a science fiction fan I am eternally grateful (I was recently able to return the favor by sending my friend a copy of Vinge's new book in the same universe,  A Deepness In The Sky).  The book is of epic scale, and combines an  extremely original concept for an alien race with an extremely original  concept for a universe and (careful not to give anything away!) probably  the best conclusion I've ever seen to a book. I've given away more copies  of this book than of any other science fiction book, and had to buy an  extra one myself because the copy I lent out wasn't returned.
