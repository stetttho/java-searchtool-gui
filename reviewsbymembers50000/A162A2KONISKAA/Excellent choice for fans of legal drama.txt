 I quite enjoyed this book, and having finished it went and immediately purchased another Scott Turow book.  It's a pretty intricately woven legal drama, so it requires some up front investment from the reader in  terms of getting oneself sufficiently submerged in the characters &  events to figure out everything that's going on, but the investment pays  off handsomely as the characters are very three dimensional and the puzzle  very interesting.
