 An extremely well crafted legal drama/mystery. Turow has always developed his characters superbly, and his study of narrator Mack Malloy is masterful. Malloy is a deep and believable character, and his personality  gives Turow even better opportunities than usual to exercise his wit--how  often does a page turner legal thriller also have you rolling with laughter  on several occasions? I highly recommend this book, and I second the notion  that this is the perfect place to start if you're wondering if Scott Turow  is for you.
