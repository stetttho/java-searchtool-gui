 If you haven't read Vinge's related work, A Fire Upon The Deep, go read that first, because it's even more brilliant and gives you useful background. But if you're like me and check the "V" section every  time you hit the bookstore thinking "Please God let Vernor Vinge still  be alive and writing science fiction", you won't be disappointed--it's  great!
