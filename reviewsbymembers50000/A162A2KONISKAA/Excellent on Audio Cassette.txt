 I listened to the audio cassette version of this while driving from Alabama to Maryland and found it absolutely superb. One of the best and most involving books-on-tape I've listened to in recent years (I always  listen to one on long cross country drives). Very involving, kept me  thinking & suspenseful throughout the trip.  Also, based on this  experience I'd certainly recommend Joe Mantegna as a reader--a superb  performance, really great & consistent character accents. I found the  story itself compelling and suspenseful. Convinced me I should go out and  get a Scott Turow novel or two in paperback rather than wait until the next  trip!
