 I'm normally a pretty big Greg Bear fan, but I'm going middle-of-the-road on this one. It's got some very cool concepts, develops some interesting tensions & plotlines, but the ending is pretty darn unsatisfying, feels  like it leaves too many things up in the air w/ no real reason. Towards the  end of the book I found myself skimming more quickly, thinking "yes,  yes, I know all that, can we hurry up and get to the cool resolution of all  this..." and then suddenly there I was at the end w/ nothing  particularly cool happening. Everything that -did- happen at the end had  already been described in rumors & foreshadowing, so there was nothing  unexpected left for him to end on. That said, I'll probably buy the  sequel if there is one (surely he has to do a sequel to this, what with  pretty much everything left unfinished), because I definitely enjoy a good  Greg Bear book all griping aside. If you're a read-everything-by-Greg-Bear  person like me, get this. If you're new to Greg Bear or just looking for  some really cool SF to read, go get Anvil of Stars (also by Bear).
