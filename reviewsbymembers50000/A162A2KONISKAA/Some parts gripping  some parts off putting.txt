 There is a great 600 page thriller hiding inside the 800 pages of The Laws of Our Fathers. Specifically, I'd suggest losing the last 100 pages and most of the first 100. The central account of the trial is powerful and  gripping, and the flashbacks to the sixties are well done as well. The  characters, as is usual with Turow, are deep and interesting.    But there  are LONG detours into what I found to be excessive tangential and  background material. This happens on and off throughout, but most of this  is concentrated into the last 100 pages of the book, by which time you've  already had the climax wrap-up of not one but -both- main plot lines, and  you're thinking "and now why do I have to go through ANOTHER 100  pages?" No good reason presents itself (from a thriller reader's point  of view) just a lot of wallowing around in characters' minds.   I have no  argument with those who say Turow (or probably more accurately, this book)  "isn't for everyone", or that the book has touches of  "literature" as opposed to simply mystery/thriller (One of the  editorial review clips called Turow the "thinking man's John  Grisham" which gave me a chuckle). But first of all I'd take exception  with the view that the "literary" elements were exceptionally  well executed, because they do have a tendency to bring an otherwise  gripping plot to a grinding halt. And secondly I think it's fair to warn  readers looking for a mystery/thriller (even a deep complex one) that it  will take 100 pages or so before you start getting what you paid for.    I  enjoyed this book, but you should go into it with eyes open.
