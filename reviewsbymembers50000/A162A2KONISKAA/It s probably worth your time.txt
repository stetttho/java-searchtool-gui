 Sure we all wish Frank Herbert had lived to finish his Dune series, but he didn't and this is the closest you're going to get so just start grinning and bearing it, okay? ;-) If you didn't make it through Herbert's  original 6 books, don't start with this one, because the master himself  definitely tells the story best, but if you're like me and have read pretty  much everything the man ever wrote, just can't possibly get enough Frank  Herbert, this is definitely worth your time.  Brian Herbert and Kevin  Anderson do a credible job of bringing Frank Herbert's characters and  universe back from the dead. The book is a "prequel" to the  original series, and further good news is that there are clear hints that  there will be at least one additional prequel book and a  "postquel" book as well.
