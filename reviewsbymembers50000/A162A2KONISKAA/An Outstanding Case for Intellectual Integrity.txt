 A departure from Sagan's typical fare--less concerned with explaining a particular scientific field, more a cogent defense of the entire scientific enterprise (and a scathing rebuke of many non-scientific, or  "pseudoscientific" to use Sagan's word, arguments commonly  foisted on us as science, in the name of science, or as if they were viable  substitutes for science). Includes a useful discussion of how to  distinguish logical arguments from logical fallacies, and how to spot the  fallacies ("baloney detection") when they are committed. There  isn't a lot of earthshaking new scientific material here; the book is  clearly intended as a critique of how we think and reason...and as an  inspiration to the reader to examine his own reasoning processes.  I  think it clearly a must-read, and I'll happily add my vote to the  "ought to be required reading in every high school" column,  although the central themes of Sagan's argument are guaranteed to produce  controversy (in case you hadn't already figured that out when you saw there  were 145+ customer reviews of this). By the way, the reason I'm back here  at the site is to buy eight more copies and give them to my friends, surely  the most powerful endorsement of all.
