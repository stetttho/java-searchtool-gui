 I received this book as a gift, and as a non-mathematician I thought it was both an interesting biography and an engaging overview of some of the key events and themes in modern mathematics.  Fair warning: it won't in  particular teach you any mathematics per se; it's more about painting a  picture of how mathematicians go about doing the things they do, and what  makes them tick. I would recommend this to those who like to read  biographies, or those who are specifically interested in Paul Erdos  himself, or those who are interested in the mathematics profession (that  is, about what mathematics is like as a pursuit or profession).
