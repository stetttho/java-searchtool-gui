 It's been a long time since I've read a history with such explanatory power and such well-written prose. Diamond undertakes to survey all of human history from the last ice age on down, and chart the rise of  civilizations--and specifically, to explain why cities and complex  societies arose in some areas more quickly than others, and why in still  other areas they never arose at all. His thesis is that ultimately a  combination of environmental factors in particular areas nudged the  inhabitants of those areas in the direction of intensive food production,  which led to increased populations, complex societies, better technology,  and in the end the displacement and even eradication of peoples and  societies who were less fortunate. Diamond does not restrict his focus to  a particular region, civilization, or people. Rather, his text is replete  with examples and case studies from around the world. We learn why horses  were domesticated but zebras were not; we learn why agriculture arose first  in southwest Asia, only later in Mexico and the Andes, and not at all in  ancient Australia and California even though the latter two areas contain  regions which seem perfectly suitable for it. Best of all, though Diamond  is greatly interested in explaining the causes of the European expansion in  recent centuries, he time and again illustrates his thesis with examples  from -other- encounters between peoples of different environmental and  technological backgrounds. The breadth of his examples, and the common  sense appeal of his arguments, lends great credibility to his thesis. My  own degree is in history, and I have worked professionally as a designer of  computer games intended to tell the story of human history. So I've read  quite a few books on this sort of subject and this is by far the best  written and has one of the most interesting (and useful) theses. I  recommend the book without hesitation for both casual and serious students  of history.
