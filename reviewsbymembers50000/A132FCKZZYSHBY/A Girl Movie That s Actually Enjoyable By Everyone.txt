 This is a major chick flick - the true (non-magical, no fairies or glass slippers) story of Cinderalla (no, it's not a true story, the narrator just  claims it's true when telling the story to some other people in the  movie) It's a chick flick, it has romance, it has no nudity, practically  no violence, people talk kind of funny and the star is Drew Barrymore. It's  both realistic and plausible (like i said, no fairies or magic pumpkins or  such things) And yet, for reasons i can't explain, this movie is actually  good. It's not boring, not sappy, not hard to understand and Drew Barrymore  actually does a good job. i'm not sure what to say. i feel like i'm selling  out guy-dom here, but it really is a good movie
