 i don't know why everyone claims this game is gory - it's not much  different than any other shooter. Basically, this game is what you'd expect  - it's a newer shooter than some, so it took all the best parts of those  and added a few, nicer things. Nothing radically different - it's just a  nice, incrementally better shooter.
