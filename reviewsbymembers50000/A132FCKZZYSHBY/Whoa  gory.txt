 First, ya gotta like anime. Do you like Japanese cartoons? Good. Next, ya gotta like serious people and real violence (none of that Dragon Half/Bugs  Bunny-like cartoony violence where no one dies and everyone's eyes turn  into swirling circles). You into serious anime? OK, now here's where Fist  of the North Star turns the corner - how graphic and gory do you like your  deaths? Fist of the North Star is a good anime in a post-apocalyptic world  where a person of super human strength escorts a mute girl in a war against  huge armies conqueoring huge nations (it's an epic).  But where's it  different from the others is that the main character's (the Fist of the  North Star) special attack is that, when he punches you, your innards try  to find ways to escape your body, causing you to explode in a pool of  intestines and livers and stuff. While all the other guys do standard anime  things like punching, kicking and so forth (well, the main bad guy actually  sticks his fingers in you, making big gory holes, but the rest of the  people are normal), the main guy causes really gross explosions. i don't  know what it is with Japanese people and biomass, but with the large  absorbing flesh monster at the end of Akira and the multi-body demon in  Devil Man and the explosions in Fist of the North Star, i think someone has  a real internal organs fetish. If you don't like staring at people's gall  bladders, this might not be the movie for you
