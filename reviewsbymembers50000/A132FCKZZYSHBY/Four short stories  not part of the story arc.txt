 This teensy, teeny book (note the cheap price) contains four articles about the Rising Stars. Well, three of the four do. The 4th is about a kid who claims to have powers to escape his mom and schoolmates. No, these are not plot-important stories. These stories are in no particular order and take place outside of the timeline and story arc of the other two Rising Stars books. Personally, i'd read this after Rising Stars 1 (Born In Fire). The stories here are character studies, mostly while the kids are young, so don't expect much action.  If you read Rising Stars, this is mostly worth reading, although hardly as gripping as the story arc stories in the other two volumes. If you don't read Rising Stars, there's no sense in reading this one.
