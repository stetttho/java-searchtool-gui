 Dr Gigerenzer is one of my very favorite people in this field (um, whatever that is). i absolutely adore the book Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart. That book was a collection of chapters by various authors from his ABC group that put together all the research their group had done into a cohesive whole. This book is a collection of older essays written by Gerd himself, some of them about the same topics covered in Simple Heuristics only in fewer pages and thus in much less detail. Note that all of these essays (i think) have been published before. They're here because you probably don't own all the academic journals these articles came from. There are other essays too. Several are about how psychologists (not average people) misunderstand statistics, especially probabilities and Bayes. Gerd has always seemed pro-human and here he once again writes about how work by Tversky, Kahneman and others claiming humans are lousy at statistics (and thus decision making) is flawed. In a nutshell, humans are good at making decisions but Tversky and friends (like most psychologists, including me) are poor at designing psychology experiments. Another article is about a friend and mentor who did good work but didn't get as much respect as he deserved. So the book is about a lot of things. As before, Gerd is a good writer and can be understood by most people, and he avoids lots of pseudo-math and field-specific jargon, but the book is still fairly dry and isn't super exciting. i don't know if people not in the field would really want to read this. And since this is a collection of unrelated essays, it's probably not a good first introduction to Dr Gigerenzer. But if, like me, you enjoy collecting all of his stuff, this is a good book to have
