 i am a huge Trey Parker fan, so i gotta own everything he did. Unfortunately, that included this film Back in college, Parker did a play about some guy in Colorado history called Alfred Packer. Later, he made a movie out of it. No one would publish it until he became famous, at which point the great Troma team published it This is a musical. Like most Parker films, this one is about Mormons. About half dialog, half singing. Standard cast (Matt Stone, Screech, other UColorado alumni). Surprisingly, there are almost no jokes here - this isn't really a comedy. Well, maybe it is since all the characters act odd (stone is a liar, parker loves his horse, Screech wants to have sex, another guy is always happy), but no one really tells jokes or does anything really unrealistic. Despite supposedly being a cannibal movie, it's not really shocking or antisocial. It's just sort of a historical pic with some really bad songs (the reporter's love song, the schpedoinkle day song). Oh yeah, the plot - Parker (Alfred Packer) leads a bunch of mormons to colorado in the winter. If the movie was 90 minutes, about 70 minutes of it is spent talking about walking and whether they're lost. Maybe 5 minutes is spent when the freezing party eats a guy who was already dead. It's a slow paced movie OK, the movie wasn't all bad. For starters, my easily-offended, churchy boy roommate thought it was hilarious. The trapper song is great. The paranoid Indians who spoke Japanese were great. But overall, this movie was very, very dry and way too long
