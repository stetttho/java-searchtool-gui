 Most games have little bugs that show it was rushed or that no one cared. And even great games like Half-Life have really bad parts like that whole Xen thing. But this game is just plain fantastic i like the weapons. The humor (this is a funny game first person shooter, not a serious spy game) is awesome. i hate the '60s and those ugly constumes, but this game is still wonderful.  Only complaint i have is that i didn't like the scuba diving level. Also, the sharp shooting level where you protect the dumb US guy was pretty hard due to your limited field of view, but still fun This is probably the best FPS i have played in a long, long time
