 For some reason i remember this comic getting really knocked, but i'm looking again at the reviews (only 4?) and they're uniformly good. Huh, maybe my memory is slipping. i'm not going to describe the book because it's the second half of the Power duo. Read the first, see the cliffhanger, read this story which starts 10 years later. i thought i heard reviews claiming this book wasn't as good as the first one. i suppose that's true, although this is one really good book. i also remember reading that people thought this was kind of cliche comic book stuff, and it really isn't. It's still in the Moore/Miller adult theme where the characters have insecurities and make mistakes and all that. It's good stuff. My one complaint is this - the book completely wimps out in the end. And by end i mean the very, very end. All this build up about complex politics and factions and ideas and conspiracies and in the very end we find out who the real villan is and it's... lame. Really lame. Standard comic book villan stuff. Nothing interesting or realistic or insightful or novel. That was a let down. But i'm still glad i spent the money to read this whole series
