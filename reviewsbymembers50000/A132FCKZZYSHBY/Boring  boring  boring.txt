 i bought this book because a)i colelct quotes and b)it sounded controversial. Boy was i ever disappointed Do you know what an anarchist is? There are punks who sing down with the government. There are workers who hate government rules and taxes. There are business men who want an end to regulations. And then there are "intellectuals" who use big words to fill hundreds of pages on steady state economies and the like. Remember Karl Marx, the long winded Marxist who droned on about the proletariat, the bourgeious (sp?) and the formation of capital? This book reads just like that While i suppose these are, technically, quotes, most are several paragraphs long. Is it really a book of quotes when each quote is half a page long? You certainly aren't going to be memorizing any of these - they are way too long These quotes aren't controversial, unless of course your audience loves to use the word proletariat. Most of these quotes are just plain confusing. And they're all boring. Boring, boring, boring The book is horribly one sided. It's not biased towards liberals, it's biased towards long winded "intellectuals" who like big words and vague concepts Bottom line, you won't be quoting these in conversation, using them in term papers or discussing them at group functions. i'm hard pressed to say when you would ever use these quotes - they're just so long and elitistly boring. i really wanted to like a book with a name like "the heretics book of quotations", but i just couldn't
