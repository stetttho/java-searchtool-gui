 A book by an award winning graphics artist. i figured it would be a bunch of pictures of the brain with some text. Nope, it's a ton of text with a fair number of pictures (maybe 1 per 2 pages). Wonderful illustrations but it's hardly a picture book. i'm a graduate student who builds software that mimics the human mind. i'm not a neurologist so i can't claim to review this book the way an expert would, nor can i claim to be particularly interested in the neurology and biology. But the information in here, which explains what all these parts do and what the impact is if they get damaged was really useful to be as a computational cognitive modeler. So what do i like about this book? Two things. First, it's pretty comprehensive and integrates the information well. It hits most of the significant parts of the brain and explains the relationships between them. Second, it's really easy to read, which is great when you have readers like me with a minimal background in this stuff. i've since read a lot of books on psychology, cognitive science and neurology. Few are as easy to understand as this one and few put all the information together as this one.  Note that this book focuses on functionality and puts relatively less emphasis on mechanism. Yes, synapses, sheathing, neurotransmitters and reuptake are covered, but don't expect in-depth coverage of the role of glial cells or calcium influx. This is not your MCAT study guide and isn't a references for neurosurgeons doing their residency. But it does have some good information for people who work in or near the field and is easy enough and enjoyable enough for anyone of practically any age to read
