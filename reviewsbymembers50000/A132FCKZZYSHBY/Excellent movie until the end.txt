 This movie is a classic. It's wonderful. Val Kilmer's wise-ass lines are incredibly funny and makes the whole movie worth while. The one problem -  at the very end, when the geniuses of this thinly-disguised Cal Tech decide  to do something wacky and zany to get back at their professor, it is  impossible to forget that this movie was made in the '80s, with schemes and  humor straight out of Police Academy or Revenge of the Nerds. i hate the  ending - it's so damn silly, moving from the mostly-realistic humor of the  movie's initial dialog to the silly escapades at the end. But despite the  dumb ending, the movie is wonderful, and i wish i could find this on DVD  (any day now, right?)
