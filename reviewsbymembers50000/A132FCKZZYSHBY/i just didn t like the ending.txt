 OK, i suppose this is supposed to sound odd, but i didn't like the ending Winona Ryder, playing the main character who also happens to be the author of the book this is based on, gets in a little trouble and goes to an asylum where people are treated not so great. She meets a strong, rebellious character played by Angelina Jolie. Jolie gets Ryder to be a little rebellious In the end, Ryder reforms her evil ways, plays by the asylum's rules, gets released and writes this book. Jolie, refusing to give in to the asylum, pretty much stays there forever and has a horrible life It was a pretty decently done movie, except that i really didn't like any of the characters (Whoopi Goldberg normally plays someone likable and wise, but here she was neither) and i really wished Jolie had won. Personally, if i had been in that instituion, i would have been as rebellious as Jolie. i cheered for persistent rebellion against abused authority, but in the end giving in to authority was shown as the way to go. So while it was an OK movie, i just didn't like the ending, even if it was a true story
