 i think this was the first formal book on software patterns. It's certainly the most popular - every senior object guy i know has this. It has some good material in it, and if you haven't at least memorized the names of the patterns in this book, you might get left out of a few conversations The one criticism i have is that the authors are clearly not professional writers or teachers. This book is BORING. Really, really boring. It's still a good thing to own, but you ain't gonna read this cover to cover in one sitting and, many times, you'll probably have to steel up your will and tell yourself it's good for you before you crack open the book. It's a good book, but it was written by professional programmers and it shows Of course, i don't know anyone who took the concepts in this book and wrote something easier to read, so you probably should buy this one
