 i'm going to guess these people make console games or wish they did This game is 3rd person, a *really* bad choice for this game. The camera is often stuck behind things This game is hard. That's OK, but you can't save a game, and you *will* die thanks to some surprises, so expect to get bored playing the same thing over and over There are only 11 maps i think, and most are _very_ small. The game is short, although they stretch out the game play by preventing you from saving the game It's a minor complaint, but why don't any of these Asian gangsters recognize a tall, white, albino, bald guy with a UPC code on his head? Is his disguise of a shirt and pants really that good? There are numerous bugs. Or maybe they aren't bugs, just bad design choices. For example, you can't walk through a guarded gate unless you first touch someone who has walked through it - bizare This could have been a really good game, but it isn't.
