 i buy pretty much anything Neil Gaiman writes, so i bought this. My girlfriend and i agreed that the plot was definitely the weakest part of this book, especially the latter half. The book is about what it would be like if all the Marvel villans and superheroes existed in 17th century Europe, which is an interesting idea and done well, but the second half of the book explains that this is no accident, all these heroes suddenly popping up has to do with time travel and modern military experiments and The Watcher and all sorts of "let me explain psuedo-scientifically why this is happening" and that part i hated (i'm told the book was very polarizing with people either loving or hating it; my guess is hate it is more common than love it). And as an Indian, i really can't say i'm too thrilled with the Americans being guarded by a giant, speechless, blond-haired, blue-eyed Indian. They eventually explain that too, but badly  So i expected a better story. What i didn't expect was such fantastic artwork. i'm not a huge art fan. i don't linger on pages. i read word baloons and move on. But the art in this book is amazing. That alone was easily worth the price of the book  My recommendation - find a comic book store and read the first half or so. If you find you're still interested, buy the book. Or if you're a big art fan, buy the book. If you collect everything Gaiman, even the bad stuff, you pretty much have to buy the book. Otherwise, for everyone else, i recommend borrowing a copy or just skipping it altogether  By the way, the book was a good idea and told well until the author tried to explain why everything was happening. Maybe someone else will take a stab at this kind of book and do a better job
