 Wow, i'm confused. When my friends and i make lists of the worst movies of all time, Krull is always at the top of the list. The sci-fi/fantasy group here in Minneapolis has a monthly movie night at a local theatre where we  watch horrible movies and laugh at them. Krull's one of the favorites for  being so bad it's funny.  When i was a kid, i had low standards. Really  low. i loved movies back then that, when i watch them now, i wonder what i  was thinking. How could i have liked Gymkata? How did Beastmaster make it  on my top 10 list? But even back then, i thought Krull was one of the worst  films i had ever seen, second only to treasure of the four crowns. It's not  simply poorly done for now - it was bad decades ago when i was just a kid
