 Not sure whether to give this a 3 or a 4. This is kind of like a first person shooter like half-life, only you are too weak to really get into big  fights. It has some RPG elements, but only barely. The graphics are ugly,  but i don't really care about graphics. The respawning monsters (but not  respawning ammo) are annoying, and the weapons that break after a couple of  shots are MAJORLY ANNOYING!  That alone is reason to have the author  kicked. But despite all of that, the game is actually fun to play, and the  story is somewhat interesting. You could consider Deus Ex to be System  Shock 3, since it's extremely similar only with better technology and  weapons that don't break as easily (although the ammo is still limited -  none of these are Quake kiling sprees). But SS2 is a fun game, you just got  to keep your expectations somewhat low, because there are a lot of little,  annoying things here
