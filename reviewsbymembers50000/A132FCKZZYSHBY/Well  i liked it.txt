 i'm a grad student in AI who has decided to study psychology, a field i know relatively little about. i'd read a lot of specialized psych (mostly cog sci) books that went in-depth on a single topic and decided i wanted to get a book to familiarize myself with the basic concepts. So i ordered this one. i am vocally critical of a lot of text books, but i actually really liked this one. It covered most of what i wanted to know, taught me about all sorts of things i didn't know i wanted to know and was pretty darn well written. It is an intro/survey book, so don't think the ~300 pages here will make you an expert in any single field, but it puts those fields in context well and then points you to where you can get more information. Don't know about other people, especially those who know far more about psychology than i did, but i personally really enjoyed reading this book. A lot
