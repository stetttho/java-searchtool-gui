 i don't know why others rate this so highly - the graphics are OK, i love the fact that you can play with friends (although in the end are different schedules ruined this) and i like importing my own pictures. But the  controls for this game are absolutely frustrating!   Some minor gripes:  the manual doesn't have enough info, combat used to be a MAJOR pain until i  stumbled over the pause commands (and had to play with them to figure out  which ones to set), having the main character enter a store makes life  frustrating for other LAN players, the plot doesn't seem multiplayer  friendly (you lose all those NPCs which are important to the story - the  party is so small), the maps don't make a ton of sense, group movement can  be really annoying and my number one complaint: you can't use arrow keys to  move your character!  i know, it sounds minor, but the view screen is only  large enough to show a few tiles, so you have to scroll the screen, click a  destination point, by which time your guy has already walked there so you  scroll some more, repeat - it gets so that you never actually see your  character because you're so busy setting way points for him to walk. At a  minimum, if you have to play this carpal-tunnel torture of moving your  characters leg by leg, you should at least be able to make the screen  center on the character - the little guy just walks off the screen and you  don't know where he went. At a minimum, let me see more of the map at one  time - i have a 19" monitor and prefer looking at what's happening  rather than the large pretty pictures some artist drew. The plot's OK,  the D&D system is pretty sophisticated, there's some real polish in  places and we've needed a good RPG for a while (i LOVED Fallout, which had  lousy, but still vastly superior, map and movement controls), so i got the  game the very first day it was released (xmas eve), and my roommates and i  played it for 2 weeks, but eventually i got so sick of the control scheme  that i just erased the frustrating thing
