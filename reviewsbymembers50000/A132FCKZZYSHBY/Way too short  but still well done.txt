 This is obviously a mod for Half-Life. But it's a really good one, and i have no problem paying for it. The wierd, flexible weapons they add are really nice. Level design, though linear, is nice. The dinosaur models turned out really nice, although they only appear at the very begining - wish they had been in there more. Driving the tank was pretty cool too. And i even liked the plot. Still, it hit some of my pet peeves. i despise annoyance monsters, the ones with only one hit point that serve only to waste ammo. i don't mind that the game was pretty short (not Hitman short, but still pretty short).
