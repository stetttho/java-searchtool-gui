 This is about one guy wandering around a post-nuke war California. You can  pick up an NPC or two, but it's not really a party-type adventure. i  don't really like post-apocalyptic stuff (i'm more into dragons and magic  and stuff), but this game just plain rules. Plus, it's funny, and i love  little bits of humor in an RPG (it's not silly/funny all the time, but it  has enough cute little parts like a Red Ryder BB Gun to put eyes out and an  X-Files reference to be enjoyable). It has quite a few references to  various movies, which is cute The odd thing about this game is that i've  played it through to completion several times and intend to play it again.  i tried first with an average guy, then i made new characters - a sharp  shooter, a talker, a brute with a 2 intelligence, a bad guy, etc. The  game's different each time (for humor, try talking to NPCs when your  intelligence is 2). i just really like this game
