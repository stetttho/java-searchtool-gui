 i didn't like this game when i first saw it at E3, but when i went back  and played it, it turned out to be pretty good. Not too many boss monsters  (i hate those things), some of the monsters are rather agile, the weapons  are new, the graphics are extremely pretty (nice colors, great water), you  can configure all sorts of things, there are some good guys to help you out  (they show you hidden goodies) and the game makes a lot of effort to be  stable. Hey, they even have a story and little logs you can read to get a  feel for the story. It's not as story-scripted as Half-Life (but then, it  doesn't have the awful Xen world either), and many people prefer the  realistic weapons of Quake to the unusual ones of Unreal. i like the  built-in bots in multiplayer (i think this was the first game to ship with  them), but i'm told the net play is really slow
