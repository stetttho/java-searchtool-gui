 Sometimes it takes a while for music to grow on me. That was definitely true for the Get Up Kids. At first i thought they were kind of slow and boring. Now i love them. i still think some of their songs are boring but i absolutely adore several. So obviously i bought this CD. And i've listened to it ~50 times. And i feel guilty saying this, but it's really rather boring. Tracks 3, 5 and 13 especially annoy me. i kind of like 4 and 12 and maybe 8 but overall, this is a slightly below average CD with some very unlikable tracks. Everyone has their own taste, of course, and the people who like this CD seem to be the same ones who disliked On A Wire. My favorite Kid tracks are Red Letter Day (from Red Letter Day), Action and Action (Something to Write Home About), Anne Arbor (RLD; this one had to grow on me), Burned Bridges (Eudora), Don't Hate Me (4 Minute Mile) and Fall From Grace (On A Wire), Overdue (On A Wire; a little unusual for them, i probably like it because of the video) and Worst Idea (On A Wire). So i guess i was one of the ones who liked On A Wire and maybe this CD just wasn't meant for me. i'm glad others like it
