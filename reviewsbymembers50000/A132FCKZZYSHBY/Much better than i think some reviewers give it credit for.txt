 This was a really good book. Especially for a comic book. It was one of those dark, gritty, realistic(ish) comics but not as dark as Watchmen, Dark Knight Returns or Kingdom Come. Some little touches i liked, like how they had to walk and how the story unfolds over 12 months. And Lazarus' character, although not there for long, was pretty neat. But one thing really bugged me. This comic comes pretty close to being a knock off of Gaiman's 1998 novel Neverwhere. Neverwhere, of course, is much better, which stands to reason since novels generally have more room. In this case, Neverwhere had more characters (there are only 2 characters of any significance in Midnight Nation; space constraints?) and the hero was a dweeb, not a tough-as-nails cop protected by an invincible badass. Did MN copy Neverwhere, which came out ~5 years earlier? i don't know. But it sure seemed like a tough cop comic book knock off. Despite that, i really did like this story
