 i don't think they've release this on DVD. Good thing i bought this on VHS oh so many years ago This movie is silly. It's about a mercenary  killer/soldier of fortune who wants to give up killing to bake cookies. The  problem is, he can't cook. So to earn money until he makes it big in the  cookie business, he goes to a big city with a crime problem and offers to  clean up their streets in exchange for cash. Traxx, the main character, is  stupid, a bad cook and kind of dense, but for some strange reason he can't  be shot (all the bad guys are terrible aims; his inability to be hit by a  bullet when he engages in numerous full scale gun fights is a running joke  in the movie) In the end, the local crime lord calls in three psychopaths  to kill Traxx. These people are so mean, they threaten to kill the crime  lord's accountant unless he sings Old McDonald with them. They pick the  animal, he has to make the sound. They pick a gazelle, which confuses the  poor guy and nearly gets him killed (turns out, "it's a trick  question; gazelle's ain't got no voice box") And then they kidnap  the little league baseball team and Traxx has to go rescue them. Like i  said, this is a silly movie. Not slapstick like the Zucker brothers and  Airplane, but it doesn't pretend to realistic. And while the whole movie  sounds really, really bad, this movie really is incredibly funny,  especially if you're watching it with a bunch of friends who enjoy poking  fun at movies that intentionally try to be bad. This movie is a classic,  and i wish more people had seen it
