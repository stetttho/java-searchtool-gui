 Maybe i'm not as picky as some of the readers here, but i gave up reading comics a long time ago because they lacked both realism and depth. In the last decade, i've only picked up a few graphic novels, all of them the usual suspects (V for Vendetta, Dark Night Returns, Watchmen, Kingdom Come, Sandman, Ronin, etc.). So i think i'm picky. And i really like this. Enough to read it in one sitting and then rush out to buy the three other graphic novels i found by JMS. i'm not a JMS fan. Never saw Babylon 5. i only picked this up because of the recommendations here. i'm really happy i did. Others have described the story so i'll just mention the tone. It's another adult-type comic where the good guys have insecurities and the world at large doesn't worship them. Many of these people with superpowers can't get decent jobs and die as lonley, TV-dinner eating janitors. Some have bad tempers, some are wimps, many are child bullies, a few are primo donnas, all pretty standard human stuff. Think Watchmen. It's the kind of environment (real world) that i know others claim is overdone in comics but i don't think it's done nearly enough.  So it breaks with the cliches of most comics in that there aren't clear good guys and bad guys, where human motivation plays a big role and where the public is more scared than thankful. Others here have said the book is cliche, derivative and poorly paced. Maybe i'm just not smart enough to notice, but i thought it was done wonderfully and uniquely. The only really, really horrible reversion to standard comic book style is at the very end of the second volume (Power). And that volume is pretty good. But this volume is, in my opinion, the strongest of the three
