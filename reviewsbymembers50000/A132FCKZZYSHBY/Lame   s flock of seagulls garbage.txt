 i absolutely loved their first CD, even if the topics were fairly juvenile (high school kid in love, getting a speeding ticket, etc.). i got this one and much of the ska sound from their first CD was replaced by cheesy 80s  synthesizers. Is this the same group? Lord, it's awful. And who remakes  Always Something There To Remind You? Yuch.
