 Not sure what they are (soft punk? acoustic folk alternative?), but they are much deeper and more talented than any Brit pop 80s bands like Big Country. They're fairly slow (a little more energetic than Toad the Wet  Sprocket), somewhat political (probably not as angry as Rage Against the  Machine, close to Ani Difranco) and kind of folky sounding.  i listen to  a LOT of music (ska/alt/punk), and NMA has been one of my very, very  favorite bands since i first saw them on MTV 120 minutes in '87. This CD  has their best known songs, and it's just plain great. i just wish it was  easier to get their stuff in the US - most of their material seems to be  imports, which makes them expensive and hard to find in stores here Why  they haven't been more popular in the US is beyond me. It's not radical  fringe music, no more so than Ben Folds Five, Toad the Wet Sprocket or  NoFX, all of which have been semi-commercially successful here
