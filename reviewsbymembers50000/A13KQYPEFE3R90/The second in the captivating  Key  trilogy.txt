 It's Dana Steele's turn to find her key in order to free the trapped Goddesses. Part of her quest involves coming to terms with the love she had for her former flame, Jordan Hawke, best selling author. As they join forces to solve the riddle and defeat the evil Kane, their love grows strong once again, just in time to try to save Dana's life, and the souls of the Daughters of Glass.   This was not a bad story but this trilogy seems to be dragged out a bit much. The focus of this story is on Dana and Jordan, but too much time in spent exploring the beginning love between Zo and Brad. Nora Roberts should make sure she remembers the focus of the story and doesn't risk having another, secondary relationship steal the show.  I do love the concept of the Celtic Goddesses imrisoned and that only three humans can free them. The magical bend to this story will certainly appeal to fans of the paranormal romance genre. Without the Goddesses and their long suffering guardians Rowena and Pit, there would be no story.
