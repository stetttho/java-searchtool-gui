 I was not overly impressed with this book. The heroine is rather weak and doesn't seem to have much common sense. The hero was portrayed much better but still not overly exceptional. The conflict between them seemed pretty contrived and was not a very strong one. Come on now, the only conflict between them was that the heroine could not admit that her father's work was not always perfect. The whole discord between them was based on the fact that Jacques, the hero, contradicted the heroine, Rylla's fathers points in an educational paper he wrote. Also, the book was supposed to be focused around a search for a lost Incan city and treasure. That was only a minor part of the book. Over half of the book was preparations to go on the expedition and break through the jungle. The actual Incan city when they found it, was only featured in a total of maybe 10 pages r so out of the whole book. I would have preferred to see more of the focus be on the lost city itself. Rylla was TSTL (too stupid to live) in parts too. She goes wandering off in the jungle all alone, during the rainy season and surprise, surprise, gets lost, needing rescued by Jacques. How dumb can a person be to do something like that? And on top of that, she damages her hands by touching exotic plants she knows nothing about, which give her blood poisoning. THEN, she is afraid to tell the rest of the expedition crew of illness, which could have seriously jeopardized the lives of all of them. Needless to say, I guess you can tell I wasn't fond of this one? Not worth the read in my opinion. This book will be dumped in the garbage; I have no desire to read it again and can't believe I actually finished it at all!
