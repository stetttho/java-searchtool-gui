 I just bought this CD yesterday and have already listened to it more times then I can count. I loved their debut album and the first release off of this new album, These Days. The talent these three young men have is well showcased on this CD and their growth as entertainers is evident. This CD has a little bit of everything, upbeat songs, soulful ballads, and some thought-provoking songs as well. All in all, it is a wonderful album and I look forward to hearing the rest of the releases from this CD. So far, These Days is my favorite song on the album, but there are a few others which are really outstanding as well.
