 Courtesy of Raven Reviews (now defunct)  If readers are looking for the ultimate sexy romance collection to add to their bookshelves, then this is a "must-add!" Every major holiday is covered in this spicy collection with the prevailing theme of "Love will find a way."   One story is about a young woman reinventing herself to be the person she's always dreamed of being, and finding the love she's always desired in an unlikely place. How about a young couple separated by a misunderstanding, who after 20 years get a second chance at the love they let slip away? Then there is the story of a single mother who lives solely for her daughter's happiness where that daughter has other plans... to help Mom find love again. A personal favorite of this reviewer is one about a young woman, scarred physically and emotionally as a result of an abusive relationship who only wants to heal, but finds happiness with a man who should represent all she is trying to escape.   Also to be found is a story about a woman who gets stranded in a blizzard and happens upon the mountain retreat of a reclusive author, and finds love as a result. In one of two paranormal stories in the collection, one woman holds the key to unlocking an ancient curse placed on a pair of lovers several lifetimes ago. In the second, which is another one especially loved by this reviewer, a young lady who has dedicated her life to taking care of her ailing grandmother and everyone else, finally gets the chance to find herself through a passionate encounter with a very mysterious stranger. And lastly, what happens when a married couple loses the spark in their relationship, and one makes it their personal goal to reignite their passion?   Kelley A. Hartsell, July 2004.
