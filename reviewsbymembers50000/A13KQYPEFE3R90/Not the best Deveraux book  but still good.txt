 Fiona Burkenhalter is required to go to Florida on a fishing expedition to land a huge contract for the toy company where she works. While on the expedition with guide Ace Montgomery, her client is murdered and she and Ace are blamed. Now Fiona and Ace must try and track down the real killer, and find the answers to the mystery, in their dash through FL and the Everglades.  Perhaps it is because I could only get the abridged version of this book on audio, but High Tide didn't grab me like Deveraux's books usually do. I loved Ace, after all those Montgomery men are to die for. Fiona on the other hand I was unimpressed with. Her entire life is Kimberly, who readers are supposed to be kept guessing as to who exactly she was, though it was pretty obvious to this reader.   The mystery plot line is quite intriguing however and will keep one guessing as to why Ace and Fiona were chosen for this trip and why they were targeted set up for the murder.  Sparks fly between Ace and Fiona, though at first they seem to despise each other. Extreme circumstances can affect anyone though and these two find out just how attracted they are to each other, and discover they may very well be perfect together.
