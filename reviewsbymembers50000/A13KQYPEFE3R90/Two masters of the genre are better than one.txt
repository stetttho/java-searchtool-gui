His mother is dying and takes him off to the resort hotel, Alhambra, a place from her recent past that is full of nothing but happy memories of her late husband, Jack's father. Upon arriving, Jack discovers there is a world beyond ours, "The Territories," and begins an adventure that will change his life forever.  The only thing that can save his mother is a mystical object, the talisman, and Jack must trek across the country, and the territories to bring it back so his mother will live. Others want his mother and her "twinner" in the territories, Queen Laura, dead for reasons of their own and will stop at nothing to see that Jack never makes it to the talisman.  The Talisman is the quintessential fantasy novel that tells of the coming of age for young Jack... There are the typical good versus evil wars, mystical powers, vivid alternate realities, compelling characters, and maximum adventure. Jack is older than his years, with a surprising wisdom for one so young. He sets out on his quest with only his wits, the contents of his backpack, and some mysterious advice from friend Speedy Parker. By the time Jack reaches the resting place of the talisman, readers will have watched him turn from frightened boy to confident young man.  The cast of players is varied and colorful, with the most intriguing character being Wolf, the friendly werewolf who makes it his mission to protect his young friend with his life. Readers will love him dearly, maybe even more than Jack in some instances. A thrilling adventure, The Talisman carries readers on a magical journey, disappointing only in that it has to end.
