 Temperance O'Neil is a young woman in NY pushing for women's rights and helping down on their luck women find jobs. When her mother marries a domineering Scotsman who demands Temperance come to Scotland and find his nephew a wife or she'll lose all access to her inheritance, life is about to change. When she gets to the home of James McCairn, she finds that he may be the one man who can make her change her mind about never falling in love or marrying.  This is classic Deveraux, if not as superb as earlier works. Temperance is a fiercely independent woman who chafes at the confines put on her life by her mother's new husband. James is the proud Highland clan chief who takes his role seriously, in spite of the barely making ends meet state of his clan lands. This two are perfect for each other if only they can see that for themsleves.   James has a tender side, that is evidenced in the relationship he has with the villagers of his land, especially the children. Temperance needs to see that in order to understand that not all men are bad and that she deserves to be happy as well.  Add in a dash of mystery in the form of a hidden treasure and readrs are in for a delightful story.
