 This story picks up just after the "Wrath of the Lamb," the great earthquake affecting the entire world. Our heroes Buck and Rayford, on opposite sides of the ocean, search for their loved ones, praying to find them alive. In the aftermath of the quake, the battle lines between good and evil are more clearly defined as people become more in awe of Nicolae or more clearly sworn to their divine beliefs in God.  Slower going then some of the previous installments, this story will still engage readers, just not quite to the extent of preceding works. There is still plenty of action here, with Nicolae's attempts to thwart the efforts of the Tribulation Force, and the desperate searches occurring around the globe of survivors for their families and friends.
