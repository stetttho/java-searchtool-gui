 Upon hearing Jamie O'Neal's first release from this album, "There Is No Arizona" I found myself blown away by the talent and passion in her voice. I immediately rushed out to buy this CD and it was well worth the investment. Every single song on here is absolutely incredible! From the fast, upbeat, FUN song "Frantic" to the beautifully emotional ballad, "I'm Still Waiting," this CD is chock full of just plain GOOD music. There is no bad song on this CD and it fast became a treasured favorite in my music collection. Jamie O'Neal has so much talent that is evident here, it is expected that she will just continue to rise in the country music world and become a true "diva" like Reba McEntire or Faith Hill.
