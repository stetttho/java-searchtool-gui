 Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques  Four men, Joe "Beaver" Clarendon, Pete Moore, Henry Devlin and Gary Jones, best friends as far back as grade school, come together for their annual hunting expedition. Unfortunately for them, the forests surrounding the cabin have become home to aliens who invade humans' bodies and try to take them over. When a lost hunter comes to their door for assistance, the nightmare really begins. Now the foursome has to fight for their lives to defeat the aliens, costing some of them their lives.  The remaining friends begin to realize there is some kind of connection between the aliens, themselves, and Duddits, a man with Downs Syndrome, who in some unknown way cemented the bond between the four. They now have to get to the bottom of plans of Mr. Gray, the alien who has taken over one of the four. Telepathic abilities aid in their quest, helping the reluctant heroes to find the key to the alien's destruction.  As always, Stephen King gets to the depth of the story, twisting everything around so readers have no idea what is coming next. Dreamcatchers is more sci-fi psychological thriller than horror, but never fails to strike fear in to the hearts and heads of his readers. In addition to scaring fans senseless, he explores the deepest realms of the psyche, representing how there is no stronger weapon then one's own mind.  Duddits is the most interesting of all the players, though for much of the book, he is only present through flashbacks and memories. Readers are drawn to this enigmatic person, wanting to know just what exactly is his connection, other than being the method through which "Beav," Pete, Henry, and "Jonesy" reinforce their relationships, to the story, and why exactly his very name strikes fear in Mr. Gray.
