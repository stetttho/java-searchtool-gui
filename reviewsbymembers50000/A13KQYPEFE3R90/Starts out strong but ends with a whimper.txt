 Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques   The Jewish Remnant have fled Jerusalem and escaped to the safe haven of Petra. Attacked by Carpathia with nuclear missiles, they are protected by miraculous means and not harmed at all. However trouble continues to plague them as the Global Community army continues to attack, with some success.  Meanwhile, key members of the Trib Force have been captured in Greece, needing the aid of fellow members to rescue them. Through it all their faith ever wavers and more believers begin to come in to the fold, despite the constant threat of Carpathia looming over them all.  The beginning of this installment is action packed and non-stop, reminding loyal readers of the earlier books in the series, where Trib Force members were always getting in to, and out of, various scrapes and binds. Then things slow down again as we wait along with the Remnant for the Glorious Appearing at the conclusion of the series.  Carpathia has now fallen in to being nothing more than a bad caricature, whose non-stop screeching and railing has surpassed annoyance. Where he used to be a truly frightening monster of a man, he is nothing now but a whiny pest. Other aspects of the series also begin to lose steam and originality as well. Why on earth would false identity experts give a false name to key player in the Trib Force that is actually the person's own name, with minor differences? Do they really think it's not going to alert the Global Community "Peace keepers" that something is not right?  Loyal fans of the series will continue to read on in the series, if for no other reason but to get to the end and see what happens at the Glorious Appearing. The series did pick up again for a brief while, and this installment started out very promising, only to fall apart half way through the book.  ? Kelley A. Hartsell, January 2006.
