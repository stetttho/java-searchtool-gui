 Courtesy of Love Romances Reviews  This story was indeed a fairy tale... with a twist.  Elena Klovis had lived a life of servitude. Her home is in the Five Hundred Kingdoms, where magic and Tradition rule. Her role was to have been the Cinderella of her kingdom but fate had other plans and left her stuck in a life where she didn't belong.  Instead, her Fairy Godmother takes her under her wing as an apprentice, preparing Elena to become the next Fairy Godmother, When Elena takes over, things are totally different than she had ever expected, and she has her share of frustrations as well as adventures. Especially when she turns a prince into a donkey to teach him manners and respect, and brings him home to work!  Thus begins her greatest adventure yet.  If one is looking for a fantasy tale that is intriguing and full of humor, this is the book to buy. This story has plenty of excitement and adventure to appeal to the most die-hard of fantasy lovers. The details of Elena's duties as Godmother are well done, making it believable, and possibly even making the readers wish to have their own Godmothers to assist in times of trial and need.  There is a romance here as well, though it is by no means the focus of the story, nor is it meant to be. The hero doesn't even make his first appearance until halfway through the book. However, even though the romance is not the primary storyline, it is woven seamlessly into the story, making it a natural progression of the plot line, and sure to attract the interest of romance lovers.  This is a strong story by the well-known and talented Ms. Lackey to launch the new Luna line by Harlequin, and is sure to attract new and old fans of the author, and the genre.   Kelley A.
