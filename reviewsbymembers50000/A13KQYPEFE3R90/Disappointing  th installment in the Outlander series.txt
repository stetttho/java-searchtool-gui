 Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques  The saga of Claire and Jamie Fraser from the Outlander series continues in this, the 5th installment. They now live in North Carolina, having crossed oceans to live a happy life together in young America. Their daughter Brianna and her family, husband Roger, and son Jemmy settle in with the Frasers to share a new life and new adventures. Yet unrest is breaking out in the colonies, unhappy with how England is running things. Jamie is given the job of building an infantry militia to prepare for an outbreak of war.  I could not get in to this book for anything. With all of the past Outlander books, I have been sucked in from page one and couldn't stand to have to take any sorts of breaks from reading. Not so with this one. I was bored senseless and kept trying to come up with excuses to put off reading the book.   Normally I love how the author teaches us along with entertaining us. I've always wondered how people made do in past centuries with amenities we've become used to like toothpaste and toilet paper. There were loads of these bits of trivia throughout which I enjoyed. However, the plot moved so slowly I kept thinking "get on with it already!" and "when will it be over?"   There wasn't enough action here, not like in previous books in the series. To me, this story was all about showing off impressive research, and not enough about the characters' stories. It could have done without a few hundred pages and still gotten the story across without dragging on so long. Was there a reason we were given the lecture on genetics twice, in almost the exact same wording? Details like this had a lot to do with the less than exciting segments of this story, which were too frequent to be enjoyable.
