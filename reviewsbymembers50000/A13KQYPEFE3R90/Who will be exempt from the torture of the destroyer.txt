 This book picks up where book 4 left off, with preparation for the meeting of the witnesses in Jerusalem. Nicolae tries to prevent the meeting then tries to take it over when stopping it isn't possible. God's judgments grow fiercer when after the meeting, the first of the Angel Trumpet Woes hits, with all non-believers being attacked by hideous creatures led by the demon Apollyon. Hattie is more an more torn over the pending birth of hers and Nicolae's babies.  There is more action in this installment, with all the action surrounding the Meeting. the description of the meeting is vivid and very realistic for an event of such magnitude. The demon locusts unleashed are suitably hideous and the suffering of victims is intense in its occurrence.
