 Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques  Dianne Robbins has had a rough life but has never given up. While pregnant, she was abandoned by her husband when they discovered the baby was severely handicapped and unlikely to ever have a normal life. Tim couldn't handle it and took off, leaving Dianne to pick up the pieces of her broken love.   Now, ten years later, Julia, her daughter, is still struggling through her life, with the help of Dianne, Dianne's mother Lucinda, and Juia's uncle and doctor, Alan, who is Dianne's former brother in law.   When Alan brings a young troubled girl, Amy into Dianne's life she finds that she has more love to share then imagined. Will she now open her heart to Alan, the man who has loved her silently and patiently, through it all?  This is a beautiful story of love lost, love found, and all the kinds of love a person can share. Listeners will feel the emotions along with Dianne and company, and come to know these people as friends.  Dianne is a strong woman who stands tough through all the blows life has dealt her, never giving up on her daughter, and never regretting the life she could have had if not for Julia. In Amy, she finds another outlet for the love she has to give, which brightens the young girl's heart and soul, giving her the peace and affection she can't find in her own home. Alan is steadfast in his devotion to Dianne and Julia, never quite hoping, but never giving up either, on the possibility of a deep soul-stirring love with Dianne.  The closing of the book, told from a different perspective from the rest of the story, adds a sweet touch. Some readers my find it unnecessary and too sappy, but I thought it was the perfect way to end the story.
