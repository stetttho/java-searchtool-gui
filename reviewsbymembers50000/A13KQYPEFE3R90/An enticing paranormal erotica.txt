 Courtesy of Love Romances Reviews  Trina was a slave, forced to do the bidding of a powerful sorceress, Kalidah. She had been bought as a young girl, and was kept to perform menial chores and labor for her mistress, while learning the few minor spells she was permitted. What she doesn't know is that she herself has a bit of magick in her soul, not that she had ever been given leave to develop it. Then one day as she is gazing into the fire, she unwittingly casts a powerful spell, introducing her to a whole new world, that of the fire spirits.  She can never let her mistress know, and one day her fate is decided for her. Kalidah is set to sacrifice her young slave to a powerful demon, in order to harness its powers for own selfish desires. When her plan backfires, Trina is given her freedom, and finds a new passion for life, in the form of the mysterious Brand, who appears out of nowhere to assist her in beginning her new life... and awakening burning desires Trina never knew existed.  Trina is on her quest to find her family, and her history, with the help of some friends she meets along the way. All the while on her quest for her family, she is also on a different quest... to explore these passions and erotic fantasies she has suddenly been enlightened to discover.  This is quite an interesting read. Who could have ever dreamed up a world of flame spirits, dancing in the hearths of the ordinary people? Ms. Midnight takes something that seems so ordinary, simple fire, and delves into a whole new world. The passion between Trina and Flame burns brightly, never wavering, even in the light of dangers stalking Trina as she continues her journey of discovery. If one is looking for an erotic foray into another world or alternate reality, this is the book to read. One will never see fire in the same light again after finishing this one.   Kelley A.
