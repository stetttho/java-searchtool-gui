 Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques  Stella Rothchild has just lost her husband and moves to Tennessee to start fresh with her young children. She immediately happens across a management position at the In the Garden nursery and becomes fast friends with the owner, Roz Harper. Stella quickly falls in to the routine of the business, but her strict management techniques put her at odds with landscape designer Logan Kitridge.  In spite of their differences, Stella and Logan slowly develop a new relationship. Just as things are reaching the point of being serious, the resident ghost at Harper House, where Stella and her children live with Roz, takes exception to the growing romance, trying to circumvent Logan and Stella's blooming love. Who is the ghost and why does she hate their new relationship so much?  This first book in the new trilogy will appeal to die hard fans of Nora Roberts. All of her trademark writing skills are found in abundance. The relationship between Logan and Stella develops slowly but steadily, drawing readers in and making them hope for the requisite happy ending. Readers will like the hint of romance to come for other characters in the novel as well.  The addition of an unidentified, unhappy ghost, known only as "the Harper bride," lends another facet to the story, making one eager to find out who she is, why she haunts Harper House, and why she hates the budding romance of Stella and Logan. Many questions are left unanswered, expected to be explained in more depth in the second and final books of the series.
