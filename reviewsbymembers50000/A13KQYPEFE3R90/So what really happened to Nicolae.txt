 Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques  This story starts almost a year after Book 5 ends, with Rayford Steele contemplating the state of the world since the Rapture. He's filled with rage at the fate they've been dealt and wishes he could be the one to destroy Carpathia. Hattie has gone missing, in her own desperate desire to kill Nicolae, and the Trib Force worries she may have unknowingly compromised their safe house. At the same time, believers are preparing their underground network for the day that all are forced to take the Mark of the Beast to buy or sell anything.  This story keeps you guessing as to what will happen to Nicolae and will the Two Witnesses at the wailing wall in Jerusalem finally meet their foretold end. Many different members of the Trib Force wish Nicolae would die and hope they will be the one chosen to see out the prophecy. The book steamrolls through the end, with us meeting new people, and saying good bye to others, good and evil alike. The book ends with a cliff hanger as to what really happened and "whodunit."
