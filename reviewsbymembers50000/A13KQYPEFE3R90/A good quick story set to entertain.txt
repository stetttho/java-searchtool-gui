 Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques  Julie Carlson suspects her husband, Sid, is having an affair and sneaks out one night to follow him. Fortunately for her, her sudden decision to do so saves her from the mysterious man trying to sneak in to the house to kill her. While out on the town tracking Sid she bumps in to "Debbie," who is PI Mac McQuarry undercover on a job. He agrees to help her get the goods on sneaky Sid and in the process they uncover a deeper secret then Julie ever anticipated.  This one wasn't too bad, but it's not something I'd rush out to buy either. It's a good quick listen at only 4 CDs. I was able to do the whole thing in one day at work. I did like how the hero and heroine met... him dressed up like a drag queen which provided several humorous pages of the heroine thinking he was gay.  However, the abridged version seems to cut out much of the deeper anecdotes that would give a better feel for what is happening in the story. As such, some parts feel rushed, and occasionally Julie and Mac's growing relationship feels forced.
