 How can any true fan of Star Wars not like this movie? No, it is not as good as the original three. But then, no matter how incredible the movie is, nothing will ever compare to the originals. Twenty years of anticipation makes it near impossible for anything to be as good as we want it to be. I think it is definitely better then Phantom Menace though.  The acting is trite and the dialogue stilted in some scenes. (I was not impressed with the choice of actors for Anakin though I love Natalie Portman as Amidala.) But then again, George Lucas is known for his incredible effects, not written dialogue. The effects of course are phenomenal, as is to be expected. There are some fabulous fight scenes, especially the one with Yoda. He rocks! I've been dying for a Yoda fight scene since I first discovered him in the original trilogy and Lucas comes through for his fans. I wouldn't buy this movie in the hopes of some scene-stealing performances for Anakin, (See, that shows how impressed I was with him, I can't even remember the actor's name!) but I was satisfied with the other characters. And I can't imagine a better person to play the younger Obi Wan then Ewan MacGregor. But if you want some incredible action and effects, this is the movie to buy.
