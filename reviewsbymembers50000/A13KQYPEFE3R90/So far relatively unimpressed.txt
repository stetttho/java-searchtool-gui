 I purchased this item a few months ago since I am a big audio book fan. My library has a lot of the books on tape in the dual stereo format for which I need balance control. Before purchasing this adapter I could only listen to this format of audio book in my car.  I tried using it for the first time today and was far from thrilled with it's performance. For starters, the adapter doesn't quite fit the headphone jack on my radio so it kept popping out every time I moved the radio even the slightest bit. Since I listen to audio books in the office, I am always moving around with my head phones on.   After much fooling around with, I finally got the adapter to work in the left or "A" position and all was well. Then I switched to the right or "B" position and could not get it to work for anything! I finally gave up after fiddling with it for half an hour.   I need to try this adapter on my walkman to see if I have better luck but haven't had a chance to do that yet. So far though, the Book Cassette Adapter has not been a useful purchase.
