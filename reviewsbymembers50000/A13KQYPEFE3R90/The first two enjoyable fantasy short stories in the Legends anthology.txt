 Little Sisters of Eluria by Stephen King  This is a prequel to the stunning Dark Tower saga. Roland of Gilead is passing through a strange town where he is attacked by slow mutants. He is nursed back to health by sisters he presumes to be of the "Jesus-man Religion." Shortly after arriving, he begins to suspect they have ulterior motives for his person, but are waiting impatiently to reveal the deadly secret.   This story is classic Roland. He is on his long journey, runs into trouble and needs aid to escape. The young woman who aids him puts her own life at risk and he must escape the town with guns a-blazing. Short and enjoyable, Dark Tower fans will love this addition to the series.   Since I had just finished the entire saga back to back on CD last year, I was glad to get another chance to have a brief visit with one of my all time favorite characters from any book I have ever read.  Majipoor - Seventh Shrine by Robert Silverberg  This story was harder to follow and I had to listen to it more then once to get even a basic understanding of the story. Unfortunately I think I still missed the deeper meaning of the story.  This is about the discovery of an ancient shrine in the desert, with the archeologist who found it being subsequently murdered. There are many mysteries surrounding the shrine, endangering the lives of anyone who tries to open it.   Having not read any other books by this author, this story is extremely difficult to get into. I was confused throughout the whole thing trying to figure out what was happening. Those who have read other books in the Majipoor series are bound to enjoy this one though.
