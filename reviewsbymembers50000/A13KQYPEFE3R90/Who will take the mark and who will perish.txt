 Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques  Here in the eighth installment in the hit series Left Behind, all people are required to take the mark of Carpathia/Satan to prove their loyalty. Should they refuse, they will be put to death via one of the "loyalty enforcers," AKA guillotines. No I'm not giving any spoilers here, so don't worry!   The Tribulation Force is more at risk then ever, with their refusal to accept Carpathia as their new "god and savior." Now they have to rely on an underground network of believers to survive in the coming half of the Tribulation, which will only get harder to endure.  This one starts to show the serious decline of Carpathia into a truly evil monster. Carpathia is actually becoming more of a caricature then anything, with his behavior changing and even his way of speaking being different post-resurrection. The Trib Force members are still exactly the same, with the men playing hero every chance they get and the women being shuffled to the sidelines to sit back and wait on their men.  Not a bad book, but I think the series is maybe starting to lose steam a bit.
