 I have been reading the other reviews here for "Empire Records", and noticed that most of you are probably under the age of 18.  WEll, I am well over that age, and I still loved this movie!!! I have seen it several times now, and it is just one of the movies that have that unique quality - to be viewed many times - The story centers around a record store, Empire Records, which is about to be turned into a "Music Town", and the fact that one of the employee's, Dazed and Confused's pothead, Rory Cochrane, loses all the store's money in Atlantic city.  When all the teen employees find out they go out of their way to save the little store.  It's a day-in-the-life kind of film.  It stars Anthony LaPaglia as the manager, Robin Tuney, Liv Tyler, Renee Zellwigger, Debi Mazar, Maxwell Caulfield, Brendan Sexton, and Ethan Embry.  I thought that everyone was great in the film. And the soundtrack really rocks!!  It is without a doubt, one of the best soundtracks ever, it is a big part of what makes the film so great.  It's really just a fun, teenage romp of a film.  For those teens at heart(like myself), it can be just as good as it was for the teens out there that have all given this movie rave reviews.  ...  (you won't be disappointed!!)
