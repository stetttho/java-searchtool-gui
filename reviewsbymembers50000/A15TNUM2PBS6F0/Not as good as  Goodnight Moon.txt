 which is also written by Margaret Wise Brown, and also illustrated by Clement Hurd.  The drawing of the bunny is similar to Goodnight Moon's illustration, but the rest of the artwork is different.  Like a few of the other reviewers here, my only recollection of this tale is from seeing the film, "Wit" where the story is read to a woman dying of cancer. She is comforted by it, and I was brought literally to tears. It is a moving story, but it is certainly not as baby friendly as "Moon" is.  I found the story itself so endearing, but mixed with the illustration, it is a little freaky and not pleasing to the eye. "Goodnight Moon" has much brighter colors, more of a primary color base,  and easier on the eyes and mind.    Also, when I read this to my 1 1/2 yr old. for the first time, he was not the least bit interested in the pictures or story.  He took off running.  He has loved "Moon" since he was 10 months old, and never tires of it. I think it is more of a toddler book than this one is.   This is more for children between 3 - 5 years old, so long as the pictures don't frighten them. I bought this for really cheap at a yard sale, and am glad I did. It was a bit disappointing since both my son and I had loved "Goodnight Moon" so much. From the reviews I have read here, this story sends mixed messages.  The message of the story is that a mother's love is unconditional. This was written in a different time, and I think there is a lot of fear driven into society lately.  Plus, I can see how people can have that sense of the story with the creepy pictures. I'm sure the writer was trying to show the love a mother has for her child. It is not intended to scare anyone.  It is a timeless story that will tug at your heartstrings.  It's very moving to see the love a mother has for her child.     I recommend it for it's story content.  Be weary of the illustrations as they are bound to sway your opinion of the story itself.
