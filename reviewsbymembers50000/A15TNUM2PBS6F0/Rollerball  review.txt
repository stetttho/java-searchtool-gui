 I had been wanting to see this movie for years, and could never find it on video.  After seeing the preview of the new Rollerball, My husband rented this 1975 film starring James Caan as the Rollerball champion< Jonathan. It's set in the future, as the filmmakers of the 70's saw the future, which is very archaic by today's standards.  Basically, the film is the Rollerball tournaments, very 70's parties, and a lot of James Caan, which is fine by me. And some sort of mind bending drugs that make everyone behave a certain way, or at least the way that John Houseman wants them to. Caan turns in a great performance as always.  Is it worth watching?  I'd say so.  It had a few slow parts, but the acting and storyline keep you interested enough to see it through to it's very fitting ending.
