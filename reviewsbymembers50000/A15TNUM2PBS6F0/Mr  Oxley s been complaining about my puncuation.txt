 "so i'm careful to get here before nine"...MM has this classic and very funny line in this movie.  It's the line that I always remember.  That and "Find someone to type this", Charles Coburn says to MM, his secretary.   This is a great comedy from the 1950's that stars Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers.  Marilyn is in a supporting role as the secretary to Charles Coburn, but she truly shows her side as a comedic actress in this.  I have always been a great fan of Cary Grant, and he is just hilarious as the absent minded doctor who is trying to concoct a youth serum.  Little does he know, all it takes is a monkee..this is a fun movie.  and it shows the comedic talents of grant, rogers, and monroe..
