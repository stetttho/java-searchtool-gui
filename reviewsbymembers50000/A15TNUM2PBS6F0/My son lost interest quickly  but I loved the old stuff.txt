 It was a trip down memory lane for me. My son did dance but there is too much inbetween stuff that just didn't do anything for him. Those three furry looking tall pelican like creatures bopping in tune to the music was a bad idea. He turned away and lost all interest in that part. He did enjoy the LA LAing(became a la laer himself by the end), and the Elmo song. I think the Count scared him, but he loved the rest of this menagrie of old sesame mixed with some new. I don't highly recommend buying this, rent it first. I think that anyone that grew up watching Sesame Street might appreciate this more than their children because of the older songs "C is for cookie"< "Rubber Duckie" "Doin' the Pigdeon", "Count it Higher", and the "Aardvak song", and the "alligator" song. It's missing a few though, "Born to Add", "letter B" were my old faves that were takeoffs of real rock songs. Big Bird grows more annoying as the hour wears on complaining about not being able to find la laers.  This just teaches little ones whining gets you what you want.  Not a good lesson!   This has some hits and misses..Not worth buying.  Eileen Famiglietti
