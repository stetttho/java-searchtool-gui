 For those fans of corny silly romantic stories set to the backdrop of WWII and a beautiful Greek Island, you will love this one. My husband rented it because it was set against WWII.  According to him it was not historically accurate.  According to me, it is a lavishly beautiful film to look at, but the storyline is weak, the script is about as good as a harlequin romance, and Cage's acting is horrendous.  How often does an american actor actually get any foreign accent right?  Pretty much never.   Penelope Cruz is Pelagia, a woman who dresses like a nurse cuz she wants to be a doctor.  She is a decent actress, Cage makes her look even better in their scenes together as I think this was just a bad choice for him as an acting role.  I usually like him, but lately he's done no movies I find him appealing in lately.  As the other reviewers are saying here, the characters are never developed so you don't really know enough to care what happens to them.  I do think that Christian Bale's character, Mandras, is the only character that comes close to any development.  You think he's bad for awhile, but he actually does end up being good..all for love of course. It wasn't a totally terrible movie, but it wasn't great.  I thought the script was just too corny and I couldn't believe the words coming out of John Hurt's character. He plays Pelagia's father.  It's like Danielle Steel wrote this.  He was very good in this movie as he is in everything I've seen him in.   This is also very predictable.  If you LOVED Titanic or Pearl Harbor, chances are you will appreciate this film more than me. I just have to really be in love with the script in a film to appreciate it and this script is drivel.  I'm sure the book is much better.
