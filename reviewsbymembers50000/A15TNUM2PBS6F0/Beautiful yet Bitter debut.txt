 This album is such an amazingly well written and musically ecletic arrangement that it deserves a listen. You can really sense Sinead's anger and rage here. While she may have her own personal demons, she is an utterly amazing talent that shouldn't be overlooked. She has an impressive range in her voice that is what makes this album so wildly creative.  Screaming like a banshee one minute, and merely uttering a whisper(had to turn up the volume) in a split second. It never ceases to amaze me.    I've been listening to this album for ten years, and it still shines among my collection even after all these years. If you are a fan of O'Connor, I highly recommend this! "Mandika" alone is worth the price.   It's the best song on the album.
