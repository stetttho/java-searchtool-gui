 it's got "Peace Frog", which is one of the most original Doors' songs if not one of the original songs by any musician. It also has "Roadhouse Blues", which is, for me, the ultimate driving song. I always catch myself(before the cops do) doing at least 60, and this is in a residential area. That songs just totally rocks me out, and it also happens to be one of all time favorite songs. Aside from "Roadhouse Blues", and "Peace Frog", the rest of the album really disappointed me. "The Spy" was the only other song here that I really appreciated. I have been a long time Doors' fan, and I have heard all their studio albums. This is not up to par with their debut album or with "The Soft Parade".  I am a huge Blues' fan, so it's not that I don't appreciate their homage to that genre of music.  They just don't seem like the usual Doors' here. Jim's voice is faltering, and the last song especially, "Maggie M'Gill", had me totally at a loss for words as I thought Jim sounded awful here.  Like, was he possibly drugged up or drunk when recording?  Nonetheless, it is worth purchasing for the three songs mentioned here.  Eileen Famiglietti
