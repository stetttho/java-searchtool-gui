 If you are looking for a c.d. you can listen to while you work out, this is perfect. There really aren't any slow songs on it, so it keeps my pace up on the treadmill..It's a fun group of songs to exercise to so it doesn't really seem like exercise. My only gripe is that my copy of this disc is ruined! i must have worn it out.   This would probably be great for disc jockeys as well. It has a great mix of dance/r&b/funky sounding songs from the late 60's, 70's and 80's on it. Some are sort of obscure, but I can't help but want to dance to the entire group of songs here.  I don't know if this is indeed "pure funk" but it is pure fun. Highly recommended!
