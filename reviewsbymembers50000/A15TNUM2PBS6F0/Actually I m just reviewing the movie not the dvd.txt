 I caught 'Roads to Riches' on late night HBO. It is a fine film, with even better acting by Rose McGowan as a striper, Robert Forrester as a washed up child actor who is trying to win cash on game shows and scam some soda company, and Kip Pardue, a dashing looking young actor who plays a Texan that has just made his way to L.A. to become an actor but ends up elsewhere. Henry, Kip's character, meets Jack(Forrester) at a game show. They become buddies and Jack shows Henry around and to Moira(McGowan), who was taken under Jack's wing and works as a striper.   "Roads" is a dramatic movie with some twists to our three loners lives.  It is part love story, part character study, and at times not sure what it wants to be. It was the heart of its' stars that made it shine bright enough to be worthy of this review. If you are fans of any of these stars, it's worth a look.
