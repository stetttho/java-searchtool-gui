 "Havana Daydreamin" is an earlier album of JB's.  It doesn't have many of the hits that we hear at the concerts, but it has some great songs that tell stories.  It makes you want to sit back and relax with a mixed drink, and it also makes you want to get up and two step. In listening to the earlier albums, I have noticed that he seems to mix up his country western music with the calypso/rock/hawaiian tropical sound that we all know and love.  He didn't leave his country western heart to quickly, and I appreciate it.  I love all his music.  "My head hurts, My feet stink, and I don't love Jesus" is more of a country song, and the back up band is The Oak Ridge Boys, which is a country western group that had great success in the 70's and 80's.    There aren't very many commercial successes from this album, and I will admit that the only songs I really knew before getting to know this album were "The Captain and the Kid", and "Havana Daydreamin'"  I do think that Jimmy is a great storyteller, and such a talented musician.  I listen to his music with an open mind, and am learning to appreciate the earlier JB as I have only been a fan since the box set came out.  While it isn't one of the classic and essential albums, it is still pretty good.
