 Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice show their pure genius here. Well, technically the play itself is what I mean, and I have seen this as a play as well...Both the film adaption and play are excellent.  I consider this to be one of the best musicals of all time. The film takes a cast of JCS and sticks them in a desert in Israel to act out the entire play.  Everyone in this is has a great voice and brings great life to their character.  And they look like they were having a ball.  There is no talking in this film, one must pay complete attention to the music as it tells the story.  This is Webber/Rice's signature.  Evita is told the same way.  Ted Neeley, who plays our title character, looks just like the "image" of Jesus that we have inbedded in our heads.  It is so uncanny, and he is an amazing talent.  His voice is wonderful.  Yvonne Elliman is Mary Magdelene is just breathtaking.  Her voice during "I don't know how to love him" is spine tingling.  This is my favorite song from this show.. Recognize her voice? She does the hit< "If I can't have you" from Saturday Night Fever.   If you are just looking for the story of Jesus, you may be disturbed by this.  It is not the same story we have seen on t.v.  There are visions that may upset some viewers.  I hadn't seen this in awhile and was a little shocked myself at some things, but I still love it.  I love all the songs, and am a fan of most of Webber & Rice's work. I think this was a good purchase, but I wouldn't ever show it to my children.  or teens!  It's Judas's image of Jesus, and it's not the same image that we are taught about growing up.  So, be aware of that.
