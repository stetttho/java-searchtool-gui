 lives Pooh and his friends. This dvd captures the oldest and most endearing adventurous stories of that silly ol' bear and his sweet friends.  It also has great extras! There is a game, which I think is most definitely more aimed for young children, but I couldn't resist!  What fun! This is an ultimate disney purchase.  It ranks up there with the special edition of Snow White on dvd, which is the best Disney DVD to own in my opinion. See my review of Snow White for more! I don't really remember watching Pooh cartoons when I was growing up, but I do remember watching them over and over when I was babysitting. That got me hooked on Pooh. I was 19, and now am 32..and still adore Pooh and his friends. Classic disney cartoons that make us laugh and smile should enchant anyone! Watching these videos as an adult just makes me remember how simple life was as a child, and it reminds me of the importance of friendship.   These old Pooh cartoons look outstanding on dvd, and also had such better animators than the newer Pooh videos. You can see the comparision of the two on the extras of the dvd.   Pooh has become a huge franchise, but I opt for this one dvd, and my stuffed Pooh bear and the old books. All the new stuff is just not the same.  He also has a huge fan base ranging widely in age. There are many adults that love him. What's not to love? He's a cuddly bear, and such a sweet one. even without his honeypot. I highly recommending purchasing this dvd! It is worth the price for all the extras and especially for the three animation shorts staring Pooh and Co.   As Tigger would say, TTFN..ta ta for now!
