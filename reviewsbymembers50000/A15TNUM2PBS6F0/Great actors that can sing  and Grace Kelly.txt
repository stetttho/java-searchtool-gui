 Now there is a combination worthy of four stars!  This was on PBS last night, and seeing as it had three movies stars that I like, I couldn't resist it! I am a long time fan of the movie musical, and I particularly enjoyed this one.  It has Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, and Grace Kelly in it.  Sinatra and Crosby do most of the crooning, but Kelly also sings a little bit. She can really sing too!  What an amazing star!  She could act, look so elegant and graceful, and sing!   Usually the music takes top shelf over the acting, but I quite enjoyed both in this musical remake of "The Philadelphia Story". If you liked "The Philadelphia Story", and you like musicals. You will probably like this movie a lot.   It is a fun movie with two hip crooners as it's stars.   Two thumbs up! Way up!
