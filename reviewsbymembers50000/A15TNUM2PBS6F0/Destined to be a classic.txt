 I saw this movie when it came out in the theaters back in 1993, and bought the dvd two years ago.  It has been viewed quite a few times, and I never tire of it.   "Nightmare" has great music, some haunting and some fun("What's this is my personal favorite), great animation, and I love the story. Jack Skellington, the pumpkin King, is the main character.  At the end of Halloween he is all in a tither as to what to do next?  The next major holiday with a figure is Christmas.  Wwhile wondering in the woods, he discovers the gateways to other holidays.  He falls into "Christmas Town" and is in awe. He comes up with the idea of stealing Christmas as he isn't in the mood to wait around for the next Halloween. After discovering Christmas, Jack spends half his time trying to figure it all out and understand it. This film is a bit dark, and I certainly don't recommend it as a family film.  I say parents should watch it first, alone, then decide for themselves if they think their children will be okay with it.  There are some scary ghoulish images. I personally think it's an adult movie, with it's dark humor and imagery.    Decide for yourself..it is worth it.
