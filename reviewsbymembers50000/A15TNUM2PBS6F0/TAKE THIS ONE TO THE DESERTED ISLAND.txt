 Abbey Road is the only c.d. by the Beatles that I own, and that is fine with me!!! I hear enough of their "hits" on the oldies station.   This is definitive!!! Forget the singles album, This is one of those c.d.'s that I would take on a deserted island.  I love every single song on this album.  It's a perfect Beatles album and a must for every fan !!!!!  This is a true classic...Paul, John, George, and Ringo are all great genuises of rock and roll because of their amazing writing and performing.... The Beatles Rock!!
