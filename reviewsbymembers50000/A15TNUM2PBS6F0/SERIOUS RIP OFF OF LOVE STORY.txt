 My title pretty much gives away what happens in this movie.  If you are a fan of Chris Klein or Leelee Sobieski, you are so much better off renting Election and Never Been Kissed.  This movie is so bad.  I wish I had read all these reviews before deciding to waste my time.   I'm so tired of badly written movies making there way to the big screen. This one is one of the worst, It makes me much more confident than I could also have my screenplay made into a film, It couldn't be any worse than this stupid movie. And just who are we supposed to like here?  I found myself feeling sorry for the boyfriend that Leelee jilts. He is played by Josh Hartnett, and he's so cute and charming.  She is just pure evil, sneaking around on him with Chris Klein.  and then the whole "cancer" thing.  I will admit I did cry, but I think deep down I was crying more for Josh. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!! at least Love Story was original at the time...
