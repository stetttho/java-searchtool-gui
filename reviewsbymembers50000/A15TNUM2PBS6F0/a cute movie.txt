 I am going to have to completely disagree with the other customer review here.  While The Slugger's Wife wasn't a great classic romantic comedy to come out of the 80's, it was worth the two hours I spent watching it on cable.   I think this must have been one of Rebecca Demorney's earliest roles, possibly after Risky Business.   She plays a singer(well, err...she tries to be a singer) that performs covers of popular rock songs in cheezy/lounge singer mode.  I'm sure it was her own voice too.  That part of the film was a bit cheezy, but it was the 80's!  Michael O'Keefe plays a major league baseball player who falls instantly in love with her as he sees her perform at a club.   He doesn't win her right away, he actually almost "strikes out" completely.  Eventually they start dating and get married.   He wants her to be there for the games and not work, and she wants to continue with her lame singing career.   This was definitely not one of the best movies from the 80s, but it is worth a look at in my opinion.  It was kind of sweet.  The music however, was more of a cheeze factor than real music. I didn't feel my time had been wasted on this movie. I found it to be a cute little romantic comedy that seemed to be forgotten.
