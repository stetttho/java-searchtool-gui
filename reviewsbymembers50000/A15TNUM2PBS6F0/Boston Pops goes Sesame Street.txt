 In this dvd you have, the Boston POPS orchestra with it's truly fantastic conductor, Keith Lockhart, Elmo and the Sesame Street gang, and the masterful piece of music "Peter and the Wolf"..What a combination!  It's very educational and entertaining.  How many kids' dvd's can you say that about? To any and all Muppet fans of all ages, this is a instant classic.  I loved it just as much as my 2 yr. old son did.   He loves every single bit of the video, and I have no qualms about him watching it.   Two year olds don't know what popguns are.  This is all just in good fun. It's a great dvd for any young child's collection!
