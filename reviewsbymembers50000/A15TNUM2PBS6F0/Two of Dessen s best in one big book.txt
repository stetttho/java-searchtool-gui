 Both of these stories about teenaged girls, Halley & Scarlett in "Someone like you" and Colie in "Keeping the moon" held me captive. Sarah Dessens writing is refreshingly honest, and she is a highly respected writer for the genre. Ive never seen a bad review of her writing.  I identified so well with all of these characters on some level.  I was never pregnant, but one of my best friends was.  These books suck you right in. I highly recommend you buying this! I am glad I did.
