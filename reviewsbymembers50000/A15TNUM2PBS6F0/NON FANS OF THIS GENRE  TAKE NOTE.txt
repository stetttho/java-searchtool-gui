 I haven't read any of the Harry Potter books nor have I read any books or watched any movies about wizards and their great magic. Well, make one exception..The Wizard of Oz. I really had no desire to see this movie, I didn't want to read the books because I just never had any interest and they were not what I Like to read. My husband rented this, and I watched with him.  It has opened my eyes to a new genre of film! (if not books) "Harry Potter" is a fun, enchanting, and quite involved look into the world of how wizards come to learn the craft, and how they are chosen, and Harry Potter is the main character. Speaking of characters, he comes across some mighty interesting ones in his quest for the stone.   I recommend this one for the entire family.  There may be a few close to scary momments for the young ones, but it really is great film that you can safely allow your children to view. It has something everyone can appreciate. Plus, it is fun to watch and the story is easy enough to follow. Just don't take your eyes from the screen, there is so much to see in the visually stunning movie!   Worth renting for the acting, which was oustanding by the whole cast, and it's special effects.
