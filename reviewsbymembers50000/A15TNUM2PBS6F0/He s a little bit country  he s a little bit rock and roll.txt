 I found this tape (...) and gave it to my husband for christmas one year, as he is a huge parrothead. It's found it's way to my car, so I have been listening to it alot lately.  This is a great find and is certainly worth more than what I paid for it! Usually when you buy a tape that cheap there is maybe one good song on the whole album. This is chock full of good songs, some of them being staples at his concerts now.  Like, "Love song(why don't we get drunk)" and "He went to Paris" ..  Then you have the more country sounded songs like, "Peanutbutter conspiracy".  He seems like he was more of a country singer in his early days, but went way of the carribean sounds("Cuban Crime of Passion") after this album.  I think true Parrotheads will appreciate this album if they don't have it already.  It came out in 1973, so it must be one of the first.   Buffett has a sound like no other performer, being a bit country and rock and roll.  I'm not sure how to classify this album, I guess I'll just say it's BUFFETT. Worth buying!!!
