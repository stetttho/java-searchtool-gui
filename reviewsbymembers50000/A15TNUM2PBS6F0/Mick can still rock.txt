 As one of the members of "Dinosaur Rock", Mick Jagger may look old, but man, has this guy got energy!  I saw him perform "God Give me Everything" on a live show recently, and he was so energetic, and still seemed as virile as ever up there on stage. His voice still sounds as good as it ever did...He certainly isn't a classically trained vocalist..but he's Mick Jagger!!!  He rocks the house with this album. That is my favorite song(and yes, it's the one hit so far)off the album.  It is also my one year old son's fave!  He really gets down to this song.  It must be the rocking beat...It is Mick at his finest senior momment. He amazes me.  He looks old, but he seems just the same as he did when he was younger.  The rest of the album all seems as good as the single.  I could dance to the entire album pretty much. There are some very catchy tunes here. I rarely buy new c.d.'s as many of them are so disappointing, but this is one c.d. I am still listening to.   I have been a long time fan of the Stones, and appreciate this album just as much as the older Stones' record.
