 I feel asleep three times during the duration of my viewing of "Lord of the Rings", which I thought I'd never even watch at all.  As a non fan of this genre, I don't know what came over me to rent this. See my review of Harry Potter, I talk about how I am not a fan of the genre, but I really enjoyed the movie. Well, things didn't work the same in this situation.  The movie has an amazing performance by Ian McKellen, who is a consumate professional actor. He takes the craft seriously, and he is a truly amazing talent and I love to watch him. I actually did like this movie to some extent, but it just kept going on and on and on and on and on.... It just didn't do anything for me, the first hour was good, It had me interested in wanting to know more of the story, but it just dragged way too much. I was stunned by the visuals, they are just breath taking.  It is a beautifully filmed zonker. Sorry, but this is my honest opinion, and we are all entitled. I have never read any of the books, and I never plan to as I just can't get into this genre of book or movie. This is way too long! It's over three hours. Drink some coffee and don't watch this too late. Eileen Famiglietti
