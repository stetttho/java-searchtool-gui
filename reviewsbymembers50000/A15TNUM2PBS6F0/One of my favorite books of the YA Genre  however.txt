 I think it shouldn't have a genre, like Stargirl..it must not be like all the others around it in it's society. I am 35 years old, and I LOVED this book by the brilliant Jerry Spinelli. Why - it was easy to follow and get into and it brought me back to those days with such clarity.  This is the only book of his I've read, but you can be rest assured that I will be stocking my children's bookshelves with his entire body of work.  Leo Borlock narrates - Stargirl is new to the school, unusual yet sweet, and a true individual.  As things unfurl between them, they develop a true friendship. Jerry Spinelli does a truly wonderful job giving his characters depth(Especially Stargirl) and meaning.  He is one of the best writers I've read anything from lately. I hadn't read anything this quickly in a long time, that's how hooked I was on this short and sweet and shining work.   One thing about most high school students, male or female, is most of us like to be well liked but the underlying meaning to it all in those years is to be true oneself no matter how outside the "norm" you may be. Be you, and that should be all that matters - sort of like Stargirl. Because you may just stay inside someone's head for years and years..like Leo.  Eileen F.
