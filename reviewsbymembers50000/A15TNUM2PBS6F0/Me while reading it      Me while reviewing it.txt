 As I was perusing Amazon one night last week, I stumbled upon Carolyn Mackler's new novel, "The Earth, my butt, and other big round things."  I took a 'look inside', and feel in love with Virginia Shreves, its' main character.  I've never related so well to a fictional character so vividly before.  All those feelings of no self worth or confidence came flooding back to me, and it was very real to me.   Chapter one has Virginia lip locked with Froggy, a boy from school who has an hour to kill before his trombone lesson.  They spend an hour in her bedroom kissing every Monday.  When his hands start roaming, she pretty much sends him packing. Being overweight, Virginia feels very uncomfortable with the idea of someone of the opposite sex seeing her body.  She doesn't even look in the mirror, at least not yet.   I am not one to give much away in my reviews.  I will tell you that you will laugh alot, most likely cry(i did), smile, and just love reading it.  I am very happy I bought my own copy.   As Virginia's story progresses and the 'perfect' shell of a family shatters, she is transformed.  I loved this 'coming of age story'....
