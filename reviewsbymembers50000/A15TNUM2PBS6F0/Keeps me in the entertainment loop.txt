 EW has been somewhat of a bible to a lot of members in my family who likes the various sources of entertainment that are represented here. It's very helpful in keeping me informed on the latest and supposedly greatest in books, movies(even though I rarely go), t.v., and video(off to the video store i go!). My favorite part of this magazine is the t.v. section where the schedule of different shows has little blurbs from one of EW's writers. I laugh everytime I read these. The latest issue had a ton of beautiful photographs of different entertainers. It's worth buying! I'm not giving my mom back her copy.   It's not always this good, but at least every issue has that t.v. guy.   Keep it in the bathroom..it's good reading there.  and I don't mean that in a bad way.
