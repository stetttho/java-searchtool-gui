 This is a very depressing story.  I knew it was going to be when I started it, but I kept going because Michael Cunningham's prose had me hooked.  He is an amazingly gifted writer, and he has created a very unique and gloomy story here. I was a bit confused with the chapters going back and forth between the three women's stories at first.  After awhile I started to get to know each character and see the way he'd written it to all come out together as one. Instead of going into detail about each, I will simply say this.  These are lives that are not happy, they all seem to be walking zombie-like through life and not really living it.  It is very dreary. Even though this is going to have the sensitive emotional wrecks like me out there bawling, You will get an eyeful of beautiful writing as well.
