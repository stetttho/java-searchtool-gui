 for renting this awful movie!! I didn't laugh once in this moronic movie. This is strictly for men between the ages of 17 and 23, or fans of "dude where's my car"...which could relatively be close to the same audience. I am a grown woman who appreciates comedy, and this was not funny.  It was poorly written and poorly acted. It could have at least been camp, but it wasn't even that. It's just a total waste of film. Stay away from this one!I don't recommend it at all. I'd recommend "Police Academy" over this, and i didn't even like that all that much. Eileen Famiglietti
