 This is one of my favorite films of all time.  It's beautifully filmed and acted.  Depp being the lead character of the title.  He is so incredibly gifted, he has played different kinds of characters.  Straying from the stereotypes, he just shines in everything he does. Gilbert Grape lives in a small town, he has two younger sisters, a retarded brother, played brilliantly by Leonardo Dicaprio, and a morbidly obese mother.  Gilbert is the father figure in this film, and he has little chance to just be himself for awhile.  He always seems to be the one taking care of his brother, ARnie, while his sisters complain about him.  He is just going through life, working at the local grocery store, and fooling around with a married woman, played quite well by Mary Steenbergen. Then enter Becky, played cooly by Juliette Lewis.  She is a perfect match for Gilbert, and although she is only stopping by for a few days, you can see she will forever stay with Gilbert in his heart. This is not a very happy movie. It certainly has a few laughs, but it is rather serious, and takes a rather sad turn.  But it is a beautiful story, and worth watching.
