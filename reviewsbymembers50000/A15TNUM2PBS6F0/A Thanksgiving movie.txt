 With Thanksgiving just around the corner, this movie is a great classic to be viewed about now.  Just like "Its' a wonderful life" is pretty much mandatory now for Christmas, PT&A is really a movie to be watched by all for turkey day. It's the day before Thanksgiving and Neal, played with great comedic genius and timing by Steve Martin, just wants to get home and be with his family for the holiday. Of course, everything that could go wrong, does go wrong.   Enter John Candy, as Del, the lovable bear of a guy who seems to turn up everywhere Neal does throughout pretty much the entire film.  They have all sorts of mishaps together the first being bumped off their flight to Chicago.  They manage to travel along side even though Neal is clearly not happy while Del has this goofy grin on his face through most of the movie. There are so many hiliarious momments throughout the film, but it is also quite heartwarming.  The end of it is very moving.   I think that John Candy and Steve Martin had great chemistry as a comedy duo.  They were both really funny in this movie.  If you are a fan of either one of them, you'd definitely appreciate this movie. and Happy Thanksgiving!
