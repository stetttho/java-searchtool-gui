 This is one my favorite greatest albums because every song on it is a true hit, and I never skip a single song on the disc. It's perfection in the greatest hits category. Especially if you are a fan of nice mellow soft/countryish rock, basically, music that just gives you a "peaceful easy feeling".  The more I play it, the more I love it.  This highlights the ballads that The Eagles made in the early 70's.  There are a few songs that pick up the pace a bit -- "Already Gone", "Take It Easy", and "One of these Nights". This is great to have on in the car, especially when one is trying to calm their overtired and cranky toddler.  It definitely gave him a peaceful feeling.  I speak from experience. Also, the songwriting here is very well done, certainly not the best, but these are songs I really "listen" to.  I just don't mindlessly let it play it the background and relax all the time. I actually really paid attention to what they were saying in this last listening.  Nice songs all around.  Nothing I'd be embarrassed to listen to in front of my parents, my children, my co-workers.  This album is for all ages! I have read some of the other reviews here, and people are far too hung up on how this album did on some chart. I really could care less, I've been listening to this album for 12 years, technically I had the album, which I pretty much destroyed with my overuse. Now, I have the disc, which is frequently listened to when I am in the mood for mellow rock.  They are number one on my list, which is the only list/chart that matters to me. Buy the second greatest hits for their harder rock hits.
