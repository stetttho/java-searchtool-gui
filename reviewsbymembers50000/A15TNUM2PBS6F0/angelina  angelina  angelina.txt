 what were you thinking? It is becoming consistent that the winner of best supporting actress at the Oscars, comes out with a really bad movie.  I am not a fan of the game nor this movie. She is a very talented actress, and I am disappointed that she is in this video game/movie.  Maybe you need to be a fan of the game, and totally obsessed with it or her to appreciate this movie.  I thought it was really lame, and it put me to sleep in about twenty minutes.   While there may be alot of great action sequences in this movie, there is no plot.  Just Jolie in some sexy lingerie.   Only for fans of game...
