 "Married to the Mob" is a very funny movie about an Italian Mob Wife who wants out.  It is one of my ultimate favorite movies of all time because it is so funny, so well acted, and pure fun to watch.  Michelle Pfieffer stars as Angela Demarco, the wife of Frankie "Cucumber" Demarco(played by Alec Baldwin) and mother to 7 year old Joey.   Frustrated by the lifestyle, she just wants to start over fresh and have a second chance for a good life.  She asks for a divorce, which is ignored. Then Frankie and his mistress get iced by the big boss, Tony "The Tiger" Russo, played by Dean Stockwell, who roars as this cool mob boss.  Angela is beside herself, and ready to move out and on with her life.  She moves out of the neighborhood and into a tenament in a seedy looking neighborhood.  She plans to get a job and raise her son on her own.  She is then being unknowingly surveillanced by the FBI, and Agent Mike Dowling(Matthew Modine) becomes interested in her.  Young Pfeiffer and Modine seem to have a little chemistry going in the movie. They are very cute together.   Once Frank is dead, Tony tries to seduce Angela.  His wife, Connie, played by a hilarious Mercedes Ruehl who is just wonderful in this role, tries to stop it. Tony tries and fails several times.   Mike falls hard for Angela, but eventually she finds out that the FBI is behind it all. They want to use her to get Tony. Chaos ensues with comedy following.  All the actors in this movie work so well together, too. I liked every performance in the movie.  Pfeiffer being the best. She plays the character with zest and the accent is perfect!   It is a movie I intend to purchase soon as I just don't tire of it's upbeat, funny, and romantic story.   Highly recommended!!!
