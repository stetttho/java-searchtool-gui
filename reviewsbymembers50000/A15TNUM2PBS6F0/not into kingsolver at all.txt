 I tried to read this book, first time around I got half way through, then got bored. It was certainly descriptive, even if I could have cared less about the characters.  Also, the writer doesn't write her characters to be likable.  So just what is her point?   I tried to read it again, and totally didn't like Kingsolver's style of writing. She is boring!  Also, she just tries to use big words to make up for lack of talent.  This is pure drivel. Try Cathie Pelletier, now there is a writer! Kingsolver is all hype.
