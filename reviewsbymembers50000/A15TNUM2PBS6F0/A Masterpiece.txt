 "Finding Neverland" is a very enchanting, emotional, and fantastic movie. I laughed. I cried.  "My heart blew up like a balloon." (I'm quoting a movie there.) Johnny Depp is such an amazing actor, and he brought J.M. Barrie to life in a wonderful way. If you are a fan of Barrie, Peter Pan, and fantastically filmed movies that the whole family can enjoy, rent it, buy it! You will enjoy the journey to Neverland.  Eileen Famiglietti
