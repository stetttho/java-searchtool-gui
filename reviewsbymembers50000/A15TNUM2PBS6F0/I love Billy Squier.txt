 I can remember proudly displaying my "I love Billy Squier" pin at school on my jean jacket, and all I have to say 20 years later is where the heck is that pin?  Back then, I thought Billy Squier was sexy with his long hair and tight jeans, and not only was he beautiful, but he could rock out!!   Sure, he has cut his hair, gotten older, and is now wearing glasses, but this album STILL rocks.  The album title song, 'Emotions in Motion', the rock anthem, "Everybody Wants you", and the more subtle hit, "She's a runner" all pack in wallop of a punch in the rock and roll ring. For those fans of 80's hard rock, this is one of the defining albums by one of the most talented musicians of the time.  Billy has a great voice, great range, and is also a great guitar player.  And even in the early 90's could still wail.  I had the great priviledge to see him in concert on the Rock it tonight tour.  One of my favorite musicians of all time has written, lyrically and musically.  Even though a lot of the songs sound very much alike, I still really like this record.  It epitomizes the music of that unforgettable decade -- the 80's. I still listen to a lot of 80's albums now and this is among my favorites.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
