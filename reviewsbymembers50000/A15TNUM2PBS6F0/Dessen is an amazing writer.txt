 Despite the fact that I am not a teenager, who this book is more aimed at, I loved it!  I had found it relatively cheap, and thought I'd buy it instead of getting it out of the library.  I am a fledgling writer of YA stories, and I had done some homework on the writers. Sarah Dessen is considered to be a highly respected writer in this field, and I can see why.  "Dreamland" was a incredibly good story about an impending senior, Caitlin O'Koren, and how her life changes after her "perfect" sister, Cass, leaves without saying anything to the family.  You see how this affects the entire family.  Caitlin then meets Rogerson, a very intriguing character who I right away, liked.  It was almost too easy, but as the story progresses we learn some dark secrets about him that do not make him a likable character, but you can't help but feel sorry for him. One thing, as a parent, that I learned is that parents can often not even know their own teenaged children.  I have discovered that it's truly important to have an open and honest relationship with your teenagers, at least as much as you can.  The parents in the story are so far away, and don't have a clue about what is really going on as they are too busy with their own lives and also many parents have far too high expectations of their teens as well.  Teenagers are people, but they are going through an extremely unique period in life. Caitlin really came to life for me,. This is an extremely well told tale of a teenager's life as she embarks on a journey of self discovery while dealing with losing her sister and being abused by her boyfriend. It's worth buying!! Dessen is a true visionary in the YA lit. world. I hope I can be that good a writer someday.
