 This soundtrack is a perfect compliment to the film, and It's gloriously remastered to make you feel you are still watching and not just listening to the music from the movie itself. In the liner notes I read the original soundtrack only consisted of five songs, the five songs we hear sung in the film.  "One song/I'm Wishing", "Hi Ho", "The Yodeling Song", "Some day my prince will come", and "Whistle while you work".   Over the years, the instrumental musical score was thrown in to create a wonderful masterpiece of a soundtrack. I highly recommend purchasing this. If you like the music from the movie, you will love this. After hearing this for the first time(I've now heard it at least 100, thanks to my 2 yr. old), the movie is brought out to be more of a musical adventure as well as a wonderful story to be told. This is my son's favorite c.d., and he has so much fun dancing and singing along.
