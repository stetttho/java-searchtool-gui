 This is definitely a must have c.d. for the big fans of the movie version of Grease.   All the songs that are performed in the film, are on this album. I had the LP of this when the movie came out, I have no idea where it is so I had to buy the c.d. ...it is one of the few c.d.'s I own that I listen to repeatedly..it's also the most fun to listen to cuz I know the words to every song, and I have fun singing along to it while I am doing house work, or most recently, in my car, after a rough day, it was the perfect music to lift my spirits up. I loved the play too, and there a few songs that aren't here from the play, but they weren't in the movie either!  It's probably a good idea to have both the original Broadway version of the soundtrack along with this if you have seen the play and miss the few missing songs. GREASE IS THE WORD......
