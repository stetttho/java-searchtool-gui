 This c.d. is awesome!!! I love it!  I totally recommend this to fans of Sinatra and Dean Martin.  Sammy is cool, too, but I haven't bought any of his c.d.'s where as I have bought the hits of the other two. The Rat Pack is not only these three men, who are all long gone now physically, but a way of life, a genre of it's own kind.  I think spiritually and musically they will always be here.  This is music that can be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates different kinds of music.  It makes for a great gift too! as it was for me.  All hail Rat Pack!!!
