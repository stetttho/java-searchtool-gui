 My son is two years old, and He loves this dvd. He requests it by name, and I always sit and watch it with him.  He loves Elmo, the firefighters, and even the "fillers" that other reviewers aren't too pleased with. This dvd is for the entire family -- we can all learn something here.While some reviewers think that 2 yrs. old is far too young, I disagree. With repeat viewings, and there have been many of them, my son, realizes that with fire comes the fire fighters who will keep us all safe, warm, and fuzzy -- Sort of like Elmo. Elmo is very scared after the grease fire at Hooper's store. His raw emotion of fear truly chokes me up. Never before has a muppet had such an impact on me or my son.  Frankie, my son, always points out to me, "he's scared".  So, not only is he learning fire safety, but he learning emotion and how to figure out how someone is feeling. Then after Firefighter Bill takes Elmo around the firehouse, Frankie is relieved to see Elmo back to his usual cute self, playing with the firetrucks like any other kid. NYFD does an outstanding job helping Sesame Street viewers and residents how to handle the situation should a fire happen.  They were very reassuring and were genuinely concerned about Elmo. I think this is a perfect addition to fans of Elmo, and fans of Fightfighters.  There is a sequence of "elmo's World", some other little cartoons and a video with the 3 little pigs and the big bad wolf called, "get out stay out don't you go back in!"  and little ones get their turn to show us what firefighters wear and how they feel about them.  Mr. Noodles sister comes for a silly visit and figures out what the fighter of the flames must wear to be safe.  Also, a beautiful girl and close friend of Elmo's, Sabrina, shows us all her family's plan in case of fire. My son adores the whole dvd, even the silly Baby bear "hero Guy" that the movie ends with.
