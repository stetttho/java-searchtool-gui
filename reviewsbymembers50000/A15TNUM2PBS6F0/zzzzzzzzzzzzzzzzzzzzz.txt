 When I saw this in the theater, not willingly mind you, I fell asleep for a good amount of the movie.  This is the most boring movie in the history of film!!! I just don't understand what makes this film oscar worthy!  Look at some of the other movies that have won -- they weren't boring!  but for one year I guess the academy decided to give the award to the most boring movie of the year if not of the century. I tried to watch this again when I was much older, being 13 years old the first time, I didn't take it too seriously.  I just used it as a sleeping aid.  I still thought it was dreadfully boring even 20 someodd years later.  It's a movie about nothing but some english chaps running, and running and running...  run away from this one.  Don't let the Oscar nod sway you, it was a bad year for Oscar that year.
