 "Rhythm & Blue"...it's right there in the title! Parents of toddlers will appreciate this, and your toddlers will especially appreciate this particular Blues' Video as it consists of rhymes, songs, and learning rhythm.  I think this is the only Blues' Clues' video that toddlers really get any education out of. The rest are fun, but because this is made up of all music and rhyming, I think and know from my own experience, that a toddler really can love and learn(without realizing) from this. Blue wants to play a song game, a rousing "blues clues" game helps figure it out! Also she wants to do an inside(it's raining out) musical thing, hence the other episode on the tape begins... It's all great fun hearing and singing(yes, even I sang along!) to "two little monkeys", "if you're happy and you know it", "the itsy bitsy spider", and "head, shoulders, knees, and toes". Highly recommending this one!! Eileen Famiglietti
