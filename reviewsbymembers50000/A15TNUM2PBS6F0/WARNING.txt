 (...) This is an extremely violent movie with many graphic scenes (...).  The movie itself isn't particulary worth viewing anyway.  The plot is very disjointed, and lacking.  I didn't know what was going on half the time, and they just kept jumping back and forth to different characters and not explaining why or who they were.  The script was just plain awful, and I thought John Travolta was overacting.  Although the character often reminded you of his characters in both "Get Shorty" and "Pulp Fiction".   He plays the bad guy, who is trying to wipe out terrorism with terrorism.  He has Hugh Jackman, of XMEN, hack into a bank's computer so he can be financially secure with his terrorist activity.  Halle Berry, who looks great in this movie, plays Travolta's sidekick.  For reasons unbeknown to me, she decides to reveal her breasts in this movie.  (...) The whole movie is just confusing, and doesn't delve to deep into what is going on, and why.  It's just a mishmash of events, almost plotless, and just has a lot of stuff blowing up throughout it. I say throw this fish back.
