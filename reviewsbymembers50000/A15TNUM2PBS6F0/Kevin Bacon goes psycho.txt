 When Hollow Man was released in theaters, it had been panned by the critics. So, I was a bit weary renting it.  If I didn't like Kevin Bacon, I think I would've passed it up.   I gave this movie 3 stars because of the great performance by Bacon and the awesome special effects.  The plot, and the rest of the performances were all pretty bad.   If you like horror movies with really good special effects and if you don't care much about the acting(aside from Bacon) and story, you might like this movie. When I first heard about this movie, I thought the story sounded interesting(a scientist goes slowly mad throughout the film, after volunteering himself to be turned invisible and eventually starts killing -- animals and people).  Maybe they needed a rewrite.  One thing I know is they needed to take Elizabeth Shue aside and tell her to get some acting lessons -- She turns in a very wooden performance.  She had more heart in The Karate Kid.   This film is definitely worth a look just for the amazing special effects made for the transformation from visible to invisible and back to visible again.
