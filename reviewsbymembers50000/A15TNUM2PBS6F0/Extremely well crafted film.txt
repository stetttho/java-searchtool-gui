 This is a mystery/crime drama of the 1990's that is one of the best films of all time.  JMO.. It has all the elements of what I feel truly makes a movie "one of the best".   The Screenplay - without a decent screenplay, you have a bad film.  This is without a doubt an amazingly great screenplay.  It makes the film.  While it does borrow from old films from time to time, it is just so well done.  Good job, screenwriter! You got my vote for Eileen's Oscars as the Academy sometimes doesn't know what they are talking about. The Acting - Totally awesome acting here.  Kevin Spacey, hands down, is the best actor around right now.  The rest of the cast is excellent.  Kudos to Chazz Palminteiri!! He is very convincing as the cop.  I love when he goes off on Verbal Kent about who Kaiser Sose really is. Little does he know... The Plot -- This is a great story.  The first time you see it, you will not be sure who Kaiser Sose really is. I knew, but my husband begged to differ.   The ending  -- One of the BEST ENDINGS of a movie ever!! Well, next to Casablanca, it is the second best This is just all my own opinions, but I've seen this movie several times now, and just like it more everytime.  It is very well crafted in every capacity a film can be. It is worth buying!!  I gotta run out and get my copy soon.
