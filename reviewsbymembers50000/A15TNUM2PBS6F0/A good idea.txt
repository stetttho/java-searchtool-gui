 gone bad.  This film was not completely terrible but it is no horror classic, I don't even think it's much of a horror movie -- It isn't scary, or gory, or suspenseful.  It had potentional but it just kind of fell flat on it's face.   Karen Allen, (Raiders of the lost arc, Scrooged, and Animal House), plays the single mother who's computerized address book is being used by the "soul" of the serial killer.  he kills off her friends that are in the book.   I can see why this is a "straight to video" movie.  The acting wasn't any worse than most horror movies, but the execution of the film is just poor.  If you are a real horror film buff, watch Nightmare on elm street as opposed to this.  The killer is actually scary!   ...
