 This movie actually started out okay, and I thought that Josh Hartnett's character was sweet. I didn't think it was that funny at all, though, and once the friends make a bet that Josh's character can't last without any form of sex for the whole period of Lent it goes on a downward spiral from ok movie to very bad movie. Curious to see how it all ends and if he makes it, I stupidly keep watching.  The ending is terrible!  Let's just say I agree with the "spoiler" reviewer from Oxfordshire, England about what the ex-girlfriend does. I should've just watched Pearl Harbor again.  Don't waste your money on this. Be like me, and at least wait for it on cable.
