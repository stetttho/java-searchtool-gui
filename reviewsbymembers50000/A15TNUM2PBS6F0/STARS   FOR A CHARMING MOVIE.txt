 I have been reading the reviews here, and I guess this movie was not received very well.  I thought it was a cute, charming, comedy with romance thrown in.  The film stars Jason Biggs as Paul, fresh from American Pie, and Mena Suvari as Dora, who was covered in rose petals in American Beauty.  They are being portrayed as the "Losers" of the film, but after watching the roommates who tortured Paul for not being like them and for having a girl pay attention to him without help from a PILL slipped into her drink, we all find out who the real losers are. Greg Kinnear plays the professor that Dora is having an affair with, just so she can have a residence.  He doesn't end up being a very good guy in this film, which is what I was used to seeing him as, but he does a good job in his role.   While this isn't one of the best movies of the year, it had some charm to it and I recommend it for a romantic comedy rental..A good date movie.
