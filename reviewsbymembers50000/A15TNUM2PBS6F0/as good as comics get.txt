 I'll admit the only reason I wanted to read this was because I had already seen the movie, which was excellent.  I have to say that this probably the best comic I have ever read.  Of course, my comic reading days were limited to Archie comics, and it's been a long time since I read those.  The characters were all so funny and realistic.  I can't help but relate to Enid as I felt alienated and alone also at that age.   This is worth a look at if you like comics of all kinds.  Thumbs way up!
