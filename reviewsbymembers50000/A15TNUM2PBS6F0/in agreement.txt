 I'm going to have to totally agree with the other reviewers here on the bad quality of the transfer to compact disc.  While I love both the movie and all the music from Some Like it HOt, and I love listening to this, it doesn't sound very clear.  It's like listening to a scratchy record. Maybe it needs to be remastered again?  or is the best it can get? It is very good, a great ensemble of jazzy tunes that all were in the movie including all three of the songs MM sang: Running wild, I'm thru with love, and I wanna be loved by you.   I like how some dialogue is thrown into the mix too.  It's a fun soundtrack if you don't mind the quality of the sound.
