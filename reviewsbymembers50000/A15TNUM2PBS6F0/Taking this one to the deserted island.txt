 I have long been a Beatles fan, and always liked all of John Lennon's solo efforts as well.  At least the more popular songs like, Imagine, Woman, Watching the Wheels, and Starting Over. Then, while visiting a friend, I saw this compliation.  It is without a doubt one of the best c.d.'s of the compliation category.   I didn't hear the whole thing til the day after Christmas, (It was a gift), I am so happy with this c.d.  You usually can't go wrong getting the greatest hits, and this is definitely "the very best of John Lennon" as the cover of the disc states. There were a few songs I didn't know, but with each listening to this c.d., I seem to enjoy the whole thing more and more.  It is a great tribute to the genius called John Lennon.  I believe he is one of the greatest songwriters I have ever had the pleasure to hear.  It's so sad that he had to be taken from us so soon.. TO YOU JOHN, You'll live forever through this tribute.
