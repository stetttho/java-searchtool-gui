 Not as well mixed as the first round of 'Greatest Hits', but this album still is pretty good.  It has some of my favorite tunes to sing along with like "Hotel California", "Heartache Tonight", "Life in the fast lane", and "The Long Run".   The rest of the songs on the album aren't really all that well known unless you are a purchaser of every album in The Eagles music catalog.  The only other song I know is "I can't tell you why".   Not that these songs are not good, but I can't say they are the 'best' I've heard from this group.  That is what the first greatest hits album from them is all about.  This is more of a peak into some of the other recordings from what I think is one of the best bands of all time.
