 Brittany has come a long way since the film "Clueless"..she was Cher's "project"..Wow! what a great performance she turns in in this very predictable yet engrossing enough thriller starring her and Michael Douglas. It's hardly the best film of the year. I am of the opinion that 2001 was not a very good year for films.  A lot of bad movies came out.  The really good screenplay writers were on strike, I guess. The script is really formulatic to all thrillers.  It did keep my attention, and I thought that Douglas was good in it..but Murphy gets kudos from me for her awesome portrayal of the chick that coos "I'll never telllll" Worth a look for diehard Murphy fans.  It's a very predictable movie, and has no surprises.  Some of the acting was awful!  Famke Jenseen..you are beautiful to look at, but you can't act worth a lick! the girl playing the daughter was a better actress.  Note: the girl playing the daughter was the youngest child in The Patriot with Mel Gibson for those of you that think she looked familiar..her hair was colored for this.   for a thriller, you may be disappointed, but at least you'll get to see Murphys' finest 2 hours.
