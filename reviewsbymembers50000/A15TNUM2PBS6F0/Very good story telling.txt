 As an aspiring author of young adult fiction, I decided to do some research and read what teens are reading right now. "When Dad Killed Mom" by Julius Lester is a great story, and I liked the way the story was told in alternating each chapter between Jeremy and Jenna being the narrator.  Their father has just killed their mother, and throughout the story, we come to find out the real truths that are hidden.  and about the secrets that are kept.  It's a good look into the relationships of parents and children, and also sibling relationships as well.   I was hooked from the first page, and read the second half in one sitting!! I didn't want to move until I finished it.  I think Lester has a great vision for teens' emotions.  While you could definitely tell it was an adult who wrote the book, I thought he did an outstanding job being the voice of both a teenage girl and boy in the same story.  He knows how to get the reader hooked, and keep them interested.  Considering the attention span of teenagers, this is a good quality for a book.  and it's not too long.  I am an adult, 32 years old, and I really thought this was a very interesting tale, and I thought he told it beautifully.  he's a good writer.  I hope I can be that good one day.
