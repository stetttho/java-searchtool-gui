 One rainy day I spent at Borders, I listened to this c.d. as I had liked "LIke a bird" when I heard the first time on mtv.  That was probably 8 months ago.  For some insane reason, I bopped along for quite a while.   I got the disc for Christmas and have listened to it once(I don't think I could handle it ever again).  It was like listening to someone scrap their nails down a chalkboard.  She has the most annoying voice.  It sounds like she is singing through her nosy..VERY NASALLY...Some say she has a unique voice, it's unique alright.  but not good.  I found the songs so repetitive..How many times is she going to turn out the light?   Maybe if you are a rap fan, you might appreciate this more as she seems to have hip/hop and rap influences and it's pretty obvious in her music.  "Like a Bird" is the one song that everyone knows and the only song that she doesn't sound so whiny. I saw the video before the album even really hit the stores and I really liked it.    It seems that some c.d.'s sound better in the store, but once you actually own it and listen, it just isn't the same. I have no intention of listening to this c.d. again!   I'm sure a lot of people appreciate her very unique voice, but I am just perturbed.  I wonder how many people have already sold their copy to a used record store?
