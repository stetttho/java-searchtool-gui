 The movie itself is such a wonderful Disney classic that appeals to such a wide audience.  This dvd is one of the best dvd's to own in my opinion!  There are so many extras on it!! and there is a whole other dvd with extras(havent' watched that yet!!!) The first dvd has the movie, and documentaries on the making of the movie, music video(or movie clip, but Barbara STreisand singing "some day my prince will come".  DVD is chock full of fun things to watch for the entire family!!!! All the added stuff is just as good as the movie itself. There is even a game, "Dopey's mine ride"(not the exact title but close enough), I had a blast playing that!! But you have to know the movie really really really well!!! Watch the movie a few times before playing. I highly recommend picking this dvd up for your own personnal libarary, it is a great package and a great Disney classic.
