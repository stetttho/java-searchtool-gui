 While "Pat the Bunny" may be a true classic children's book, it is also a great curiousity piece for infants big enough to know what they are looking at somewhat. My son is ten months old and loves to literally tear this book apart as the binding is sort of flimsy.  He loves to touch everything and play with all the "interactive" things throughout the book.  He just gets more curious with each page, and wants to figure out how it all works. This is great for babies and preschoolers that love to touch everything they see.
