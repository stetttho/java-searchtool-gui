 If you can put up with the repetitious sounds coming out of "bop it" you may just like it a little bit. It's a memory game that relys on the recording of a man's voice saying "Bop it", "Twist it", "Pull It", and in one mode of play, "Pass it"(It can be a team game as well as a solo)..and when you mess up, it shouts 'OWWWWWWWWWW"!   There are three modes of play.  You can play it solo, either to the voice or just the noise that each of the three commands makes.  Or you can play it with other people in a circle. Is it fun?  It can be but it gets boring very fast.  My nieces and nephews, who are all between the ages of 5 and 10, have all played it, and they last about two minutes a session.  Meanwhile, my son, who is one, just loves it!  Everytime I play it(which lasts maybe five minutes), he runs over and laughs at the sounds and wants to steal it away from me so he can hear the sounds. Educational?  Not really, It requires having some kind of memory, so your memory skills may be improve.  and tolerance for annoying sounds will also improve or at least start to take form. Durable?  My son has dropped it a number of times and it still works! So it is pretty durable.  ...
