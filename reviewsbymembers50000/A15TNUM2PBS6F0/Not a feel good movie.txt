 but "once were warriors" will keep you enthralled with it's powerhouse performances and it's stark reality.  Watching this is like watching real life, which in this case, is a very sad life indeed. Enter Jake, a violent, manipulative (fill in the blank)that has his family's fate controlled by his behavior.  He beats his wife to a bloody pulp.  He drinks his days away after being laid off, and money appears in his hands from out of nowhere.  This is not exactly the "father of the year" nor "husband of the year" for that matter.  His wife, along with the rest of the women in the story start off seeming submissive but by the end things change, for the worst in one way. But in another, it is good.  The wife finally takes her survival tactics and her fierce determination for a better life for both her and her children, and leaves her husband.  They go home to her tribe/family known as Maori, who were once warriors... I recommend it, but get out the tissues.  It's a real sad look into the lives of a family living with an abusive and downright mean patriarch.
