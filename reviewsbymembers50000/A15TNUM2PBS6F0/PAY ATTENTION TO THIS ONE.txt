 I liked this movie alot, but I found that if I even turned my head away for a split second that I would miss something.  It's the kind of movie that you really need to pay attention to at all times.   It was a very interesting idea that was well crafted.  I think that Guy Pearce was amazing in this movie.  It has a few twists and turns that are well worth watcing.  The idea of telling everything in reverse was different, and there were only a few times that I truly felt confused.  (I think my husband asking me a thousand ??'s during the movie didn't help), I just may watch it again to see if I missed anything. It's a original film, and one of the better films I've seen this year.  Worth a rental fee, just be in the mood it.
