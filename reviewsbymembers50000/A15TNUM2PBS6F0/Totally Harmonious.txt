 Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young all have very distintive voices that blend together so harmoniously. "So Far" is a compliation of some of the early hits of CSNY that display this all too well. This is a perfect mix of songs for the casual and even more serious fan of the group.  It's mostly acoustic, and all the songs are so beautifully arranged and extremely well written. A group of great tunes for the very talented group of CSNY. I highly recommend this one!! as there isn't a bad song in the bunch. (I can't say that about every hits album I have heard) Plan to play this one continously...
