 Titan A.E. is an animated film that has some scenes too familiar to Star Wars scenes.  The big fans of S.W. will pick up on them. So, so much for total originality.  What this movie did have was pretty cool animation and some actors voices you may recognize, and a story line that held my interest long enough.  It was hard to imagine Nathan Lane as a bug eating bug when(Hello, Lion king fans),after hearing him as the sidekick in Lion King.  Remember he sang "Haikuna Matata"?   It wasn't too bad, worth a rental if you are a fan of animated films.  It might be a little too long for the younger children
