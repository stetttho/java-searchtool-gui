 "White Sky, Black Ice" came highly recommended to me by a friend, and I am glad I picked it up.   It's a mystery/police drama set in Alaska.  While reading I couldn't help but be reminded of one of my all time dramatic/comedy shows, "Northern Exposure".  That made me like this book all the more.   Also, I thought the character of Nathan Active, the state trooper who becomes suspicious of two deaths and investigates them much further, was one of the best character's I read.  Trooper Activ is born to a Native Alaskan woamn, but raised by a white couple.  He is a single man, probably in his late 30's early 40's, cynical, witty in a dry off putting way, and just an amazingly well written character.  I totally appreciated everything he said and I could easily see that character being brought to life on film because he is so vivid. Once he hears of some strange and illegal goings on at the mine called "The Grey Wolf", he is moreso even more leery.  He does everything in his power to find out what has really happened and why. I got put off of mysteries after attempting to read the terrible writings of Sue Grafton, but my friend, Diana, gave Stan Jones such high regard, I knew I had to try it.  I am very happy I did.  I've always been a fan of the genre, and this book was  unique and very well written.  It has very interesting characters, and paints a beautiful picture of Alaska. In the beginning of the book there is a page of terms used by the Native folk.  Thank you for this Mr. Jones.  I have not only read a wonderful book, but I have been educated.  How often do mysteries do that? Awesome job, and I await the next "Nathan Active" mystery!
