 Just listening to this album again after oh...16 years or so, brings me back to the mid 1980's and to the great hard rock that came out of that decade.   Whitesnake's "Slide it in" kicks [rear end]. Even though all the songs, with the exception of the ballads, sound relatively the same, this album is still quite a powerhouse of rock and roll, 80's or not.  It is just a good rock album, and I think David Coverdale has a very strong and bold voice reminiencent of Robert Plant.  I'm sure Zeppelin was a great inspiration to Coverdale(who later toured with Jimmy Page). I definitely recommend picking this album up if you appreciate hard rock, so long as you don't mind alot of the songs sounding so much alike.  "Slide it in", and "Slow and Easy" are without a doubt great rock anthems.  CRANK THEM UP!!!
