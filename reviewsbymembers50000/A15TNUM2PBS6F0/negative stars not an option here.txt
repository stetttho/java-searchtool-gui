 but if it were, this film would get it.   I have been reading the reviews here, and I just don't understand what people liked about this film!  This is one of the worst movies in the history of film making.  There was not one funny scene in the entire hour of the movie that I watched, which is just one of the reasons I had to shut if off. This movie may have some good actors in it, but that doesn't make a good movie.  The plot, screenplay, and direction were all completely and unbelievably bad.  This film has no redeeming quality as far as I am concerned.  I am a woman, so I have interest in watching Love Hewitt and Weaver shimmy all over the screen in tight revealing prostitute wardrobes.  They both have nice figures, and that is about all they have going for them in the movie as their acting really stinks in this !!!   What is up with Sigourney Weavers' fake Russian accent? and how stupid do they think men are that Gene Hackman would buy her phony accent?  The most pathetic is her meak attempt at singing.  I had to change the channel it was so hideously bad.  I rented this on Pay per view.   I was told this was a funny movie, but I just don't see what these people I know that saw it found so funny.  I didn't laugh once.  I just got frustrated and more frustrated as the film went on as it was so awful.   It's a waste of film and time, I say DON'T BOTHER with this one.  Put it back on the shelf!!! Trust me!!! I watch a lot of comedies, and this is just not funny.
