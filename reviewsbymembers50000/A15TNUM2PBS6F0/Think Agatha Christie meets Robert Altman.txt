 What violence is to the action/adventure film(this film is NOT that at all), dialogue is to Robert Altman's latest work, "Gosford Park". Like other films by Altman, this one has it's different stories giong on at once, and a huge cast, mostly made up of unknowns. Maggie Smith, Kristen Scott Thomas, and Jeremy Northam(played Mr. Big on Sex and the City) are the well knowns who play among the aristocrats.  Emily Watson, Helen Mirren, Alan Bates, and Ryan Phillippe are among the well knowns of the servants of the aristocrats.  The strongest performances are by Smith and Mirren, who were both nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars. Maggie Smith was far more deservant of the Oscar than the winner, Jennifer Connolly.  Smith was great as the sarcastic, tactless, snob who has nothing good to say about anyone at all.   The story:  Lady Sylvia McCordle(Scott Thomas) and her husband, William are hosting a shooting party. The party consists of everyone sitting around talking and eating and drinking the night before the actual shooting of birds commences.  They invite family and friends of society.  Everyone brings their own servant.  It reminded a little of "Murder by Death", but it was really that funny at all.  It had it's little momments, but this is mostly a dramatic film with a plot twist of murder added to the Altman mix.  It shows the different world and goings on of both the "aristrocrats" and their "servants".   The acting was very well done by the entire cast. I can see that Robert Altman is trying something new here to some extent, and he did a good job. This is a decent film, but It is not one of my faves of 2001.  I thought it was far too slow, and it seemed to drag on forever.  This is long!!! Be prepared for that.  It's a fine choice if you like British whodunit type films.
