 In the past ten years, "new country" music sprouted it's head.  Most of it that I've actually listened to is more "pop" than "country". This album is totally country, and it doesn't seem to ever fall into a pop stance.  It is "Pure Country"(which is the one movie G.S. was in!) to me. George Strait's "Carrying your love with me" is a truly genuine country album. This is the only album I have of the Country singer, but it is one I listen to. Whereas Shania's "Come on over" is collecting a lot of dust. If you love the old classic country, like Kenny Rogers & Johnny Cash, you will appreciate this honkeytonk record.  It's a great addition to a country music fan's collection. Highly recommended!
