 The dvd itself is highly disappointing. There are only two extras, a trailer and some lame interviews with the stars. Didi Conn is the only one who seemed to offer true insight. The words coming out everyone's mouth just didn't seem to amount to anything except they didn't know what to say.  VH1's "Where are they Now?" on "Grease" was much better. There is also a songbook, inside the dvd cover.  For anyone who has ever questioned the lyrics to "You're the one that I want", here is your chance to see them in all their glory. I'm sure another edition is being planned with next year being the 25th Anniversary. Hopefully, for fans of the movie and fans of all those "extras", there will be a much better package. One other complaint I have about this dvd is that you have to buy both editions, widescreen and full screen, to have the two options as they are not all on one dvd.  Of course, Widescreen rules! But what a gyp! I have other dvds that have this as an option. I still love this movie! It's endearing to me, and It is pure fun. This is a movie I will always watch over and over so whether or not the `transfer' was well done doesn't matter because it will be worn from being used so much.
