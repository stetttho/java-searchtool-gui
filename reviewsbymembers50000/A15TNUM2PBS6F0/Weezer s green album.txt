 I remember when Weezer's first album came out,and after hearing  "the sweater song", I ran out and bought the c.d.  It totally rocked, and I liked the singer's voice.  It was one of favorite c.d.s'...Thus it seems to have disappeared from my c.d. collection. Green album seems to be making up for the loss of blue album.  Not as strong as their debut, but still a very good album which spurned two hits, "HASHPIPE" -- which I like to play at extremely loud volume, and "ISLAND IN THE SUN", this was a bit unlike the rest of the album. It was a total departure from Weezer's sound, and I like it a lot.  Even if it does sound a bit too pop. It's a fun little ditty. HEYHEY.. Aside from these two songs, I think the rest of them all sound so much a like.  Like The Ramones, Weezer seems to rely on the same guitar riffs and just make up different songs.  There is certainly nothing wrong with that, especially if you really like the music.  This isn't for deep listening and getting great thought processes down.  It's just a cool album to chill out to. Worth buying! I recommend it if you liked the first album.
