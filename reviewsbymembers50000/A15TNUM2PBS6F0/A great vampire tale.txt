 "Fright Night" is a very fun, frightening tale about a boy, Charlie Brewster, played by William Ragsdale.  (Remember, Herman's Head on Fox?)  His girlfriend, Amy, who he has been pressuring into having sex, is played by Amanda Bearse, who is probably best known as the annoying neighbor, Marcy, from Married with Children.  Suddenly Charlie is more interested in learning who his new neighbor is and not so interested in Amy.   Stephen Geoffreys plays Evil Ed, with his annoying voice and his nerdy looks, he pretty much steals alot of the show with his antics.   My favorite in this movie has to be Chris Sarandon, who plays Jerry Dandridge. He is the vampire, and he is very sexy.  A perfect choice for the role.  I also thought Roddy MacDowell was very good as the fearless vampire killer, in movies, but when it comes to real life he doesn't seem to have much faith. The story unravels as Charlie learns that Jerry is in fact and vampire.  He is trying to convince his friends that there is a vampire living next door.  and Roddy Macdowell enters when the friends are trying to convince Charlie that vampires don't exist. This movie works for me..it's fun to watch, and the special effects are decent.  The acting is by far much better than it is in most horror movies.   If you like vampire movies and a bit of comedy mixed in, this is a good choice.
