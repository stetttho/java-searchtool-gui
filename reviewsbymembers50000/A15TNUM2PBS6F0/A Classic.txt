 While VOTD is hardly a piece of american literature that we would've read or learned about in high school, it definitely has it's place in the history of fiction.  Jackie Susann was a writer that wrote with great guts and integrity, and she had a great style.  The Dialogue just flows so well!  and the characters all spring to life.  Even those characters we don't necessarily like are just as intriguing to read as say, Anne Welles.  Anne is a small town girl who moves to the big city, New York to be exact.  She is kind, bright, and sweet, maybe too sweet and kind for her own good.  She wants a better and more exciting life.  Down the path to that life, she meets Neely O'Hara, a struggling actress/singer/dancer who wants to make it on Broadway and will stop at nothing to reach success.  This character is hard to sympathize with, whereas Anne is totally easy to like and feel sorry for. Enter Jennifer North, She is an actress that meets up with Neely and Anne as they all learn about and see the lights go up on Broadway.  Jennifer is more like Anne's personality, but has a very tough time between her family, the man she loves, Tony Polar, and his family.   They all become friends, and all shall i say?  creep around in the valley of the dolls.  "Dolls" being sleeping pills, pep pills, pills to help them relax...  Read and see what these dolls do to their lives and the lives of those around them. This is a MUST READ book.  I can't say enough good things about it, it is captivating, easy to follow, it has great dialogue. If you like stories about women friendships and stories about show business, this should interest you. I have read this twice in the past six years, and I love it just as much now as I did when I was 26 yrs. old.  It's a timeless read.
