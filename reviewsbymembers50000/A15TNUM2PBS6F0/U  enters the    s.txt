 This album is U2's first of the 1990's and one of their best. Joshua Tree being the other best. They enter into the new decade with a different sound that makes their fans and many nonfans just starting to appeal to them, want even more. I love every song on this album.  While "The Fly" and "Mysterious Ways" are the major hits from this album that got the most airplay, I think "Trying.." and "SO Cruel" are my personal faves. I listened to this album for two weeks straight when I got it..I was covering night shift at my work..this kept me awake..as I loved listening to it so much.. HIGHLY recommend for all fans of music because this is just sheer brilliance.
