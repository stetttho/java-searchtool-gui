 The words from Alice Sebolds' "The Lovely Bones" will be with me for eternity. She richly blends the lyrics of Susie Salmon's requiem into a story that disturbs, haunts, yet draws you in.  I was literally hooked by Susie Salmon's story before I even had my hands on the book.  I had read an interview with the author, and thought that the book sounded unique. I then read some of it here at Amazon, and had to buy it. This book is definitely worth purchasing.  Susie is raped and murdered by creepy neighbor, George Harvey.  Looking down from Heaven and into the family and friends left behind, she narrates the entire story.  Characters in the book are all drawn out so well. You feel as if you really know them. This is a story about redemption.  It is extremely well told. Sebold has a true talent for originality and prose.  I will never forget this book, and will probably read it again. I will lend it out to everyone I know that would appreciate this innovative and moving story. My only complaint is that I think some words were too big for a 14 year old to pull off. I often thought: Would this girl really say that? I'm in my 30's and had to use a thesaurus to read this book.  Sebold surely has an extensive vocabulary, but she needs to find more teenaged words to use. I know it was the 1970's. Where teens more sophisticated with their words then? STILL HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! Eileen Famiglietti
