 I was introduced to JB by my husband, then boyfriend, 10 years ago and have grown a great admiration for his work and have FUN listening and watching him perform his music. I still have yet to hear all his albums.  I did finally listen to "Floridays".  I guess some will say I am not as big a Parrotthead as others, but I am a Phan that Phlocks to the concerts every summer on Labor day weekend. That all aside, Floridays is such a great album!  It has a great group of songs here that JB recorded in 1986.  I was never aware that Carrie Fisher had co-wrote a JB tune until I read the liner notes of this c.d.  She helped write "I love the Now", which is the opening tune to this album.  Having always been a fan of her work, both her writing and acting, I was pleasantly surprised to see her name here.   From this album spawns "First Look", a great mellow track, "If it all falls down", another great one, and "You'll never work in dis bidness again", this is a very cool tune!!  It's a songs that sort of mocks the entertainment industry, but it is funny, and is one of Jimmy's best songs he ever recorded in my opinion. "Creola" is such a nice song to just kick back, get on that hammock, and just be... This is definitely one JB album worth adding to one's collection.
