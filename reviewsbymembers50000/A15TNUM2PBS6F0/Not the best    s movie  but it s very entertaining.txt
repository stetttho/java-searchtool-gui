 This is a pretty good movie to kill a couple of hours on a saturday morning.  It's funny and keeps you interested even if it is quite predictable. it's a very 80s movie! right down to the clothes and the cheesy background music.   Billy Jacobi plays the younger brother, Buddy.  He is the comic relief of the film and I laugh alot at his character.  Ayre Gross, who was on the show Ellen, plays one of the geeks'. He thinks he's an alien.  Also, A very young Sherilynn Fenn plays in this movie as a sex starved teen after the male "Terri". She is cute, and this is a cute film that spawned from the 1980s.
