 Quite a few years ago in my quest to stay with Oprah and her book club, I read 'where the heart is' by Billie Letts. I was very disappointed and gave up half way through.  Of course, my mind is more open to different kinds of books now. "The Honk and Holler Opening soon" was a gift I got recently, and of course, I was a bit hesitant to read it after the first book experience. It came highly recommended by someone who's opinion I truly value, and I quickly got into it.  Billie Letts' characters are all very realistically drawn out and while it wasn't a plot driven as some people may want it to be, it had a certain charm all it's own as one of those "slice of life" type books. It's as if I was peering into the "Honk & Holler" itself stealing a glance and listen at other's people's lives.   My whole image of Letts is completely blown out of the water, and I am now a fan of her work. I am glad I gave her a second chance with this little book. Like I said, it's got a plot but I really think it's more about fleshing out the characters like Caney, Vena, Molly O, and Bui. All from different walks of life and backgrounds, they come together to teach an important lesson in how you don't have to be related to be a family.  Eileen F.
