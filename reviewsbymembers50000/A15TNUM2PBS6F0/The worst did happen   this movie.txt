 This movie doesn't deserve to much time from me.  The best part about this movies is BOSTON.  It was filmed in Boston, and as a life time Massachusetts resident, I loved seeing our fair city in yet, another of the handful of films actually filmed here. It is a city that looks beautiful on film. Lawrence is playing his usual role of the petty thief who dances and talks way through the film.  ....  I do usually like Danny Devito, but I don't know what he was thinking here.  His character, Max, has a few funny moments, .... Lawrence robs Devito, and Devito is in the house when it happens.  He steals the ring Lawrence is wearing.  The rest of the movie is Lawrence trying to get the ring back. This movie didn't make me laugh much.  When I was laughing, it was when Detective Tardio was on screen. What a hoot!  William Fichtner plays him, and he is weird! really weird. At first, I didn't know what the heck his character was for, but I realize now that the movie needed him.  He was the best that happened...
