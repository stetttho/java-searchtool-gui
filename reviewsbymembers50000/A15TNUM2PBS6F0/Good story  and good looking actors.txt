 What more does this movie need?  Less air time!  This is a long movie, 127 minutes!  It did keep my interest. Robert Redford and Brad Pitt star in this one.  Redford, Muir,  is on his last day bfore retirement from the CIA. Brad Pitt, Bishop, once his "protege", is in a chinease prison and about to be executed. The entire film is Muir flashing back to when he had originally met up with Bishop, and while explaining this to the CIA, is also trying to help Bishop escape. Does his plan work?  Hmmm...I will not give to much away.  It's a fast paced, well acted, sometimes funny, and very engrossing film that makes you think. It's directed by Tony Scott, who is good at giving us very stylish looking action films like "True Romance" and "Enemy of the State".   For fans of Brad Pitt and Redford, you get to look at their cute faces a lot.  Even in his mature state, Redford, is still very charming and handsome. Worth the rental fee!!
