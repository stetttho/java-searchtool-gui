 The first few times I watched this as a child, I was always so petrified of the Wicked Witch of the West, that I could never wath the entire film.  I loved Dorothy and her little dog, Toto, and her three new friends, Scarecrow, Tinman, and the cowardly lion. And most of all loved the music.  As I grew up and continued to watch the annual t.v. viewing of it, I was able to watch the whole thing but in Black and white! At the time it didn't bother me as I loved the fantasy of it all and it had appealed to me so well.  Then one year, I was invited to my best friend's house to watch it, well, all I can say is WOW.   The colors! They actually made the story all that more my favorite movie.   Through the years I watched it less and less but always treasured it as my absolute favorite movie of all time.  My husband bought me this dvd, and it is just an amazing feast for the eyes.  With oodles of extras to watch, even some parts that originally met the editting floor show up here, this is just a perfect dvd to add to your collection. Even if the dvd didn't have all that supplemental stuff, I would still love it. The movie just sets the imagination free and let's you go with it.  I sing a long with the entire cast and have a ball!  The witch doesn't scare me anymore, and I watch it on a 42 inch screen so I am getting a pretty good showing. I highly recommend this dvd. It's a perfect family film and for any fans of older movies, this is the one to have.  It will not disappoint in the least. I've only met one person in my entire life that didn't like this movie.  What's not to like?  You have a good story, motivation, fun songs to sing a long with, awesome acting by all in it, and glorious cinematography. It's a wonderful film that will remain forever in my heart and always remind me of my youth. "There's no place like home", Dorothy says.  I say, "Tthere is no movie like this one."
