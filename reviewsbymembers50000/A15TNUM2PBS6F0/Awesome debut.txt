 Radiohead is a unique band that has an incredibly talented lead singer.  This albums showcases these qualities to a great extent. It is also the debut of Radiohead.  Even though the big hit from the record is "Creep", it isn't the best song on the album, just my opinion.    "Anyone can play guitar" is the best song on this album.  I like all the music on this record. It's a good mix of mellow and rocking out music by one of the most talented bands to come out of the early 90's.   You must check out Radiohead live! I got the chance once.  They were masterful!  Amazing band!!!
