 THis is a great c.d.!!  Sinatra's The very good years has many of the great songs recorded by Ol' blue eyes.  And it's all those songs you just won't grow tired of listening to. It's a good mixture of songs we all know, New York, New York, Love and Marriage, and That's life ...to a few tunes off of broadway plays, "I get a kick out of you" is from Anything Goes, "My Kind of Town" from Guys and Dolls...And everything in between is just pure delight.  A great mellow selection. This c.d. makes great background music for candlelit dinners, or quiet "cocktail Parties". A great addition to any c.d. collection...
