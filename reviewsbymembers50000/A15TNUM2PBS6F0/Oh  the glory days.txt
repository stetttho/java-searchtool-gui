 "American Fool" brings back great memories for me of junior high and going to my first concert, which just so happened to have been J.C. himself. This is a really rockin' album with two of the biggest hits from John Cougar, "Hurts so good", and "jack & diane".  "hand to hold on to" what a chart hitter, but didn't do as well commercially. Yet, I always felt it was just as good as his two hits.   Cougar is a truly talented musician who really shined back in the early 1980's.  I'd like to say that this is his debut, but I have a few albums that were prior to this, "John Cougar", which has no hits at all, and "Chestnut street incident", which is a collector's item now. However, "American Fool" is the perfect and definitive album of his to have. It showcases his talents as a singer and guitar player.   John is the every man's rock and roller.  I still love this album as it's got some really good music, no fillers. Every song on here is great rock music.   Highly recommended!! Eileen Famiglietti
