 I recently watched Rain Man, for what was probably at least the tenth time as it is on television alot.  It is one of the best movies of the 1980s', and it has without doubt, one of the best performances ever seen on film.  Dustin Hoffman was amazing as Raymond Babbitt, an autistic man, whose younger brother, Charlie, played quite well by Tom Cruise, abducts him from the institution he is in in order to get his share of inheritance money.  The character of Charlie is very selfish and greedy, but as the film goes on he changes for the better.  He takes Raymond clear across the country by car because Raymond won't fly. Watching this film again made me realize that it is really one of the greatest films I've seen.  It's a bittersweet story of brotherly love, dramatic at times, but has a great deal of comedy blended in.   This is a film to be cherished for generations. I highly recommend Rain Man.  The performances by both Dustin Hoffman, who won the Oscar for best actor(very well deserved!), and Tom Cruise are outstanding.  I believe this to be one of the first films that Cruise had a real substantial character with depth to him.  Watch Rain Man...you won't be disappointed.
