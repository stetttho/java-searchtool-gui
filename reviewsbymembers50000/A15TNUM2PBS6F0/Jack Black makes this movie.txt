 My title pretty much sums up what I have to say about "Orange County" -- which I am not sure was a comedy as the laughs were far and few between. Both Black, as a total wastoid brother of the main character, Shaun, and the small roles by the comedic actors/actresses from the age 40 and up, were genuinely funny. The story wasn't bad, it just couldn't decide whether it was a comedy or a drama.  It's about Shaun Brumder, played by Colin Hanks(Toms' son), and his quest to attend Stanford so he can study with a writer whose book, "Straight Jacket", he discovers while on the beach with his surfer buds. Not really a bad idea at all. It just wasn't executed as well as it could have been. Worth watching if you absolutely LOVE Jack Black.  He is hysterically funny in this.
