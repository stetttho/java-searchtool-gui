 I was 10 years old in 1979, and I remember listening to a lot of these songs on the radio, especially "Escape"(Pina Colada Song). It was one of my favorite songs back then.  This greatly eclectic mix of genres will bring back some great memories of a year that spurned some great music. Disco was fading, but Blondie got her hooks into it with "Heart of Glass", which starts this disc off right. "My Sharona", the one hit wonder of The Knack is on here, along with a few 70's party standards for fast dances, "I will survive", "YMCA", and "Ring my bell". The slower songs are sad love songs: "Just when I needed you most" and "Sad Eyes".  This is fun album to have on and sing along with(karoake here i come...)in the car, or at home in the background at a party. I've actually recognized it being played at clubs, between bands.  I am highly recommending this for 70's music fans! It's one of the greatest if not the best compliation album I've heard for that decade. Eileen Famiglietti
