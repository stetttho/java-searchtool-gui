 After watching this movie, I can see and totally understand why it's release was put off for so long. Within the first 15 minutes of the film, there is a terrorist attack and lives are lost. Families are torn apart by tragedy. Gordy Brewer, Arnie's character, is seriously effected by this violent manuever, and must get revenge. I got really angry and was on the verge of tears knowing their are a lot of people out there who have lost loved ones, and Hollywood made this movie. It really didn't do much for me except bring up those awful memories of 9/11, and that was not a good thing..... For an action film, there wasn't a lot of action going on. Don't recommend....
