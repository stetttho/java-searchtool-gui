 Despite the brilliant performance by John Cameron Mitchell, this film is just not all that great.  It is visually bizarre, the animation is very simplistic looking but makes very strange conotations  as they do apply to the story.   I watched this purely to see Mitchell's performance.  I had heard it was utterly amazingly brilliant, and I totally agree.  This film is just too out there for me.  I've appreciated movies about drag queens and gay men in the past so that has nothing to do with my decisions here.  Some of it just made no sense to me.  This movie is just not for everyone.  I did like the music a lot, it was very original and fresh.  It helped to tell the story somewhat, but I didn't think the story had much of a finish...
