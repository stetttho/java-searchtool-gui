 This is one of the many holiday movies that throw in a dysfunctional family, in this case, one extremely dysfunctional  family, into the holiday spirit.  It's Thanksgiving this time around, and while this movie isn't as hiliarious as "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles" it had me laughing quite a bit.  It took a little while to warm up to this movie.   I did like Holly Hunter's character, Clyde, who is not looking forward to the trip home for the holiday.  She was very good in this role, it's as if it was created just for her.   The acting by all the cast was great.  I really felt like I knew some of these characters, and are related to some of them.   Clyde and her brother Tommy, played to perfection by Robert Downey Jr., seem pretty close.  Both of them got out of the neighborhood and moved to big cities far away to get away from their highly dysfunctional family.  They both come back for Thanksgiving and the dysfunction starts up pretty quickly. This is a very funny and endearing look into how the holiday goes with a family that isn't exactly a "Leave it to Beaver" family.  While they each have their problems, I think it is Clyde who is the glue of this family.  Her sister, Joanne, is brewing with anger and hate toward her brother and sister because they got out.  I had no sympathy for that character, but it is a very realistic portrayal, as I unfortunately know people like this.  She thinks she is the normal one, but she is really not.  I adored all the other characters in the family, they made me laugh despite their quirks.  Just like our own families, we all have our own problems and live our lives differently, but what it all boils down to is we love each other.  This is what really matters.  There are the momments that we share together that will stand out in our memories more than others -- I think that pretty much sums up the point of this movie.   This is a good movie to watch around Thanksgiving.  It has humor and is very touching.
