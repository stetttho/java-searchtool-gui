 I have seen B.B. King live, and he was just amazing - A brilliant musician, a crowd pleaser, and a bundle of energy.  He is an amazing performer, and this live c.d. is awesome!! Worthy of any Blues fans collection, "Live at San Quentin" had me wishing I was a fly on the wall at that show.  What a performance!  Every song here is great, and King doesn't slow down for a minute.  Like he says in the album, the blues doesn't mean "blue" as in depressing all the time. I actually listened to the entire c.d. while i was on the treadmill at the gym. It was very upbeat for the most part.  A sensational record that is worth buying. Rather than have his whole catalog, I prefer this! It is just masterful! Highly recommended!!
