 Led Zeppelin is the definitive group of the genre of classic rock, and I think this is the album to have. While it doesn't have the more popular songs, aside from "Kashmir", this is one of the best of their albums. The music is all great here, and Jimmy Page is the greatest guitarist ever.   "Physical Graffiti" plays on so many different levels. Zeppelin can rock out, they can mellow out.  Mostly, they just entertain the masses of classic rock fans like myself.  I've been listening to them for 20 years now, and I bet I will still listen to them when I am old and gray.   If you are of the age I was when I started listening to classic rock, this will be a great start to your Led Zeppelin collection.  It is a mix of a more edgy Zeppelin with the beautiful sounds of Robert Plant's harmony during the slower songs.  The music is powerful here.   Worth buying!!!!
