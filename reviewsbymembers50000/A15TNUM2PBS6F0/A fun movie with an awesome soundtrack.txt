 "Undercover Brother" to me, was like a Black Austin Powers..It had that same brand of humor, and like AP, was a spoof film.  I laughed a lot in this movie, and many of the comedies from 2002 didn't even make me crack a smile. This was fun, and I love the soundtrack!!  Great 70's music here! "Play that funky music", "Jungle boogie", "car wash"(stick around at the end for this one), "Brickhouse"....just to name a few. I recommend this for a rental.   It had some good laughs, and I had a good time watching it and listening to that funky music.
