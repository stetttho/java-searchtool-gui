 I had highly anticipated this album when I had heard of it's impending arrival. I have been a huge fan of The Boss> When the last studio album came out w/ the E street band was when I was really taken up by him and his stories told my music.   He is a totally amazing musician, an awesome performer( must be seen live at least once in your lifetime, he is worth the price of that high admission), and a great song writer. "The Rising" is not only his and the E street bands latest endeavor, but it's his coming into a great maturity.  I definitely could hear it in his voice that he is getting older and mellowing a bit, but then when I saw him performing "Mary's Place" live, he really is still THE BOSS! He wrote a lot of the songs as his response to the Sept. 11th attacks.  These are some very profound and emotionally charged lyrics.  Even if some of them are extremely repetitive, I just can't help but be lured in by Bruce's outpuring of serious emotion regarding these terrible tragedies.  That all aside, this is an amazing piece of work that should be purchased. The album has ballads and faster songs (Let's be friends just gets me in a serious rocking mood.) It's packed with songs! There is a lot of music here, and this is a record well worth buying for the fan that appreciates any and all of Bruce.  There isn't a single song that I didn't like. They all sounded good to me. Bruce and the guys deserve great praise and admiration for this great piece of music. It may be long overdue, but it was worth the wait. NOw if we can just all get tickets to the concerts... Highly recommending for all fans of Bruce! You huge fans, buy it! It has something for everybody that appreciates his music. Eileen Famiglietti
