 a practical joke on anyone because you don't know who is psycho out there! That is the main point to this story, which was very different than I had expected.  It didn't resort to bloody grisly murder scenes but did that old Hitchcockian thing and thrived more on the suspense of it all. Steve Zahn(Fuller) and Paul Walker(Lewis) play two brothers who are on the road travelling to pick up Walker's girl, Venna, played by Leelee Sobieski.  On the way to Venna, they decide to get on the cb radio(yes, cb) and play a joke on a trucker. Lewis pretends to be a woman(candycane) on the prowl. They trick him into meeting "candycane" at a hotel.  Little do they know who they are dealing with. This guy is a full fledged murderer, and doesn't like being tricked.  Kudos to Director John Dahl for this interpetation of horror. It doesn't quickly rush into the gore and stupidity that other recent horror films are notorious for.  "Jeepers Creepers" has one similarity with this movie -- a truck chasing a car. The main characters in "Joy Ride" were stupid to mess around with this guy, but they learn a valuable lesson whereas the main characters in "Jeepers..." are just plain dumb.   The acting was fine, not brilliant.  Zahn is the best actor in the film. And creepy Ted Levine, best known as Buffalo Bill in "Silence of the Lambs" gives our "monster" his voice. If you can appreciate the suspense behind it all and not just the blood and gore, you will probably like this.
