 "American Pie 2" has the gang from the first film back for more sex, drinking, partying, basically everything teenagers do in comedies these days.   This time around they are in college, and of course, there is another humiliating scene for Jason Biggs, no baked products this time.  You'll have to see it to find out. If you liked the first film, you will probably appreciate this one as much as I did.  I liked it just as much as the first one.  I laughed just as much here.  2001 was not the best year for movies, but this is one of the few that is tolerable and actually made me laugh.  Worth the rental fee.
