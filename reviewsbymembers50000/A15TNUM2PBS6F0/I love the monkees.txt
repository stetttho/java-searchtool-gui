 In all honesty, the only bit of recorded music I had listened to before this album was their Greatest Hits, which I had on vinyl years ago. This is a good album that I can listen to with my 4 1/2 yr. old son in the car.  It's full of catchy tunes that sonny boy is getting to know pretty well now.  It's fun and most of the songs are upbeat and child friendly.   He shunned "I wanna be free", which I'd liked to call Davy's anthem.  I watched the reruns of the show growing up and he had a different girl in every episode. He didn't want to be tied down, just as he sings in the song.   Mickey sings a lot of the songs, Davy sings a few, and the unusual Mike Nesmith(the quiet one who wanted nothing to do with the tour I went to) sings one as well. Overall - with the theme for the tv. show on it, "Last Train to Clarkesville", and the other mishmash of Monkee's songs that I hadn't really heard before - This is a good introduction to their music, aside from the greatest hits.  With this disc, you will hear some songs that aren't as well known but are just as good...maybe even better. The nostalgia factor for me is way up there as well.  I was a child in the 70's, when the show was in rerun city.  That is how I discovered them, especially, Davy. I had a huge crush on him.  And I got the greatest hits as a gift, which was most of the songs everyone know.   I am without the greatest hits now as I don't have a turntable, but this little album here, is just as good, and I can listen to it everytime I drive.    Eileen F.
