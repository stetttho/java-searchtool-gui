 This is a wonderful movie!!! and now that it is finally on dvd, I am glad to have it in my possession.  The movie itself is restored to brilliant color and crisp clearness for the viewer's eye.  The extras were very interesting.  I very much enjoyed the Backstory(from the cable channel AMC).  It helps take the viewer behind the scenes a bit and see a little more than MM's undies. The deleted scenes made me laugh!!! To think what drew the line back in the 1950's as far as censors go!! These were so tame by today's standards.  They are still delightful scenes nonetheless.  They should've been put back onto the entirity of the film for the dvd.   The movie itself is just elegant, as MM's character would say.  It's the story of Richard Sherman, played by comedic talent, Tom Ewell.  Marilyn plays "the girl" who gets Mr. Sherman's wild imagination going.  She lives upstairs and when her tomato plant falls over and practically kills him, he invites her down for a drink.  Just a drink... There's much more going on, just check this film out.  You won't be disappointed!!! It's a light airy comedy with great laughs, and the beauty of Marilyn. This is a wonderful party!
