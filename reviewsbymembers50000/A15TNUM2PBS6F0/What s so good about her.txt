 After hearing reviews of Jennifer Aniston's(the not so good "good girl")most recent cinematic achievement, I was interested.  I had no idea of the intensity, the raw reality of it, and that Mike White, a scriptwriter in need of serious psychotherapy, had written it.  The story is about the miserable Justine(Aniston), unhappily married to Pothead Phil(John C. Reilly), and very soon to be adultress with Holden(Jake Gyllenhaal). Justine works at the Retail Rodeo at the make up counter.  An odd ensemble of characters works there, and it is where she meets Holden.  Both caught up in their miserable lives, they  "Get each other". Once Justine wants the breaks put on it all, is where things really start to get weird. Holden becomes obsessive about Justine.  She isn't sure what she wants out of life, and she isn't sure who Holden really is much less herself.   Life for our "good girl" just keeps getting weirder and weirder, and the more I watched Justine and her reactions to the bizarre situations that arise, the more I kept thinking, this is not a good person.  Just what is Mike White trying to prove here? That a very dishonest woman who cheats on her husband is good.  If that's good, I would hate to see his version of bad.   I know I know, I could've shut it off. But I was intrigued. and I was blown away at the acting of Aniston, Reilly, and Gyllenhaal.  They were all brilliant and really gave their all to these oddball characters. Do I recommend this movie?  If you like Mike White's body of work maybe.  If you can appreciate watching a movie of stark reality(as I know "good girls" like this one) and some of the best acting of the year 2002, this might be a good rental choice.
