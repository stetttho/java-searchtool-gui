 I am not one to buy dvds of movies I haven't seen, but my husband decided to "one", and bought "Evolution"..It was a decent comedy about some scientists, played by David Duchovny and Orlando Jones, who discover an alien life form and while the aliens try to take over Arizona by mutating into giant dinosaur like creatures, the scientist guys try to kick some alien....  it's sort of an MIB ripoff, but it had some pretty funny momments with both stars.  Even that guy, with the three names, who was in American Pie and Road Trip, was very funny in this as well.  I totally think it's worth a rental fee, but it isn't a movie I personally would have bought or recommend you buy unless you have seen it already and really loved it.  I really have to love a movie enough to want to see it many multiple times before deciding to buy it.  My husband just bought it like he was buying a loaf of bread.  I'm not knocking this movie, it's a decent comedy.  I just wish he didn't spend more than...(rental fee) I guess if you are a huge DD fan, and would like to see [him]... every once in a while, than this is a choice dvd for your collection.
