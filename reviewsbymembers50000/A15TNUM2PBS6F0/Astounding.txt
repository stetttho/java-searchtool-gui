 "Capote" is an account of Truman Capote's decision and execution of writing the nonfiction book "In cold blood".  I have never read his work, but after viewing this movie, I plan to.  He was unusual, interesting, talented, and even funny.   Philip Seymoure Hoffman's acting was amazing. He was so deservant of his Oscar.  I've always been a fan of his and this movie is his truly shining star in the galaxy of celluloid. Also, Catharine Keener was very good as writer,(one of my faves at that) Harper Lee, who penned the classic "to kill a mockingbird".    I really think Capote wanted to write something non fiction which is why he was looking in the new york times that day he found the article about the murders of the family in Kansas.  He did everthing in his power to get as much research to create thie book.  It took him years to finish the book due to the fact that Perry Smith, one of the convicted killers, wouldnt' tell Capote details about the crimes he committed.   I think "Capote" is one of the best films to come out of 2005.  Everything about this movie was brilliant.  I highly recommend it to the movie fan who appreciates all genres of film.
