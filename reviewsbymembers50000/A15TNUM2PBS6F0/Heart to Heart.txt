 "Return to Me" made me laugh, and it made me cry(I can be very sappy and sensitive when it comes to romance films).  David Duchovny, who plays the male romantic lead in the film, performs probably one of the most romantic gestures (This is just my opinion.) that I'd ever seen on film.  And it seemed so real! It wasn't sappy or corny, it was just so sweet and you have to watch the movie to see it!   I could rehash the scenerio,but if you've been reading all these reviews, which almost all of them have been excellent!  alot of people seemed to really love this film.  I wasnt' sure if I would like it as I am not a big fan of Minnie Driver.  She turned out to be very good in it, and it was a good role for her.  All the other actors were great.  Jim Belushi steals the show as the husband of Bonnie Hunt(one of the screenwriters).  Hunt is also a scene stealer, and usually plays that type of role.  I am a fan of hers and when I realized she wrote this, well, I had to see this for myself.  I know quite a few people who'd seen the movie already, and they all loved it. It's funny, heartwarming, and there is something for everybody in this movie.  My husband even liked it!  He laughed alot.  Archie Bunker himself, plays the grandfather to Minnie Driver, and him and his buddies are all so funny!!! They have quite a few scenes in the film.   In Closing, I would definitely recommend "Return to me" for a feel good romantic kind of comedy.  Oh, and don't forget the kleenex!!
