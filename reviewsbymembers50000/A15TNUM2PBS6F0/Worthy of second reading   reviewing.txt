 "The Earth, my butt, and other big round things" is one of those rare books that I've read more than once. I also plan to read it again, and again, and again. Chock full of the insecurities I myself felt as a 15 year old gilr, like "Virginia Shreves", who is the girl in this funny but sad tale.   The main reason I like this character and this book so much as it mirrors my own teenaged life so well.  Maternal denial, sisters that move away because of it, and food being stuffed thy throat. This novel is the perfect recipe for my life as a teenager. Virginia, however, learns that lesson about life being what YOU make it and not what others make of it, learns much sooner than I did. Froth with realistic dialogue this is a book I highly recommend to girls of all ages. It is brightly written and Carolyn Mackler has earned my highest respect.  Buy this one as Virginia is a friend you will want to visit again.
