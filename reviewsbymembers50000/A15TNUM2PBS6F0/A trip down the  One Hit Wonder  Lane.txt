 I was in junior high and high school throughout the 80's, and can remember hearing the songs on this album umpteen times.  For the most part, the songs that appear here are mostly one hit wonders or the biggest hits from some of the acts that appear, like The Go-Go's and Night Ranger.   Some selections are a bit obscure, and aren't as big hits as others.  That is what makes the album so great.  You'll find a few songs here that you may not have heard in a long time. Put it on and take a stroll down memory lane. You will have a wicked awesome time!   This is good background music for an 80's theme party too..I have yet to do it myself, but I have thought about it.  There are some good dance songs, "Safety Dance" is probably the best.
