 but "Shadow of the Dolls" is quite entertaining.  When I saw that a sequel had been written, I new I had to read it to see what had happened to the crazy Neely and the way to nice Anne. "Valley of the Dolls" is one of my favorite books of all time, and this sequel certainly isn't a personal fave but it isn't entirely terrible.  They do tell us right in the front of the book that the dates and times have been changed..why? I have no idea. That part takes away one star for me.  Why did they have to do that?  I guess that was the writer's decision.  By the way, Rae Lawrence is a decent writer.  While she doesn't write in the exact same way Susann did(who ever could?), she does have a knack for dialogue.  She did a great job writing Neely's choice words.  Nothing beats the original.."I AM NEEEEEELY OHARAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!"  Technically, Anne and Neely should have been at least 15 years older than they say in the book.  Anyway, that all aside.  As long as you remember that this wasn't really written by Susann, even though you see her name on the cover of the book, and you just enjoy "seeing" those "old Friends"..as a lot of reviewers have put, this book is a decent take. I wasn't thrilled with the ending of the book. I just hoped for something better.  But this isn't better.  VALLEY OF THE DOLLS is the better of the two.  For those die hard fans, of the first, you may be disappointed.  Yet, this book is good.  It kept me interested.  I really hope a movie is never made.  The movie of the first book is such outrageously trashy fun -- That could never be duplicated, so it should be best left alone! As far as this book is concerned, I didn't love it, but it was good enough to keep me reading. I won't give away too much, but if you want revisit Neely O'Hara, Anne Welles, and Lyon Burke, you just may enjoy this homage to Susann.
