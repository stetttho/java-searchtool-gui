 I caught this on PBS, and it was very good!  A great story, and what actors!   It's a period piece, set in the late 1920's.  Rip Torn is this lumberjack type guy who has a Native American Indian woman companion he hangs out with all the time.  There is a dam being built around his property, and the builders are trying to buy him out.  He does everything he can to not give in to their bribery.  It's fine drama, and some comedic momments sprinkled in.  I thought the acting by both Torn, and the woman was outstanding! I always liked him.  She was just amazing.  It's movies like this that have the truly talented actors.   PBS doesn't edit either, and there were no commercials.  Both my husband and I liked it alot.  Highly recommend!
