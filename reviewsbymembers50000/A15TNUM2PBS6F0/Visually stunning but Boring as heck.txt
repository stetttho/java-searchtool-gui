 "Mothman Prophecies" has Richard Gere, and it was beautifully filmed. These are the two things going for it. The story seemed interesting as first, but I was soon bored. It didn't seem to be moving to quickly. Very slow and uneven in parts.   Even the fact that it was based on "true events" didn't really keep me interested.  Even with it's good solid acting from Gere and Laura Linney, and Will Patton this movie still couldn't stay above water. It had a bad ending too.   Save your money and time and skip this one.
