 Wonder Boys is without a doubt one of the best films I have watched in the past year. It is another one of those black comedies in which an aging man goes through a midlife crisis..Does anyone remember American Beauty?  This film reminded me of Beauty a little bit.  I thought it was a very well written screenplay, and I loved Alan Ball's screenplay even better(Beauty).  The main character is played brilliantly by Michael Douglas, and the movie pretty much centers around him.  I don't know if Wonder Boys will sweep the Oscars like Beauty did, but I think it deserves a few nods.-- Best Actor, best screenplay, and best director.  Like American Beauty, I don't think this film is for everybody.  It plays like a drama, but has comedic moments thrown in.   I could rehash what the film is about like everyone else here, but I just want to voice that I think it is an excellent film that I was very entertained by.  It was funny and though not fast paced, was very engrossing.  Not to mention the amazing acting!! This film was a springboard for some of the best acting in the year 2000 -- Robert Downey Jr., Tobey McGuire, and Frances McDormand.  If you are a fan of any of these actors, especially Michael Douglas, you will appreciate this movie.
