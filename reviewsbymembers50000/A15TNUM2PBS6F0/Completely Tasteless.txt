 My husband rented this expecting something similar to it's predecessors.  He didn't realize that "straight to video" means "THis movie stinks! Don't bother!  You'd be better off watching the original movie if you like that type of comedy. Band Camp completely insults it.  I saw only one original AP star, Eugene Levy who plays a Quasi-counselor to the rude and annoying characters. I watched half of it asking myself, "Was I supposed to laugh at that?" and rolling my eyes at how truly moronic it was.  Finally I realized I'd have a better time sleeping so I stopped watching altogether.  I think it has no true humor and is distasteful.  If you can base a movie as good by the amount of nudity and really stupid humor this is right up your alley!
