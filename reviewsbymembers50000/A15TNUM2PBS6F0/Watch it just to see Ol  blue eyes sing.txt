 "The Tender Trap".  Hence, that is the name of this rather dated comedy/musical staring Sinatra, Debbie Reynolds, David Wayne, and Celeste Holm.  The players are all pretty good, and that one song sung by Frank himself, is what made this movie for me.  I love Frank Sinatra and his voice is so great.  He plays a very carefee bachelor who has a long line of lady friends, Celeste Holm being one of them.  He is just enjoying his carefree life and dates. Enter his friend, played by David Wayne, who is taking a breather from his marriage and family.  He is an old friend who has come back from the past, and hopes to change his life. Debbie Reynolds is just plain annoying in this! She has an agenda, and her legs crossed much too tight.   Sinatra teaches her to sing the title song the correct way, which is the only time he sings in the entire film.   It's a silly farce, but is light hearted and good for early sunday morning viewing on cable t.v.!
