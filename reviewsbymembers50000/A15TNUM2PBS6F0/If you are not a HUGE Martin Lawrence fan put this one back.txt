 Fortunately for me, I waited til this total waste of film, and time on my part, was on video before viewing.  I am not even a fan of Martin Lawrence.  I did like Blue Streak, but only because the charming Luke Wilson was in it.  I don't think Lawrence has alot of comedic talent.   I have to admit there are a few, very few rare momments of Martin Lawrence that I actually consider funny.  And maybe one of them was in this film.  Blue Streak was a much better movie and story.  I am a fan of some of the older, much more funny comedies that involve men dressing up like women for whatever reason.  SOME LIKE IT HOT & TOOTSIE are probably the best of the bunch. Plus, how many times can bathroom humor be funny?  It's getting old. This waste of time has maybe two or three funny parts, and the rest is just totally stupid.  The ending was totally predictable.  I think that Martin Lawrence should maybe hangup his fat suit and go back to t.v.
