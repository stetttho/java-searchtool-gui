 I got this as a gift when my son was born, and will always treasure it.  It is a perfect book for young children.  My son is ten months, and he loves looking at all the colors, and pictures.  and sometimes appreciates my reading the cute story about the bunny getting ready to go to bed. I have the board book of Goodnight Moon and it is the perfect size for him to look at without much help from me. It's a classic story that has been around for years, and it has never lost it's audience.
