 I discovered Sebastian Cole on the Sundance channel, and have watched it three times now.  It's such a good story, different, quite a diversion from the typical teen movies that are out there lately.  It is funny, heartwarming, and at times, serious. The film brings us back to 1983 - 84, and Sebastian Cole, played superbly by Adrian Grenier, wants to go on adventures.  He also wants to get out of school as soon as possible.  All the while, his stepfather decides he wants to become a woman, Sebastian's sister leaves and moves to California, and his mom leaves when she finds out her husband wants to be a woman. It is a little different and offbeat, but that is what makes this movie so unique.  The acting by Clark Gregg,who plays Hank/Henrietta is outstanding!  I've never seen him act before but I thought he played his characters with such great sensitivity and realness.  The performances by both him and Grenier, who I did see in Drive me Crazy, are truly beautiful and you can't help but fall in love with their characters.  Sebastian is a great person who just wants to be good to others and along the way have what he calls 'his adventures'. You will have to watch to see what these adventures actually consist of.  You won't be disappointed. The soundtrack is great too.  Perfect compliment to an 80s' kind of film.
