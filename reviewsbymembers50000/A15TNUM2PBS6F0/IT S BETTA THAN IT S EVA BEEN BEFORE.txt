 I am so excited that this movie has been released again.  I just got my DVD a couple of days ago.  I never got to see it on t.v., and had rented it several times a few years ago. Then it disappeared from the video store.  I have been a big fan of Rex Smith since I was 9 years old, and he is just so sexy and talented in this movie.  It's his showcase.  He has an amazing singing voice, and is such a charming actor.  He really brings Michael Skye to life!!  All the other actors in this film are great too.  It's a romance/comedy/drama about a teenager, Jessie. She's thirteen, and falls in love with Michael Skye(who wouldn't?).  She tells him alot of lies to be with him.  This is a very endearing film and it has stood the test of time.  I don't know if the guys will like it, but ladies...you will enjoy this movie!! Whether you are 13 or 31!!! Watch it and see how it turns out.  You'll also get to hear Rex Smith perform, and I think the songs are great.  Very catchy tunes.  Hopefully they will put it on CD as my old LP is very scratched!!! This is probably the best t.v. movie ever made , in my opinion. I don't know why this movie ever disappeared.  I'm just glad it's back as it truly is BETTER THAN IT'S EVER BEEN...
