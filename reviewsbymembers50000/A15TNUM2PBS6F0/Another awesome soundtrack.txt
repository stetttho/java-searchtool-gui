 I have listened and grown to love the eclectic compilations known as Quentin Tarentino's movie soundtracks. I am total amorous of the discs for Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and when I heard the "Kill Bill Vol. 1" soundtrack, I once again in love. Soundtracks can make a movie that much better, and no one knows how to pick the selected pieces like QT.  From the opening song, "Bang Bang", sung by Nancy Sinatra, who is more famous for "These boots were made for walking" than this unknown recording, to "Don't let me be misunderstood" which is somewhat a lost disco classic. To "Twisted Nerve", which is whistling made cool.   Quite a difference in music genres there, and that isn't where it ends.  Highly entertaining and a feast for a true music fans ears, "Kill Bill Vol. 1" is a soundtrack worthy of a purchase.
