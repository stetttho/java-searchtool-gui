 "The Tao of STeve" is a comedy in which, Dex(not STeve, so who is steve?), played by the hilarious Donal Logue(That taxi driver guy that used to be on MTV).  He certainly doesn't fit the "romantic lead" like Richard Gere, but he does stand out.  He's the type of guy us normal women would date seeing as Richard Gere would just be way out of our league.   The title of the movie is based on the way Dex "gets" women to go for him, and "Steve" is for all the cool Steves, the coolest being STeve McQueen.  He's trying to be cool, trying not to let these women know his ulterior motives or motive. This movie was very entertaining.  Despite The brooklyn reviewer's opinion, I thought the movie was well written.  It was like listening to any guy talk of his ways to get women whether it involves isms' or not.   If you are looking for a modern day comedy, this is a good choice.   It certainly worth the rental fee.
