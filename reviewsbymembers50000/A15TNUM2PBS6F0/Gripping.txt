 "Seance on a Wet afternoon" is a pretty short book,.... It is a crime/mystery drama that was written back in 1961 by Mark McShane.  The story takes place in England.  The two main characters are Myra and Bill Savage.  They are married and live off the money Myra makes as a medium.  She holds seances at there house, hence the title which I think must have been taken from the climax scene of the story. I don't want to give away to much, basically they want to get more money and quickly.  They cook up a scheme, well, mostly Myra does, to kidnap a well to do fellow's daughter.  Do they get caught?  One must read to find out as I will not give away too much of this very intense book.   The two reasons I wanted to read this is. 1.  The idea, while I do appreciate the crime drama/mystery from time to time. They get so formulatic after a while.  It seems as though there hasn't been many that have interested me lately.  This book has been around a while, and it seems to be very obscure.  I was surprised to see that no one else had reviewed it.  It has some excellent twists and turns in the story that keep the reader guessing as to how things will turn out. 2.  The price. ...  This is definitely worth much more than that!   McShane writes with great description of everything that goes on, and the dialogue is just divine. He really knows how to bring characters so totally alive and seem as if they are just about to jump off the page.  He knows how to keep the reader interested and gripped to the very last page. There were times where I didn't want to go on with it because Myra is just so unlikable, but the plot kept me going.  Her husband, is teetering on bad himself due to the influences that Myra has on him.  Besides, while she is the brain behind the operation, Bill does all the grunt work.   The ending is excellent!!! Very creepy!! This is worth reading!!! Plus, it is only 189 pages so it doesn't take to long to get through it.
