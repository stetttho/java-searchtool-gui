 I am a great admirer of Marilyn, and while I did buy this movie, and I watch it a few times a year, it still isn't one of my favorites.  I gave the film the 3 stars for MM!  Marilyn is fine her performance, but it's no Cheree' from Bus Stop.  This film reverts back to her older films, cutesy musical movies with cheesy plots. I thought that Gentlemen prefer Blondes was a much better musical and a better movie. Let's make Love is lacking..I found Yves Montand to be so boring and a bad actor!!! He just didn't go well with Marilyn at all.  It amazes me that she had an affair with him; I think maybe the fact that he bares a slight resemblence to Joe Dimaggio may have something to do with that.  And the fact that she was very depressed and estranged from her husband at the time, Arthur Miller probably didn't help either. The movie does offer some entertaining musical numbers, but the first half hour of it is SO BORING!!!!! I fast forward through it now.  The scenes with Marilyn are the best.  Also the cameos of Gene Kelley, Milton Berle, and Bing Crosby help to make this film a little more watchable.  The script is awful! Aside from Yves' wooden performance, the rest of the acting is fine.  I always find Tony Randall so amusing in his earlier films.   I'd have to say the first scene with Marilyn, when she performs "My heart belongs to Daddy" makes the film worth purchasing for one's Marilyn collection.  I think you can only truly appreciate this film if you are a big admirer of her's. The movie itself is a big flop, and from what I've read Marilyn thought so, too.  She seems very distant and has very low self esteem through out the movie.(well, except in her first scene). If you want a great movie musical, this is going to sorely disappoint.
