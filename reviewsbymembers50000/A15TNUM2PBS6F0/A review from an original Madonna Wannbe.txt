 Back in 1984, when I was 15 years old, I was a "Madonna Wannabe".  I know that has absolutely nothing to do with this album, but the Madonna I knew and grew to love was a green Madonna, a young, burgeoning woman -- The Madonna in the Borderline video. Now, almost 20 years later, I am a more mature individual(no more rubber bracelets & midriff baring shirts made up of lace), and so is she.  Everything about her has ripened -- her voice, her songwriting, her thoughts, her idea of what her music should be, and with her first child being born right around the time this album was released The Material girl herself has aged very gracefully.  The photo of her on the cover is gorgeous.  "Ray of Light" the first single from the album is one of the most original songs of hers to date -- faster than the speeding light she refers to in the song. No other hit of hers from my rememberence has such a eclectic sound to it.  I can listen to it over and over and find total joy in it's words, it's driving beat, and Madonna's boundless energy.   After listening to the entire album for oh, the millionith time, I feel a bit at peace and very alive at the same time.  Listening to it I can picture it being background music for a yoga class or music you'd hear in a nightclub -- music that gets everyone's hips gyrating.   It makes me truly happy to love this album as much as I love the very first Madonna record I had which was simply titled "Madonna".  Sure, "Lucky star", "borderline", and "Everybody" are not remotely close to sounding like the songs featured here but this is a good thing.   It is a spectacular feat to have your fans love all your work that span over 20 years.  Madonna has never disappointed me with any of her music.  "Ray of Light"  beams with a mix of ballads and dance tunes with profound lyrics and funky beats. In my honest opinion, it's pure brilliance.
