 It's very rare that I appreciate every single song on a record, but I love every one on "Come on over". Shania Twain may be a crossover/country pop queen, but she is a very talented performer and sings like an angel.   Looks all aside, this is a truly beautifully gifted performer.  I can't deny her her looks.  She is a stunningly beautiful woman, and from what I've seen of her on Vh1's Behind the music, she is just as beautiful inside if not more so. Like I said, I love every song here.  There are a lot of fast songs that get me bopping along to the beat, and there are some sappy love songs, "Still the one" is the big hit of the album and is still the one to me, even after all this time. "Come on Over" was released in 1997, and is still an extremely well played disc in my car.   I highly recommend this album!! It's chock full of songs that will get you moving, feeling a little romantic, and two stepping.
