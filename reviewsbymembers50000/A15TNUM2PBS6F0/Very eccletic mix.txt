 Sugar Ray seems to have many sides to their music, and this album showcases their ecclectic talents.  Not every song sounds the same, and I liked every song.  It's a great album and addition to my c.d. library.   I am usually weary about buying any c.d. that isn't a compliation album of songs I know I already like. I got this for Christmas, and if i had bought it, I would not have been disappointed.  Like Tom Petty, Sugar Ray's entire album sounds great.  I don't have all their albums yet, but plan to. I totally recommend this one, it's fun to listen to and totally rocks and it won't disappoint in the least.
