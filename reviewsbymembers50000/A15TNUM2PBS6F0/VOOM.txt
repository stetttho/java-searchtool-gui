 This story is read on a nightly basis to my son at his bedtime..He loves it!  For a long book like this, he actually sits still and is mesmerized by the pictures and that Cat in his Hat.  Dr. Seuss was pure genius in the craft of writing for young children and there are scores of generations that appreciate his works. Simple words, rhyming times, and eye catching antics of the cat are all the ingredients to what makes this story work.  He's come back to visit the children from the first story, and proceeds to make a giant mess.   We meet little cats A through Z, who are just as cute as can be.  Then something called VOOM makes everything right.  yes, it does.  Then Mommy says goodnight. There is something about reviewing Dr. Seuss, that just makes me want to rhyme. This is a great addition to your child's collection of books for years to come!
