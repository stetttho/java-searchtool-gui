 Having read all books now, but one, the newest one, "That Lullaby", I can easily say that Sarah Dessen is a groundbreaking, utterly amazing writer.  I just finished "Someone like you", and while there is so much I could say, I'd rather just say this: Every topic in the story of Halley Cooke's coming of age is covered in a vast array of novels for the genre. It is Dessen's approach and style that make it her own. Everything flows like a smooth brook of crystal clear water.  She sucks you in and breathes life into all her characters.  I just want to sit and read until I finish every last page every time I read any of her books.   I'm just sad there were no writers like her around when I was a teenager back in the 80's.   Enough said. Now go check this book out!!!
