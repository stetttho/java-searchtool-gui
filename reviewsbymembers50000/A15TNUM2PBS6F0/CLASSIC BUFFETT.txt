 This is one of JB's albums that is a definite must own!!!  Especially for the newer phans that have only phlocked among us recently. I feel that listening to JB's older music will help you realize the scope that he has as a musician, and it will give you more of a perspective on his work as a whole. This is one of the greatest of all his albums to date.  The oh so popular hits by Buffett are here.   Such as "Son of a son of a Sailor(album title)", what an awesome song that just sets the tone for the entire record.  It is a  one of his greatest hits of all time, and in so many ways reflects the man himself.  "Livingston Saturday Night", which was performed in both films, "FM", and "Rancho Deluxe", by JB himself.  The sing a long "Cheeseburger in Paradise" is also here.  This is one of my all time favorite songs by Jimmy, probably more of an obvious choice, but a very fun and danceable tune that always gets me going.  And always seems to make me hungry for that big hunk of meat. This is a necessary album for any Buffett phans collection!  You won't be disappointed!
