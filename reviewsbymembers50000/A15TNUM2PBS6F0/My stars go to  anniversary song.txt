 I bought this c.d. probably 10 years ago for the 'anniversary song'.  It is the best thing going for this tedious disc. I like women in rock with harmonious and soothing voices, and the singer here definitely falls into the category. However, I found this album very boring, but her voice is excellent.  Most of the songs sound alike with the exception of it's most commercial recording of the anniversary song.   I don't know their catalog of music but I hope that the rest of their records aren't as bland as this one.  Just my thoughts..I seem to have the lowest star review here so other people seem to appreciate their haunting lyrics hopefully over their non melodies.
