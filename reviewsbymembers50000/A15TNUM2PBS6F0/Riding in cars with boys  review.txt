 The latest effort from Penny Marshall's direction is not her best.  This movie tells the story of a woman, who I did not care for at all, or have any sympathy for, named Beverly Donofrio. Bev, at age 15, makes a "mistake" that changes her life forever. In the meantime, she is ruthless about getting a college education and getting her book, same title as the movie, published.  While it is good to be ambitious, it is not good to be so darn selfish, irresponsible(even for age 15), and well, just plain mean.   I found Bev to be a very unsympathic, rude, sometimes heartless and unfeeling person. Why was this film even made? Who should even care about this woman as she is just a total selfish, well, female dog for lack of a better word.  And why did I bother renting it?  I'll tell you... Yes, I squirmed in my seat a lot, and forced myself to watch the entire movie.  I did however, like the performance of Brittany Murphy, who plays Bev's best friend, Fae. She had her character down, and is a great young actress with a lot of potential. Murphy, and pretty much every other actor on the screen, totally outacted Drew.  I just don't think she is a good actress at all.  She had a very forced and unrealistic New York accent, also.  Both her and her character annoyed me beyond belief.   There were some very poignant, and truly funny momments in this film between Bev and her family and friends.  It wasn't a total waste of time, but it wasn't great.  There are far better movies from 2001. James Woods, Lorraine Bracco, and Steve Zahn were all very good in their roles, and very believable.  I think just sitting back and watching someone "ruin" their lives isn't really my idea of a totally entertaining film.
