 Christopher Guest, creator of Waiting for Guffman, has done it again!! This was just as funny and entertaining as Guffman if not funnier!!! I have watched real dogshows, and to watch this send up on one, is hysterically funny! IF you love the "mockumentary" style film this is an excellent choice.   I loved the Norich Terrier, he was the cutest dog I've ever seen!!  This is a fun move -- it's consistently funny, no boring drawn out parts where you ask yourself, "is this really funny?" And all the actors/actresses have perfect comedic timing. I just might buy this as I think it would be a great addition to any collection.
