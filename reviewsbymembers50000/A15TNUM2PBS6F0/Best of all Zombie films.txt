 "Night of the Living Dead" is the original zombie movie.  The start of a not a new genre, but a new "boogeyman/bad guy" type in the horror movie genre. Due to something weird in the air, the recent dead are coming back and feasting on the flesh of the living.  Then those killed come back within minutes to feast on others... Enter Barbara and her brother, Tom.  They have come to visit their Father's grave and are unsuspectingly attacked by one of the walking dead.  Her brother is killed and she must get away from the fleshhungry ghoul.  She finds a house.   Enter Ben, a black gentleman who also finds the house, also the Cooper family finds this abandoned house(The owner is now one of the zombies).  The Cooper's daughter was bitten by one of the zombies, and no one yet knows what will happen to her. There is also a young couple. The movie pretty much all takes place in the house, aside from seeing the zombies come at the place in slow motion.  I won't give away what happens but most horror movies do not have happy endings.  The ending was very surprising to me -- kind of funny. See it for the great direction by George Romero, for the extremely interesting camera work, and especially for the gore, which is pretty tame by today's standards but a bit gory for the 60s'> There is also a bit of nudity in this as one of the female zombies seems to have died naked. I can see why this movie was deemed a horror campy classic.  I highly recommend this one.  Turn the lights off, and enjoy this one.
