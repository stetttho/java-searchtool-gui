 They just don't make Christmas special like these anymore.  There was a whole group of ones like this by "Rankin & Bass"..If you see these names, you know you have found a gem of a Christmas animated special.  They also don't air these on t.v. like they used to.  This showed up on ABC Family network on Satellite t.v. the other night, and I got the chance to see it for the first time in ages.   It is based on the questions the children ask about how Santa came to be.  The music is rather catchy, I still remember the words to "Put one foot in front of the other".  This isn't as good as "The Year without a Santa Claus" but it comes in for a close second.  It is worth buying if you like this kind of animation.  (Stop motion, claymation mixed)..sort of like Nightmare before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach. but older looking. You'll have fun watching this one, and will watch it alot..
