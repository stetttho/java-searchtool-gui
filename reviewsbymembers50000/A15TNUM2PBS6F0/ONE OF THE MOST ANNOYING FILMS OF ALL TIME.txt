 and why did I spend 1 1/2 hours of my time with it?  At least I waited until it was on cable!  I actually waited til there was pretty much nothing on cable but this movie.  I had heard the bad reviews and have read alot of bad reviews here.  I am just glad to know I am not the only one out there who thinks this movie really stunk!  It's about three sisters, Meg Ryan being the only non selfish one.  Their father, played by Walter Matthau, is in the hospital and dying.  The whole film centers around their darn cellphone conversations and self absorption. The acting in this film is horrendous, but I'd have to say that the most annoying part of this film is CELL PHONES...I would like to personally knock out the person who invited them into this story or into any existence at all for that matter.  The whole film is Meg Ryan yelling at Diane Keaton and Lisa Kudrow on the cell phone, while they all are clad from head to toe in black.  WEll, Meg does wear other colors but what was up with the constant black wardrobe on Kudrow and Keaton?  The screenplay was awful, I don't know what happened to Nora Ephron, but after this one she should probably reconsider a new career. This film has no plot, bad acting, bad screenplay, and is just plain annoying.  I could have changed the channel or shut the t.v. off, but I really thought it would get somewhat better. take some good advice and let this one collect dust on the shelf at the video store.  ALL i can say is I'm glad I avoided this in the theaters and the video stores.  The only thing I really wasted was my own time.  AVOID THIS ONE AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!  REALLY BAD!!!!! DON'T BOTHER!!!!!
