 Take "There's no Business like show business"(a completely awful movie which showcases marilyn's voice and body while the rest of it bores the heck out of you) out of this great collection of MM's films, and you have got quite a nice set of movies to feast upon.  Also, the documentary, which originally aired on AMC, "The Last Days", is outstanding.  Marilyn looks stunning in the footage of her last work on film that was never shown until now.   "The Seven Year Itch", "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, "How to Marry a Millionare", and "Bus Stop"(yippee!! finally back and looking fantastic on dvd) are all great movies of Marilyn's and throwing that monstrosity I mention above in was in bad taste.   I still think it's worth buying. I got it as a gift.  It is a perfect gift for the Marilyn lovers like myself.
