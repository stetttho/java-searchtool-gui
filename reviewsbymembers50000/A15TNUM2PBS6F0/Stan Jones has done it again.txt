 This being the second book of his, I had highly anticipated "Shaman Pass".  I am happy to say I was highly entertained and even more impressed at Mr. Jones' second installment of Nathan Active mysteries. He writes with great fervor.  "Uncle Frosty", a mummy has been stolen from the local museum. Victor Solomon turns up dead and has Uncle Frosty's amulet and harpoon on him. Hm....this is enough to bring in Trooper Active and have him do some serious investigating and flying across beautiful Alaska.    It's fabulous writing and another great lesson of Alaska. It's a great mystery from a great writer.
