 This is certainly one of the greatest hits albums that you can't wrong with on buying it.   I bought this used, and at that time I only knew "Reminiscing", and "Lonesome Loser".  These were both songs I loved growing up in the late 70's.  I was very pleasantly surprised with this album. I have grown to love the entire album.  There isn't a dud on it.  I don't find myself skipping over any songs like I do with some other "greatest hits" albums that I have. LRB certainly is obscure.  Many people look at my c.d. and don't have a clue who they are, but when they here it, they like it. Then they remember those hits mentioned before. They have a mellow sound, kind of like the Eagles. This is worth buying -- I love it's easy going sound.
