 This is Jimmy's transistional album.  Before this album, he sounded more country/folk.  This is where the definitive Buffett that us Parrottheads know and love really starts to shine. Not that I don't appreciate his earlier stuff, but this is what I've known, really known for the past 10 years.   While "Margaritaville" is the clear hit here, this album also is home to "Lovely Cruise"(a personal favorite, it was played at my wedding as the last song), "Banana Republic", "In the City"..The entire record is just a great selection of music and a must have for Buffett fans.   FINS UP....
