 It's not so much the fact that there have been far too many Musketeer films, as the fact that this movie stinks!!! The acting is totally atrocious!!! SOme of the worst acting I've seen on film. Mena Suvari was so good in American Beauty, but in this dud  she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.Whoever that guy is playing D'artanan...he looked a bit like Chris O'Donnell, who did play this character in the three musketeers, he needs to take some acting classes or find a new career. What a bore! While this fellow was nice to look at, he was such a bad actor!  He needs to just stick to something easy, like male modeling.   This is just another attempt at a swashbuckler film, and it failed miserably.  Reminds me of some made for t.v. movie that might show up on the WB network. Watch the Musketeer film with Chris O'Donnell and Kiefer Sutherland. It's a much better made film.
