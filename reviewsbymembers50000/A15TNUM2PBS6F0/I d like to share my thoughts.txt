 This is one of the worst movies ever made.  What the heck was Dana Carvey thinking?   I had to leave the room this was so boring and unfunny. Even the kids watching this with me, left the room!  This is a total waste of film, money, and time.  I had more fun cleaning my apartment! When I did come back and ask my husband how it was, 3/4 of the way through he said,  "This is possibly one of the worst movies ever." Thoughts shared.  Rent a quality fun film flick like "Spy Kids", both of them are better than this drivel.
