 "Freaky Friday" is a true classic film to come from the world of Disney. With Jodie Foster, one of the most brilliant and beautiful actresses of her generation, as Annabel, and the vivacious Barbara Harris as her mom, Ellen "Freaky Friday" has gone down in my history of film watching as one of the best all around.  Upon seeing the preview of the new version with jamie lee curtis, I immediately seeked out the orginal.  It is funny, and just a pure joy to view multiple times.   The movie's basic plot is it's Friday the 13th, and Annabel and her mom are at war with each other. They both exclaim "i wish I could trade places with her", and their wishes come true!   The hijinks and chaos ensues.   Here's a film you can watch with your entire family. How many movies can you say that about these days? it's utterly unforgettable, and even now that I am no longer a kid, I will always have a special place in my heart for this sweet silly story.
