 I've always appreciated David Spade's sense of humor and have liked the films he's been in.  He was also one of the better SNL regulars.   This film should not be taken so seriously, it's a silly comedy about a boy who has a mullett haircut glued to his head.  He is searching for his family, when all along he knows who is real family is. Droning and boring Dennis Miller plays a dj that brings Joe on the air to spill his story, thus, this is the entire movie.   It had some laughs, many of them were stupid laughs, but nonetheless, I have to admit I found myself laughing.  Maybe I'm a bit ashamed as this certainly isn't one of the greatest comedies of all time.  It does get a little trite and predictable, but Spade gets a few good laughs in. Rent at your own risk.  I didn't pay for this rental, so I can't say it's worth the fee.
