 I have been a longtime fan of James Woods.  Before viewing the first fifteen minutes of this trash, I used to respect him as an actor. After seeing him (...) grunting and groaning, I could never look at him the same way again. I am so sick of all the toilet humor in movies.  It's getting really old and stupid.  It isn't funny, and has never been. I am just very upset that he did this awful movie.   I had to shut it off after that scene, I was just too weirded out that an Oscar caliber actor would resort to such drivel and disgust. If he is trying to show his sense of humor, this was the wrong forte.  His acting is usually high caliber, and I hope he realizes it was a grave mistake to his career. Skip this if you are serious Woods' fan or you will be a non fan. I am really tired of movies with so much disgusting antics, it is childish and getting to be really old.
