 with some karoake thrown in.  I saw "Twin Falls Idaho", and The Polish brothers have certainly got their own brand of film.  "Jackpot" is their sophmoric effort, and it is just visually stunning.   Great cinematography! Jon Gries plays "Sunny Holiday", a drifter type who wants to become a professional singer. He is married to the foul mouthed Daryl Hannah, and they have a little girl.  He leaves them to embark on his journey to Karoake bars, but he is also on a journey of self discovery.  He meets a lot of people along the way, and there is some fine supporting acting.  This film is definitely in the "road movie" category. The movie itself is more of a character study than plot driven. The character isn't entirely sympathetic. At times, you almost want to hate him.  I don't think we are supposed to like Sunny, but he gets under your skin. He does the karoake thing to get the practice, and meets up with SNL original cast member, Garrett Morris. Morris becomes his manager, and they are very good team. They were both excellent in this little, unknown and somewhat likeable movie. The Karoake scenes were all pretty entertaining.   He did have a decent voice which sounded better when crooning country songs.  This movie is very different from the other karoake movie, "Duets", although I did like that movie better than this one. This movie was an original, but what it has in originality doesn't make up for the awful ending.  It just really disappointed me and my husband, especially since we had really liked it up until that point. It is as if they just ran out of time or film.   "Duets" is much lighter than this, this is a bit more serious but much better acted..you decide.  Better still, they are both decent movies, and I think it's fun to watch celebs do Karoake.
