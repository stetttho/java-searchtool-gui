 "Feedback" is an album of covers by Rush, one of the bands who have stood the true test of time in my life.  I've been a fan of Rush since the early 80's yet my collection of records has worn thin..literally.  I've always loved their sound, their classic hits, and their light show(got to see them in 89').  Upon hearing about their 30th reunion tour, I had a sudden recharging urge to run out and buy their c.d.s'.   The urge was quickly put to bed when I received this disc as a gift.  While I don't even know all these songs, I thought this was fantastic. The band sounds excellent. They cover one of my favorite Who tunes, which isn't even one of the bigger hits, "The Seeker".  "For what's it worth" and "Crossroads", and "Summertime Blues" are the only other songs I really know well off this, but I really like this album.  It was something different yet familiar at the same time.    Some of the reviews here seemed very critical of the sound and the song choices, but it was a true feat for Geddy Lee to take some classic hits and make them his own.  It's a purchase that music lovers with diverse tastes will appreciate.
