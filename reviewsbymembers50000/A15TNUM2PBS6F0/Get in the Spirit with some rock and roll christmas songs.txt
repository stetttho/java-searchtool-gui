 Back in the late 80's, when this came out, I bought the album. Yes, I was still listening to albums while everyone else was buying compact discs.  It is a well worn album at that.  I love this album!! It has awesome renditions of classics and a few more modern Christmas carols, gotta love RUNDMC's rap.  It has some of my all time favorite artists like Stevie Nicks, John Mellencamp, U2, and Madonna.  It is a very 80's group of artists. This is a record that will put you in great Christmas spirit. The c.d. has found a permanent home in my car now, and it's a c.d. worth buying for some great rocking' Christmas Carols. This is a highly recommended album!!  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
