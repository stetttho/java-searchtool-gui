 My first introduction of "The Wiggles" was a blurb of their show on the Disney channel when I was picking my son up from daycare. I thought that it was very goofy and silly seeing grown men dance around and sing. Now that we've bought this dvd, and I have watched it in it's entirity about fifty times, plus have seen my son's reactions and dancing, It is still goofy and silly but it's all in good fun. Like any party. You party pooper reviewers out there, not every single thing you watch is all that educational for you! so why should everything your children watch be? If you really think about it there is a sense of education here. My son has learned to appreciate polka, rock, dance/pop music, and folk songs. This video helps them to appreciate music and also they learn that dancing is fun. Plus, younger children, like my son, don't really watch it that much and see those annoying patterns that many reviewers mentioned. I am glad that two of these wiggly men are attractive, at least, much more attractive than Steve, of "blues' clues", which I have to watch every day as well.  Anthony & Greg totally rock!!!! And I think they all look like they are having a really good time.  Isn't that what all parties are supposed to be about? If you are really concerned with visual patterns, this maybe a bad choice of video. Otherwise I recommend it for children between the ages of 1 1/2(like my son) and 7.  Most of the children in the video are between these ages, and they all look like they are having a good time. This is a FUN video..It's pure entertainment....and we all like to be entertained from time to time.. Eileen Famiglietti
