 but also hard to stop watching!   I generally am not a fan of Lynch's work.  I think his movies are extremely bizarre and the story always hard to follow because of the weird fashion they seem to be in. While this movie did have me totally lost, I was intrigued by the story. Naomi Watts plays "Betty", a fresh faced girl who has just moved to L.A. to make it as an actress.  I appreciate films about the making of actors, but this goes beyond that. She meets "Rita", who has been involved in a nasty car accident(This is the start of the film). Rita has lost her memory, and Betty decides to help her figure out who she is. Do we really ever find out who "Rita" really is?  I watched this movie three days ago, and I still don't know.  This movie was confusing, really confusing.  I think they were going back and forth in time, but the viewer doesn't really know for sure.  At least I didn't.   There are some really strange characters, as with every Lynch project, that join Betty and Rita along the way to figuring out the truth about Rita's life. This is a twisted tale of Hollywood. Both actresses were excellent, and Justin Theroux, who plays a director in the film, was very good. I just saw him in a play in Boston, and he is a great actor. It's been so long since I've watched any of Lynch's other work, but I think only diehard fans of his will truly appreciate this film.  It's extremely hard to follow but at the same time it's interesting.  I found myself engrossed in it, and wanting to know what the turnout would be.  I'm still trying to figure it out.
