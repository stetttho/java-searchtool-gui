 "America The Beautiful" is a novel by Moon Unit Zappa, who most of us know as Frank Zappa's daughter.  She is also the chick that rambled on in the parody hit, Valley Girl, back in the early 80s'.  That is what I think of when I see her name. Now I will think about what an original and fresh voice she's added to today's literature.  While she definitely was "writing what she knows"(I am a fledgling writer and have heard that repeatedly), she definitely knows how to write.  Her style is unique, and she has a real flair for dialogue.  It really was well written and it was easy to follow.  It is also laugh out loud funny at times. I think a lot of women will relate to the character, America Throne, who constantly makes bad choices in her men.  The story is about her rollercoaster style life of relationships, and her amnomosity towards her father.  She learns about herself, and you will enjoy the ride.  I promise.... When's the next book, Moon?
