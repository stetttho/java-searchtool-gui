 I read most of the book a few years ago, I hated it so much!! I thought it was too drawn out, boring, and just frustrated me so much. I figured that one day I would watch the movie, and I will find out then what happens in the end.  I like both Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd, and I think that they brought their character's to life so greatly.  They made them seem so real to me.  Plus, the movie only took two hours of my time, but the book, which was put down so often, took a much longer time.  The book was very hard to get into, but if you like the talents of both Portman and Judd, you'll appreciate this movie much more than the book.  The book is usally better than the movie, this is one of those rare exceptions.  It's is a very heartwarming movie that will make you laugh and cry.  Also, the acting is excellent despite what I had heard from other reviews.  Stockard gives the character of Sister Husband great soul. I watched this one on HBO, but I would definitely recommend it for a rental now that I've finally watched it as I had kept passing it up on the video shelf.
