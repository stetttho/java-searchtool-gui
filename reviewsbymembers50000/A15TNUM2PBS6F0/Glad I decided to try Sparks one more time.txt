 When I read "The Notebook" some five odd years ago, I really didn't care for Spark's brand of writing.  It seemed so cliched and Harlequin romance.  I really thought I'd never like his work. I was given this book by my mother to read, and I loved it! It starts off great.  It is being narrated by the main character, Landon, at ages 57 and 17.  Landon is a very likable character.  I immediately felt drawn to him, and I wanted to learn more about who he was.  Sparks did a great job of allowing us to get to know his characters.  I grew to love both Landon, and Jamie, who is the female character in the story.  They are in high school, and are both going through a lot in their senior year.  They share a lot of good and bad times together, and eventually fall in love.  It's a bittersweet story, and worth reading right to the last page.   This is a very quick, easy to read book, but it also tragically sad.  It is a beautiful story, and it was beautifully written by Nicholas Sparks.   It is not just a romantic story, but it is a coming of age story as well.  I think it would appeal to a lot of people as just a good story, even if it is very sad.  It is worth the tears.
