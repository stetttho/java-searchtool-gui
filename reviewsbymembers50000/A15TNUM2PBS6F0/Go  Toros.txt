 Bring it on really surprised me.  It is a cute film, with some great dialogue and awesome dance sequences.   From reading the other reviews, I am going to guess that most of the reviewers are all between the ages of 12 and 17, with a few adults sprinkled in between. I am among the adults, 31 yrs. old, and I liked this movie -- It had alot of heart, and it's a cute little story with a great soundtrack.  I think Kirsten Dunst is one of the better younger actresses right now, and she has a great future in Hollywood.   She was very convincing as the new captain to the cheerleading squad for the Toros(a championship winning squad at that).  Come to find out that her whole cheerleading career is a lie when she learns all the cheers are stolen from another squad from East compton.  So they have to come up with something original.  One of the funniest scenes is when a "professional choreographer" comes to teach them a thing or two about real dancing.  Eventually they do have to come up with their own cheer for the finals in Florida. This is a cheery little film, no pun intended.  It wasn't great,but it is well worth the rental fee. Be sure to stay tuned for the outtakes at the end.  They are always fun to watch.
