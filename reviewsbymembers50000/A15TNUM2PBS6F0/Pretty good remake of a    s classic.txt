 Like I have felt about most remakes, when i heard about this, i cringed a bit.  Then i saw who was starring in it - Billy Bob Thornton, one of my favorite actors. Then I also noticed that Richard Linklater directed it. He also directed one of my all time favorite movies, "dazed and confused".  So, as the credits started rolling and the cool soundtrack started playing, I went into the first viewing of this version with no expectations.   In all honesty, I think it's a decent movie.  I laughed quite a bit, however, I missed the original "Kelly"(Jackie Haley) and "Amanda"(Tatum O'Neal - who is much more charasmatic and talented than the girl in this one) I felt the actor who played Kelly was too cute and innocent looking. Kelly is supposed to be this tough juvenile deliquent type.  Those were my only quips about the movie as I did like it enough to recommend it. If you'd seen the original, and like Billy Bob in all his many works on film, you will like this.  I think both he and Walter Matthau are equally talented actors, and they both took the role of Morris Buttermaker and made them their own.  Owning both versions is not a bad idea at all. In fact, I do own them both and won't ever get rid of them.
