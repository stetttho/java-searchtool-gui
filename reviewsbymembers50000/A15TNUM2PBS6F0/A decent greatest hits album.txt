 I am not a huge Buddy Holly fan, but I have always like his music as I do listen to alot of 50's music.  I liked this album, it has all the songs I know by him. "Maybe Baby" being a personal fave...reminds me of the show "happy days" for some reason.  Buddy Holly was a true pioneer of rock, and was taken far too soon.  This is a good tribute for the casual fan to listen to. By by, miss american pie...
