 "Hollow Man" is "The Invisible Man" meets "Friday the 13th".   I gave this film three stars for it's effects and for Kevin Bacon.  If the film were void of both these, it would be a big waste of time. Kevin Bacon is very good as the Doctor that volunteers himself to be turned invisible, and he is the first human to do so. They can't get him to turn visible again __ oh no!  Bacon takes advantage of being invisible, and wrecks havoc all over the place.  From sexually assaulting a woman he watches from his apartment to killing people, and copping a feel from his fellow female employees.  Eventually, along with his flesh he loses his mind, and goes on a killing spree. This isn't a great horror film, but it's got great visual effects during the process of invisible to visible and vice versa.  Seeing a giant gorilla reappear and Kevin Bacon disappear are both very graphic and kind of gross but wow! -- whoever created these effects deserves an oscar (The film was nominated for Best Visual effects).   In my opinion, the film doesn't have much else going for it.  The rest of the acting is pretty bad.  Elizabeth Shue needs to either get a new career or at least some acting lessons.  She turned in a very lame performance.  The screenplay wasn't much better.  Rent Hollow Man for a look at it's great effects and it's great lead actor Kevin Bacon.
