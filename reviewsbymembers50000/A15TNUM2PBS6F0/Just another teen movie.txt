 Let's all face it, the true great teen comedies came out in the 1980's..'sixteen candles, breakfast club, ferris bueller, Heathers..." I did laugh a few times in this, but i was then wretching. What is it with teen comedies today? So many of them are crude and disgusting. "The New Guy" at least has a message: be yourself. DJ Qualls, who was the really geeky guy in Road Trip, plays Dizzy. He wants so badly to fit in, he does anything in his power to do so..  He ends up in jail after some minor charges brought against him in school, and is schooled in how to be cool by Eddie Griffin, who was funny in this. He doesn't even have to say anything, he has great expressions. Such as the EYE... Dizzy has his real friends, and then makes new friends at a new school after being expelled.  Elisha Dishku, who I remember from the t.v. show "Buffy the vampire slayer", plays Dizzy's new friend who takes him under her wing, and helps him become "in". Eventually the jig is up, and everyone finds out the truth about the new guy...This is typical-- very predictable but at the same time is sort of funny in a stupid way.   Country singer, and sometime actor Lyle Lovett plays Dizzy's father. He is actually pretty good in this. This is cute for a few laughs, it's not the worst of it's kind. It's hardly a classic. I think a younger audience than myself and fans of Elisha will appreciate this more.
