 As a fan of most of Cameron Crowe's other work, I was somewhat disappointed with this movie.  It wasn't terrible or the worst movie of the year as some reviewers here seem to think.  It also wasnt' great or one of the best of the year.  It was good, but I also thought it was very boring.  The acting was outstanding by Crudup, Fugit, Hudson, McDormand, and Seymour Hoffman.  The screenplay was good, I was very happy to see Cameron Crowe finally win an award.  He won the Oscar for best screenplay. The idea of this movie really seemed like a good one to me, and when I first watched the movie, I was pretty happy with the outcome.  Then recently I watched it again and was bored.  I kept saying, did i really like this?  It just seemed so lame and to not be going anywhere.  Maybe it just isn't one of the movies, for me anyway, that I can view repeatedly. The music I could certainly listen to over and over.  The soundtrack is better than the movie.   I just thought the story was really not all that interesting or entertaining.  It seemed to drag, and it wasn't particularly funny.  If it was supposed to be, I don't know where I was supposed to laugh.   It's certainly worth a look at for the great acting and soundtrack and screenplay.  It's just not all that fun to watch.  I compare it to another Crowe movie, Jerry McGuire.  This movie had so much hype, like Almost, and when I saw it in the theaters, I fell asleep!!! I am a woman, and I love romance comedies.  I didn't think either of these films were much of either but more of a sleep aid. I think Crowe's best work was Singles and Say Anything.  They were both very entertaining comedies.
