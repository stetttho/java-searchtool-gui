 Every once in awhile, an album comes along where every single track on it is great, the hits are plentiful, and it is just all so perfect.  Not one song gets skipped on the disc, and even the songs that aren't the big hits sound just as good as the hits do. "Don't Say No" by Billy Squier is one of those albums.   Squier is one the guitar playing rock singers to make it big in the early 80's, but he will always remain in my c.d. collection and still get a lot of playing time.  His music certainly may sound very 80's to a lot of people, but I think it's pure rock and roll.  This is an awesome album. Play it loud!  Highly recommended for hard rock fans that love great guitar riffs!
