 I bought this book about ten years ago for $1.99.  As a Marilyn fan, I was curious and thought it was a good addition to my collection.  I finally read it, and I really liked it.  Despite the other review here, I found it to be very entertaining, and it was interesting to discover "what if".  While Staggs isn't Hemingway or Shakespeare, I think he is a very good writer.  He is good with words and is very descriptive and has a knack for dialogue.  It was a very interesting interpetation of MM's life had she not died.  There have been a few other writers who tried to do the same thing.  The two I have read are Marilyn's Daughter, which I liked as much as this one.  Although, I don't remember it that well.  But I would have remembered it if I didn't like it.  Speaking of not liking, Blonde, by Joyce Carol Oates is the other book that displays MM in a fictious way.  I didn't even finish that one as I did not enjoy it at all.   This book starts with MM at the end of her Hollywood career and instead of her dying another woman takes her place.  Everyone thinks it is her, and in the eyes of most of the world, MM is dead.  but she is kidnapped and taken "underground", eventually she runs away from her captors.  She lives her life under a different name, and meets alot of interesting characters along the way to a different kind of success. I would recommend this book for both MM fans and anyone just looking for something a little different. It is a great book.
