 "UH HUH" is one of my favorite albums of all time because it has an entire album worth of kick butt rock songs by one of the most talented performers who spawned from the 80's.   Back when this record originally came out, I had the cassette tape which was warped beyond recognition due to it being played so much.  Now, close to 20 years later, I still have just as much fun singing along(I still know all the words to the entire album) and playing it loudly.  It's got some great guitar riffs, and it also got my butt moving quicker at the gym. I was a big fan of JCM from the moment his "American Fool" album came out, and while that is a great album, I like this one better.  I think it packs more of a punch.  It is so much fun to listen to, like most of his music, and it's music and lyrics are just awesome. Plus this album has some of the greatest hits of JCM's career, "Pink Houses", "Authority Song", and "crumblin down". My personal favorite on this album is "PLay guitar".  There is amazingly good guitar playing on it, as does the rest of this group of outstanding songs by the man himself. If you like John Mellencamp's music and you still don't own this disc, buy it!! You will not be disappointed.
