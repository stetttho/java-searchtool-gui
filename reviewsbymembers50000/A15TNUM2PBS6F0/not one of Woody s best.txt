 After watching this film on cable recently, I am glad I waited that long to see it.  I like Woody Allen's films, and am usually quite amused by them.  He has a few unfunny films, and this is undoubtedly the worst!  The worst part of this film is the pathetic and extremely annoying performance by Mira Sorvino.  I am not a big fan of her, but I was curious to see her performance as she had won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.  It was horrendous.  What was the academy thinking?  She was more than annoying, and what was up with the voice?  She is known for making up strange voices for her roles (Romy, in Romy and Michelle's High school Reunion, and her awful attempt at playing Marilyn Monroe).   The story wasn't bad, Woody Allen, Lenny and Helen Bonham Carter, (i don't remember her character's name but she thinks she is Judy Davis) are a married couple who adopt a baby and when the child develops his intelligence, Woody is on a rampage to find out who this child's real mother is.  The real mother is Mira Sorvino, who is a porn actress, trying to get a real acting job, and she also turns tricks.  Woody goes out of his way to get to know her and help her to turn her life around so if his son Max does decide to ever look up his real mother she will be a more respectable person. Throughout the film, there are actors dressed up in Shakespearan costumes, and they are telling the story of what is happening in the movie.  They also try to play god with Lenny's life.  THat whole part was kind of strange.  I wouldn't recommend this film, unless you are a fan of Mira Sorvino.  It is one of the worst Woody Allen films made in my opinion.
