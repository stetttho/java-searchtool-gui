 I bought this c.d. the day after I saw the movie, which I also love.  i can't say enough good things here..It's an awesome soundtrack!!! The tunes on here will have humming along, and eventually, you'll start singing along and having a grand old time. Like many of the other reviewers here, I am not a huge fan of this genre of music usually. On sunday mornings, just put on this c.d, read the paper, have yuor coffee..It really is great relaxing music whether you are a fan or not.   I highly recommend this for all music fans who would like to expand their horizons.  There are some catchy bluesy tunes, and some softer selections that will help you relax.
