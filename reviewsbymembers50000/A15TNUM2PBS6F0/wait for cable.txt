 Aside from a few attractive "actors/actresses" -- and I use these terms lightly, this film has little to offer.  The acting was terrible, the plot was okay, but needed alot of work!!! There were holes in it. This is a cheap ripoff of "Wild things".  They even went so far as to have a Denise Richards ripoff who was trying to hard to be Jason Vorhees.   Don't waste your money, at least wait for it on HBO if you really are curious about it.
