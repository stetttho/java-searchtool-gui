 Valley of the dolls is one of the great "camp" classics of all time.  It definitely has a high cheese factor also. The songs, the cheesey soundtrack, and the dialgoue all rank HIGH on cheesiness.  So if you are a big fan of cheesy, campy kind of films that just offer alot of fun, you'll be pleasantly surprised with this movie.   It has been wildly criticized as being an extremely bad movie. I just think it's lots of fun despite wooden acting and cheesy lounge act singing.  "come live with me" is one of the good ones especially when neely and tony sing it in the sanitariuam. patty duke, who thought this was her worst perfomance ever, was perfect as neely.  complete overacting is what calls for this character. read the book first, it is a page turner! i read it in two days! so bring on all the cheese..cuz this is without a doubt the best of all cheese/camp drama classic...
