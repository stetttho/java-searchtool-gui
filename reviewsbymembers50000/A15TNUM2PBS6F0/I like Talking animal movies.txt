 and "Cats and Dogs" is a cute one.  While this film was catered more to a younger audience, as a full fledged adult, I enjoyed viewing it.  I laughed alot.  The maids dressing up Mr. Tinkles the cat was my favorite part. yes, the acting was less than par, but for those of us who appreciate this genre of film, it has quite a few laughs and it's fun trying to figure out who is doing the voices.   This is a good family film too.
