 The author of "Looking for Wes Carroll", Jim Connell lives in the same town as I do.  A local bookstore held a book signing/discussion and as a voracious reader and a fledgling writer I felt I had to be there. After only reading an article about the writer and the story, I decided to buy his book.  My title up there is similar to what Jim wrote when he signed my book.  The author himself seems very nice, down to earth, and a writer who just loves to write.  I learned a lot sitting there listening to Jim talk about his experiences in his effort to have the book published. I loved this book because it drew me in and I didn't want to put it down.  I wanted to know the main character more and more, and I related to him so well.  He overdoses on nostalgia, and he could have easily been a real person.   Another reason I liked this so much is all the references to Boston, and other Massachusetts pop culture references.  It is nice to read about things that are so close to home for me.  That is a rare thing.   "Looking for Wes Carroll" is an easy to read and follow novel about the very down to earth and likable Max Clark.  Max lives in Quincy, Massachusetts.  His best friend since the beginning of college, Peter Sullivan, has his own life falling down a sprial staircase, and Max, being the good buddy that he always was to all his college friends, tries to aid Peter back to health.   I don't want to say too much about what goes on.  Max is a wonderfully written character that you will hate saying good bye to.  I am glad I bought this so I can go back and visit.   This is a very well written story, sad at times,(I cried several times), and has it's happier moments as well.  A lot like life itself, "Looking for Wes Carroll" is a novel about living, enjoying life, remembering our good times in life, road trips, and moving on and looking ahead to a bright future. I highly recommend reading this, especially to readers from the same area as me.
