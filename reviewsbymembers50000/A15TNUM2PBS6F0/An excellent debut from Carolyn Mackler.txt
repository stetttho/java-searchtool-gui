 I am a teenager living in a 32 year old woman's body, and I still appreciate these stories just as much as I did back in the 80's when I was a teen. This book is so true to life.  I think a lot of girls can relate to the main character, Sammie Davis.  She faces a lot of challenges and obstacles that I think almost every teenaged girl faces.  It's sort of a fish of water/coming of age story that is wonderfully written by the new fresh voice of Carolyn Mackler.  -- What a writer!  I also read this cuz I am trying to be a writer myself and this is my genre.   The characters are all so real and true to life.  It's almost as if they just jump off the page and into your lap while you are reading.  I highly recommend this novel for all teen girls, and for those teens at heart.  It's the kind of story that really grabs you right away and you don't want to put it down til you are finished.   I got it out of the library, but I think it is worth buying.
