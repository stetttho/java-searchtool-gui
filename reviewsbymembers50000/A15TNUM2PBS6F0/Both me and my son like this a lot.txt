 I'm a big lover of soundtracks, and "Shrek 2" is one of the better movie soundtracks I've heard in awhile.  I popped it in my car cd player not knowing what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised to hear not just a good combination of funky, laid back, and kid friendly songs but be very much entertained by it all. I did get a little tired of hearing "La Vida Loca" after five times, cuz my son just had to hear it again and again and again, but thinking about the actors and their roles - I thought the song seemed sort of fitting. I haven't even watched the movie yet, but this soundtrack is a cool pick for music lovers with diverse music tastes.   From a disco classic like "funkytown" to a remake of "holding out for a hero"(which I like better than the original because I didn't like Bonnie Tyler) to a Tom Wait's song about Poison and a silly karoake style version of "La Vida Loca" by Donkey(Eddie Murphy)& Puss in Boots(Antonio Banderas), it could possibly enterain masses of people who really liked the movie and thought "I like that song." Like many of the soundtracks I like, there is quite a variety of musical genres. I thought it was all mixed together quite well.  Eileen F.
