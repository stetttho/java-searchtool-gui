 I still like it.   "C'mon,C'mon" is the most recent album from Sheryl Crow, one my all time favorite female rockers.   This album starts off with three very rocking songs, "Steve Mcqueen", 'Soak up the Sun'(the first single and a true anthem for me as I totally relate to many of the lyrics.), and "You're an Original". This song has a certain tune and melody.  I think it will be the next single off the album after the opener "Steve Mcqueen". "You're.." is sung with none other than Don Henley, who has the perfect back up on this track. The rest of the album is nothing too memorable for me to highly enforce listening to them. I think a lot of the songs sound too much alike. I like Sheryl's voice and the music she plays.  The big fans of Sheryl Crow maybe a little disappointed. I honestly don't think this is her best work. The first album, and the album titled "Sheryl Crow" are her best work aside from live Crow. She is a great singer and guitarist, I'll give her that.  I'm just gonna go soak up the sun, while it's still free.... (that is such a great song) I'm on the fence here..It's recommended if you really really love Sheryl and can appreciate anything she does. Otherwise, if you are buying this cuz You love "soak up the sun", you are going to be disappointed.  Eileen Famiglietti
