 "Elmo's World" is a collection of skits that are all Elmo, the cute little furry red monster of recent years on Sesame Street. My son is 20 months old and loves this video. He has learned the word "telephone" from it, which is not an easy word for a child of this age.  Each skit is dedicated to a different topic - singing, drawing, and telephones. Elmo asks questions such as "who can sing?", "what doesn't draw?" and "how does the telephone work?"  Even though some of Elmo's background art work for his world is a bit hard on the eyes, this is a great introduction to these topics for the ages 2 and under. For me, it is too much Elmo, but it really isn't for me now, is it?  I recommend for the toddlers!!
