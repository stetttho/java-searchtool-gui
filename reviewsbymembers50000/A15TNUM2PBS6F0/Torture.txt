 I'm sure DAvid Morrell has an audience, I know he does.  and I will never be back to join them as I found "Creepers" which had been recommended to me, boring, uninspiring, and failed to entertain me.  SO, Why did I keep reading?  HOPE...I had a glimmer of hope that Morrell's latest effort(and the only book of his I've read and will read) would turn into something I'd appreciate. "Creepers" is marketed as a horror novel but i wasn't scared.  The characters were very one dimensional.  There isn't much substance to this work.  It wsa hard to get into, and hard to sit through.   Now that this 'high school' assignment is over, I can read something that will make me feel at least a bit smarter if not more enlightened.   Eileen F.
