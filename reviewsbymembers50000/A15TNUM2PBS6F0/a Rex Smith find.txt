 For those Rex Smith fans out there, He is in this, but it is a short lived role(literally).  He is charming and handsome as ever as Jeffrey Fields, husband to Lindsay Wagner(Bionic Woman), who plays Daphne.  Barry Bostwick, most known for his role of Brad, in Rocky Horror Picture Show, plays the doctor who falls in love with Daphne. The story starts with the present day, Christmas Day, and when Daphne gets hit by a car, the story unravels and goes back to when she lost her first husband, Jeffrey, and her daughter in a house fire.  She gives birth to Jeffrey's son, who turns out to be deaf.  Daphne becomes a famous author, and raises her son on her own.   This is the first Danielle Steel movie I've watched, I did read the book a long time ago.  It is one of my favorites by her.  While I don't read her anymore because of sophmoric and formulatic plots, I still enjoy romantic movies with happy endings. I really wanted to watch this for the snippet of Rex Smith as I have been a fan for more than half my life.  It turned out to be a nice story, with the usual Steel plot twists with tragedy(even a glimpse of the twin towers), romance, drama, and tie it all up with a happy ending.
