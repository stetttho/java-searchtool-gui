 "Keeping the Moon" is simple yet it stirs some serious thinking about how we live our lives. Colie Sparks, former fat girl, fifteen years old, has no friends and is ridiculed at school.  At least now it's Summer. She is being sent to live with her oddbird Aunt Mira for the summer so her weigh loss guru of a mother can tour the world for her cause.   Mira lives near a beach, and Colie meets Norman, Morgan, Isabel, and other townsfolk(not all so nice) of the small beach community.  Colie decides to spend her summer waitressing with the two girls, and they befriend her.  They are a few years older and wiser, and teach her valuable lessons that she'll always have with her.  She gets a birds' eye view of how friendships work. Being the cynic she has become (and you'll learn why as you read about her classmates), she is not so easy to trust and let others in.  The petals of the flower known as "Colie" open up and she blossoms into a more self assured individual as the story of her summer away from home progresses.   Believe in one's self and everything else will fall into place is the underlying theme of Sarah Dessen's well crafted novel.  I read this in two days!! And I'm not a teenager nor a YA. I am 34, and a teen at heart.  I think and feel many of the same feelings that Colie does through this book.  I did back when I was 15, and I could relate so well to her.   It's a quick read, highly entertaining, and rouses up something in all of us - wanting to be better and feeling good about ourselves.
