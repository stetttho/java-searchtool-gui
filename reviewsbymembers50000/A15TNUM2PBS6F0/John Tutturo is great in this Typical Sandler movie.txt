 This is very much like every other Adam Sandler movie I've seen, with the exception of "Punch Drunk Love". Sandler's character, Deeds, is far from intelligent, and you will recognize a lot of the actors from his other movies, his friends in Big Daddy, Steve Buscemi(once again appearing uncredited), and 80's music!!!  Deeds inherits a penthouse, $40 billion dollars and a company from a relative who turns into a popsicle after climbing a mountain.  He goes to New York City to retrieve(or does he?) his fortune.  I'm not going to rehash the entire plot of the story, if you like Adam Sandler's movies, chances are you are going to get a few chuckles out of this one.   The reason I gave this movie four stars is for John Tuturro. He plays the butler/servant for Deeds, and has a fascination with feet.  When I saw his name in the credits I was wondering what the heck he was doing on this movie.  All I could think of was Kathy Bates being in "The Waterboy".  BUT, John's character added most of the truly funny moments in the movie. I laughed at every scene he was in. Otherwise this is a very predictable romantic comedy.
