 "Flamingo Road" is a film that delves deep into the world of politics, on the other side of the politics is Lane Bellamy, played by Joan Crawford.  She was working in a dancing act in a carnival that blows through town.  When the carnival takes off, Lane stays in town hoping to lead a normal life.... Not if Sheriff Titus Semple, played brilliantly by Sydney Greenstreet, can help it.  The sheriff doesn't take to kindly to Lane, and tries to run her out of town.  To bad, Field, played by Zachary Scott, is in love with Lane and wants her around. Semple has other plans for Field, like marrying his daughter.  Of course, he gets his way, but he also gets something else much later in the film.... This is a great film from the 1940's.  I used to watch old movies all the time, and this movie has brought me back into the classic movie watching mode.  The acting, the screenplay, the directing....they are all so wonderful.  Greenstreet and Crawford are fun to watch on screen together.  They had great chemistry together.   This movie has a great ending.....WATCH IT!!!!
