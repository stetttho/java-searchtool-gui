 "Legally Blonde" is a cute fluffy as air comedy staring Reese Witherspoon as the blonde.  She is one of the best young actresses around right now.  She has a great comic ability and her timing is impeccable.  She is very talented, and in my opinion, is a bit underrated as an actress. Enough about the Blonde, and on to the movie.  The main character, Elle Woods, played by Reese, has been kicked to the curb by her man because she isn't smart enough.  It takes an episdoe like this to get Elle to prove to herself that she is smart.  While she acts pretty ditzy, and graduates with a Bachelors in Fashion Design, she decides to try and get into Harvard Law School as that is where the ex boyfriend goes.  She wants to show him that she is smart enough for him.  One of the funniest parts is her "video essay" she sends to the school and the board of admissions is viewing it.  I laughed through this entire scene.  She is accepted.   Along the way, she learns a lot about herself, and she meets some pretty funny characters.  When she goes into a nail boutique for an emergency manicure, she meets Paulette Bonafonte, played hilariously by Jennifer Coolidge.  They become fast friends.  She meets Emmett, played by the sweet and charming Luke Wilson, at the school.  He is a lawyer who is also an assistant to Elle's worst professor.  He becomes her new love interest, and Emmett is sweet to her and believes in her more than Warner ever did.  Elle is the underdog, but in the end she wins out.  This is a good rental. It's a fun movie.
