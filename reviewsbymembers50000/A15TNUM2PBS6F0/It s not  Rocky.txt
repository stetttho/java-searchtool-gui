 Sly Stallone wrote this script, but he also wrote the script for Rocky.  It wasn't a brilliant one, but at least Rocky was a much better film that this total waste of film. This movie has no redeeming qualities to it, I can't even think of one reason why I would recommend it.  I thought it was boring, and the race car sequences were just okay.   Stallone tried to throw romance(lame try) and action and sports together.  I think he was trying to appeal to everyone, but I don't think it appeals to anyone.  This movie was badly acted, and the script was awful(Rocky script was much better), and it has been done far too many times before.   Skip it..and watch Rocky again.
