 I am a long time fan of Classic Pooh, and my husband bought this for our son and myself to read together. We have probably read it 500 times since March! My son loves the pictures, and love to point out Pooh and Piglet, and all the other characters to grace this beautiful book. Also, the words are BIG,, a good first choice for when he is ready to learn to read on his own. Until then I will read it ten times a day!  It's just as sweet as Piglet himself!
