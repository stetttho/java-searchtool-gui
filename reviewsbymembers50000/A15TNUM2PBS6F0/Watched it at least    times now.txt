 When "Back to the Future" came out in 1985, I must have seen it in the movie theaters 3 or 4 times.  It is one of the most highly entertaining movies to come out of the 80s'.  While the idea isn't all that original, I think the approach is unique.  I also think that the actors, both Michael J. Fox and especially Christopher Lloyd really make this movie a great one for multiple viewings. It's about a teenage boy, Marty McFly, played by Fox, who's grown up kooky friend, Doc, played by Lloyd, invents a time machine.  Then Marty is accidently sent back to November 5th, 1955.  He spends most of the movie trying to get back to the future.  He encounters his own parents, played by Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson(they are both awesome in this movie!!! glover is hysterical) when they were teenagers.  I really loved this movie when it came out because it made me laugh and it was very entertaining.  I was also a big Huey Lewis fan, and both him(a very small role in the beginning) and his music are in the film.   This was a very popular movie when it came out, and with the Universal Studios ride, I think it's popularity emerged back up.  There are two sequels, but this is the best of the series. It's funny and the acting is great all around.   I think it's a good film for the whole family to watch together.
