 I knew the subject matter before hand so it is not like I don't appreciate films about gay people. On the contrary, I consider myself a pretty open minded person and am always up for something different.  I didn't know that I would be witnessing one of the most BIZARRE films that I'd ever seen. I really wanted to see this because John Cameron Mitchell, Hedwig/Hansel, was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actor.  He was critically acclaimed, and after all the bad movies with even worse acting that I had seen in 2001, this couldn't be much worse. Well, This is just not for everybody.  Especially straight men that have a bit of a phobia for watching movies to do with gay men.(especially when the sex/love scenes arrive).  My husband left the room.  I on the other hand, watched the entire film with some dismay.  I do think that John Cameron Mitchell was totally amazing and gave a very riveting performance as the main character.  He had this great confidence in his acting, and seemed to really enjoy playing this character, Hedwig.   I think that the direction and the pencil drawing animation is what I found bizarre, but not bad.   The ending was the most bizarre part of all as I just lost all understanding and meaning of the movie.  What is it that they are trying to say here? It isn't all cut and dry, maybe I missed something that others saw.   I think all the acting was very good, especially JCM.  He is very talented, and I imagine that the live show must be a real powerhouse of entertainment..for those that can appreciate this kind of show.   It's not that I wouldn't recommend this movie at all.  It totally depends on the individual.  It's certainly a movie I will never forget.  It has been 24 hours since I've watched it, and I still have got it up there in my head.  I really loved watching JCm...
