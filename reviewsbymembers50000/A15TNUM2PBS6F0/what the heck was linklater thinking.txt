 I loved both "Slacker" and "dazed and confused", so I thought I'd appreciate "Waking Life".  It is an animated film that revels in philosophical conversations and dream sequences.  That is all this movie is; there is no plot.  It's just Wiley Wiggins, who was in "Dazed", floating around talking to different people about life.  Is he dreaming? Is he awake? I don't know nor do I care.  I think it was the animation itself that turned me off this movie.  It was too out of control, and to try and catch the conversation and the animation is virtually impossible. THis is better as an audio commentary. Just listen to the conversations, which were actually pretty interesting, and not watch the animation. Unless you are a serious animation fan that appreciate all kinds of animation, I don't think you will fully appreciate this movie. I thought I would just because it was a Linklater film, but I was sorely disappointed. Many of the "voices" are actors from Linklater's previous effort, "Dazed and Confused".
