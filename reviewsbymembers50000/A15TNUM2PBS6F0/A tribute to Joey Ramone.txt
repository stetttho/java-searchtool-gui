 I had first seen this movie years ago, on cable t.v., and being a Ramones' fan, totally could appreciate this movie.   I got to see The Ramones live in Boston, six years ago, and they were just as good then as they were in their concert that was filmed for this movie, whic was made in the late 70's.   I recently watched this again on AMC's American POP(basic cable), and just felt sad.  All I could think of is how Joey is dead now, and there is no more band, it just wouldn't be the same without him.  I consider this to be a tribute to him now. That said and done, this is a Roger Corman film, he was a b-movie director so this movie certainly isn't a great movie persay.  it is the mix of the enthusiasm of the actors, particularly, P.J. Soles, and the great music of the Ramones that make this film worth watching. It's a harmless fun little movie about teenage rebellion all built around the music of Joey and his brothers. I say if you are a fan of The Ramones, than this movie is a perfect addition to your movie collection.
