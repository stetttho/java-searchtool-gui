 "A Parchment of Leaves" was highly recommended to me, and I now highly recommend to all that want a brilliantly written, poetic, and moving story about love, life, and family. It is a beautiful story and one of the best books I've read in my life.  It had me mezmerized and drawn in.  The characters are all so amazingly real.   Tough yet tender Vine, of Cherokee descent, is the main character who we want to get to know, and we do as the story progresses.  Thought to be a "witchy woman" by the townsfolk, she is soon discovered by Saul Sullivan. They fall in love.  Vine is one of the best characters written in the English language. She springs to life so vividly, and you want to see good things happen to her throughout her life at "God's Creek" with Saul, once the get married and settle down. You have to read this masterpiece to find out for yourself. Thank you, Silas House! You are a literary genuis! Keep reading, Eileen
