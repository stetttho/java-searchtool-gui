 I'll admit the only reason I originally wanted to see BLOW was because Johnny Depp is in it.  I have been a fan of his for a long time.  I think he is so underrated as an actor, and for those die hard fans of his -- this is worth a viewing.  He is totally mind Blowing in this movie.  Words can not describe how wonderful I truly think this performance is.  If I could pick the Oscar winner for best actor this year, I'd gladly give it to Depp. As far as the movie goes, this is a very fast paced, comedy/drama that has a lot of great music. It's the story of George Jung, who was born and raised in Weymouth, Mass. His parents dreams are shattered when he grows up to be a drug dealer.  Jung didn't want to work a real job, so he got into drugs and selling them as a means to make money, good money. He is hardly a sympathetic character nor is he the greatest person in the world.  He isn't a bad person either, I think. He made very bad choices with his life, and his priorities were totally out of whack.  The film goes through his "career" of being a drug lord and pretty much starting the cocaine trade in the USA.  It's a very interesting and entertaining look into the seedy world of drugs.  "Peewee Herman" aka Paul Reubens is also extremely good in this movie as one of George's first drug dealing friends.  This was a good role for him, and I think he did a great job. Rachel Griffiths (of most recently, Six feet under) and Ray Liotta play George's Parents.  I am from Massachusetts and to hear the Boston accent so poorly acted out by these two was excruiatingly painful.  I like Griffiths, she is a good character actress.  I've never liked Liotta, he is just not a good actor at all in my opinion.   BLOW is a good rental.  It's one of the best movie's I've seen this year, and has the best performance by a male lead.
