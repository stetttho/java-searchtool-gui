 I am not a fan of Melanie Griffith at all, in fact, the only film I really like her in is "Working Girl".  It's not that she is a terrible actress.  She is just annoying.  So why did I waste over 2 hours of my time watching this movie?   I am now asking myself the same thing.   I wasn't sure if this movie was supposed to be a comedy.  If it was, it wasn't even funny.  Griffith, plays Lucille, a woman who is beaten by her husband.  She kills him and cuts his head off...Why?  I have no idea.  Maybe she's crazy?  She then decides to leave her 7 children in the hands of her mother so she can go out to Hollywood and live out her dream of becoming a glamerous actress. She takes the head of her husband along for the ride...why not?  Nothing else makes sense so far so why not make less sense. This film is just a mishmash of nonsense.  She wins a lot of money in Las Vegas right before she gets to California. She eventually gets her big break...She is on t.v. Then, she gets caught..eventually all criminals do. I don't know what the ending of this movie is all about...She goes free?  when she was sentenced to a term in prison?   Maybe the book is better, I hope so, cuz this was a boring movie.  I watched it on cable....thank god i waited that long.  The only bright spot was Lucas Black, the boy from Sling Blade.  He is one of the best child actors right now.  I hope to see more of him in films.  He is very charming.   I personally wouldn't recommend this film.
