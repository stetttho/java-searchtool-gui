 I am not 66 years old, not anywhere near it, but older viewers of "about schmidt" warned me I wouldn't understand.. it is perfectly understandable!  The story of a man who has a second chance at life after losing his wife, starring the always intense Jack Nicholson, is a bittersweet, often quite comical, and very odd.  Jack plays Warren Schmidt, the just retired actuary who starts up as foster parent to an underpriviledged child.  This is how the story gets told part of the time. He is writing letters to this small boy telling him about his wife's annoying habits, about his daughter who's abandoned her family, and suddenly his wife is gone. He packs up and takes a road trip in a new Winnebago.  Daughter Jeannie(Hope Davis)is getting married, and he wants to talk her out of it. Kathy Bates does an outstanding job as Ray's eccentric mother.  She was fun to watch. In a nutshell this film is 'about schmidt' and his complexities and him finding purpose.  In between there are a few oddball characters thrown in for good measure.
