 Marilyn is so amazing in her role of Nell, the psychotic babysitter, who is hired for one night to babysit an 8 year old girl.  Her uncle is the elevator jockey, and he gets her the job.  She has just moved to NYC after being released from an institution.  She attempted suicide after her lover is killed in WWII. At the hotel, she meets Jed, played excellently by Richard Widmark.  I think him and Monroe had a great chemistry together.  Jed doesn't have a very understand heart at first, but by the end of the night he is a changed man.  They meet looking across into each other's hotel rooms and decide to chat in her room.  The little girl, Bunny, is bothered by him being there and makes problems for Nell.  Nell does everything she can to keep the girl away.  She even almost kills her!   MM mesmerizes me everytime I watch any scene from this film.  She is very expressive, and she just delivers an awesome performance.  I think she should have stuck to dramatic roles.
