 I absolutely adore this album. I have listened to it so many times, especially my old audio cassette I got in 1983, that I know all the words to every song.  NOt that it's hard to learn them, Bryan Adams has a voice you can understand all the words coming out of his mouth..Unlike many of the artist today. He is a true rock artist that emerged from the 80's. This is an album that truly defines rock and roll and what it was like back in the early 80's.  I love all the songs on it, and have fun listening to it.  While there were so many "one hit wonders" and artists that disappeared with the 80's, Bryan Adams is one rocker that is here to stay.  Although he seems more popular now for his movie theme songs.  I still love this album today just as much as I did when I got in 1983. Definitely worth purchasing for any Adams fan.
