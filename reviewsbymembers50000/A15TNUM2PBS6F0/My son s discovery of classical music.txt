 My son's growing obsession with this story has truly sprouted since the purchase of this album. Oddly enough, I never really knew this story or I don't remember it from my childhood, but once my dear sweet boy discovered it's haunting and charging sound, it's become a staple in my vehicle. A perfect way to introduce classical music to any child -- tell them a story and have all the parts of the story be different instruments from an orchestra.  Beautiful, just beautiful..
