 "Company Man" is a spoof/comedy which is basically a work of fiction but placed in a certain place in History.  It's 1961, around the time of the Bay of Pigs, and English Grammar teacher, Allen Quimp goes CIA agent(much to the chagrin of the CIA, to them he is a joke).  He is sent on a "secret mission" to Cuba to assassinate Castro.   I'm not sure who this guy is who plays Allen, but he reminded me a little of Kevin Spacey, in the physical sense.  Acting wise, he was hardly Oscar material, but I think he pulls the role off quite well.  Especially up against Sigourney Weaver, who plays his greedy/selfish wife, Daisy.  She gets some of the funniest lines in the film.  John Toutorro plays his partner in crime, and he is very good and funny in his role.  An almost unrecognizable Anthony Lapalgia plays Castro. Woody Allen is also in it, and he gets some funny lines also.  Sprinkle in a little bit of Alan Cumming, playing his usual flamboyant character, and you have an interesting and entertaining line up of actors in this little comedy.  I was entertained, and I laughed more in this than I have at most of the comedies I watched from the year 2001. If you are a fan of films that spoof points in history, than this may be right up your alley.  It will at least give you a good chuckle or two.
