 but it does have my signature hit, "Come On Eileen".  This is one of the few one hit wonders that I like on this album.  There were a lot of other songs from the 80's that I would have picked over "I ran", "Words", "Tuff enuff.."  Enough said, the first half of the album is very good, but then it just starts to lose steam.  It's as if they were running out of ideas as to what to put on the album.  I didn't like these songs back in the 80's so why should I like them now.  I guess that is the price I pay to get the few songs I did want. I always loved the show, The big 80's on Vh1.  And when this and the first c.d. came out, I bought them together.  All in all, not such a terrible purchase.  I like the first one much better, there are a better selection of songs.
