 Jim, Morrison, better known to his legions of fans as Mr. Mojo Risin', was a man influenced by old blues music.  He loved rock and roll, and his music is a fusion of the two. He wrote most of the songs that grace this "best of", and his distinctive sound emerges from every single track. For those music lovers who don't know The Doors' music that well, this is a perfect introduction.  It has a lot of the more well known songs, such as "Light my Fire", "Hello, I love you", "People are Strange". It also has some of the more obscure, but deemed classic(by yours truly), songs like, "When's the music Over", "Spanish Caravan", and "Unknown Soldier". The Doors was a truly unique band, and this is an awesome showcase of their work. Highly recommended for all music lovers who want a little diversion from the usual classic rock.
