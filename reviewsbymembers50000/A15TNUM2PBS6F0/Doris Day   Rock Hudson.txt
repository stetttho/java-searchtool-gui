 Need I say more?   To fans of both these talented and very attractive stars this is a definite must see!  They work oh so well together in this dated but very funny romantic comedy. Day is playing that character she is so well known for--the simple, elegant, and very innocent type. Hudson is playing well, everyone that wears a skirt.  He is charming playboy who hasn't found the one woman that can tame yet.  Does Day do it?  Watch to find out. Watching this for a second time after so many years it is just as good, just as funny and sweet as ever. They are both playing ad execs' that are also playing for each other.  Although, Carol Templeton, Day's character, doesn't realize who Hudson is through half the movie. She half wittedly thinks he is the doctor that is the inventor of a new highly advertised yet nonexistent product called VIP.  She falls in love with him.  Jerry Webster, Hudson's charming yet woman chasing character, falls for Carol hard. He keeps the ruse that he is someone else because Carol has no respect for and can't stand Jerry Webster. Of course, chaos ensues as the couple get to know each other and accidently get married after sampling the new product VIP, which is basically an alcoholic beverage in the form of a candy. Always funny Tony Randall costars, and he is a master of comedy, a true genius as the sidekick to Hudson.  Ann B. Davis, "Alice" in the "Brady Bunch" plays Carol's secretary. Also, another t.v. name you may recognize, Donna Douglas, plays a secretary too. This is frothy 60's comedic fun that has a great cast. It's two big stars are very likable, charasmatic, and beautiful people. Highly recommend this for some romantic comedic fun via the 1960's!
