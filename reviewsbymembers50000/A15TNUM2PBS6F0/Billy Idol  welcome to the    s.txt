 Upon hearing he was touring again, I felt the sudden need to listen to one of his albums, but all I could conjure up was the beaten on copy of "Charmed Life".  It's a very good mix of ballad and fiercely pumping arm tunes.  While listening to this disc, I was flashng back to "rebel Yell", and "whiplash smile", and the Billy Idol I saw live in concert about five times.  Even into the 90's, Billy was still pumping out some great tunes. His cover of "LA Woman", paid homage to Jim Morrison, and he added his own flavor to it.  "Cradle of Love" is the first single, and I remember quite vividly that around the time of this album's original release, Billy Idol had a major accident on his motorcycle and with his broken leg, he made the video for "Cradle of Love".   I still love his music now, after all these years.  "Charmed Life" is a slightly more mature Billy Idol, who is still pumping that fist furiously.
