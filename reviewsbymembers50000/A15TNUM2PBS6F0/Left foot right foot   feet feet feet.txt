 Oh, how many feet you will meet in this Seuss' classic! Here on Amazon the recommended age level is 3 - 6. My son is 1 1/2 yrs. old and adores this book! He loves the pictures, and I think the singsong approach to the telling of the "story" helps keep his attention.  Seems to rhyme in perfect time, and that is what we know and love Seuss for. Highly recommended for young children! Even if they can't read it yet, they will know it by heart by the time they can read.  I must read this one five times a day. Run out and buy it for your baby today!
