 After watching the AFI's "Heros & Villians In movies" countdown, and seeing Atticus Finch beat out all movie heros, I had to read this again.  I highly recommend this as a purchase. Atticus Finch is the open minded lawyer and father to Jem, who is thirteen yrs. old, and Jean Louise, or 'Scout', who is 9.   Harper lee's story of the southern family and the southern ways of the 1960's is fantastically well written and to this day, in July 2003, still holds up amazingly well.  She can really tell a story!  While the "ways" of the townsfolk is to totally cast out other races and look down on them, Atticus and his bright children have open arms and open minds. This especially happens when Atticus, a defense attorney, is standing up for Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman.   While there is much sadness throughout, the novel as a whole is just so brightly written.  Narrated by our little friend, Scout and seen all through her eyes, we get to know her and her family and about justice.   I was sucked in to the world of Scout's, and was utterly blown away by all that took place.  "To Kill a Mockingbird" is a true classic. It's written for everyone and it's an awesome story told. Thank you to Harper Lee for creating this masterpiece!
