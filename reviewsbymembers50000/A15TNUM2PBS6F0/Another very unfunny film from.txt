 I am generally not a fan of the "road film comedies" like it's a mad, mad, mad, mad world" and "cannonball run".  So, you fans of those films will probably appreciate this one. It's supposed to be a comedy, but I wasn't laughing.  I must have lost my sense of humor somewhere in 2001 with the rest of the bad comedies that came out. This film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I don't recommend it.
