 An odd combination, but I thought it wasn't too bad. Considering that I haven't heard of most of the talent before made this record all that more entriguing.  I grew up listening to the Carpenters, and love their music.  I always remember having so much fun listening and singing along to "Top of the world" and "Yesterday Once More".Those sha la la la's ...still shine. And the band that covers it, Red Kross did an awesome job bringing that ditty up to modern day standards of hard rock. Shonen Knife's cover of "Top of the World" is a snappy one, and gets me just as happy as the original. This album certainly isn't for everyone. I think if you have an eclectic taste in music, and if you like tribute albums done by a variety of artists, even some that aren't well known, you will be pleasantly surprised with this little record. A few of the more well knowns on here are Sheryl Crow(Solitaire), The Cranberries (Close to you), 4 Non Blondes(well, they did have a one hit wonder, What's up?. Does that make them known?)(Bless the beasts and the Children).  Also Sonic Youth does "Superstar", one of the best covers on the album, Cracker does "Rainy days & Mondays", and Dishwalla does "It's going to take some time".  A good deal of these artists had been introduced the year this album was made, 1994.   I do recommend this to music fans with a wide variety in their collection. Eileen Famiglietti
