 I love all Buffett's albums, but this is one my faves.  Every song is just perfect Buffett.  He is a great song writer, story teller, and just makes me feel relaxed. This is a great album to listen to when you are sitting on a beach drinking fruity beverages, and watching the sun. Or when it is bitterly cold out and you just want a little bit of warmth,  Oh, do I miss the summer....Just putting any Buffett brings summer back to me. On the whole, I highly recommend this album to all Buffett fans, even nonfans who just want something to chill out to.
