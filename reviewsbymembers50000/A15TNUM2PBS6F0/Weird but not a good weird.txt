 From the previews that I'd seen of "Slackers" I thought that it was a college type comedy like PCU and Road Trip.  It certainly has taken some of it's few comedic momments from both these movies.  There is no classifying this movie, it isn't all that funny.  Plus, the whole thing with the Ethan character, played by Rushmore's Jason Schwartzmann, is just totally bizarre.   Why is this movie called "Slackers"?  It really should have been called "Cheaters".  Was that title already taken?   It could've been called "Stalker".  Ethan stalks and obsesses with the female lead character, Angela, who wants pretty much nothing to do with him. I will not say much more about this film because I thought it was a travesty of the teen/college comedy genre.  I have liked other movies I thought were weird, but this film had nothing else to offer. There isn't much originality here, and it just makes teens today look as if they have no scope to their imaginations when it comes to what they consider humerous in a movie.  We have had far too many films with the same brand of sick humor.   Also,  even though his character is twisted psychotic Ethan, Jason Schwartzman was very good.  The rest of the actors were nothing special.  Unless you are male, you may appreciate Mamie Van Doren's scene. I don't recommend this film at all. Watch "Animal House" for a great comedy set in a college and put this one back.
