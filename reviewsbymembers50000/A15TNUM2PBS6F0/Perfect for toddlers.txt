 My son loves this book!  I think it must be because the illustrations are easy on his eyes.  The drawings are very childlike and the colors(mostly primary)are perfect.  This is the story of a zookeeper who is closing the zoo for the night, and while he says "goodnight" to each critter, the gorilla, who is first, steals his keys and lets all the animals out.  They all follow him home, and he never even notices!  His pop eyed wife has to take care of them herself.  It's the most adorable little book!  There isn't much to read. It's more of a feast for the child's eyes right before he sets off to night nights. The copy I have is a small board book, and it's small enough for my son's little hands to hold and admire all by himself.  I highly recommend buying this for the child at age 21 month and over.
