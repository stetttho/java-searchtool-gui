 really bad.  I just don't know what you reviewers were laughing about! Okay, I did laugh at their attempt to satirize "Reservoir Dogs" with their "walk into the Robbery".  The rest of this movie is a total waste of time!!! The only reason I watched it(well, I rented it thinking it looked funny and something different for a teen movie) was that there was absolutely nothing on the 126 channels I have on Direct TV.   And who wrote this piece of garbage? Do teenage girls out there today actually talk like these airheads?  And considering the influence that film has on today's youth, what kind of message is this movie sending? so, if you get knocked up and you are broke, rob a bank! you are sure to get away with it if you can find someone like Marla Sokoloff's character.  Someone as unscruplous as yourself.  I will say that the soundtrack was decent.  I am also getting tired of cheerleader movies.  Hollywood! Get some new ideas for teen movies! Also, to you reviewers that are comparing this ridiculous excuse of a movie to HEATHERS, get a job!(as veronica said).  That movie had great originality to it.  It had a great screenplay with very funny dialogue.  Whereas S&S had such bad writing.  Also, Heathers had Winona Ryder, who is a great actress.  The girls in S&S were all just a bunch of Betty dolls. Also, this is not a black comedy at all, at least not in my book.  This is a few genres of films all thrown together(teen comedy, and bank heist film) and what's up with Jack & diane's parents? I guess this movie is trying to satirize many genres, but it is all just a big mess that has hardly any laughs.
