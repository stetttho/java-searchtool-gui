 I think that Thomas Ryan has been a fan since the very beginning of Jimmy Buffett's career.  This is a lot information that I don't know about Buffett, at least the very early stuff.  We do have the albums, but who really cares about every single specific detail of every song and it's production on every single Buffett album?  I know I am probably taking this far too seriously, but when I did a few of the quizzes in the beginning of the book(I don't know the early stuff that well, I like it, but don't know who Carmen was dancing with).  I failed miserably and it just upset me. I have been a fan of Buffett since I met my husband ten years ago.  I have really learned to totally appreciate his music, and he is one of my favorite musicians.  I have seen him in concert eight times!  I have a blast at the concert, and just because I failed Ryan's quizzes doesn't make me a non parrotthead.  I think he must have a lot of time on his hands to learn all these stupid little details. That aside, it's interesting to learn more about THE MAN.  My husband bought this, not me.  I just tried to pass the quizzes and failed miserably at the first three. I gave up after that. I am a Parrotthead. I don't care what this book says! I think if you've been a fan since his early days, you will do amazingly well at these trivia questions.   I know it's just a trivia book; I just don't think it justifies who is and isn't a real Parrothead. FINS UP!
