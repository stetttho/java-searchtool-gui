 Edwards Burns is the writer, director, and one of the stars of this movie.  He also wrote/directed "She's the One", and "The Brothers McMullen". He is sort of a male Nora Ephron.  He can write about romantic situations in modern day, and make them seem funny, serious, and realistic to some extent.  and we know where he has set this movie. "Sidewalks of New York" is his latest work.  There is a lot of talking in this film, unfortunately one word that begins with f, and it is not a nice word, is way too overused here.  That is my only problem with this movie.   Otherwise, I liked it alot.  There wasn't really any plot, it was very subtle.  It is filmed somewhat in a documentary style, where six people are being interviewed about their relationships and their sex lives as they live them. It's very interesting. I also felt that there is such an honesty to the approach of the all actors and actresses as they speak their lines straight on into the camera.  It seems as if they could have just been talking to me, or you.  The acting in the film was all very good especially by Stanley Tucci.  He plays the sleazeball cheating husband very well. Also, Dennis Farina, is hysterical as Edward Burns' older buddy.   It is a pretty funny movie, and it has some great lines. I just don't appreciate that f word being used so much in films.  It doesn't add anything to a movie for me; it actually takes away. In this case, it took away one star.  I still recommend it.  It's a good choice for a romantic comedy with some drama thrown in.
