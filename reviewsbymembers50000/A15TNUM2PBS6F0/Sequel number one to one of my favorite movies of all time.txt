 Sequels are never as good as the first. We all say it, we hear it. Well, it is true.  But this movie is fun! Even if it is the most confusing of the series, jumping back and forth from the future, 2015, to the present, 1985, to the past, 1955.  It leapfrogs all over the place. The futuristic sequences are great, I love Cafe 80's...I'm totally a huge 80's fan and product of the time and this movie brings me back... If you liked the first, you'll like this one..just as much fun. good family entertainment, despite a few swears here and there..it was rated PG!
