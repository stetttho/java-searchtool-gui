 "Erin Brockovich" is one of the three films nominated for Oscars that i have seen, and I don't see this one taking home the statue. Okay, so it was a true story, that doesn't make it a great film.  I guess my expectations were too high as I had heard that it was a great film.   Julia Roberts was good as the title character, but I had no sympathy for her.  It seemed as if as soon as Erin had a real job and was out trying to get PG&E, her family seemed to not matter much to her.  This is just what I got from what I saw on film.  I am just very surprised at the academy this year, for including this film in it's nominations.  In my own personal opinion, I don't think it is deservant of it.  Nor does Julia Roberts deserve a Best Actress Nod.  There was nothing stunning or awesome about her performance.  It was decent. The movie is worth a rental fee, but i wouldn't buy it.
