 Both Jimmy Buffett's story and the illustrations are so beautiful.  This story of the jolly mon, and his adventures(such as maybe Buffett himself may have or has had already) in the sea is a real treat.  While it is marketed for children, as a Parrotthead myself, I think all Buffett fan's could enjoy this.  He has added the lyrics to his song, Jolly Mon, in the back of the book as well. Like all other stories, this has it's good guys and bad, and conflict.  I think that is the way Jimmy Buffett writes, which is so honest and down to earth.  This is as good as any song he's written, maybe even better.  I was so moved by the ending, I cried.   I am not going to give anything away, but this story has a great message. I think this is a great addition to the library of books I am building for my children. My son is only 1 year old, and while he doesn't really pay attention nor understand what I am saying.  He was entranced by the illustration.  The artist, Lambert Davis, did a wonderful job of capturing the characters and the places that Jolly Mon visits. This is definitely worth buying!
