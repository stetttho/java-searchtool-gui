 It was a perfect night for viewing a "horror" movie that was listed as a comedy(there were a few funny scenes, but it's not a comedy!) on the box from Blockbuster...It was thundering outside, and the lightening was incredible.  Along with this creepy night out, is a creepy character who is played by a very creepy Willem Dafoe.  While I do think he is one of the better actors around, he's always had a sort of odd way about him.  He's not conventionally good looking at all, but can he act!!! And as Max Schrek he is amazing!!! I did see the original Nosferatu on video a few years ago, and Dafoe looks exactly like him in the movie and captures the whole aura of the actor that played him.  That's what really creeped me out, and he has these long claw like nails to go along with the 'vampire' make-up.   At first I just thought this movie was going to be like the making of nosferatu, I didn't realize they were satirizing it and making him out to be a real vampire.  It's an excellent hook, and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I can't say enough good things about Dafoe's performance.  It's just mind blowing.  He should have gotten the Oscar!  To think he lost it to Benico Del Torro, in Traffic!  While he is a good actor, I don't think he was anywhere near as amazing as Dafoe.  John Malkovich is amazing as the director of the film.  I think he must get controlled by Max Schrek.  some of his behavior seems so outlandish, and he gives the end of the film an element that just makes you really keep thinking about the movie long after it's over. I recommend a viewing of this movie to all fans of Dafoe, Malkovich, and vampire movies fans.
