 Every single review here says the same thing. We all pretty much agree that Russell Crowe's performance was outstanding.  His character was outrageous and down right villianous. What more can I say? This isn't an award winning film, but it was entertaining. And Crowe made it all the more so. It's an action/adventure film with some comedic moments(although I don't think they mean to be funny) with Crowe's character, Sid 6.7 -- a virtual character who finds his way to the outside world to terrorize Denzel's character.  I didn't think Denzels' acting as that good in this. It didn't impress me as much as some of his later movies. All in all, it was a fast paced action thriller that is mindless yet Crowe's colorful character keeps you interested. I recommend this movie despite some of the bad reviews here...Try not to take it too seriously. Gotta love him in the purple suit scene.
