 Marilyn is so beautiful in this movie.  While the movie itself is not her best, she is just so amazingly gorgeous in it.  Like the scenery itself. The story isn't very good, but to see Marilyn perform "One Silver Dollar" "I'm gonna file my claim" and "river of no return" and a sweet "down in the meadow" it's worth buying!  she does act decently in this but it's hardly her top acting. The little boy is very good too.
