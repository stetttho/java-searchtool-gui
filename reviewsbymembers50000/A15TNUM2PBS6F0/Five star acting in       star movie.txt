 Parker Posey, Kyra Sedwick, and Fairuza Balk all get umpteen stars from me for their great portrayals of women who have reached a point in life where they know something has got to change.  There are three women: Delia, Greta, and Paula.  Their lives are unraveling, and only they can make the choice as to what to do next and if it is the best thing to do. I thought the first two stories were extremely depressing.  I honestly didn't know the tone to the entire movie. I tend to not want to know a lot about a movie I am going to watch because what would be the point to watching them?  It's like looking into someone else's life watching these stories. My thoughts are this -- Kyra Sedwick's "Delia" is a blue jean wearing chick who has a past of being promiscuous and a present she wants to escape.  Parker Posey is "Greta", the woman bent on success and high on infidelity.  Some of her thoughts were laugh out loud funny.    Fairuza Balk is "Paula", young, pregnant, and freaked out by an accident that she sees happen to a man she has just met.  She runs away and picks up a young mysterious hitchhiker  This is the best story because it ends on an unbeat note.  The writing was good, and I liked the style of filmmaking Rebecca Miller has incorporated with her stories. It still left me with a bitter taste. It is certainly not a feel good movie, but it is at times compelling. It's intriguing enough that I did like it despite it's frankness.
