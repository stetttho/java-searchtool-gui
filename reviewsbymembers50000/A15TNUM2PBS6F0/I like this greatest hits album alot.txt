 Pat Benatar is one of the best woman rockers of all time, even if she did spring from the 1980s', she was one of the few artists from that decade that had true talent. "Best Shots" hits you with some of her classic hits like "hit me with your best shot", "promises in the dark", "Heartbreaker", "Love is a battlefield", "Invincible", and "Shadows of the Night".  There were a few songs that I didn't know, and I definitely think there were a few that should've been here that weren't.  Like, "It's a little too late" and "You better run".  I think whoever put the album together was probably trying to get something on there that was more recent as Pat has still been recording. I was never a huge fan of hers back in the 80's, but i always liked her music.  I recently saw her on VH1's Behind the Music, and decided to get this greatest hits.  This is definitely worth getting for the casual fan.
