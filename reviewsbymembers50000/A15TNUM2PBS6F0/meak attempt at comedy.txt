 I kept waiting for the laughs to come with this movie, and they were so far and few between.  And what was up with the dog and Billy Crystal? That was disgusting.  just completely unneccesary and unrelated to the topic at hand.  That part alone really brought this film down.  This film tries to hard to be funny, and fails miserably.  It also tries to be a romantic comedy with Julia Roberts, who was very good in the supporting role of Kiki. I thought Zeta Jones character was so evil, and she was great.  You really wanted to see her end up badly. It was also a predictable movie, as most romantic comedies are.   Although if you want to see a funny romantic comedy, watch "When Harry met Sally" ...Amer. Sweethearts is a total let down.
