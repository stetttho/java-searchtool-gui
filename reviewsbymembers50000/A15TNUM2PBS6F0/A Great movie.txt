 Whether or not there is entire truth in this movie in comparision to the real life of John Nash will not sway my feelings on this movie.  Almost every movie made about "true events" is embellished in some way.   That said, I really was quite engrossed by this film.  Russell Crowe was in top acting form.  He was simply amazing!  John Nash, who I had never heard of until this movie, is a math/ecomonics wiz who is also a professor at Princeton University that has schizophrenia.  Crowe's portrayal is stunning to watch.   We see all his "delusions" as other characters in the film.  I thought Ed Harris', who plays the Department of Defense guy, acting was downright awesome.  Speaking of acting, Jennifer Connelly, who played John's wife, Alicia, was good. Although, I didn't think there was anything stunning about her performance that made her deserve an Oscar for best supporting role.   Even with the sad subject matter about Nash's mental health, I thought "A Beautiful Mind" was one of the best movies from 2001.  It was intriguing, and it told the story of Nash so wonderfully.  It gives you a chance to see into the mind of a schizoprehnic, and how their lives and the lives of those around them are affected.   Richie Cunningham has outdone all his other films, and I think he truly deserved his Oscar.  Russell Crowe's acting is reason enough to watch this movie.
