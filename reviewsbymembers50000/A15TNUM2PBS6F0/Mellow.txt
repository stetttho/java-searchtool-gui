 Yes, when we hear Jimmy Buffett, some automatically think mellow.  On the contrary, while Buffett is the king of hawiian/beach like music that borders on rock and roll and country, he does mellow one out. His latest addition to his album catalog, is definitely worth adding to any parrotthead's collection.  It starts off with a Lion Kingesque theme song that is will most likely be the opening to the upcoming tour.  It's peppy and in usual Buffett mode.  The first few songs in the album are all like this, and then, like some of his earlier albums, seems to start sounding more like a pop country album.  The album as an entirity isn't the greatest of Buffett's, but it is pretty good. I've already listened to it about six times in the past two days, and I do think it is worth buying.  I haven't heard every album Jimmy has recorded, but am working on it.  It seems that a few of the earlier albums sound very country, as Jimmy did start off as a country western singer.  Well, this album ends country, but sounds more like the country that is popular now, hence the term pop country. Nonetheless, this is still worth picking up if you like the scope that Buffett has.
