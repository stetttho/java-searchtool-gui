 "The Chelsea girl murders" by writer Sparkle Hayter is the fifth in a series of mystery novels about Robin Hudson.  The only series I've ever gotten into as a mystery reader.  Sparkle's writing is intelligent and witty.  Even with the myriad assortment of characters throughout the story, they all serve a purpose and Sparkle is so good at making them all have meaning and not add confusion. Robin's apartment building burns down, and she takes shelter at the "Chelsea". An out of town friend left her a key to her place there, and Sparkle takes advantage.  Little does she know what she's about to get herself into.  As she seems to do in all the stories.  It is still extremely entertaining and a laugh out loud book. What I love most about this book is Sparkle's witty dialogue, and how she chose the illustrious "Chelsea hotel" as her set. This is worth reading if you like funny/mystery stories.  Robin Hudson is a character I always look forward to reading more about. Eileen F.
