 One of the best "Greatest Hits" albums to ever come out. I love Tom Petty's albums, and I think that they all are great.  There is never a bad apple in the bunch.  So just imagine an album with all the songs we all know and love.  Those hits we could pick from his albums and put into one big record.   This is it. It's a must for every Petty fan.  He is a great songwriter, storyteller, and still rocks after all these years. I think that this album was a bit overdue, but at least it got the hits of the early 90s' on there too.
