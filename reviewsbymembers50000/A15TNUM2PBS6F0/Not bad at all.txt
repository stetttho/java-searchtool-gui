 Martin Lawrence stars in this comedy, as "Jamal".  Jamal works for a medieval times amusement center, and takes a trip back to the true "medieval times" when he falls into the moat he is cleaning out. His character seems totally selfish in the beginning, but changes for the better by the end of the movie.  You could say there is a moral to the story.  Do unto others... I am not a big fan of Lawrence. My husband rented this.  Well, I actually liked it to some extent.  While it wasn't completely original with it's hip modern music thrown in...and time travel,... it as least has a bit of a twist to it.  Instead of just playing Sly and the Family Stone's "Dance to the Music" and having the townsfolk dance around, Jamal teaches the musicians to play and sing to something hip enough for him to dance to.  This was my favorite part of the movie.  It was just a lot of fun to watch, and Lawrence was genuinely funny here. As far as the time travel part goes, he doesn't deliberately go back in time. At first, he thinks he is in the new competition for where he works, until the fair chambermaid, Victoria, tells him what year it really is. This wasn't a waste of time by any means. It was good for some light comedic entertainment.  To the big fans of Martin Lawrence, you will totally enjoy!
