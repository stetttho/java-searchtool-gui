 who didn't like this movie! As to whether or not we disliked this for the same reason, is neither here nor there.  I was very very disappointed in this movie.  It was a multiple story line mess of actors swearing left and right. Does using certain curse words make this story better? or give it more of a point? It was unnecessary!  Matt Dillon, calling Matt Dillon, could you play a good guy for just once! I don't think you've done this in a long time.  he is the main reason i wanted to see this, it certainly would not interest me otherwise.   This movie is full of racial slurs, and intense moments(at least I got some bit of excitement out of the torturous 2 hours). It is one of the few movies I've seen that I wanted to walk out of. Why didn't I? I thought it would get better, and also, i was curious to see how it would all turn out. After all the great reviews I had heard about it, maybe i had just gone into this film with high expectations.  No thumbs are risen from this movie lover.  If anything, I would put this on my list of Movies that were reviewed well but really stank. I really want to know what it is that people liked, let alone loved about this movie. there were a lot of bad characters, a lot of car accidents, and a lot of racism.  maybe, it was too real for me.
