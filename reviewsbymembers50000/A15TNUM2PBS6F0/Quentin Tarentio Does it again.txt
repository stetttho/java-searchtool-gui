 I absolutely love all of Quentin T.'s films. "Kill Bill Vol. 1" is just as exciting and fiercely entertaining as I suspected it would be.   I can remember reading about the making, and how it was originally going to be one long movie instead of cutting into two films.  The idea of this story peeked my interests, but I unfortunatly waited til it was on dvd to see it. If it is shown on big screens again,  I have to go.  This is definitely a film that should be seen BIG.   With it's cartoonish blood, fight scenes, revenge filled plot, and awesome soundtrack, "Kill Bill" delivers a true homage to a variety of movie genres.   Starring Uma Thurman as our vengeful Bride, who was left for dead on her wedding day, who kicks butt clear across the entire movie.  It is really quite a spectacle to see.  One thing I couldn't quite get over was that the actor playing "BUck", who seems to always play a jerk of all trades, played the boyfriend in "Valley Girl".  While that doesn't do anything to tell you whether or not to view this extremely fine film, it's a bit of trivia for ya. I am highly recommending this one! It's truly a great show.
