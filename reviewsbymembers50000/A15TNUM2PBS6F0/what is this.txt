 I can't even bring myself to chapter two, that is how much i hated chapter one.  if a book doesn't get me interested after chapter one, forget it.  I give up. I was very disappointed in this, I liked Interview w/ a Vampire and thought I'd read something scary in lieu of Halloween being so close by.   This is just pure drivel.  I had the book for three years before I picked it up to read it.  It was a gift.  thank god i didn't spend money on this terrible book.  I don't know what she is talking about in it, it's like reading a text book..boring! skip this if you want something scary...this will put you to sleep.
