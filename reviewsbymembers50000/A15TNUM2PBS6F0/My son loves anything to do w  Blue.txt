 My son is 1 1/2 yr old, and is already a big fan of "Blues Clues". "ABC's and 123's" is just one of the many videos we have for him to watch over and over, and even though he is too young to really learn from the education standpoint, he still appreciates Blue, and all their friends. The music and cartoon characters all seem to keep his attention, and now that he has been watching for awhile, they are all like old friends.  Blue, Sidetable drawer, mailbox(he loves the mailtime song),and all the other characters they meet in each episode entice him into keeping his eyes on the screen.  I don't think he is a big lover of Steve. Steve comes off as very goofy. He is trying to have fun and be a friend to children, but to me it comes off way too goofy, and I think even my son sees this too.  "Blue's Clues" itself has been a huge commerical success and the marketing for it amazes me. They have every single toy you can think of. My baby is already being sucked in by the media frenzy!!! eeek!!! Anyway, this is a fun video, and he will have it for a long time as in another year he will really be listening and learning. He does learn now, he picks up words here and there. The overall lessons taught though are far beyond what he can grasp. Still recommended!!! Toddlers will love the cartoon characters and music..and they will be watching for a few years... Eileen Famiglietti
