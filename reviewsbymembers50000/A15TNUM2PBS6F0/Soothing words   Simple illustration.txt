 These are the things that the little ones, like my 21 month old son, should appreciate in a book.   MWB is widely known for the books "Goodnight moon" and "The Runaway Bunny".  I didn't even know about this book until I saw that my husband had picked it up at the bookstore.  This book is illustrated by a different artist, Felicia Bond, and her work is sweet and uncomplicated.  The story has that same rhythm and beat you follow when reading poetry, but it is also gives a peaceful feeling to it's readers(and the ones being read to).   It's a day in the life of kind of story about animals on a farm, while the children are gone.  It is a perfect addition to any child's book shelf and makes for a perfect bedtime story with it's calming effect. I highly recommend buying this for toddlers! If you already have any of Brown's other books, this one will be a welcome addition.
