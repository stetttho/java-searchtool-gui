 This is just another typical "Heist" film.  but Hackman really shines in it.  He brought my review up with his acting! He is just such a great actor.   Plus, it's a Mamet project, and I am weary of his films. I've been disappointed in the past.  "spanish prisoner" was just so awful! i remember hating that movie.  Mamet has hit and misses, and heist is more of a hit. certainly one of the better films of 2001. There were some great lines in the film and the acting was decent.  The ending was a surprise.
