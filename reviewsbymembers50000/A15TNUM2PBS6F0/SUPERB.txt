 This was not an easy soundtrack to get my hands on. It was my husband that did.  Our toddler has an everlasting affection for the film and the two songs, "Hi Diddle de" and "I've got no strings" so we thought the second addition to his own c.d. collection would be the entire soundtrack.  (The Snow White soundtrack was the first, and that is just as great as this one!) Remastered into all it's glorious musical score, Pinochhio is a great c.d. for those who like movie/musical score type soundtracks. It does have the two songs that my son loves too, and also, "when you wish upon a star".  "When..." is one of the most sweet and simple songs that has never failed to enlighten me.  I get very choked up and happy at the same time when I hear it.  It's such a classic song.  I actually think the music is better than the movie!  There were parts of the film that I thought were truly disturbing. I highly recommend this c.d.  The sound is crystal clear, and it is brilliantly remastered to bring you into the story and feel Pinocchio's pain, sadness, and joy.
