 I loved "The wedding singer" and ran out to purchase this c.d.  soon after I saw the movie in the theaters.   "Pass the Dutchie" is a lost one hit wonder, and I really wanted it on c.d. That is the main reason I really wanted it, but I was very happy with the whole c.d.  It is great, with the exception of Culture Club. I know they were big in 1985, but I never liked them. The rest of the album has quite a unique collection of 80's songs ranging from "How soon is now" by The Smiths to "Pass the Dutchie" by Musical youth to one of the founding fathers of rap's great rap classic, "rapper's delight" by Sugarhill Gang(with a guest vocal from the cute little older neighbor played by Ellen Dow from the movie) It's a fun c.d. to bring us early 30somethings back to our teenage years.  Check this one out!  Worth buying if you like the movie!!
