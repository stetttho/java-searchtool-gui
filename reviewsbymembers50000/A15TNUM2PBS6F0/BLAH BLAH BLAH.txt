 In the late 80s' there were a lot of comedies that came out, they have all now made their way to cable t.v. as a staple on TNT. Overboard was just on today, and i watched it. I did see it back when it came out, and I thought it was a funny romantic/comedy.  WEll, after viewing it in the present day, I found it to be quite dull.   Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell are both good actors.  I just thought the story -- her being a rich uptight brat who falls "overboard" and his poor, single dad character uses her to get back at her for not paying him for the job he did. It's just so darn predictable.  I did, however, notice one of the sons were played by kids who were in other movies.  One of them was in Big, as Josh's best friend.  Just a little tidbit of useless information for you. I don't recommend this movie, it's boring.
