 I had no idea what the new Shania album would sound like when I bought it. I hadn't heard a single song off it, but I loved her last album, "come on over". "Up", is just that, very upbeat but hardly meaningful.  Like one other reviewer said here, did a 7th grader write these lyrics?  Maybe I've grown to not like her lyrics, or I have to be in a real silly mood to appreciate this record, but I firmly feel that this album is ridiculously bad. Considering how long us Fans of Shania had to wait for this record, it is highly disappointing. There are a few songs that I did like, "Up", which is a catchy little diddy that opens up the album. "Juanita" is very smooth. No other songs are worth mentioning.   Also, the two c.d. thing is so silly.  They sound exactly the same! What a waste of time for Shania to think she could "rock" and then slide back into country/pop territory.  Shania is a beautiful woman, and deep down I know this could've been better. She isn't by any means a great songwriter, but some of her songs have that 'pop' quality that get you UP.  Hence the album title. Buy at your own risk because I don't recommend this.
