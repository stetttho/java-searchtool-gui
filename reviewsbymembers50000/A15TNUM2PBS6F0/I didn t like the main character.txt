 "Open House" is the second novel I have read of Elizabeth Berg's.  I read her first book, Durable Goods, which I liked so much  better than this one. The writing was very well done, but the character of Sam was very annoying and acted rather immaturely.  I don't identify with her and didn't sympathize with her much at all. Her husband has left her.  Her preteen son is distant, and grows even more so.   Sam takes in boarders so she can keep her house.  She's meeting new people and trying to get in touch with Martha Stewart.  One new friend, King - the best character in the whole story - helps open her eyes and heart to more after a heart wrenching marriage ending.  Open House is a novel about divorce and how one woman's life changes after.  The character of sam seemed so innane at times I wanted to stop reading, but Berg's writing kept me hooked.  She is very talented.
