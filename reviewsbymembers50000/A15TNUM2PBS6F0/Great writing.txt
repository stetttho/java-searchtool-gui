 After reading a review of her newest book, "Best Foot Forward", I learned I had to read this first to get the whole story in "Best..."  Jenna Boller, the main character from "Rules of the Road" continues her journey through teenaged life in "Best Foot Forward". This book made me laugh a lot.  Bauer is not only a gifted writer, but she is great at comedy.  They are honest to goodness told stories that have messages and a wide range of characters.  Jenna works for Gladstone's Shoe Store, and the whole company is about to change hands. However, Madeline Gladstone, one of the original owners, has something to say about that - and not something nice.  She asks Jenna to be her driver when she goes to Texas for a stockholder's meeting.  Jenna's pilgrimage is not just about getting from Chicago to Texas. It is also about evolving, helping others, and meeting some wonderful people along the way. I highly recommend this book not only for teenaged girls, but for everyone.  Bauer's writing is briliant and witty. I've only read one other book of hers, but I will definitely be reading them all at some point.  She inspires me.  Eileen F.
