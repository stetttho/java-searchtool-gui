 Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Barry have both given the performances of their careers here.  I can see why Halle won that Oscar, which is the only reason I really wanted to see this dark, depressing, stark movie.  This is not for the faint of heart, and if you are just looking for light entertainment, look elsewhere. We are talking deep here. "Monster's Ball" is a look into two people lives, Hank & Leticia, and how their characters connect through the whole movie -- Her husband is executed on death row, and Hank is one of the corrections officers that assist in the execution. Sean "Puffy" Combs plays the husband, and he is quite impressive. The film also shows how they end up after so much tragedy is bestowed upon both of them. They both lose their sons, but in some sense, I didn't see them really grieving for their loss which is one part of their character that truly bonds them.  They are both extremely complex, angry characters, and you want to have sympathy for them, but it isn't easy. As the film moves on, you start to feel for these characters. We get to know them on a personal level. That aside, the performances by these two well crafted actors is just awe inspiring. It is a film worth watching just for the acting.   This is an amazingly well crafted piece of work, the acting, cinematography, excellent screenplay, and realism of it is all just brilliant.  Even if it is very depressing it is also extremely engrossing, I made myself stay up way past my bedtime to watch the entire movie.  It was one of the most moving pieces of cinema I've ever witnessed. For dvd buyers, this is worth buying just to see Thornton's character "Karl" from "Sling Blade" play "Hank".   There are about four deleted scenes, and a trailer, and a little piece on how the movie was scored.  That was pretty interesting.   One of the best of 2001
