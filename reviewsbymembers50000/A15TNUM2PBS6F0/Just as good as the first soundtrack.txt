 and they say sequels aren't as good as the first!  "Free ride" and "No more Mr. Nice Guy" open up this cool record, and get you in a rocking mood.  Although, it is the Texas rock song, "Balinese" by ZZ Top that really gives this five stars. That is the song, for those that have seen the movie, when the black friend is dancing in the back of the truck during the beer blast.  I never realized it was ZZ Top until I looked at the c.d. This is a great addition for those with extremely diverse c.d. collections. Especially lovers of 1970's music. This disc offers 12 tracks, and musicians such as Peter Frampton(two songs from him, the last two of the album), Foghat, War, Steve Miller Band, Alice Cooper, Edgar Winter, and Seals & Crofts all have one of their early 70's hits on it. There are some obscure songs that you may remember from the movie. Even though every song isn't necessarily as memorable as others here, they are all great songs. I liked every song I heard.   This is great driving music. Open the windows, and crank this one up! Highly recommended!!
