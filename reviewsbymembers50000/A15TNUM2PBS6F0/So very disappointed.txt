 I loved Clerks, that was the best film Kevin Smith did.  It seems that every film after that was just a disappointment in comparasion to Clerks.  Even with the very raunchy subject matter and the language, I still find Clerks a very funny movie. and the characters of Jay and Silent Bob are more background in it. I'm sorry I have to compare this to Clerks, but it just doesn't even hold any sort of candle to Smith's first and best effort. Watching this movie, I could only think that Smith had decided to totally make fun of the two characters and make cartoons out of them.  I'm not really sure what Kevin Smith was trying to prove by creating this piece of very unfunny and annoyingly bad film. All the cameos in the world(from the stars of all his past efforts) couldn't make this movie any better.  I thought that the tremendous amount of swearing that Jason Mewes' character, Jay, spews out was just more than I could take.  He should be trying out for a part on the Sopranos' next.  The language was bad, the script was atrocious and unfunny.  I was very disappointed with this movie, and totally do not recommend it.  Watch Clerks instead.  Jay and silent Bob struck out on this one.
