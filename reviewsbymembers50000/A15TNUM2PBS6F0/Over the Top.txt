 "The Grinch" is portrayed by an extremely over the top acting of Jim Carrey.  It's like watching his character, Ace Ventura trying to be Grinch.  He really goes way over in this movie, which I think is why some people are cringing at it.  I think only true fans of Carrey and not the story the Grinch, will appreciate this film more.  It is an entire different entity. The book and cartoon are classic Dr. Seuss and a staple at Christmas time, and the movie has been panned because of not keeping up with the original story.  Also, there is alot added, which had to be otherwise this movie would have been a half hour also. I really thought that Taylor Monsen, Cindy Lou Who, was so adorable as Cindy Lou Who(who is alot more than two).  She helped to bring the story life. Some of the additional things seem sort of silly, but whenever The Grinch is onscreen, it's pretty funny and entertaining.  (...) this is not meant to be taking so seriously, take the original story/cartoon for what it is, and the movie for what it is. The scenery and make up are all amazing, and in the extras on the dvd, I learned that circus folk from Cirque De Soleil are in the movie.  It  all adds up to a fun time, JMO.... (...) It's Christmas, people, lighten up! I think overall this is a great Christmas movie for the entire family.
