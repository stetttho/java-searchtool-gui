 that is how much I LOVE IT!! Both my husband and I like the album and it has been destroyed.   I can't say enough good things about it, it is punk at its' best.  It has all the songs from "Rock and Roll High School" -- the movie, and has all the classic Ramones, biggest being "I wanna be sedated".  I highly recommend you buy this disc! You won't be disappointed. I had the fortunate experience of seeing them live back in 1996, and the band was amazing. Almost as amazing as this album, which has all the "mania" one can stand of The Ramones. I will never tire of this record. I bet even when I'm really old, I will still be thrashing my head to this music. To JOEY....
