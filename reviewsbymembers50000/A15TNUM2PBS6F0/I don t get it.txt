 I had read great reviews of this movie, and was looking forward to watching it on dvd..the whole time i did watch it i made this face like, what is going on?  It was totally not what I thought it would be.  I thought it would be a spoof on those late 70's early 80's summer movies, but it doesn't feel like that at all to me.   This is not funny at all, I didn't laugh at all.  I thought it was very strange also.  I never watched the State, and the director and one of the actors, David Wain and Michael Showalter, were both on that show. Maybe I just don't get this brand of comedy if it is supposed to be one.  It must take a certain individual to appreciate this film and I am not it.  My husband said they should pay people to watch this one.  Avoid this ..if you want real comedy about summer camp, watch Meatballs...spoof or not. if you are a fan of the state or upright citizen's brigade, you will probably appreciate it...i don't get this brand of humor at all.
