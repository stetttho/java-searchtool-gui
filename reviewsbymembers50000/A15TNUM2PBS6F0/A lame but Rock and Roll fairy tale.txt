 "A Knight's Tale" is a silly little movie that has a rock and roll heart and soundtrack.  It's a bit offbeat in that sense.  Hearing "We will Rock you" in a knight movie seemed a bit strange to me at first, but I just decided to try and enjoy this movie for what it was...a somewhat laid back attempt at a fairy tale romance involving a jousting knight and the beautiful girl he falls for.  It had a few laughs and the actors were all fine.  It isn't meant to be taken too seriously, it's just a fun  movie that happens to have Heath ledger as it's main character.  He is certainly as good an actor as he is good looking.  FOR YOU DIE HARD HEATH FANS: this is a must see!! he is perfectly charming as "William", who wants to be a Knight, fight the bad guy, and win the girl. It was a little predictable, but cute.   Worth a rental fee.
