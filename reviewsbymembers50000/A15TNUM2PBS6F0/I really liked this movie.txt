 "Showtime" is a fun comedy starring two movie stars who I never thought I would see paired: Eddie Murphy and Robert Deniro. They made a great pair and a good chemistry working together as two cops who are on a reality t.v. show (think: cops & big brother mixed together). Deniro's character, Mitch Preston, wants nothing to do with it, and Murphy's character, Trey Sellars, is an actor as well as police officer, is pysched to be working as an actor. Even thought their characters don't really have much in common, they somehow seem to blend well together and balance each other out. Mitch is divorced and spends much of his spare time doing pottery, this does little to add to the plot, but is more of a sideline.   Trey is a quick talking, "dumb" cop type, who is trying really hard to be an actor along side his career as an officer of the law. Rene Russo is the only other name in this snappy little comedy. She plays Chase Renzi, a pushy t.v. journalist who wants to use Trey and Mitch to her advantage to get ratings.  Not her usual kind of role, she pulls it off anyway. She does a great job in  her supporting role. This was a genuinely good comedy, and I really liked it. I laughed a lot!!!! It was really funny.   Even though it is somewhat predictable, it is also a very entertaining film. There are some good performances here, and I think Murphy and Deniro were great together. Highly recommend this one for fans of comedy genre, but especially fans of Deniro and Murphy Eileen Famiglietti
