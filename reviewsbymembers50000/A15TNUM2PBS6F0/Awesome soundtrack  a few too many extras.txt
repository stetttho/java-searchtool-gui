 My only qualm with this soundtrack, which is one of my all time favorites, is the extra extended mixes of "I Love the Nightlife", "Go West", "Shake Your Groove Thing"(one of my fave dance hits of all time), and "I Will Survive".  These are all really fun songs that came out of the 70's, but I don't need to hear them this often! Maybe as a party disc, I can see how these mixes would fit in.  Or maybe if you are working out it would be a great collection of fast songs to get you moving, aside from the few slow ones.  I just feel that there is too much repetition. The disc is outstanding aside from that.  This is such a fun group of songs to just pop in your c.d. player and groove to.  It's always gets me dancing.  It is very entertaining, and I even appreciate the older songs, "I Don't Care If the Sun Don't Shine", and "Can't Help Loving That Man", and "A Fine Romance".  These are all by great female singers of an earlier generation than the 70's.  Being an Australian movie, they just had to throw a little ABBA in, "Mamma Mia".  There are a few songs from the 90's, "Save the Best for Last" by Vanessa Williams and "Finally" by CeCe Penniston.  Then there are a few obscure 70's songs, "Billy Don't be a Hero", and "Take a Letter, Maria".  It is a very ecclectic mix, and the mix of songs all fit perfectly together.  It's a perfect compliment to the film itself. I highly recommend this soundtrack.  This will not disappoint!  Especially for fans of the movie!
