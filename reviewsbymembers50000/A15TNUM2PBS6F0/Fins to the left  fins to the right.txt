 "Volcano" is the album to have!!!!  To newer JB fans, this is a great start to a collection.  It has so many great songs, and many of the songs we do know by heart!   "Fins", "Volcano", and "Boat Drinks" are all staples of Buffett's, but let's not overlook "Treat her like a lady" and "Survive"( I Have heard this one in concert, amazing!!!), and "Sending the old man home". For the Parakeets there is "Chanson Pour les Petits Enfants", which has a very childlike quality to it.  He did this the last time I saw him in concert, and it was just so sweet.   I took French in high school, which was quite a few years ago, but I am sure it translates as "A Song for the little children". JB has a nice soothing voice, and it is a fairy tale that will entice many children old enough to really appreciate music. This is one you should have!!!
