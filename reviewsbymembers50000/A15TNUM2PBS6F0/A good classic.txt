 LM Montgomery had a great ability to write stories that made us laugh, cry, and tug at our heart strings.  Both Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea are books i bought, and will give to my children to read when they are old enough to appreciate them. I never read them as a child.  I wasn't even introduced to them until I was planning a vacation to Prince Edward Island three years ago, and I read the first book.  I also watched the movies which were both such wonderful adaptations.  Anne of Avonlea picks up where the first one left off.  Anne, who I think is the best female fictional character I've ever had the priviledge to read of, is now a teacher.  She is growing up, but she still has her adventures with Diana, and her other friends.   There are a few new characters are introduced, and although you don't instantly fall in love with them like Ann, they grow you.  All but Davey, this character was just so annoying.  THis boy was just a bad apple.   I'm sure LM had good intentions, but I was utterly annoyed and it brought my feeling of the book down a bit. IF you loved the first book, you will probably enjoy this as well.  There is a long series of books by LM.  I am currently on break from reading her.   She was a great writer, able to bring a great deal of sense of humor in her storytelling, and she is very descriptive.  She really brings the characters so true to life, especially Anne. I do recommend this despite my problem w/ davey.   Anne will always remain forever in my heart as a true heroine of classic literature. One of the best character to ever be put on paper..as she is kind, funny, good spirited, and what an imagination!
