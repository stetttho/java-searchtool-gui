 so amazingly well.   "Heathers" came out in 1989, and I was 20 years old then.  Even though I was technically out of my teen years, I totally could appreciate this movie as it had some of the wittiest and most original dialogue ever to come out of any movie, especially a movie of the "teen" genre. Not only is the screenplay the bomb, but the acting is superb. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater have an amazing chemistry together, and they both truly carry this movie. This is deemed to be one of the true classic movies of all time, in my honest opinion, even now, 12 years later and I am now in my 30's, I still love love love this movie!!!! I just bought the dvd, and watched the film with the running audio commentary from the writer,(You rock, Daniel Waters!I'd love to see you write Heathers 2, just as Winona has been asking), the director,Michael Lehmann, and the very cheery producer, Denise Di novi. It gives you real insight into the making of the film watching it this way. I didn't realize it had been made on such a small budget.  The movie itself is a great hour and a half of film.  Like i said, it has some of the best dialogue to ever spring from the lips of actors.  It's fairly intelligent, and I think people of all different age groups can appreciate the humour, the story, and the message that the story conveys.   If anyone knows where to find the screenplay for this movie, I'd love to hear from you.  I've been looking for it on line, and have had no luck thus far. This is definitely worth buying for those die hard fans of this film.  Their are some extras on it such as the 30 minute "swatch dogs and diet coke heads", and the original ending of the screenplay, only in writing, it was never ok'd to be filmed. So for the fans of the film, the dvd is worth purchasing. For those just looking for something different, with comedic momments, although dark at times, and a truly unique screenplay, rent this film.  It is worth at least one look...
