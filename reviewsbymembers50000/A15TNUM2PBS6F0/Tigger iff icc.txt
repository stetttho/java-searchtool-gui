 My 17 month old son got this as a gift, and he totally adores it. Tigger gets more hugs than mommy and daddy.  It's a very huggable, lovable, and fun toy for little kids who LOVE Tigger. My son is obsessed with him.   While it is a great bunch of bouncy fun, it is not educational at all. It is pure fun. I have been caught huggin' him a few times, and making him talk his cute little sayings.  This if for tigger/pooh fans of all ages!!! so squeezable...go on give him a hug!  Whooo hooo !!
