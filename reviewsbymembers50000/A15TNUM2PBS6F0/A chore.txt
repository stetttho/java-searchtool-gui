 Reading this so called "literature" was a complete chore for me.  I had a hard time getting into it, and just forced myself to continue reading JK's supposed masterpiece. There is no real plot, it's about some selfish, slacker types that travel around the country looking for the next best thing. The narrator, Sal Paradise, is the exception.  Supposedly, Dean Moriarty is based on Neal Cassidy, JK's real life side kick.  I know and am unfortunately related to people like this guy..not a selfless bone in his body.  What is too like?  JK's annoying style of mindless chit chat that just seems to make almost no sense.  I abhor the fact that there is no use of correct grammar here.  I guess this is what it takes to create a literary classic. 1.  Use little or no grammar rules 2.  Create characters that people just want to smack around 3.  Have no plot, and just aimlessly spew out words that make     no sense. It's your decision.  It took me a long time to get through this and feel I wasted so much of it. Highly disappointed.
