 When this album came out, I was 8 years old. I am having total flashbacks to those days of when I'd put this record on and sing and dance and just be totally joyous.   I am going to hunt down the c.d. and listen to it in my car and sing along, and when no one else is home, I'll listen to it and dance.  Thank you darryl and toni, you made my 8th year a wonderful one!
