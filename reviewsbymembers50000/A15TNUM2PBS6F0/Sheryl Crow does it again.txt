 This album is just as great as Crow's first album, Tuesday Night Music Club.  Both albums have great rock and roll songs that you can sing along with, and hum to, and just enjoy listening to while kicking back.   Her music is very bluesy and packs a punch.  It is a great combination of blues and rock and roll.  "A change will do you good" and "Everyday is a winding road", and "if it makes you happy" are the commercial hits of the album.   I like every single song on this album, there isn't a dud in the bunch.  Put this one on my list of "Albums to take on the desert island"... She is a very talented musician, and it is very clear on both this and Tuesday, that Sheryl Crow is here to stay and rock and roll some more. If you liked Tuesday, you will love this album too.  It is a great follow up.
