 I have been reading the reviews, most of which are obviously written by teenagers or preteens.   My husband, also 30something, tuned into this on cable the other night. and we both sat and watched the whole thing.  It's "Lord of the flies" set in modern day, but much more fun to watch. Christopher Lloyd, best known as "Reverend Jim" on t.v. show Taxi, and "Doc Brown" in the Back to the Future movies is the only known star that shows up in most of the movie.  He plays the authority figure throughout the film when the parents' aren't. It's a "let's see how much we can get away with while the parents aren't looking" movie.  and I have to admit, it was pretty cool..Both my husband and i were thinking: That is cool..I wish I could've done that.  It's a fantasy for younger teens.  Basically, some rich kids pool all their summer camp money together and create their own fantasy camp and their parents think that they are all at the camps they were originally supposed to go to for the summer: fat camp, computer camp, drama camp..  instead, it's just 'HAVE FUN ALL SUMMER camp..OR Camp Nowhere at some run down land that Lloyds' character finds. The teens all come together and help Lloyd from going to jail. It's a cute little film that certainly isn't one of the most classic of the teen genre, but certainly is entertaining enough. A lot of silliness goes on, and eventually chaos!!!  the parents want parents day..of course, they have to get caught eventually, right?   check it out...
