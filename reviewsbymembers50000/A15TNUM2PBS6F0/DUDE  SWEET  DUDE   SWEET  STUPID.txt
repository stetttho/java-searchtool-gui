 I don't think this movie was terrible, but it certainly isn't a comedy classics or even one of the best comedies to come out of the year 2000 or 2001(whenever it came out, which i'm sure most people don't really care about). It's just brain candy.  One of them gets DUDE and the other gets SWEET tattooed on their backs, this has to be one of the most ridiculously dumb scenes in movie history.  There are much better comedy selections out there for you somewhat intelligent folk. I can't be held responsible for the rental fee of this film, that was my husband's job .  This is more of a "dude" movie, I guess. Unless you are just suddenly in the mood for mindless dumb comedy with alot of T&A, then this will be right up your alley. It also has that cute guy, Ashton Kutcher from That 70s show as Jesse.  Chester played by Seann William Scott is best known for his role in "Road Trip".(another mindless comedy).
