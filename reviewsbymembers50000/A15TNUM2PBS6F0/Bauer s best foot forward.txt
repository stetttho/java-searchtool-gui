 This is a great sequel to an equally stunning and entertaining read, "Rules of the Road". Bauer has vastly impressed me with all her books I've read thus far, but this one was like a big fat cherry along with the whipped creme on top of the hot fudge sundae known as "Rules of the Road".   Jenna Boller is back, back with a vengence alongside the owner and her boss, Madeline Gladstone.  There are some new characters that add flavor to an already sweet treat of a story.   For anyone who just likes a good plot and lots of laughs, I recommend this. It may be targeted at teenagers(those teenagers are darn lucky cuz there were no writers like this in my teen days), but at 36, I have grown into a great fan of Joan Bauer's writing. She is very talented at telling a tale that is funny and endearing.  It is a really easy read that I know younger girls will really enjoy because while I may be 36, deep down, I am still a teenager at heart.  Eileen F.
