 I finally have listened to the entire c.d and am somewhat disappointed. When I just listened to the "hits" that I actually know and like, is when I liked this album. It really is very disappointing about three quarters of the way through. I always skip over these, tracks 11 through 13 are boring!  and I have never liked "No more Lonely Nights"..that is another Mccartney dud in my opinion.   I've always been a huge fan of the Beatles, and like most of the music from Wings'.  Some of the choices as the best here, just aren't the best in my opinion.   One is better off listening to Beatles records for his truly best work.  His solo efforts are just not the same.   He still is one of the most talented musicians out there..and he did a great job at Superbowl halftime. I did like most of the album  ..it's worth buying for the real hits.
