 While this debut of Jaclyn Moriarty is stunningly original and offbeat to my liking, it hit far too close to home for me.  The character, Celia, reminded me of my "best friend" in high school. Her selfish ways and unfeeling nature towards Elizabeth are a huge reminder of how horrific my teen years were. Celia runs away more times than we care to remember and this time she's joined a circus. Quickly forgetting the friend she had in Elizabeth, she cares only about her own stupid stunts and goes so far as to steal the guy Elizabeth liked first.   Elizabeth, however, rises above Celia's insensitive ways and starts fresh with Christina, her new pen pal via her latest English assignment.  Unfortunately for me, my "Christina" never happened back in the day, but I do currently have a similar relationship with an email pen pal I've met.  It's great that these are real letters and that Moriarty hasn't succombed to the technology of email. It keeps true perspective in this letter format story.   Does Elizabeth really "feel sorry" for Celia?  If she does, she is a fool. Christina becomes Eliz's best bud and they stick together like true friends should in all the chaos around them in this quirky turn of the Young adult form. I see myself in Elizabeth in so many ways, just wanting a truly best friend, and never really felt like I had it.  Meeting someone via mail is a real way to get to know someone on a whole new level.  Christina and her are meant to be friends. Too bad things didn't turn out this good for me.  I finished this book in a few days, and had basically read it because I am an aspiring YA novelist. I have only read YA novels lately, and some are extremely better than any other novel I've read lately.  Moriarty is a fascinatingly fresh voice in the genre, and I hope to follow in her footsteps. Thank you for this great addition to literature, Jaclyn! Keep up the good work.
