 This is a very intense police drama that stares Denzel Washington, as the evil, very corrupt narc Alonzo Harris, and Ethan Hawke, as the "rookie", Jake Hoyt, who spends one day on the job with Alonzo.  Little does he know that Alonzo is so hard nosed, and that he joins in the drug inducing along with the creeps he is trying to bring down. Jake has quite a day with Alonzo.  Washington's Alonzo is unnerving but brilliant!!  He is one of the best actors and has my deepest admiration for going against the type of characters he usually plays.  It was very brave of him to take on this role.  I found myself shocked at some of the things the character said and did, especially since he is supposed to be a police officer, but I guess they aren't all so good, and Alonzo Harris is definitely one of the baddest cops to grace the big screen.  Although, I was so amazingly entralled by this movie, I also found it difficult to watch, but couldn't stop watching because it was just so darn interesting and intense. I found the acting all around was very good.  Denzel is so excellent in this.  He is such a talented actor, and I am glad he did this movie.  It really shows that he is not afraid to try any role that he finds interesting no matter how immoral that character may be.  I think it came at a good time.  He was always seen as the good guy; this proves to me that Denzel is a real actor who cares about the craft of acting. Ethan Hawke was also excellent in this.  Before this movie, I had only seen him in "Reality Bites", which was a comedy.  Kudos to him for taking on this role!  It was a great performance. This movie is so worth watching because it of the strong performances by Washington and Hawke and it's capability to keep the viewer glued to the screen.  I didn't want to take my eyes away from the screen nor get up for any reason.
