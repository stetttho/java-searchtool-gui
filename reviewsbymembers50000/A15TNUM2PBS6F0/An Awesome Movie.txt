 Mildred Pierce's second husband, Monte Beregon, is dead.  And so the story unravels as Mildred tells her "story" to the police. It's all a mysterious cover-up.  And is worth watching to the very end! I loved this movie!!! If you are a fan of the "classics", this is one of the greatest I've seen.  Joan Crawford plays Mildred.  She has two daughters, Veda and Kay.  Her husband up and leaves them, and now Mildred must get a job.  Kay catches a bad case of pneumonia, and dies.  Veda, who is the older daughter, doesn't turn out to be such a nice girl.  She grows into a coniving young woman, who bribes someone for money so she can get away from her embarrassment of a mother. Veda is played by Ann Blyth...What an actress!!! Veda is evil to the core, and Blyth really pulls it off. I'd hate to give to much of this movie away!  It's a must see!! This movie is brilliantly photographed, and Joan Crawford is totally awesome as Mildred.  I haven't seen many of her films, but it's clear that Crawford is in her prime here.  She really plays this character to the extreme.  She certainly did deserve the Oscar! The screenplay of this movie is great for it's time, and has some hilarious lines that are delivered dead on by the actor's.  This is "film noir" at it's best.  Go rent it!!! You won't be disappointed.
