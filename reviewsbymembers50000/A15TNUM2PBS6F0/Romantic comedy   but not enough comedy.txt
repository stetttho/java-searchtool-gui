 Edward Norton, Ben STiller, and Jenna Elfman star in this attempt at a romantic comedy that takes itself a little to seriously.  Considering the topic of Religion that comes up, it's hard for there not to be some seriousness.   The three of them are friends growing up together, and when they are in 8th grade, Anna(elfman) moves away to California.  Jake(Stiller) and Brian(Norton, who is also the director of the film as well) remain close friends that grow up to dedicate themselves to their religion.  Brian is a priest.  Jake, a rabbi.  Then, Anna comes back into their lives. At this point, I knew romance would enter between two of them at some point.  THe chemistry between Stiller and Elfman was great.  The film wasn't bad, it certainly wasn't great by any means.  There was way too much time between the laughs in the film.  In my opinion, I think Ben Stiller is the glue of this film.  If it had been someone else playing his character, I don't think I could've stayed interested in it.  Not only does romance enter, but also the whole religion issue(there has to be some conflict, right)Jake being a jewish Rabbi, being in love with Anna, who isn't jewish. The film does make you think about faith and where our faith lies.   The secondary cast, which includes director Milos Forman, Anne Bancroft, who I thought was perfect as the jewish mother, and Eli Wallach, is a great addition to the film. It really was a cute story, and It has a happy ending.  If you are expecting to laugh all the way through, you may be a little disappointed.  Otherwise, it is a good rental.
