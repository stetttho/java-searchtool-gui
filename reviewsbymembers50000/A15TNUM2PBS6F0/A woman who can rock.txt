 This very impressive debut from Sheryl Crow is a greatly used c.d. in my very big collection. All the songs on this album are great> I do think "Strong Enough" is the best of the bunch.  Here she shows great emotion and courage in her ability to perform.   There are only a handful of women in rock, and Sheryl is a very welcome addition in my opinion.  She has a very unique sound and voice, and she is an amazing performer live.  Her songs don't all sound the same, she branches out into different types of music -- jazz, blues, country.  While "All I wanna do" is the commericial hit of this album, I don't think it's the best. "Strong Enough" and "leaving las Vegas" are far superior lyrically and emotion.  "ALL i wanna do" is just a fun song, and sends an interesting message that life shouldn't be taken too seriously. If you are into women rockers, you should appreciate Sheryl Crow.
