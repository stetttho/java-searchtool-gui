 Sarah Dessen's debut novel, "That Summer", isn't her best achievement but it shows true hope and promise of her rising YA author stardom.   However, it is a coming of age story I think a lot of people, young adult and older(like, say 34) could relate to.  At some point in our lives we all have similar experiences to the main character, Haven.  She is 15, feels awkward in her own skin, and with divorced parents, an older sister who is getting married, and a best friend who's fallen in love.  After reminiscing about a summer trip, she bumps into her sister's ex, Sumner. Not only is he not who Haven thinks he is, but she's not the same person by the time her sister's big day arrives. I think it's best to read this before her other novels because if you go to this after reading, "dreamland", you will be sorely disappointed. I didn't do this, and I loved all her other books much more immensely. Her writing gets better with each book.   This was a very green Dessen, but very hopeful.
