 Even if only the tip of the iceberg, Nicolle's work is certainly enjoyable for readers with only a casual interest in the subject. Despite its title, this book deals not particularly with the Huns, but with the Turco-Mongol nomads of Central Asia in general (the author adds in the forest peoples of Siberia). The influence that these hardy horsemen of the steppes had on military science and even chivalry was staggering. These people, it would seem, practically invented warfare. Even the oath on the sword taken by European knights was apparently borrowed from the nomad Turks. Nicolle's general discussion is followed by profiles of the nomad groups between the Huns and Genghis Khan (Kipchaks, Bulgars, Seljuks, Karakhanids), including cultural details (they were no mere barbarians). The color drawings were beautiful and intricate, right down to the tiny brass bells decorating the Turkic warrior's spear. Overall, it's a colorful and fascinating introduction to the nomads of Central Asia.
