 This is the sort of work that would be engrossing if you are extremely interested in the subject. It is a solid source information about the connections of islamic scholarship between the Malay World and the Haramayn (Mecca and Medina) and how these conduced to spreading a more orthodox form of islam to southeast Asia. The main concern of this text is the ideas transmitted (the need for harmony between sharia and sufism, the issues around Ibn arabi), and the networks of connection between scholars on both sides of the Indian Ocean (a lot of names). This book was definitely a good corrective for those who believe that there is no Malay intellectual tradition, or that Sufism encourages passivity (one of the scholars analyzed here, Shaykh Yusuf, was a major figure of anti-Dutch resistance) as well as the claim that Indonesians were only into the mystical aspect of islam- the scholars here were famous primarily for being masters of both the inward and outward sciences. Azra' research Indonesian scholars traveling back and forth from Mecca and Medina, a resident Indonesian scholarly community in Mecca, Arab scholars specifically concerned with issues pertaining to Indonesian Muslims... This was personally my first in-depth reading of the subject- this however is only meant to cover one aspect of the Indonesian Islamic experience- most notably the issue of syncretism with local cultures. In any case, I certainly benefited from this book; it added to my overall knowledge of Islam in the Malay world.
