 Understanding the plot of this book was difficult at first. In particular, in Part One, I was confused whether the protagonist of certain episodes was Abel or his grandfather as a young man. However, after surmounting this difficulty, I found this book to be a subtle, moving, and intricate narrative. The prose remained starkly simple and poetic throughout, a distinguishing characteristic of this book. Abel, the main character, has little dialogue throughout the novel, thus marking his role as a symbol for Momaday's theme, rather than a developed character. I believe that the lives of Abel and his grandfather are meant to coincide. After the latter's death at the end of the novel, Abel sprinkles blue and yellow meal on his body before reporting the death to the priest - which, as we learn from the memoirs of a 19th century priest, was exactly what the grandfather's people had done in their day. Abel returned to his roots.
