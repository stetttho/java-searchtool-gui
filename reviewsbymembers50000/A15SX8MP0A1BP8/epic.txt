 This book has been described as the best biography of the Prophet in English. This is partly because unlike other modern biographies which seek to draw insights and unique conclusions, this one is just a seamless narrative (saying in effect "the traditional view was the right one").  It is also more detailed than most, and integrates insights about the spirituality of what the Prophet taught (Lings also wrote books on Sufism), rather than merely depicting the political side of the story. Being based entirely on "the earliest sources," it includes a huge number of miracle stories as well as the prophecies of his coming which add a suspenseful dimension to the tale. Major themes: the prophet's constant state of trust and certainty in his Lord throughout his life. Another was that while he didn't start conflicts he could be a bold, courageous lion (as the Burdah states) when pursuing the enemies who were after all intent upon destroying his mission and were a threats to the security of his community. He was stern against treachery (the Jewish tribes, Bani Bakr), though forgiving of conquered enemies (Hawazin, Bani Mustaliq, the Quraysh, etc.). His general love for humanity and desire for their salvation can be seen in his prayers over Ubayy as well as in the siege of Taif. Very graceful, literary style with a timeless aspect, which Lings accentuates by not including any form of introduction or preface. I read this in conjunction with HAmza Yusuf's commentary which I found extremely helpful- including his occasional sharp criticisms.  But I suggest that someone new to Islam read other works first (see my listmania).
