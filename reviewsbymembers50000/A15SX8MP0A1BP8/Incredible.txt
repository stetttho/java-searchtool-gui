 According to the reviews on the back cover, Alford's book "vividly re-creates a life as dramatic as a work of fiction...events...almost defy belief." I'd tend to agree. This remarkably detailed book narrates the life of Ibrahima, a Fulani prince captured at the age of 26 and enslaved in the USA for 40 years, during which he lost neither his Muslim faith nor his dignity- both of which finally led to his freedom. The details surrounding those events are incredible and sometimes even mystical. Perhaps the most striking aspect of this book was its contrast of the literate, cosmopolitan culture of Futa Jalon, Ibrahima's homeland, and the illiterate, racist, and often homicidal nature of the whites of Natchez.
