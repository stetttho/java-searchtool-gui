 The genius of this book is that it condenses the collected wisdom of centuries of Muslim spiritual doctors such as Imam-al Ghazali into a handy, brief manual. For centuries books like this have shaped men and women of all races, from Indonesians to Swahilis, into shining examples of godliness and beautiful conduct. Anyone who implements the advice here can become what Muslim mystics call a complete, perfected human being, characterized by everything from kindness and charity (including a cheerful countenance), to waking up in the middle of the night to worship, to inward states such as thankfulness and trust in God's will. Like all men of God, Imam al-Haddad's writing is clear, sober and eloquent.
