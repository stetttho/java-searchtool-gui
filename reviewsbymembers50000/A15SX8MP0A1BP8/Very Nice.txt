 This short book of prophetic sayings conveys more of the spirit of Islam than many scholarly books of much greater length. In particular, it shows Islam's integrative, balanced nature, through the author's diverse selection of hadiths- such as those of companions extolling the Prophet's bravery and skill in battle, his advice to repeat "Glory to God," 33 times after prayers, and his encouragement of smiling as an act of worship. I give it 4 stars because some selections seem to be abridged without indication.
