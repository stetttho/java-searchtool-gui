 I discovered this book at my local library and was so impressed with it that I had to buy a copy for my bookshelf. There is certainly a wealth of information of great interest to the aspiring songwriter but beyond that there is also a wealth of information for people who want to be better at playing the guitar. Rikky Rooksby goes into the intricacies of chords and progressions in a way that makes the complex simple and understandable to anyone with even a passing understanding of theory. If you're looking for a songbook full of tabs this ain't it. If you're looking for a book that *will* make you a better guitarist and/or songwriter, I can't recommend this book highly enough. An enthusiastic five stars!
