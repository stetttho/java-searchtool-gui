 Nice digital camera with 3x optical zoom for the price. 1.6 inch LCD view helps with image composition and is viewable even in full sun. 2 megapixel maximum resolution is fine for most uses and generates file sizes that are small enough for email. Video capability depends on the size of the SD card you have. Most digitcal cameras limit videos to 30 or 60 seconds but this Vivitar will take video up to the limit of memory.  It does eat alkaline batteries like snacks so you'll want to get a set of rechargable batteries post haste. That's pretty much true for all digital cameras though.  The optical zoom is way better than other cheap cameras so-called "digital zoom." The autofocus works well and doesn't slow things down too much if you read the manual and know how to pre-focus with the shutter button pressed half way. All in all it's a great point and shoot optical zoom digital camera for the price.
