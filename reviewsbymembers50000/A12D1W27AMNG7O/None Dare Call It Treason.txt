 If you want a feel for what Bugliosi has to say in this book I would suggest youtake the time to read the article (available on the web) for <Strong>The Nation</Strong> titles "None Dare Call It Treason".  Bugliosi lays out the law and the evidence that the US Supreme Court acted in a partisan political fashion in elevating George W. Bush to the position of Resident Select and, as of January 20th, Resident in Chief.  The book as well as the article in The Nation are fascinating reads that ought to give pause to all Americans no matter their political affiliation or who they voted for in November. The danger is that the court has become an instrument of politics and control rather than a dispassionate arbiter of law. Had the shoe been on the other foot there is little doubt that the conservatives would not be willing to "get over it".  It's a great book as is "The Hunting of the President" by Joe Conason and Gene Lyons (also available on Amazon) and anyone who decries Bugliosi's conclusions based on partisan politics instead of sound reasoning does themselves or their country no favors.  Gore won.
