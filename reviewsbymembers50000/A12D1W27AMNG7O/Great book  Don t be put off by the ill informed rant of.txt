 ...one reviewer that apparently can't keep his facts straight as to what happened under which President. (Hint: Ruby Ridge happened under Bush. Asset Forfeiture was pushed through by Reagan. Waco was planned by the Bush administration and carried out by his holdovers at the ATF and the FBI.)  This book skewers both sides, right and left, thoroughly.  From "The Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984" to the instituting of the legal theories of Bentham into our system of law at the expense of basic rights, this book is a splash of cold water on the face of America. Read it and recommend it to your friends before the creeping face of fascism becomes the new face of America.
