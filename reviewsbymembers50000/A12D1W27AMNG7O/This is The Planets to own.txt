 Short and sweet: If you have a good playback system, this is the version of Holst's "The Planets" to have. Period.   The Montreal Symphony under the direction of Charles Dutoit delivers the kind of sonic impression (and fireworks!) that give this recording a real "you are there" feeling. From the deepest organ pedal (if your system can reproduce it -- most can't) from around 8 minutes into Saturn that will rattle the windows, scare the cat and help you break your lease to the most delicate strings and precision percussion, this is the performance that you will return to time and time again. Absolutely stunning. I've owned several versions of The Planets but none compare to this. It isn't even close.
