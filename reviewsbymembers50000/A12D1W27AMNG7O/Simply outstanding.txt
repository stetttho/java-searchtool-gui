 If you like Copeland, and who doesn't, the vintage performances captured here as conducted by Bernstein during the 50's and 60's are a must have. No sonic over-enginneering. Simple miking techniques. Luscious sound. Classical music for people that think that they don't like classical music and a great price to boot! The major well known Copeland pieces are all here and not a sour note or bad performance to be found anywhere on the disc. Highly recommended.
