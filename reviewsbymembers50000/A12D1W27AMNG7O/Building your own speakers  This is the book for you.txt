 Too bad that Amazon has it listed as a special order item. The Loudspeaker Design Cookbook by Vance Dickanson, currently in its 6th edition, will teach you more than you ever wanted to know or even thought existed when it comes to both the art and (mostly) science of desgining loudspeaker systems. You'll also find out first hand how useful that algebra you learned in high school really is. This book covers the most popular types of enclosures from the simple acoustic suspension (think old AR and Kloss designs) to ported bass reflex and bandpass designs that are so popular now. There is also a wealth of information on crossover design. Dickanson builds upon the work of Thiele and Small in treating speaker systems with filter theory. The days of building a box, sticking a driver in it and hoping for the best are gone. Among amateur speaker builders, and even some pros, this is the one book that you just have to have on your shelf. It's simply the best of its kind.
