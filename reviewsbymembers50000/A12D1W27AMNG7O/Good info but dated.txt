 Vance Dickason is rightly famous among the DIY's in the speaker building community. His name along with that of Joeseph D' Apollito is among the most recognized. In Loudspeaker Recipes he sets about incorporating proven design techniques from his own Loudspeaker Design Cookbook to come up with practical application in a series of two way (woofer-tweeter) designs. The designs are all good (hey, what else do you expect from Vance Dickason?) but the passage of time means that not a few of the drivers chosen for these projects have either been modified by their makers or discontinued. If you are looking for a practical kind of guide, this is still a great book. Just don't expect to build exact copies of the designs you find here. Be sure to grab a copy of the 6th edition of his Loudspeaker Design Cookbook. That one is money well spent.
