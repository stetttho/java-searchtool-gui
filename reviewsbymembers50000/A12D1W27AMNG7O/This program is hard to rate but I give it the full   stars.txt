 Paint Shop Pro is a hard graphics program to rate. Why? The price implies "Hold you hand, beginners will love it, easy to use simplicity" but the program itself is not quite that way. PSP 7, like PSP 5 and 6 before it, is more like a poor man's Adobe Photoshop. It *can be* easy to use once you invest a few hours in learning the interface but it can also be capable of the most complex operations on your graphics (requiring multiple steps) to the point that it can nearly replace the (7X more expensive) PhotoShop. Need support for pressure sensitive graphics tablets? It's in there. Need filters? It's likely in there and if it isn't, there are tons of after-market filters that will work. Need to touch up photos? With a little practice, you will be doing pro-level work. If you want a program that is kindergarten-easy, this isn't is. If you want a program that is powerful, has a learning curve that beginners can get a grip on and has a wide user base offering tons of support (check Usenet and Google!) and is *almost* as powerful as the 500 dollar PhotoShop, grab it now. JASC Paint Shop Pro 7 AE will not disappoint.
