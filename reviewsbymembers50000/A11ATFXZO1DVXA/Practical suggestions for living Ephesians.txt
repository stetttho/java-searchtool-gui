 The subtitle of this book is: "a practical guide to the spirit-led life". Larry Christenson uses many different analogies and stories to remind us that we need to rely on the Holy Spirit. "Back to square one" may sound depressing in the language of the world, but when it is a symbol of a new start, and a fresh infusion of God's Spirit, despair turns to hope.
