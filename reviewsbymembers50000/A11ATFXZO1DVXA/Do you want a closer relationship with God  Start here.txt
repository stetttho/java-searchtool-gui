 You have probably heard of The Practice of the Presence of God, a book so popular that it has been continuously in print for the past 300 years. I suspect, however, that more people buy it than actually read it.  This version has been edited into modern language, to make it easier to read, and has been paired with the letters of Frank Laubach, a missionary, writer, and friend of God, who died in 1970. The Laubach letters gripped my heart with a sense of hope, and the possibility that I too could have a relationship with God, where I was continually aware of His presence. Brother Lawrence's letters are powerful, but are also more difficult to hold on to, especially the sections about suffering. I expect that my understanding will increase as I  re-read them in the future.
