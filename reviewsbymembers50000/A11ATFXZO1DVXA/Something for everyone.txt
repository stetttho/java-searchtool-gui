 I've read a lot of books about prayer and meditation.  The strength of this book is that she includes several different approaches, so that people with various personalities all have a chance to find something that will fit their own style.  For example, people who are visual, for example, may be drawn to the method of St Ignatius, while people who are more cerebral might like to try lectio divina.  I found this much easier to read than most books on meditation -- it is written in a very simple and accessible style.
