 I wasn't sure whether to get this or not -- I was afraid it would be hard to install. It couldn't have been simpler. I'm running an XP machine, and there was nothing to install at all -- it did it all automatically. 1)I slid the adapter into the PCMCIA slot. 2)I slid the flash card into the adaptor. 3)The system popped up a message that said something like "it looks as if you have photos. Do you want to copy them?" 4) I clicked on 'yes'. 5) The photos all copied onto my C drive. There are three big advantages to this. First, you don't have to find the cable to attach your camera to the computer. Second, you don't use up your camera battery while doing the transfer. Third, the transfer speed is much much quicker.
