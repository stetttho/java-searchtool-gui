 I highly recommend this book.  I have recently become interested in contemplative prayer, and as usual I purchased several books on the topic. This is the only book I found that bridges the gap between the depth of the topic, and the distractions of contemporary life.  I have trouble quieting my mind, so I needed help in that area. Thelma Hall proposes a four step process, in which you -READ a Bible passage -MEDITATE, or think about what it means -PRAY about it, -and then finally enter into CONTEMPLATION. Somehow, this progression works. Try it. The book is very short. In fact, most of it is actually a collection of scriptures that have been arranged thematically for your convenience in finding a scripture to start reading.
