 Are you ready to be reminded of the faithfulness of God? Are you ready to be encouraged by stories of how God has moved? Are you ready to start praying for revival? Then read this book. In addition to the more 'popular' revivals that most of us have heard of, such as the 'Great Awakening' or the 'Azuza Street' revival, this tells about less well known (though equally inspiring) revavals, such as the 1857 Layman's Prayer revival (which started in New York City) and the 1800 Cane Ridge Revival.  The important theme to grasp is that revival does not wait until the country (or city) is moral and pure, it comes in the middle of depravity, sparked by the prayers of a believing remnant. So the time is ripe -- let's pray!
