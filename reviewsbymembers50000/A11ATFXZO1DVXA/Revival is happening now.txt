 Do you want to be inspired? Watch this video.  We often use the term 'revival' too lightly, referring to a particularly inspiring meeting. In this video, revival describes an entire society being reformed. Depending on the city, this has different 'symptoms'. For example: bars being closed, due to lack of business; jails being closed, due to lack of crime; increased harvests; reduction in drug trade; all-night prayer vigils held in the sports arena, with tens of thousands of participants, etc. There are four segments, each about 15 minutes long, each featuring a different city around the world that is currently undergoing revival. I was most impacted by the commonalities between these stories. In each case, the story started with sin and darkness. In each case, there were praying believers. In each case, churches united in partnership.  The lessons seem obvious.
