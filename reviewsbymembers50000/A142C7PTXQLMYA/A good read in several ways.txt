 This was not what I was expecting!  I hate to say it was a "pleasant surprise" since the storyline can't exactly be considered pleasant, but it was definitely more gripping and plot-based (rather than character-based) than I expected. With a significant but effective flavour of the legal suspense genre playing a part, Picoult tells the story of two very close families in the time leading up to and following the attempted execution of a suicide pact between their teenagers, Chris and Emily.  It really makes you wonder how well you can know a person... even your own child. The plot itself is suspenseful and gripping - I'm not a fast reader, but I finished in a matter of a few days.  The characterization seemed lacking in a couple of characters, but perhaps that only stood out to me because the rest of the time it was almost unsettling in how real and precise the characters were.  The writing style is simple and just right for this novel. I will definitely be picking up more novels by this author.
