 The setting of this story includes two farmhouses, side-by-side, but remote from anything else.  The families living in them, each two parents and a child, are so different from each other yet unable to be completely separate because of geography.  In the middle of the night, a scream and a shot ring out from one house, and both families are changed forever. This novel is a lovely bit of writing with a little flavour of a mystery novel thrown in.  I like Shreve's conservative, contained writing style, and her characters are all quite realistic.  A few parts dragged just a little, which is why I didn't give it a higher rating, but overall this novel doesn't disappoint.
