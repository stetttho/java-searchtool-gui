 Sports rep Myron Bolitar is ready to watch his big client, football player Christian Steele, sign the biggest-ever contract for a rookie and shoot both of them into the big-times.  But then Christian is contacted by a former girlfriend that everyone thinks is dead, and Myron goes on the hunt to find the truth about what happened to her. I love Coben's humour, and when I can put aside questions about how unrealistic some of the stuff in the book is (31 years old and his resume reads pro ball player, high-ranking FBI specialty agent, practising attorney, tae kwan do black belt and sports agent who still lives with his parents), I really enjoy myself!  Myron and his sidekick Win are a barrel of laughs.   My only complaint about this book was the ending - a bit too "Murder, She Wrote" for my taste (having read the second in the series, "Drop Shot," I can say that it's got a better ending).  I'm also tired of every woman in a book being the most gorgeous being ever created.  Ah well.  At least in this one, the guys are hunky, too.
