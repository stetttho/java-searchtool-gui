 I HATE doing cardio work and usually do all I can to avoid it.  But this 40-minute workout makes it do-able and (almost) fun.   The varied and fun intervals break up the monotony and make the time pass quickly.  They are timed, so you always know that the blessed end of the hard part is coming!  The lower-body strength training in between is quite effective and thorough, definitely not just filler.  Kathy Smith has the perfect amount of enthusiasm, and gives clear instructions.  There are some modifiers provided, and I like that it really does cover a wide range of intensities.   My favourite thing about this video is that no equipment is needed.  No need to drag out a chair, a mat (unless you want it for the stretches at the end), weights, bands, balls, or most annoyingly, that step with it's little heightening platforms.   Just put on workout clothes, pop in the video and you're set.
