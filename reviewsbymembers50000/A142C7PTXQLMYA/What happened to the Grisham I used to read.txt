 Judge Reuben Atlee was once a commanding and powerful figure in the legal community of a small Mississippi town.  Now he's terminally ill, living a solitary life, having chased away all those who might have cared for him.  Ray Atlee receives a formal summons to appear at his father's home to discuss his estate along with his younger brother, Forrest, but when he arrives he finds a shock, "known only to Ray.  And perhaps to someone else," as the back of the book says. Grisham is a good writer, evidenced by the easy, interesting, and believable way he writes his characters.  So I don't know why he has spent so many years devoting himself to these rambling, boring books.  The plot could have been interesting but it just droned on for me and I spent most of this book waiting for something good to happen.  Characterization was good as I mentioned, but at moments the main character seemed to have some inconsistencies for the sake of suspense.  My decision long ago (after reading "The Chamber") to stop buying his books new and only read them if I found them used was confirmed again by "The Summons."
