 I'm one of those cookbook collectors, who owns dozens of beautiful, pristine, read but unused cookbooks.  But Looneyspoons (along with it's 'sequel' Crazy Plates and of course Joy of Cooking) is the book on my shelf with the most folded, spattered, tattered, scribbled-on pages, because it is truly one of the books I go back to again and again for reliable recipes that are great and reliable.   The fact that all the recipes are low-fat is just a wonderful bonus that I forget about most of the time.  Look for brownies, stews, wonderful pastas, breads, salads, and a wide selection of meat dishes.
