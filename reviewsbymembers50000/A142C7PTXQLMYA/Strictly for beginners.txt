 This video has two main portions.  The first addresses 12 basic yoga positions, teaching proper technique and breathing.  This is very basic, slow and easy.  The second portion puts them together in more of a flowing sequence and provides a little bit of a workout, but this is still very easy and quite short, too! I am fairly new to yoga (have been doing it for only a few months with the help of 2 other yoga dvd's), and even I felt that it was way too easy and simplistic.  I got bored within minutes.  I think it's the kind better rented from the library to be able to see the different positions once or twice - I've gone through it one time and honestly doubt I'll use it ever again. One positive to this dvd is that if you are a beginner and feeling uncertain about your ability or even that you should bother trying yoga, Sara Ivanhoe is incredibly supportive of beginners, and she works very hard to make it clear that people of all levels are doing great just by trying.  But this is something that you know now by reading this review, so skip this one and try another beginning yoga dvd.  :)
