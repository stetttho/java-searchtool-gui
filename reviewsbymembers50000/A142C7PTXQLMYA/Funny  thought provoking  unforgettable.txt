 Sully and an interesting cast of unforgettable characters reside in the small town of North Bath, in upstate NY.  Sully lives in a flat above Miss Beryl, the town's former 8th-grade teacher who passes time talking to a picture of her dead husband.  Sully struggles with a bad knee, a freaky ex-wife, the dumbest of dumb best friends, and his estranged son who returns to town and seems very likely to follow right along in Sully's footsteps.   This was my second read by Russo (first was "Empire Falls," also great) and he didn't let me down.  This book contains a great writing style and is filled with laugh-out-loud moments.  Signature Russo is the fabulous characterization which is the power behind this book.  Russo is a master of making the details of small-town folks and small-town life matter.
