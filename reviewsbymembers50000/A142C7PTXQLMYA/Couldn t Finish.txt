 This novel tells the story of Guenevere and Arthur.  I started with high hopes, but those were quickly dashed.  I kept trying, but the going got slower and slower and finally stopped altogether.   The two main characters didn't interest me a lot, and when they did catch my attention they only irritated me.  Several of the side characters seemed like they had potential to be deeper and more satisfying, but the book didn't focus much on them.  The main reason I didn't finish was that the romance aspect of the novel was too much for me.  It distracted me from the storyline (which itself was interesting) and again, made the characters less likeable to me. On the bright side, I did find the story fascinating and this book prompted me to try more books that tell the story of Camelot.
