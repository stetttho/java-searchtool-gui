 Bess Grady is on a routine assignment in small-town Mexico as a photojournalist, but the howling of dogs triggers a terrible memory she's worked so hard to supress, and she knows she's stumbled onto something sinister that she must fight.  Along the way she encounters the dark and mysterious Kaldak, a man she's not sure is out to kill her or help her bring down the cause of the evil that has brought destruction to the town and threatens the world. Frankly, this was not an incredibly impressive suspense novel.  Nothing was awful, but nothing was great, and the slightly-below average rating comes from the total implausibility of the plot.  There are much better suspense novelists out there, who write gripping stories with complex characters and good writing.  Nevertheless, this one entertained me enough while I was reading, and I've since picked up two more books by this author to try, so go figure.
