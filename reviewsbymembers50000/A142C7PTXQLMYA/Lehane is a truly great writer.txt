 Three eleven-year old boys from East Buckingham are tussling in the street when a car pulls up, one boy gets in, and their lives change forever.  Twenty-five years later, they lead separate lives - One is a cop whose wife just ran away on him, another has removed himself from a life of crime and runs a neighbourhood shop to support his wife and 3 daughters, and yet another is married with a son, but is mainly just trying his best to keep his secret demon, "the boy," under wraps.  When tragedy strikes one of the families in the neighbourhood, they are, by chance, drawn together once again, and must confront a past they were all doing their best to forget.   This was an absolutely brilliant novel - a work of great writing, amazing characterization, delving into complex issues, and a sense of place and setting that you might find in the most literary of novels.  Here, it just happens to surround a murder mystery.  I read a lot of suspense mysteries, and without a doubt, this is the best book of the genre that I've read.  Highly recommended!
