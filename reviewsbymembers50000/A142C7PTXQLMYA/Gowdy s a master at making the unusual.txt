 An utterly amazing collection of short stories, many of which are related to one another, so they fit well together as a group.  She has a knack for taking the most unusual or unconventional characters and situations and making them seem so realistic and sympathetic.  One thing that always strikes me is that she seems to care about her characters so much.  Despite their flaws, despite their outright freakishness at times, she, because of her affection for them, is able to convey to the reader their fundamental humanity.  As a result, the focus is taken away from whatever makes them different, and we are instead drawn to see the similarities between them and ourselves. Some images from this book will stay with me forever.  Silvie and Sue as well as Simon and Samuel, two sets of siamese twins, each with their own story, for example.  Incomparable characterization, simple but profound writing style, this book is absolutely unforgettable.  And, if I can sneak in another recommendation, check out "Mister Sandman" by the same author - as much as I loved this one, that one's even better!
