 This was my first Berg novel, and it definitely will not be my last.  "Open House" tells the story of Sam, a woman who suddenly finds herself without a husband, with an 11-year old son that no longer needs her at every moment, and she is faced with the struggle of finding a new role and place for herself in the world.  Berg's writing pins down Sam's feelings... self-doubt, fear, loneliness, etc., with a clarity and accuracy that amazed me.  Sam was real and wonderful, and the cast of characters surrounding her was also fabulous.  I'd definitely recommend this, and not just to those who have been through divorce... also those who wonder about their place in the world, what they're doing with their lives, and what they owe to themselves and others.
