 Michael Hurbek is a schizophrenic escapee from a mental hospital, and he's on a mission to find Lis Atcheson, the woman who testified against him in a trial where he was found guilty of a vicious murder.  The police, Michael's psychiatrist, a professional dog tracker, and Lis' wiley war vet husband are all trying to stop him, but Michael seems adept at evading them all, leaving behind him a trail of murder and destruction. Somewhat interesting core storyline, although some of the tangents were a little boring.  Seemed like Deaver was trying to make this into a more serious novel without success.  Characterization didn't do much for me.  Acceptable read, but definitely not his best.  I recommend his Rhymes and Sachs Bone Collector series as much better!
