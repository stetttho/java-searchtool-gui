 I'm truly greedy with my 5-star ratings, so don't let this 4-star rating fool you - Pope Joan came very close to getting a 5!  I was in a bit of a reading slump and this is the only book that could pull me out of it, I finished the majority of it in one weekend. Read about Joan Anglicus, living in 9th century Rome, a time and place where women were nothing more than the property of men, considered unable to think with any amount of intelligence or logic.  Realizing that she will never achieve her dreams as a woman, she leaves a suffocating situation at home, disguises herself as a man and, against all odds, rises in the church to achieve the position of Pope. This novel has adventure, a bit of romance (not too much, thank goodness), and best of all, the ability to sweep you away back to this much different time and place.  Highly recommended.
