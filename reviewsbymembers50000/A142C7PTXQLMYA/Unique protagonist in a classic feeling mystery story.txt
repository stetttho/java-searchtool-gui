 One afternoon, Elise Andrioli is sitting in the park when a young girl approaches and whispers that she's witnessed the murder of a neighbourhood boy.  Cryptically refusing to call the murderer anything other than "Death from the woods," little Virginie draws Elise into a web of terror and frustration as this serial killer gets ready to strike again.  The unique thing about this story is that our protagonist Elise is mute, blind, and quadriplegic, so she doesn't know how to convey this information to anyone else, and is left to suffer with her knowledge in silence as events progress around her at an alarming speed.   A lot of the events in this book are a little unrealistic and will require a good dose of suspension of disbelief.  In addition, you'll need the ability to look beyond some somewhat one-dimensional supporting characters.  If you don't possess either of these two things, you might not enjoy this book.  Otherwise, however, Aubert does a great job of creating an interesting character in Elise, and letting us live this story through her experiences.  You can feel the frustration and tension that Elise herself must feel, being unable to communicate what she knows.  This whole story had a very "classic" mystery feel to it, along the lines of Christie (except better), as we weave in and out of the story, never knowing who's guilty or innocent from one moment to the next.  I would read another by this author.
