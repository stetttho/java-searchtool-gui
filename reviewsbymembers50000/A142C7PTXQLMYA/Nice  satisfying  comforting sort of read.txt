 Ave Maria considers herself the "town spinster" in Big Stone Gap, a tiny town in the mountains of Virginia where she's the town pharmacist and booklover.  Her life is peaceful, quiet, and she's seemingly content, until she reads a letter from her recently-deceased mother which changes everything.  Ave's life is turned upside-down and she rethinks her personal and family history, what she needs and wants to be happy in life, and her place in the world.   A very nice and pleasing book, I plan to read the sequel.  However, my one main complaint was that the characterisation here wasn't actually that impressive, compared to other aspects of the book.  The men in this novel aren't discernible from one another at all.  The women are written much better, but even some of them seemed more like cut-outs rather than fully-fleshed characters.  That being said, Ave Maria, the main character, was written well, and I liked her and want to know her better (although, is this good or bad I wonder?)  The plot was, in general, logical and neat.  One full extra rating point because for some reason I can't place, I stayed up until 4am reading this book!  Must be something!
