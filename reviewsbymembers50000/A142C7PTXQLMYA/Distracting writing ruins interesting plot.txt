 A series of paintings called "Sleeping Women" is being released into the art world - they are by an anonymous artist, and depict nude women who seem to be sleeping, but as the series progresses, and the paintings get more realistic, it looks more as if they are actually dead.  Photojournalist Jordan Glass is browsing though a gallery in Asai when she is confronted with her own face in one of the paintings, or more likely the face of her twin sister, who disappeared over a year ago.  We watch Jordan work with the FBI to hunt down the artist, the killer, and hopefully discover the fate of her missing sister. The plot might have been satisfying enough with compelling characters and an interesting writing style to back it up, but the writing didn't do much for me, and I was distracted throughout much of the book with the glaring fact that this was a male author writing a female first-person narrator.  In my opinion, if you can't successfully write a protagonist of the opposite sex, it's not sufficient to bandaid the problem by continuously mentioning how unconventionally masculine your female character is - just write it with a male lead and let the reader enjoy the juicy storyline.
