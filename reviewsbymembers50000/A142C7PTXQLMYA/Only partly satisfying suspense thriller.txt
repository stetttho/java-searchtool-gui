 Cody O'Brien and her eight-year-old son R.J. live in northern California in a life cut off from a life they once knew.  That was when they were Megan and Ryan Riggs, before Megan's husband was killed by the Russian mob and the two went on the run for their lives.  Failed by the Witness Protection Program, Cody takes their protection into her own capable hands and creates a new life for them on her own.  All is well until one day, R.J. is kidnapped after school.  Was it the Russion mob or some more terrifying captor?  Megan cannot trust anyone but herself to find her son.   The storyline was interesting and suspenseful, and kept me turning pages late into the night - I'm not the fastest reader, but I polished off this book in just over a day.  However, character development was mediocre at best, and I wish I could have cared more about the people in this story.  There were a few moments where I was made aware of the writing process behind the story, and I dislike that.  The plot rates a 3.5 stars, but the characterization and writing style brought it down for me.
