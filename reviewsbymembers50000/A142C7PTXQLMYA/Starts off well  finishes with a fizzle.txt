 This was a pleasant, sweet book about Icy Sparks, an endearing young girl with undiagnosed Tourette's syndrome.  We read the narrative (written by her looking back as an adult) as she struggles with what her disease does to her life. The writing style is easy to read, although I found myself wishing that the author would have gone a bit deeper into the minds of her characters - I sensed that she had the potential to do so, but didn't for some reason, and I was left unsatisfied. The last 20 or so pages are almost comical.  They really seem as if they were written by someone else, and if not for them my rating and impression of the book would be quite a bit higher.  Instead of being left with the warm fuzzies that the rest of the nice (if too simplistic) story gave me, I closed the last page, thinking "HUH?!"  Overall, I still recommend it as a quick, light read.
