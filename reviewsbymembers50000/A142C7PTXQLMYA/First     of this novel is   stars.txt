 I won't bother repeating what's been said in the other billion reviews of this book, but my one comment is that I adored this book and might have potentially rated it a 5* (rare for me) if not for the last two chapters, which dragged and ruined the great reading experience I was having.  I'd still highly recommend it just for the pleasure of the storyline, the charming and interesting characters, and the flowing writing style.  Then rush through the ending just to finish what is otherwise a great book.
