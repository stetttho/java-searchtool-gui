 In the novel for which he won the prestigious Giller Prize in 2000, David Adams Richards confronts his readers with the truth about the different dimensions of human nature, both good and bad. The narrator, Lyle Henderson, tells the story of his family in small-town New Brunswick.  As a child, his father Sydney vowed to God that he would never harm a soul and Sydney holds true to that promise.  Others see this as weakness and pity him or use it as an opportunity to take advantage of him.  Witnissing this as a child, Lyle takes a different, more aggressive attitude towards the world, and through the course of this novel, we witness how it all works out for both of them with their different outlooks.   An intriguing writing style and fascinating characters.  Story and characters are drawn differently than I'm used to, but it was refreshing to be challenged with something new, and it was still incredibly realistic and interesting.  The narration by Lyle is also different.  Can a book be depressing and uplifting at one time?  Read "Mercy Among the Children" and find out!
