 The Kincaid family lives a superficially contented, easy life revolving around the theatre in Stratford until one day their gardener slices their phone cable, some vital calls are missed, and their lives begin to unravel.   A very readable, suspenseful novel, a bit different from what I'm used to from Findley.  I'm a big Findley fan, but this is not my absolute favourite of his... and Findley himself called it his "slightest book," although I'm not sure I'd go that far.  It still goes to say that this is a really great book with believable characters and a complicated plot with common but complex themes.  It may even make you question your own character and what events it would take to make you break away from what you think is most important in your life. Note also that anyone who's ever been to Stratford, Ontario, will recognize a lot of landmarks and even people in this story!
