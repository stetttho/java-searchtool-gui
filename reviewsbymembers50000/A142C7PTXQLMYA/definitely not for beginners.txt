 Perhaps someone more advanced would have a different opinion, but as a person fairly new to yoga, I cannot recommend this program. Aside from the fact that many of the moves are just plain impossible for a novice, there are other faults:  The directions are very limited, the breath pattern that he seems to follow just doesn't seem realistic or at least even and steady, and I don't enjoy having to sit through or FF through 7 minutes of him showing off at the beginning of the dvd.  And as the other reviews stated, there are no chapters, so we've basically paid for a dvd with all the limitations of a vhs tape.  I think this one will be collecting some dust on my shelf.
