 Cal Mooney looks into a carpet and in a split second, realizes that all his childhood dreams and fantasies were true.  He's drawn into this magical carpet world which has awoken, and in doing so, has attracted the attention of the powerful evil forces that seek to destroy it. I was completely captivated by this story, drawn in from page 1 and kept rapt until the last line.  I can't say much about character development, which is usually my #1 interest as a reader, because I was too busy being swept along into this magical world that Barker created.  Not a short book, I wasn't aware of the length because I was so involved in the storyline and rooting every step of the way for the survival of this magical world.
