 A book's worth of notes and musings written by Mayes, who bought a big old house in Tuscany.  A college professor in the United States, spending her summers (and some other holidays) at her house in Italy, she shares with the reader random observations and experiences of fixing up the house and living in Italy.   She has a very pretty sort of writing style, restful and other-wordly.  Her life sounds wonderful, and perhaps the only downside to this book is that I think I'm supposed to feel a little guilty for (a) being a dumb american (even though I'm canadian) and (b) not spending a fortune and working my butt off on a run-down house in Tuscany.   Oh!  One more downside: it's also bad for the diet - you'll eat lots and lots of nothing but Italian food while reading this book!
