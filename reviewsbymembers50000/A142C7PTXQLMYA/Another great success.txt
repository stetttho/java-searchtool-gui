 This is almost the exact same review I wrote for Looneyspoons, but I raved about that one and Crazy Plates is just as good, so I'm not sure what else to say.   I'm one of those cookbook collectors who owns dozens of beautiful, pristine, unused cookbooks. But Looneyspoons and Crazy Plates (and of course Joy of Cooking) are the books on my shelf with the most folded, spattered, tattered, scribbled-on pages, because they are truly the books I go back to again and again for reliable recipes that are great - tasty, easy to follow, and low-fat.   But if you're one of those scared off by the low-fat label, don't be!  This isn't carrot sticks and bulger, it's wonderfully flavoured pork tenderloin, trifle, rice pudding, tons of great pasta recipes.  Check out the hamburger/cabbage soup and the quickbread recipes.
