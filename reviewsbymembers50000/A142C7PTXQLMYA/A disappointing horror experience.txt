 I really wanted to enjoy this book, since I'm on the hunt for a new-to-me horror novelist that I can enjoy.  This was my second read by Little (first was "The Walking") and likely my last.  In "The Town," Gregory and Julia Tomasov win the lottery and return to the small town of Gregory's childhood along with his mother and their 3 kids.  They forget the traditional/religious invitation to the spirit that will supposedly keep any house safe, but nobody except Gregory's mom takes it seriously.  Not surprisingly, horror ensues, or some strange imitation of horror. This book features weak characterization, a dull dragging plot, a few moments that you know should be really gripping but just aren't, and to top it all off perfectly - lots of typos.  There were some unique horror moments which were fascinating in their weirdness, but they didn't come close to making up for the *horror* of this reading experience.
