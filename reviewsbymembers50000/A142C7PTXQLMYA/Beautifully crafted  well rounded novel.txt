 Olivia and Kwan are half-sisters, but they couldn't be more different.  Kwan, having come to the US from China at age 18, is blissfully enthusiastic about everything, including her new-found baby sister and her interactions with yin people (otherwise known as ghosts), while Olivia is half-Chinese by blood, but fully American in her attitudes, and not fond of Kwan's eccentricities and over-zealous sisterly attentions.  Olivia tells us the story of her one-sided relationship with her sister as well as her own troubled marriage, while Kwan is simultaneously telling a mysterious and absorbing story of her previous life in 19th century Manchu China.   There are enough similarities between this book and "The Bonesetter's Daughter" by the same author, that it was impossible for me not to compare the two while reading.  However, aside from the handful of similar themes and relationships (an obvious one being that of the westernized younger woman struggling with a suffocating relationship with an older, more traditionally Chinese one), there is a world of difference between them.  This book sparks with wit, energy, and the tightness of great writing, while simultaneously providing a flowing, relaxing, and immensely beautiful story to read.  This is one of those books that you can love but not crave a sequel, because it sits so well on its own.  All the parts of this novel work perfectly together to form a complete whole.
