 This book chronicles the life of Nobel prize winner John Nash.  I found it disturbing in the distinct sense of "gossip" I got from the whole book, as John Nash was only referenced as a direct source once or twice, and although Alicia Nash (John's wife) was referenced more often, I still felt that the couple's privacy and wishes weren't respected enough.  Note, however, that my opinion isn't based on anything except the feeling I got from reading this book. Another downside is that there was a bit too much detail given to certain things, such as the people Nash met throughout his life... a large percentage of this book doesn't have anything to do with John Nash. Given all of that, it was still incredibly fascinating to learn about this intelligent, torn, complex person.
