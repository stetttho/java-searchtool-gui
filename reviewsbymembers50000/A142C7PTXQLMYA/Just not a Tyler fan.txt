 Barnaby Gaitlin is 30 and is having trouble breaking out of the very tiny and clearly-marked box into which his family (with a bit of help from Barney himself) has placed him - lazy, unmotivated, irresponsible, and an overall unworthy person.  He's half-heartedly waiting for his angel, a tradition in the Gaitlin Family, to swoop into his life and make everything perfect.   He makes a semi-likeable main character, and it's obvious that Tyler feels warmly towards him.  Otherwise, the characterization was a bit lacking, and the book's back-up characters seemed to exist only to be back-ups, rather than full characters in their own right.  The exceptions, and definite high points of this read to me, were the seniors that Barnaby helped out during his job with Rent-A-Back.  Tyler's descriptions succeeded in bringing them alive and making them real, even moreso than Barney, perhaps. This was my second attempt at an Anne Tyler book (first was "Ladder of Years), and I don't think I'll be trying again very soon.
