 Austin, an American painter, looks back at his life, and the people whose lives are intertwined with his memories.  George, the serious and thoughtful china-painter, Sara, his quiet summertime model and lover, Augusta, who was a nurse during the war, who tells him her life story in one night while sitting in a china hall.   This contained some of the most beautiful writing I've ever read, and I've taken note of a dozen of the loveliest passages from the book.  But as a whole, as a novel, I could barely finish.  I had absolutely no sympathy for the protagonist, and the plot was unapparent to me until the last fraction of the book.  As beautiful as those passages were, they weren't enough to keep me entertained through the rest of this novel.  Writing style deserves 5 stars, characterization 3 stars, and plot and storyline 0.
