 Uncanny, that is, but certainly not pleasant.  Don't look to this book for warm and fuzzy feelings about how we're all fabulous and life is wonderful.  However, Atwood's ability to expose the most hidden and secret parts of her characters is mind-boggling and that, alone, was enough for me. In this, as in most of Atwood's novels, I don't feel a lot of affection towards the characters - in this case, Elizabeth, Nate and Lesje (3 people in what might be called a romantic triangle by someone as uncreative as myself, although it's like no romantic triangle I've ever read about before) - but I certainly do find them fascinating.   I also find myself feeling oddly sympathetic towards them, despite the self-centred, weak, or otherwise negative traits that Atwood exposes to us as readers.  This can only be because on some level, I recognize at least a few of my own weaknesses, and those of the people I love. I recommend this book to those looking for a character-driven story, and for those who see the value in harsh but honest insights into human nature.
