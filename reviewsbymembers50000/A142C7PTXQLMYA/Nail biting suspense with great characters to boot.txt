 This is the second in the Lincoln Rhymes and Amelia Sachs series (the first being "The Bone Collector" which was made into a movie with Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie).  Rhymes, criminologist extraordinaire, is once again under the clock to hunt down the hired killer also known as "The Coffin Dancer" because of a strangely morbid tatoo on his arm.  He's already claimed one of his 3 targets and Rhymes, Sachs, and the rest of the team have 45 hours to find him before he can succeed in killing the others. This has a great main character in Rhymes (quadriplegic solving cases from his bed and wheelchair with spittle on his chin, but still somehow the sexiest male character ever?), intriguing female lead (bull-headed, aware but unimpressed by her own beauty, slight self-destructive edge), and a nail-biting storyline.  I'm looking forward to #3 in the series.
