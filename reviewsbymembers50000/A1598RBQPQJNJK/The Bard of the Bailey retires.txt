 ...Or does he? That's the question long-time readers are left pondering after that irascible, curmudgeony barrister Rumpole solves his last case in the book from a hospital bed. It's a sad thought to consider, especially after reading seven delightful new stories featuring all of one's favorite Rumpole characters, from She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed to Claude Erskine-Brown to Mizz Liz Probert. Still, it is Rumpole that one truly reads for, and Mortimer has once again crafted a comfortable but multi-layered lead character who is at once off-putting and likable, plain-spoken yet charmingly witty. Although Mortimer plays with the Rumpole character and the traditional Rumpole story  -- if only slightly but always successfully -- one gets the idea that he wanted to really have some fun with Rumpole should this be their last outing together. And the result is that we all have fun. Indeed, reading Rumpole is like sitting with a favorite uncle as he regales you with tale after tale -- you always want there to be just one more story, one more evening with a larger than life character that you love.
