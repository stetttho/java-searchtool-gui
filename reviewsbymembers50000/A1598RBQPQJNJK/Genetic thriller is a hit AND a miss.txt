 F. Paul Wilson wastes no time pulling readers into his thriller SIMS: genetically engineered human/chimp workers who yearn for "family" but are maintained simply as property. But a small group of these "sims" have asked a lawyer to help them form a union, and a government employee is working with a masked man to uncover sim abuses.... Before long, they will all find themselves going up against the biggest corporation in the world -- and a shadowy organization -- that will do anything to stop them.  Like the best thriller writers, Wilson has crafted an intricate plot based right on the edge of modern science and possibility. Unlike some of the more popular thriller novelists, Wilson is more thoughtful in his development of the story line... His story builds more slowly than, say, a Michael Chrichton or Dan Brown, but eventually reaches the same page-turner pace.  And also like many of these other writers, Wilson's writing falters when it comes to characters: They are cursorily interesting, but not very believable. With the exception of some of the Sim, none of the characters is particularly believable. Indeed, they come across rather cartoony.   All told, I find it a minor fault in an otherwise good book. SIMS remains a very readable sci-fi thriller if one is willing to overlook an all-too-common problem with the genre.
