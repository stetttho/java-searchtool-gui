 Lyndsey Davis does it again -- and better -- by bringing back her gumshoe (sandal!?) hero, Didius Falco. Having forestalled an attempt to overthrow the empire, Falco continues working for the emperor on projects here and there... This book picks up as Falco is in the process of some (cough, cough) "cleaning up" for the emperor. As he does so, he uncovers some shady goings-on that once again threaten the throne.  Sent to discover what's going on, Falco and friends travel across the Italian countryside to the oceanside resorts in the south. There he searches for a mysterious ex-slave who holds the key to the mystery of murder and mayhem that sent him on his way. Falco fans will love this one -- and first time readers will marvel at the intricate story, the historical detail, and the likable (or in some cases, not-so-likable) characters who seem to leap of the page. Davis is a master of character and dialog who easily propels her cast (and her readers) through an exciting story of murder, intrique, betrayal, and love...
