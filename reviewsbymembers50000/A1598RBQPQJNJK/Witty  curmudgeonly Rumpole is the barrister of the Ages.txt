 John Mortimer continues his classic Rumpole series in this delightful  collection of stories, proof that some things do get better with age.   London lawyer Horace Rumpole eagerly seeks out the lowliest criminal  cases to keep himself well stocked of the local plonk and his missus, She  Who Must Be Obeyed, off his back. Surrounded by a cast of quirky supporting  characters, the aging Rumpole continues his quest for justice. Like all  of Mortimer's work, the Rumpole stories are deftly written in a style so  casual, so seemingly transparent, that you finish reading before you're  prepared to. Perfect for the fan of humorous fiction and well-defined  characters, the 3rd Rumpole Omnibus is a treat!
