 Putting aside all of the analysis and comparisons, GROOVITUDE does what a good comic strip collection is supposed to do: It makes you laugh! Out loud! Over and over! Like all comic strips, you either like GET FUZZY or you don't. But how you could NOT like GET FUZZY is simply hard for me to imagine. It's got oddly appealing characters, an off-kilter perspective, great artwork, and just plain funny stories. So, get into a debate over something serious, but get into GROOVITUDE because you want to have some fun and laugh for a while... It'll definitely pick you up when you're feeling rather belgium. ;)
