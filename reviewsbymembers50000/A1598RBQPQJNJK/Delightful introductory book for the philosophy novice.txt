 First, this is a DK book and like all DK books, it reinforces and supports a spare narrative with many photos, illustrations, lists, etc.   That said, this is really a great book for a person who wants an introduction to the "big ideas" (and thus, the "big philosophers") in the history of western philosophy. Magee succinctly summarizes some grand philosophical ideas while telling us about the philosophers themselves.   The many illustrations and graphics help relate the philosophical ideas to works of art, to other disciplines (notably music and literature), and  -- ultimately -- to our daily lives.  Obviously, this book is not meant to be a comprehensive view of any philosopher or philosophical approach. But it is a thoughtful, engaging, entertaining, and READABLE book -- a very rare find in any philosophy book.   Any reader of STORY OF PHILOSOPHY will learn enough to know, at the least, if they would like to continue exploring philosophy or not.
