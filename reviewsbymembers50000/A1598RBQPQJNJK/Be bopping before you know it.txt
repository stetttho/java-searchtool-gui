 For years I wondered about the appeal and popularity of jazz music. What jazz I heard seemed bizarre, cacophonous, and, well, not worth listening to. Jonny King's book (and it's CD) changed all of that and I've converted into a definite jazz fan. King's book is the perfect introduction and does what it sets out to do: present the jazz neophyte with an understanding of what jazz is, what the musicians are doing as they play, and how to listen to jazz on different levels.  An excellent book that has given me a whole new world of music to explore and appreciate. If you are beginning to explore the jazz scene, this book is the perfect primer!
