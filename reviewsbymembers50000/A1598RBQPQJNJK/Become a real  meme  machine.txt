 Marketing guru Levinson declares all-out guerilla warfare on cheesy, ineffective, downright bad advertising and marketing with this book on a marketing approach that could transform the marketplace. While the "memes" concept has been around for some time, Levinson is one of the first to apply and evaluate the concept in the marketing arena. And, as the Godfather of guerilla marketing -- with it's emphasis on low- and no-cost techniques -- Levinson gives readers a well-thought, and reasonably documented analysis of how a single powerful meme can propel a business or product to the public eye, generating business (and more importantly, REVENUE) almost without effort. He also provides many examples of memes that work, tells why they work, and then shows readers how they can get started creating their own memes.  An engaging, easily read book, GUERILLA CREATIVITY is one of Levinson's best yet with little fluff [a fun, but overlong comparison of marketing & seduction] and a ton of useful information [especially on generating and developing ideas]. This is a must-have book for anyone involved in marketing or business development.
