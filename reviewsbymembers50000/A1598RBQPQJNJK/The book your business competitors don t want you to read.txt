 Mitchell and Coles successfully present the argument for "why" to focus on continuous business model innovation and then show you "where" and "how" to work the model in your own company...  But don't think that this book is just another dumbed down, hastily written business book from some wishful management guru. It's not. THE ULTIMATE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE is solidly researched and thoughtfully written. It's a serious book for people who are serious about creating a successful business for the long term. The 3rd chapter alone is one of the best examinations of cost-cutting techniques you'll ever find and well worth the price of the book, but happily the entire book is just as useful, applicable, and valuable, which indeed makes it a rarity. Mitchell and Coles have created one of those infrequent stars in the business book constellation that deserve 'must-read' status. And it's definitely a book you'll want to read before your competitors do.
