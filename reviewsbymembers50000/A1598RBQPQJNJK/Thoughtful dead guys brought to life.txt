 My personal interest in the history of Rome and Ancient Greece led to a desire to learn more about philosophy. I was looking for a good overview of the history and development of philosophy, something simple to understand, yet thoughtful, comprehensive, and engaging. Happily, I discovered Palmer's book and have studied Philosophy regularly ever since. This book provides just the right mix of serious appreciation and humorous perspective on the study of Western philosophy. It examines the major schools and philosophers with enough depth to understand the development of the science, but not enough to overwhelm or, worse yet, bore. Palmer's approach is to make Philosophy not an unreachable, unfathomable science better left to the professional academic, but an engaging and challenging field of study. If you have any interest in Philosophy, this is the book to start with.
