 Steven Saylor's historical mystery is a good read for fans of the genre, especially those attracted to Roman history.  This is the story of Gordianus, a finder (private detective), hired by a youngish Cicero who is defending a man charged with the horrific crime of patricide. The more Gordianus delves into the mystery, of course, the more it unravels until it becomes a tale that touches even the emperor himself. A skilled writer, Saylor takes the reader on a tour through Roman daily life that most will enjoy. His eye for detail is superb, albeit wordy... There are a few occasions where, just as he's picking up the pace, you're thrust into page after page of too-much narrative, as if our narrator Gordianus has all the time in the world to tell his story (which he does not). By the end, however, Saylor finishes the story with enough flair to make you want to see what Gordianus does on his next case. Luckily, this is just the first of a series of Gordianus the Finder books so the history-mystery fan will be able to sate his desire quickly -- and frequently.
