 This first-person tale of a young backwoods farm woman and her husband around the turn of the century is a well written slice-of-life -- as it might have been. Morgan's ear for dialect and turn of phrase make for interesting reading as do his detail in describing the hard-wearing daily life of the mountain poor in the late 1800's. But it's a depressing tale, filled with one one woe after another, and not enough plot development and progression in story or character. For some, the skill and quality of the writing will be enough, but for those who prefer character development and plot, read elsewhere.
