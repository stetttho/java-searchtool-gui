 For a quaint Scottish town there's plenty of murders that take place there. Luckily, the unaspiring by astute constable Hamish Macbeth is on hand once again to woo the ladies, mooch coffee from Priscilla, be a thorn in Inspector Blair's side, and solve the mystery. Beaton's formulaic approach is ever apparent and her supporting characters are laughable, as always, beyond these two faults, however, the writing is much better than in previous stories. Beaton continues to shine and really shows her stuff not when she deals with the murder but as she develops the Macbeth character. In doing that she provides, once more, a light, fun, and well-worth-reading book.
