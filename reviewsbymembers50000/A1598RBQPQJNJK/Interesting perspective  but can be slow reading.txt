 I was disappointed in Burke's writing style. I was hoping it would be much  more breezy, direct, and to-the-point. Perhaps I expected too much, having  been introduced to Burke and CONNECTIONS via the television series.  The  proposal that people, ideas, inventions, and events are connected across  the history of time and man is intriquing. The facts Burke presents are  interesting, yet mired at times in too much detail. The casual,  non-scientifically knowledgable types (like me) face some slow, rough  reading at points.  By the end, though, where Burke ties-in and connects  his major ideas, you'll have enjoyed the trip you took through history....  just be prepared to take your time getting there.
