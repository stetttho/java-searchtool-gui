 Mark Haddon has written a delightfully engaging novel that catches you from the very beginning and slowly pulls you into the odd experience of it's autistic narrator as he endeavors to be a "detective" and discover who killed his neighbor's dog. Along the way he learns the truth about his mother's death and the odd way a father's love can sometimes express itself. Never schlocky or succumbing to sentimentality, THE CURIOUS INCIDENT is funny, touching, and challenging. The audio edition is one of the best audiobooks I've listened to in recent past. Jeff Woodman's performance enhances the story throughout the narrative. Don't be surprised if you find yourself driving out of your way just so you can keep listening.
