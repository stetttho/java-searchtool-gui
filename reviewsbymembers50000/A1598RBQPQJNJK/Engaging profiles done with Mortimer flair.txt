 The man who brought you Titmus and Rumpole tarries briefly with nonfiction in this delightful collection of interviews and profiles of some of Britain's most engaging individuals of the late 20th century. With the same craftsmanship displayed in his novels, Mortimer quickly but deeply probes into the lives and thoughts of political leaders, religious icons, actors, musicians, and writers. Unlike much of today's so-called journalistic profiling, Mortimer approaches his subjects with a respectful distance that allows for more honest reporting and subtler observation. He always keeps the subjects -- and what they say -- as the center of attention. Mortimer fans will not want to miss this one.
