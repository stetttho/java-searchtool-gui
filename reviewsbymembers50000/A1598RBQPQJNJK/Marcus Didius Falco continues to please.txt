 In this third book of the Falco series, our erstwhile "informer" is hired to suss out the intentions of one recently engaged gold-digger whose previous two marriages ended in disaster for her betrothed. But, before Falco can piece the lady's plan together,  her fiancee is killed, the gold-digger's suspectedness is questioned, and a sophisticated lady comes to reside -- for good -- in Falco's new high-society apartment. Davis continues to delight with the Falco series. Humor once again pervades the narration but is much subtler and wittier than ever. The story, too, is more subtle in its development and much more appealing to a mass market audience, not just fans of the genre.  Well written and worth reading.
