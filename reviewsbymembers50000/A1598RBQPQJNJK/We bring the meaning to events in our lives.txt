 That's the core message -- and starting point -- of Scott Sheperd's new book attacking what he calls the "stress myth," the popular belief that stress is some mysterious force that we cannot control, only manage. Sheperd refuses to buy into that theory, and quickly shows how absurd most modern conceptions of stress really are. In a no-bull, plain-speaking style, he shows readers how they can overcome the sense of overwhelm and frustration that "stress" creates. His ideas are not the mere pie-in-the-sky, think-positive-and-it's-all-good ideas, but truly useful approaches that anyone can use to enjoy life more each and every day. One of the best self-help gems of 2002, WHO'S IN CHARGE? is a must-read for those seeking sane, sensible ideas to conquer the stress and control their own lives.
