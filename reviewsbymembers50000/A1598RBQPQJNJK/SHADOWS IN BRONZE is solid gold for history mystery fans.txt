 Lindsey Davis does it again... and better! Didius Falco returns in this second book of the Falco series. Having helped the Emperor solve the plot from SILVER PIGS, Falco is now engaged to do some follow-up work -- disposing of a body or two -- but discovers that things are far from over. Before he knows it, Falco is off, once again, pulling at the threads of rebellion that threaten to unravel the just-settled state of Roman affairs. --And it not just affairs of state that threaten to unravel.... Didius must carefully negotiate his developing relationship with socialite Helena Justina while at the same time assisting his teen-aged nephew (send along to look after Falco) negotiate love and life. Davis proved that her first book was no fluke by crafting another intricate, enticing plot filled with characters that come to life with every word. Her dialog is sharp. Her narration (for the most part) witty and well-paced. Top it off with a lot of attention to historical detail mixed with a dash of anachronistic gumshoe-detecting and what you get is this page-turning delight.
