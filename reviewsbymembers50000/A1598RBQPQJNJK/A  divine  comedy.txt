 When a noted biblical scholar recommended this book, I knew I had to read it. All I can say is "Thank God for biblical scholars!"  Locked in a hotel room by the angel Raziel, Biff writes his gospel of Jesus, from his unique perspective as Jesus' life-long pal and sidekick. As Jesus travels throughout the Middle and Far East -- learning what he must learn to understand and accept his fate as the Son of God -- Biff tags along to avoid hard labor,to keep Jesus out of trouble, oh, and to pickup chicks. Oh well, 2 out of 3 ain't bad...  LAMB is probably the best Bible-inspired comedy since Monty Python's film LIFE OF BRIAN. Irreverent, thought-provoking, laugh-out-loud funny, and even touching, Moore has written THE biblical "buddy film" book (ROAD TO REDEMPTION anyone?) that every fan of great humor needs to read.  It may not save your soul, but it would be a sin to miss out on all the fun.
