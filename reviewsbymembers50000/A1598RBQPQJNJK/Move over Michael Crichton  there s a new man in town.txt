 Just in time for the 21st century, Dan Brown jumps to the top of the mass-market suspense/thriller genre with a handful of intricately plotted and furiously paced novels. The best of these -- despite the incredible sales and longevity of THE DA VINCI CODE -- is by far ANGELS & DEMONS.  Propelling it's lead character (symbologist Robert Langdon) and readers into an enigmatic plot that unwinds page by page, ANGELS & DEMONS touches on science, religion, history, art, architecture... With every turn of the page, you descend deeper and faster into a story in which the very existence of God hangs in the balance. The characters are thin, their motivations and actions are sometimes odd, but the relentless plot pushes you onward. The historical elements are recognizable enough to make you wonder about the truth of these details, but not overbearing. The pace is so quick anyway that you won't have enough time to be slowed down. ANGELS & DEMONS isn't aspiring to be a history lesson, a scientific thesis, or a critical essay, but it DOES aspire, quite successfully, to be a no-rest-for-the weary, no-holds-barred, white-knuckled, page-turner of a thriller. Sometimes that's all you need.
