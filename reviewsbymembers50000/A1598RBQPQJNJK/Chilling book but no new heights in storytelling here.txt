 A personal look at the ill-fated Everest attempts that took the lives of six people in 1996, Krakauer gives his perspective as one of the survivors about the events leading up to and immediately after the event. The true appeal of Krakauer's book for most, of course, is that we get a glimpse of human tragedy up close -- a taste of adventure, a poke at death -- without leaving the comfort of our own little worlds.  It is a sound book, well done and informative, with enough perspective for the non-climber to appreciate the real issues modern high-altitude mountaineering and the dangers they pose. Krakauer's skillful reporting and observation, however, don't provide much sense of storytelling. This keeps what could have been a memorably gripping tale one which is simply worth reading -- but not worth raving.
