 As a fan of public television, an anglophile and an armchair historian (particularly Roman history) -- not to mention a long-time Alex Kingston fan -- I held high hopes for this WGBH produced tale of the brave and brutal Boudicca. Those hopes were dashed in the first few minutes of the program and were never revived. My interest (and worse: the spirit of Boudicca) was brutalized by an incredibly poor script, that was brought to life by trite performances -- the result, I'm sure, of a wandering directorial view. In trying to be a combination of historical drama, historical romance, morality tale, war film, and mystical allegory, WARRIOR QUEEN ends up failing on all counts. It's not good history. It's not entertaining history. And it's simply just not worth watching.
