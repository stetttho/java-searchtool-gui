 While a useful resource for any student of Rome and her history, this book is disappointing. After claiming to focus on spectacle entertainment, Beacham proceeds to discuss at length the history of theatrical entertainment in ancient Rome, from Pompey to Nero. And while some of this discussion is useful to understanding the political context of entertainment, it consumes far too much of the book. The reader, too, is consumed... through erratic writing -- sometimes quick and witty, other times slow and plodding -- and constantly having to flip to the back of the book to read the footnotes (which are often the most interesting bits to learn and so plenty that they could almost be a book themselves) is particularly distracting. Overall, it is an information-laden book that lacks an interesting narrative and never quite develops a point of view beyond simply "lecturing" about the history of Roman theater.
