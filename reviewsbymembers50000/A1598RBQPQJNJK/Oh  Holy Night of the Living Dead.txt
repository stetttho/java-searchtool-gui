 Looking for a Christmas tale that's, well, *different* from all the rest? Then just ask Santa to stuff your stocking with this off-the-wall, squirt-milk-through-your-nose-lauging-out-loud little novel from the comically zesty mind of Christopher Moore.   The subtitle says it all: It's heartwarming. It's a tale of terror (but it is NOT a dessert topping, nor a floor wax).   It has Santa, but he gets whacked -- dead -- with a shovel. It has an angel, but he's not too smart: his mission to grant a Christmas wish quickly runs afoul of the law after he's reported to the local police for stalking the town for "a young boy." It has love. And heartache. And a dope-smoking cop. And a schizophrenic warrior princess who really needs to get back on her meds. Oh, yeah -- it's also got a sunglassed fruit bat. And zombies. Almost forgot the Christmas zombies.  What more could one ask for during the holidays?   Buy the book, read it aloud (to your ADULT loved-ones), and share the joy -- and horror -- of the holidays in this wacky, weird, and always entertaining tale.
