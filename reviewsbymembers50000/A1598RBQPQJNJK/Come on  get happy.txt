 Niven has created a highly readable abstract of the best lessons learned from scientific studies into happiness and life satisfaction. With so much research being done in these areas, it's delightful to see the science applied and presented in a engaging, useful manner. Reading through the brief, concise lessons you'll discover some things you already knew... and a few things you may have wondered about. Plus, you'll get a quick example of how the lesson applies to daily life as well as the reference to the study/research behind each idea.  As a professional life coach, I recommend this book to all of my clients and encourage them to use it as a low-cost, year-long self-improvement course by having them read 2 lessons a week and focusing on applying those lessons in their daily lives.  This little book is a hidden gem in the field of personal development and self-help. Anyone looking for simple, common-sense, EFFECTIVE ideas to improve their lives will want to read this book.
