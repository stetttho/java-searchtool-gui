 I have to admit: this is only the second ONE MINUTE MANAGER book I have read. While I appreciate the brevity and conciseness Blanchard uses in these books, I find the stories he wraps these messages in to be, well, trite. That said, I found THE ONE MINUTE APOLOGY to be of interest enough to overlook that drawback. Sure, it's still a rather silly story delivering the message, but the message itself is solid, rock-solid. A recurring complaint of the ONE MINUTE MANAGER approach is that it routinely over-simplifies complex subjects. Well.... yeah, it does, and thank goodness. Life is complicated enough. Business moreso. What people need, what people want are simple solutions to help them solve problems or at least get STARTED solving a problem. This is where the ONE MINUTE APOLOGY is successful: it takes a very complex (and emotional) issue and gives the reader a very easy step-by-step approach to making amends when it's appropriate and necessary. Is there more to the act of "apologizing"? Are people affected by others' actions more deeply than this book implies? Is it more difficult to really show someone you've offended that you've truly changed your ways? Perhaps. But this book goes a long way in helping people start down the road to reconciliation by offering up a simple way to say "I'm sorry" in a meaningful manner.
