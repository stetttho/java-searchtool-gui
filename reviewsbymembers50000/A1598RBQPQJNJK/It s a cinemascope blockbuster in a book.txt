 As a movie lover, I was intrigued with the theme of this book -- how  movies have shaped our culture, our thinking -- and was prepared for a  heavy, textbook-like reading. As I read, though, I was overwhelmed with  O'Briens style, his sterling craftsmanship in describing the feelings and  emotions of the movies. I would literally stop after every few lines and  shake my head in amazement. As a writer, I am jealous of his skill. As a  reader, I am eager to read it again. Steve Martin said (in L.A. STORY)  that "a kiss may not be the truth, but it's what we wish was the  truth." I do not know if O'Brien's book is THE truth about movies in  the modern mind but, oh, how I hope that it is.
