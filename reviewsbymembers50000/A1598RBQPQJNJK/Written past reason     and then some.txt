 Based on the many positive blurbs from other well-known writers that appeared on the cover, I picked this one up thinking it might be a grand introduction to a great writer I had somehow overlooked all these years. Having read it now, I feel that neither the introduction or the oversight was all that grand. Matheson takes a classic thriller idea -- one man hunts another in the wilderness -- and loses it in a wild, untamed land of unlikable, unbelievable characters and less-than-possible plot twists. Despite being well-written when it comes to style, HUNTED PAST REASON is not written well enough that one suspends all reason or disbelief to get thoroughly lost in the story. If you're hunting for a good thriller, you're on the wrong trail with this one.
