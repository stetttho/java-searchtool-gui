 What can I say?  Crichton writes books that are wild, imaginative, thrilling, and fun. TIMELINE is no exception even if it does borrow the skeleton of JURASSIC PARK. This time around, you've got a rich guy who's busy trying to design theme parks around time travel. He sends a group of archaeologists and historians back in time... where they get stuck in the medieval dark ages, where they must survive for the next few days until they can make it back home. If that's even possible. Crichton wastes no time in getting the story going and, while characterization may be slim, the story races along quickly, pulling the reader forward in time as the characters themselves struggle in a history they've known only through books. A great little romp and a fun little read.
