 Truly a remarkable work and an excellent source for students and arm-chair  archaeologists alike. Short on the hoped-for graphics and illustrations but  long on information, the Oxford Companion proves its worth when one is  looking for an appropriate overview of various archaeological topics. Just  enough cross-referencing to excite one's imagination and more than enough  to whet one's appetite to dig even deeper into archaeology and all that is  has to teach us.
