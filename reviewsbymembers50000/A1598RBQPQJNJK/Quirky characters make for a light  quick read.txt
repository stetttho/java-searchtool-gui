 First of the Hamish MacBeth series, this book introduces the quirky  country constable who -- while not ambitious -- refuses to take a back seat  to the big city Detective Inspector sent to solve Lochdubh's murder. It's  a short, light, quick reading book that centers on the characters moreso  than the murder. Luckily, Beaton's dialog is snappy, enough so that you can  overlook some two-dimensionality in supporting characters and some all too  heavy-handed contrivance plot-wise. Then too, the Hamish MacBeth character  is so very interesting and well thought, that whatever character flaws  there may be in the book, you don't care as long as you can spend some time  with MacBeth.... ....And you do get to spend most of the last half of the  book with MacBeth, puzzling out the mystery and scrounging free tea and  sandwiches from the locals. Not a bad way to spend day.
