 Beaton continues to delight with her quaint Hamish MacBeth series.  This time around, Hamish spends Christmas on a tiny Scottish Island to help the friend of a friend... who's worried that she'll soon be harmed. Soon enough, there's a dead body, all right, but it's not who you expect and Hamish must solve the crime. As with other stories early in this series, the incidental characters are paper-thin, but MacBeth, Priscilla and the Lochdubh regulars are nicely fleshed out and Beaton's writing makes for a fast yet fun read.
