 I'll admit it: I normally avoid the highly-touted, Sunday suplement reviewed, novels of "literature." I happened across a radio interview with Author Yann Martel as he answered questions about LIFE OF PI, became intriqued, and decided to read it. I was quite pleased. Okay, more than pleased. This is one of those books that is so well crafted, so intricately plotted, so challenging in it's theme and tone, that by the time you're done reading it, all you can say is, "Wow!" Early in the book, the main character claims that this story will prove the existence of God... I don't know about that, but it's a story that accomplishes what great art of any type does: it sneeks up on you with its beauty and form, and then it gets you thinking.  A true masterpiece, LIFE OF PI will stir up your mind and never let you forget that you read it.
