 At first when i obtained this album the impression the music gave me was of a throwaway.  It didn t get through to me, the way it did a few months later. This album by P T is pretty good.  In fact it is one of their best.  From an objective point of view I have to say that out of the 10 songs that grace this record.  3 are not my cup of tea.  The others are purely intelligent, and well crafted pieces (i.e  `How is your life today, Russia on ice, shesmovedon) An interview on the p t web site asked Steve wilson how he came up with the music for his songs, and his response was `sometimes weeks can go by without a single decent piece of music, but then all of the sudden 3 songs are formed.'  He then went on and said that 2 or 3 of the songs on Lightbulb sun were done this way, or also on the road in hotel rooms etc. Being a big fan of this band i have to say that after `Signify' the band to my opinion suffered somewhat of a distrophy in musical terms.  Objectively, the albums such as `Up the downstair', or the sky moves sideaways which were easier to listen, and that you `got' them right away had come to an end. What i am trying to say is that although P T has changed musically, they are still an excellent band to listen to, or see live if you can, keeping in mind that their musical style has changed.
