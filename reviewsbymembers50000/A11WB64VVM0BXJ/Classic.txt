 This album is great.  There are timeless songs here as well as on other SP Pumkpins albums.  The ones here are very good quality, and stand out from what I think is a band that sounded like them did, and no one else. The highlits i have to say are Obscured, Starla, blue and spaced.  The faster heavier numbers don t really excite me but were part of the Pumpkins' sound when this was recorded.  This deserves 5 stars. J G
