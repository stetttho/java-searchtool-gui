 This is a great album.  For someone who likes Pink Floyd, you will enjoy this.  It is wonderful from beginning to end.  The opener 'The music you are listening to...' is a great start to this CD.  Followed by 'Synesthesia' and 'Always never', the band plunges into music bliss the way I think The Grateful Dead or other bands may have done in the past.  This band has no similarity with the Grateful Dead but the way they meld these songs together only reminds me of the best (who was the Grateful Dead).  Songs like Not beautiful anymore and 'Small fish' follow.  'Small fish' goes into 'Burning Sky', which is another 5 star song. If you like progressive music and/or PF, please give these guys a try.  You will be forever pleased.-
