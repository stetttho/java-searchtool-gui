 This to me was well, in reality the second to last dead record to come out of the studios, and one of the strongest and well crafted.  Yeah, people might say, how can you compare this to 'Terrapin Station' or the older records, but at the time this band was up to interesting song writing.  All the songs on this album later became key tunes in their live performances (A Touch of grey, Hell in a bucket, West L.A. ..).  Aside from the excellent production that went into this record, it sounds beautiful every time I hear it on my stereo. For some Heads who thought they were veering into a redundant sort of musical territory (were the fan would be bored w/ what the band would put out), I think this album only made even stronger the commitment one had as a fan to and for this band. May you enjoy this classic Cd made by some of the best musicians the United States had and still has. Thanks.
