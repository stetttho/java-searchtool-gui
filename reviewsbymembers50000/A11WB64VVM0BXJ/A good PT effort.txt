 Porcupine Tree manage to make a great album with Voyage 34.  It was originally released in vinyl so it is nice to see it in cd. What I lke about this cd is that Steve Wilson, along w/ the musicians that accompanied him in this disc, make great music.  Some say it resembles Pink Floyd, but I think that aside the obvious resemblence it has sometimes, the music shines through the way only this group could do it.  Wilson manages some good guitar solos, and the melodies that make up most of the disc are really good. Good for an early offering.. What I did not like about this album is the excessive narrating.  Other than that this CD is a masterpiece deserving all 5 stars.
