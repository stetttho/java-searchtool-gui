 This was tadream s answer to Klaus schulze s cyborg in 1972.  Bothe Schulze s Cyborg and 'zeit' - by tadream - are works that deserve very high acclaims. Both albums are written in movements (4 pieces).  And both albums clock in at around 74 minutes.  Schulze, being a double disc clocks in at like 80 - 85. What else to say.  Amid all the stale as dish soap music that churns out of the speakers now a days, Tadream managed to make a super sweet album.  Words really come very close to describing it.  There are experiments done w organ and moog synthesizer, but that i haven t heard anyone make them sound the way they do here.  Listen to the title track or to 'Nebulous dawn'.  You'll be amazed at the awesome patterns and textures of analog electronic sound that progresses and evolves into 15 minute plus pieces that leave you AT THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT. I m not kidding; please try this album. It is a very respectful registry or reminder of what rockers were doing in the 1970 s in Europe.  Because in the U.S. we had another type of music evolving which weas excellent but different in genre.  'Zeit' is ambient electronica, meant to be listened w a very fine ear. Come on, give it a shot.
