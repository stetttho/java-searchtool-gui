 What wonderful offering from this band.  Ancient album, but remastered and w an extra track. The time period when this was made was characterized for using great sounding flutes, and on the second tune 'fly and collision of comas sola' we get treated to beautiful flutes. The first and third songs are very good.  The last - Ultima thule - great.  A single that is and was very hard to find, but now you have it here on the CD.  A GREAT tune.  Enjoy this. JG
