 This book is wonderful.  I'm chilean by birth, livd in the u s for 14 years, but i have a i guess an american opinion on the book and a chilean.  It is good.  The story is well told, and tells the interesting Trueba family.  Very animated.  It is a story very interestingly told from a point of view of someone who had lived in Chile during the time of the military coup in 1973.  That, for me is very valuable.  For me, it is the most important or most interesting anecdote of this book, is that it was written in a space of time which refelected that era, and for chile it determined its future.  The military coup in chile had mixed opinions, but that comment is for another book.  The good thing about 'House of the spirits' is that it is told by one of the best latin american authors that write books today, and it is a book worth reading for any person of any taste. Thanks.
