 This album is a very underrated and very good effort by a band that in the late 80 s was part of a massive arrival of new bands into the music market in North America and the rest of the world.  I remember another good band that impressed me at that time and was Nuclear assault.  Brilliant musicians.  Anyhow, this album is a very good follow up to Punishment for decadence which is a masterpiece.  In No more color, the band further explores and deepens their yet excellent heavy sound.  Objectively speaking, the brilliance in this album comes in side two.  I say this because I purchased the vynil back in 1989 or 90.  Mistress of Deception, Tunnel of pain and Last entertainment are musical heaven.  And that s what most of us look for  = )
