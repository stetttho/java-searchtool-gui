 This cd along w 'What a long strange trip it s been' were the first two dead cd s i heard as a beginner in the music.  It was a perfect cd to hear in those cold february Iowa mornigs before heading to class (12th grade).  Then they recomended me what a long strange trip.  And those two cd s were the ones to get me hooked on this band.   I went on to see them 6 times ( This was 1992.  Saw 17 Furthur shows altogether between 96 and 98, and am still a huge admirer of this group of musicians. Go ahead, pick this cd up if you re starting up w this band, and then go get What a long strange trip it s been.
