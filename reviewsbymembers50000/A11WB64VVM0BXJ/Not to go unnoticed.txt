 I think this is a fairly good Genesis album.  If we're talking about the 70's era before P Gabriel 's departure.  This CD, along w Nursery Cryme, The lamb... and Selling England are keepers.  Genesis at the time of the recording of this CD was graced with the ability to create wonderful Prog.  Very well textured and executed.  Very similar to what Italian Prog groups Premiata Forneria Marconi and Leor Me - among others - had been achieving up to now. 'Foxtrot' is so strong.  Steve Hackett's acoustic guitar will melt you in Horizons.  The opener 'Watcher of the skies' is a prog classic that almost 30 years later, speaks with authority. The rest of the album is pure brilliance.  I reccomend this album to any newbie in the prog genre, or if anyone hasn't listened to this CD yet, give it a try, because it is one of the best early Genesis records.  = )
