 This cd es good.  2 cd's w/ excellent music made by one of the most respected musicians in the ambience genre, Klaus Schulze. I'll say one thing here because someitmes i'm not really into making a real long review, this 2 cd set is one of the best works he did/does.  And the first song Synphara was simply my favorite, the other three very good too (!). I recommend it = ) 3 1/2 *
