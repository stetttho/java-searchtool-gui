 R Fripp is capable of doing things other guitarists can t create.  But then again there is something every guitarist has that makes him / her unique or original.  In this disc we have four movements.  Be aware that these movements happen in a way that it is very musically succesful.  The first, is a very ugly or horrifying sounding experience.  Just read the song segments - which I ll share w you because they are not listed: a gnashing of teeth, Wailing I, Wailing II.  Those are some examples of what the song titles are.  The ugly and horrifying obviously have a positive to it.  You have to make your evaluation having listened to the entire disc.  The second song, The gates of paradise is one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard.  It s stunningly beautiful.  On the third movement, we go back to hell, and some of the most hellish sounds I have heard made out of a guitar.    It is known that Fripp was and is a big admirer of James Marshall hendrix.  R Fripp has said that his playing is somewhat of a continuing of what J Hendrix would have done had he lived longer.  I sometimes think listening to this disc that it s Fripp, but the Hendrix passion is there.    Anyhow, the fourth song is a return to harmony, and again Mr Fripp leaves me speechless at the capability to show you hell, then heaven, then hell again, and at last, musical beauty.  Mr Fripp s guitar playing on these soundscapes Cd s have a resonance of ambience music.  His guitar sounds like 4 synthesizers at once at times.  Ambience music is one of the finest - objectively speaking - genres in our planet.  It soothes and relaxes.  It is a perfect way to contrast the beautiful ambience with the other ' darker ' pieces.  This cd carries Fripps trademark playing and style.  One that to some folks is difficult to understand or figure out, and to others is just another guitarist.
