 Let me try and give this record some justice.  It s not the favorite Dead in the studio by consensus in the GD community.  It is although the fruit of many tunes that came to be monsters and legendary songs in shows.  2nd sets to be exact. How can you not enjoy the one of 3 (?) versions of World to give the boys did at Winterland in Oct. 78.  Well, the original is here, and sometimes the album version has the dedication and care that you don t get live.  At least that s in the eyes of European record collectors.  The Dead s laboratory was onstage, but these tunes still sound great here.  Very disco, but like I said, they became unforgetable numbers to hear live (Fire, MIracle, Stagger lee to name a few). Plus the whole concept of Shakedown St. was just SO part of our culture, the Deadhead's that made it to as many shows as we could.  When we arrived at a show, the Shakedown was in progress, and we could purchase anything from killer t shirts to beers you wouldn t find in Indiana to give an example  = ) So aside from the great tunes, I think the art is pretty funky for the album too  = )   Get it !  = )
