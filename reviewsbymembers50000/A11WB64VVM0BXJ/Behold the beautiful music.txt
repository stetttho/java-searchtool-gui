 The two songs here flow together perfectly.  Clocking in at around 15 minutes each.  This album is a tremendous step forward for this group (or was), and probably will be remembered for a long time to come, also for influencing many musicians of the electronica genre and also others (i.e. Porcupine Tree). Being a fan of this type of music I find a maturing in the music s sound from the beginning records up to this one.  Zeit was definitely the second strongest record made between 1970 and 1975 (this is only my opinion).  And Rubycon goes up to Numero 1. I see no pointless or sub par playing on rubycon.  This band IMHO rarely made an uninspred record.  That would be a cowardly thing to say (that they did).  Maybe some of the ones they did in the 80 s or 90 s were much different than the Kosmiche musik classics made in the early to mid 70 s, but they remained inspired.   I believe this band is one of the strongest in its genre that exists or existed.  Please, go buy yourself this record, or I would also recommend Zeit or Alpha centauri to begin your musical experience w this heavyweight of electronica groups that ever made music on this planet.
