 This show cooks, but beware of the excessive video effects.  It s true, the Dead played a very good show on 14.06 '91 as were many of the summer 91 performances but we get a not so welcome surplus of trippy or artsy video during some of the best song passages during the show.  It s not fair to criticize the video like this, but we all know that these dvd s and vhs s are as they were at the actual concert.  So, really there's not much one or anyone can do.  Actually the effects start toward the second set, but careful, they irritate a bit.  The bonus footage from RFk '90 is very good.  I have to congratulate the person or probably team of engineers or archivists who decided to add that to this VFTV II.  All in all though (cheesy effects and all) this is worth owning and buying it or recommending it to any friend that will know how to appreciate it.
