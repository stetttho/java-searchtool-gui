 As someone mentioned, after many listenings, you can get quite a bit out of this beautiful digi pack cd.  Also as someone mentioned, much ambient / atmospheric music has come out in the last 35 years, but these two maestros hit the note pretty well on this one.  If I am not wrong, Evening star ( 1975 ) was the last fripp & eno album col.  Fripp has been very busy with his music proyects, as well as B. eno.  I try and see the sense of calling it, Equatorial stars.  The artistic direction has a cool map of stars covering most of the record.  On really hectic days - Im a business manager - I get home, and when I have time I can listen to something real good, and hopefully be ' cured ' = )  I tried it no too long ago with this album, and it worked.  Beautiful and biorythmic ambience ( like Eno does always ) with help from none other than a great like R Fripp.  I think this should be in any serious music listeners library ( however big or small ); and should be observed as something very well done by giants in the genre.  Cheers Robert Fripp and Brian Eno.  Thanks for something that many of us music fans would dub as ' just exactly perfect '
