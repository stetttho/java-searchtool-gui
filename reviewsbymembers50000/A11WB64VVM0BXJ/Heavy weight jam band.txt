 I d like to make an honest review of this album.  I think it is good, but one of the less strong or weak offerings this band has done or offered. Aint life grand, everyday, or space wrangler are albums that are keepers for WP.  But for me 'Til the medicine takes' sounded like a regurgetated version of their material they did live, up to the poiint of the record's release.  Released in 1999, after their strong '98 summer and fall tours, we get the material we ve heard at the shows.  Sorry to sound anti WP - they re a great band - but when the record came out it began to feel as though this band was giving an answer to a record industry machine that "makes" bands do records. I think part of the WP formula is to have a fresh sound, and not to sound repeated or over played.  Maybe the music industry and their 'producers' who are the musicians are going through a small oxidation process.  Because we can t have more and more records come out just because of contracts.  NOW, if WP really dug making this album and back it up, then I GIVE THEM ALL MY BLESSINGS AND ENERGY, because few musicians now a days, i d say 40 % make music, because they like to.  The rest are just following a mindless album selling formula just to make quick cash. I give Til the medicine takes 5 stars, because i think it is the most mature WP studio album yet. Peace.
