 I think it is proper to write a review on this 2 cd album by the Dead.  It is one of the good records they did.  The first disc is a true gem, w/ classic versions of Ramble on, B E Woman & J Straw.  The 2nd cd is good also, but for me not as much as the 1st.  If by comparison, I would say that the new 'steppin out' cd is probably more of the same material you hear on this album, but for some reason they wanted to release it 30 years later.  The reason being that the material is of choice quality performance, and sound. Europe '72 the album shouldn t be an omition on your collection.  If a newby to the Dead s music, this is a good start.  It is strong fresh Grateful Dead that will probably get your liking for them.  Either way, this album is between 4 1/ and 5 stars.
