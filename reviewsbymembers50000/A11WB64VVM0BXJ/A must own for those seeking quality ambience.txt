 This is my first Vidna Obmana album, and I must say I was blown away by the sheer genious of the songwriting.  Having R Rich and S Roach as guests made it even very enjoying.  I am an avid Ambient / Electronic fan and I must say that this album is in a world of its own.  It is the perfect 'relax' disc after a hard day of work.  There are electronic synthesizer patterns that I hear Steve Wilson ( Headphone dust label ) do w his project Bass Communion - especially the first album.  I haven t found many maestros capable of manipulating the synthesizaers and other electronic elements to make the music we hear on this record, and on Wilson s first Bass Communion ( which I also strongly recommend ).  And the titles chosen for the music are very appropriate.
