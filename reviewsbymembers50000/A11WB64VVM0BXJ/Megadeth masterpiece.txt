 Much stronger than Peaces sells, So far,, is a good start to getting into this band.  I recommend this over 'Peace sells' because the quality of the tunes is much higher.  To my liking 'PS' doesn t even deserve a rating.  Anyhow, this album is good.  The entire thing is good.  'Into the lungs of hell' gets it off to an excellent start (instrumental), then Set the world afire bursts into awesome guitar work by D Mustaine and J Young.  Anarchy in the UK follows; very strong and PUNCHY.  Track 4 Mary Jane A +.  Then In my darkest hour, 'liar' and hook in mouth.  And lets not forget 502. A + album.  I don think Megadeth reached the level of playing they did here.  In Rust in peace they came close, but this was my FAVORITE Megadeth line up.  Get this. Enjoy of course : )
