 I obtained this double cd in a time period that was very appropriate.  I saw my first Phish show on 20th Oct '95 in CR, Ia.  A wonderful fall night were Phish blew me away w a performance to remember for very long. I was a Dead head so went with lots of skepticism.  Had listend to this band on and off for a couple of years.  When the Dead quit playing, there was a void that needed to be filled. The show on 20 th Oct '95 and the Madison WI Oct 24th show from the same year, sent me into an absolute bliss of experience, that I will remember on and off forever.  WAY FINE MUSIC. Anyway, lets get to this double cd.  It was the first forray of Phish into Live music at a commercial level.  And it was a very solid outing.  The first disc is classic.  Throughout we get awesome Phish.  The second disc also, but I stayed a big fan of the Phirst one. Well, I went on to see this band 4 more times up to fall '97.  Taped them twice.  Now I live in Chile, South America, very far from a Phish show, but when I think of this cd, I get very cool memories of when I was 20 Years old, heading down to CR to see them.  It was a rainy fall night.  Very Iowan.  And the show also gave lots of quality music. 5 stars. = )
