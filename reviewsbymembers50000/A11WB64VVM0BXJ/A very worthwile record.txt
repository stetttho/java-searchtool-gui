 This is a great work by B Weir.  It has been nearly 20 or 25 years since this but it still has its moments. Some songs became nuggets played by the Dead live, and some that he did w his own live projects.  I like this much more than the Kingfish record.  I think that one stinks.  This is the one to pick up. Sorry for the strong critic Bobby, but that record just didn t get to too many fans. J G
