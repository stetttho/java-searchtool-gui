 This is one of the most beautiful cd s I know of.  We have songs here like Box of Rain and Attics.. which are and were excellent tunes that this band played live.  I mean, when they did Attics, I think even they got a big kick out of it.  I like most of the dead's material, but there is some that is stale to my liking.  More power to this band, they created some great music but some of it like most things that arent perfect were somewhat stale. Back to this album.  This album and Workingman's Dead were like the two albums that this band made that showed they were developing good skills at singing.  The singing here is of a very good level. This cd is timeless.  I think 20 years from now they will listen to it and get something out of it.   5 stars.
