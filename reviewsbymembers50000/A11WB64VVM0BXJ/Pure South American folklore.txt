 It is nice to be able to be the first to review this album.  It is a historic record of Los Jaivas.  It is some of the most heart felt Chilean folklore music.  Also, very importantly on this album you get to see the true talent and craft all band mebers have and had.  Guitarist Eduardo Alquinta and keybiard player Claudio Parra.  This album will enguld you from the first track on through the rest of the album.  It is the type of record which you can listen through without even thinking twice about turning it off.  Brilliant music. Of special mention are 'Oye ninita', 'Todos Juntos' and 'Indio hermano'. If you are a newcomer to South american music in the folklore genre, Los Jaivas is one fo the more important groups.  Being a native of Chile I invite all to try this album.  It s very good.
