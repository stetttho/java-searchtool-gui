 This album is good because it captures this bands initial stage as said in the cd s description ( 92 - 98 ).  The newer material of LB is fantastic ( Lumina ).  But personally I just find it great to have songs like Viajar, Mataz anf flotar es caer in one.  In the present music market, this band offers very FRESH material.  They are like Porcupine Tree of the UK.  All if not most material the release is superb and genious work.    Que dios les de mucha vida.
