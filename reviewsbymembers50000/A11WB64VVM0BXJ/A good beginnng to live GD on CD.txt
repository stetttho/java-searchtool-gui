 This is a highly recommended cd now that it includes a full Blues for Allah, and one of the few shows played by this band in 1975 that included new songs from the upcoming album (Blues..) I own Two from the vault, and have to say that that one is excellent too.  But the reason to obtain One from the vault is to enjoy what the Grateful Dead sounded like in 1975, along w a great soundboard recording.   There are some standard GD favorites here as well (Sugaree, Big river, Goin down the road feelin bad). This was an excellent start to the Live GD show CD s that were to begin coming out with greater frequency in years to come. The most important thing is that aside from being some music played by some guys in the 70 s who were known to have some dangerous lifestyles, this music lives on as a good registry of what North American music sounded in those times; taking into account that this group is one of the few that tackled down real life issues and put them into their songs.  Sometimes ironically, and sometimes w a twist of GD humor.
