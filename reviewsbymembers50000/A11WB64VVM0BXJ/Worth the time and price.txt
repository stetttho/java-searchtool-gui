 I might as well write this in English.  Since this site is viewed mainly by english speaking readers. This book is not surprisingly a Very good work by G G Marquez.  It is well crafted throughout, and does not bore easily like other books in Spanish (there are lots).  It is so well written that you will remember it 5 and 10 years from the first chance. The othern reviews tell very well what happens in the story.  It tells our Latin American cutlure very well, from its names, sounds and traditions/folklore.  I am going to purchase 'Amor en tiempos de colera', which is sadi to be a book created as  sort of sequel to this one. Santiago Nasar , and the Vicaria family, along with the rest of the inhabitants of the Colombian town in which the book takes place will startle you as one of the best cronicles written, at 105 pages only.
