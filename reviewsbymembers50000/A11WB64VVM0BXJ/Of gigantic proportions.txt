 This is a very powerful record.  Considering that this album follows in the direction that Timewind, Mirage and later Body Love II and I instigated; Klaus pulled off as Klaus D. Mueller says 'Masterpiece # 3'.   Schulze uses very wisely all instruments in his arsenal.  Organs, Moogs, analog synthesizers.  Only Schulze was able (not very many others came close) to produce such beautiful and twisted music.   We are treated on this double album to six biographies of German thinkers (Fredrick Nietzsche, Heinrich Von Kleist, Friedmann Bach, i.e.). In my objetive opinion this double album is no more than Timewind or Mirage - which are supposed to be the other two awesome efforts by Schulze.  Again in my objective opinion Mirage doesn't get to me, and I prefer Body Love II far beyond 1977's Mirage.  Just read my review of Mirage to see my full notion. All is not perfect even in Mr Schulze's electronic world, but on this double album ALL cylinders click and take you to places unthought of by human perception. 5 well desrved stars.  I hope Mr. Schulze can grasp what I'm saying here.
