 To hear that this record is badly composed is not a very mature or realistic thing to say.  This album was done in 1979, one year after the subpar 'Cyclone'.  Force Majeure conjures the energy TD had up to around 75 - 76 which I started to see fade away following 'Ricochet' or 'Rubycon'. In comparison, this album accomplishes what was very difficult to do in 1977 and 78.  Which was make a successful record.  Don t get me wrong; the 1976 Sorcerer soundtrack is great, but they fell into some sub par playing in that period.  Which is quickly plaed in comparison by the pre 75-76 material (Phaedra, Rubycon, Atem, Alpha centauri and on..) I first heard this album on a cassette copy (done on a 3 head Sony deck) straight from an excellent copy vinyl.  The sound captured is amazing, considering my friend's tape was recorded some 8 years ago. Of interesting mention too is that I first heard this album starting with the second side (cloudburst flight, and Metamorphic rocks, and then Force majeure).  I tend to repeat this medley most of the times I hear this album. I recommend it to anyone who has read on up to now, and I'm sure has a good eye (or ear) for good ambient/atmospheric music.
