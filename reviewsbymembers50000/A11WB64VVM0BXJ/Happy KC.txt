 I beleive this is some of the most surprising music KC has put out, as far as being 90s or 2000 and beyond material.  The Projekcts are very interesting.  The 90s albums Thrak and Construction of light, are ok; not the best this band has done.  Very disciplined music, but different than the 80 s material and obviously the 70s. What can I say, the songs are very good.  Deserving 5 stars each (except for construction of light).  They played very well on the Tool tour; this cd is proof of that.  Adrian Belew, Fripp, Mastelotto and Trey Gunn keep on surprising w intersting music (as opposed to boring). I highly recommend this.  Buy it  : )
