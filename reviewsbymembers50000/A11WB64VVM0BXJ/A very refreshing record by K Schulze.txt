 First of all, I think it is wise to define for the new listener what music K Schulze does.  K Schulze does experimental music, which he s done since the early 70 s w/ guitarist Manuel Gottsching in as hra tempel.  Mr Schulze focuses more on keyboards, and other accesories like computers, and different types of keyboards to create the sounds he wants or attempts to achieve. On this double cd, it is done very well.  There are 95 minutes of music total on this album.  The first disc is a mix of different sorts of sounds.  Even I think, sounding like different styles from different parts of the world.  There is lots of percussion, and lots of experimental keyboard.  To my liking the song Amourage really wins two thumbs up for taking over the identity of this disc (the first one).  On disc two, we have to big songs, Spielglocken, & sebastian im traum.  Spielglocken is a very cool song (Way nice arrangement throughout).  Very enjoyable. The last song Sebastian Im traum is the song that takes the cd  away.  It is a song that shows you the incredible degree or level of arranging that this man has.  Artists like Robert rich come close on this type of music, and succeed in their own offerings and efforts, but Sebastian.. will leave you amazed at the skill that it took to arrange the song and to execute it, to sound like the wrath of god coming at you. Awesome record.
