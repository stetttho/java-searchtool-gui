 I think it is necessary to give a review of this album.  More than 10 years have passed since i heard it, and it s a really 'good' album.  B Corgan does things w Zwan now but this is remembered. There are so many influences here.  It sounds like true Pumpkins, but we have some Floyd, Hendrix, etc.  Crush sounds like it borrowed a bit from Meddle and Atom Heart mother of PF, and other songs here well sound nothing like any other group.   This is an album of all hits.  I was 16 when i first heard it back in '91, now i'm 27 and it feels like it has a timeless quality to it.  I feel i'll be 35 and 45 and i'll get it out to hear it. Cheers to this band.   4 1/2 stars
