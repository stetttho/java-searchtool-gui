 Reviewing this album is like being given the chance to let you know why you enjoy life. This album is so good, there are many reasons for that.  #1  It is strong as opposed to weak.  I ve heard very few bands.  Maybe since the early 70 s that use their instruments so acoustically.  Getting the most out of them.  # 2  The tunes are the greatest quality i ve heard.  Signify would have to be an album that comes close to SD. I ve heard critics of people (constructive ones) saying that it wasn t a good idead that after 1995, the year their album 'the sky moves sideaways' came out, the band went into a more song oriented format.  This is true, but they are some of the best 4 and 5 minute tunes you'll probably hear.  If you want long, uninterrupted passages try Tangerine dream or ash ra tempel.  But for quality music that resembles the long exploratory style of songs, try this album.  You only have to look back at the sky moves sideaways to have long awesome exploratory type songs. So i think this band gives you the best of both worlds:  Long improvised and arranged material (their earlier offerings), and very well arranged shorter ones w the later albums.
