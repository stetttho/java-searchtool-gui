 This is a great Maiden record.  I first purchased it when I was 14 back in 1989 on LP.  Now 14 years later I still enjoy this great release from one of Britain s finest bands. The UK has been the birth place of many of my favorite bands (i.e. Genesis, King crimson).  Iron maiden was a band that went through many different phases but on this album, and many that came before this, they were breaking new ground in their genre. This very powerful album starts w Moonchild.  Nice upbeat number w the whole band clicking on all cylinders.  Then we come down to Infinite dreams, which picks up pretty good towards the end. The album continues in this fashion w trademark Steve Harris bass, and the guitars of D. Murray and A. smith.  I reccomend this album because it is one of the best in my opinion that this band made, but also because it can be accepted by different peoples of different likes of music.
