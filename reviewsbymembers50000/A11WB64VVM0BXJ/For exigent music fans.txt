 I like this dvd.  It is really good, considering they included 6 songs from an Oct 87 show at Shoreline.  The Summer 90 performance here is good.  Before I get further into explaining 'good' i must say the band looks a bit lazy.  But in good spirits.  Since my other favorite band is Yes, I am used to seeeing more interaction between the musicians.  But don t get me wrong.  I saw 6 GD shows and own 1000 hrs of their material (as an enthusiast) and the interaction that they would engage in normally was darn good.  The China Cat > rider is a strong point.  Also the Baby Blue encore.  Additonally Big boss man is great to see in a year where it didn t get much rotation.  Big River is also a standout.  Furthermore the opener LTGTR > trucking is much full of energy.  It would be nice if GD productions would release some more 'vintage' material (if it exists).  I and others would be really thrilled to see some 1971 or '72 material on video.  Thanks.
