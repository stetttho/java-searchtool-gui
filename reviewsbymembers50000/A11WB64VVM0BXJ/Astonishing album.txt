 The year that this record was recorded was 1973 (Sept - Oct).  It was marketed three years later (Jan. 1975).  Personally I think it was a bit ahead of its time for 1973, so it waited a bit for the masses to be able to grasp the album. I dont think they would've understood it had it been released in '73.  Germany was a breeding ground for high quality electronic music.  Kraftwerk was beginning their career.  tangerine Dream was already underway quite well.  And K Schulze (who performed in the first T Dream album) was no exception. His first album Irrlicht marked his musical proposition.  Then came 'Cyborg', a mamoth album that will amaze for many years to come.  It's surprising that it still astonishes people when they hear it.  The third album Black dance, was in my objective opinion the 'preparation' for the 4th release 'Picture music'.  Black Dance was like the calm before the storm (without overshadowing it).  Following Picture music came Masterpiece # 1, Timewind.  Picture Music is like the Intro to Timewind.  Klaus matures musically and goes in a direction that would lead him to digital recording (Dig it 1980).  In short, Picture music is a quality record that should be purchased and enjoyed.  The listener will hear in later albums from the 80's and 90's (and now 00's), some of the pivotal sounds and textures that were first tapped with Picture Music.  It is a legendary album.  One that will be remembered for very long, for marking Klaus' sound in a traditional and original way.
