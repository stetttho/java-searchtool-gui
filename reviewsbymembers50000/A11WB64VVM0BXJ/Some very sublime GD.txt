 This album is full of classics.  You have the soft, yet sweet High time' which christened quite a dead set as centerpiece or respectable song that gave way to dead sets to remember for ever (i.e. 7 20 94 Deer creek, 6 27 85 Saratoga nY).   Uncle John s became a great 2nd set tune that gave way to some of the most beautiful impriovisation I ve heard from this band (Uncle J s > Playin, or UJB > Jam, or the case of new year s 87 Bucket > UJB, what a blowout !! : ) ) Dire wolf, a strong 1st set number that gave sets identity, depending where the show is played.  Gorgeous song. New Speedway, a great 2nd set big player.  Coming in at my favorite the 2 19 95 show in SLC which i attended.  More of this song, the 6 28 92 Noblesville IN show where we got lay me down > El Paso > New speedway.  Those are the NSB s I remember. strong, full of good playing, and leaving the crowds happy at your show. The rest of the songs here on Workingman s Dead, Black Peter, Cumberland B s, Easy Wind, and Casey Jones are songs to leave you content with good lyrics, and what I call a good attempt at North American Folklore in songs.
