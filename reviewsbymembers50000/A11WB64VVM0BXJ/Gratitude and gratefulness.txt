 This is a very good album with very mature playing from S Wilson, T Bowness and a handful of excellent musicians.  Michael Bearpark, a very good guitar player gives us an excellent lead on the first tune (title track).  The Space bass of Peter Chilvers also comes in good on 2 or three tracks.  Roger Eno contributes with Harmonium in 'Photographs of Black & white'.  Wilson and Bowness collected recordings done between 2001 and 2003 to give us the great record this is; considering it follows the powerful Returning Jesus of 2002.  A very mature record for very mature audiences.  Hats off in a Big way to S. Wilson and T Bowness for this stellar album.
