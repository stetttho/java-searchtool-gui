 This is a good box set.  Where can I start ? There are a number of songs here that hadn't been released in any format, let alone by tape traders.  I think this box set is a good sign in tha the Dead slowly but surely will reveal some of their best work they did.  On this that si shown.  Good versions of songs like Estimated Pr., Eyes of the World, and Terrapin station.  The nice thing is on disc one you get treated to classic dead from the 65 - 67 period w/ some songs that just didnt make up your collection before and now you have them.  It is chronological.  5 cd's starting in the beggining - 60's - and up to the 90's. Get it, because i dont think you ever heard a stufio version of believe it or not.  or rehearsals of days between & lasy raver rd. The Grateful dead were a good band, but let's not also over rate the band.  They did great thing bu there are other bands also that marked people in the 60's, 70's and up to the 90's.  What the dead did for me, reflecting back on the 6 shows I saw from 94 - 95 was give me musical satisfaction and them being a quality north american band (the best).  So come on, how about releasing 7 - 21 - 94 as a Dicks Picks (my first show). = ) I got a little side tracked here.  Let me get back to the box set.  It is worth the price, and full quality.  Get it.
