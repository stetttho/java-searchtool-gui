 I like this cd because it builds on the latter kc release, 'In the court...' and extends to further musical realms only this band could go/achieve. 'Pictures of a city' is marvelous.  Nice and developed.  'Cadence and cascade' too.  Excellent work bringing in singer Gordon haskell.  The rest of the album really stands out good including 'the devil's triangle'. I reccomend this cd because King Crimson is and was a group which took risks on recordings that gave good results.
