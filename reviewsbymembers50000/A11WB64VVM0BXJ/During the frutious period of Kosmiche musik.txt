 I thought Atem wasn t nearly the musical 'work' done on Zeit.  It is good.  It is like the soft aftermath of the HUGE Zeit.   The positive things of Atem ar the title track; long and full of interesting compositions.  The soft theme continues w Fauni Gena.  Soft and at the same time, drawing on some sounds and instruments as the first track.  The third track 'Circulation of events'.  It is somewhat reminiscent of the music done on Zeit but very original and very refreshing. Finally the Wahn, which translated to English means Mania, is just that.  A very crazy sounding track that I would leave you to listen and give your thoughts on. This is a essential TD record to own.
