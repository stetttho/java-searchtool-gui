 The Grateful Dead with Wake of the flood came into new territory as this was released in 1973.  They entered into a new style of `Dead' and left the country-ish material of Workingman's Dead and American beauty and set right into a more Jazzy style.  The shows from 1973 depct this big change because the style of them departed from what was the Dead's typical Other One/Truckin/Wharf Rat/Sugar Magnolia 2nd sets of 71 and 72 (but 72 more varied) into varied, articulate, and diverse 1973 musical maturity. The songs here in WOTF like Stella Blue, Weather Report Suite, and Eyes of the world breathe new life into the Dead's repertoire. The folowing years, 1974, 75, 76, and 77 saw these songs grow and flourish in their live shows.  In 1973,   Eyes of the world became a big song int their 2nd sets (Check out Dicks Picks Volume 1 - 12.19.73). All in all from a great band like the Grateful Dead these songs remained alive for years and years to come and could be heard at shows up to the 90's.  How could you not've enjoyed a soothing 'Row Jimmy' at a show say at Oakland coliseum or an 'Eyes of the world' at riverport amphitheatre in MO.  This album deserves 5 stars because of the quality of the songs and their continuity  and impact/effect it had on lots of people's (deadheads) lives.
