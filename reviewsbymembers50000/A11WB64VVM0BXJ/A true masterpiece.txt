 This is an excellent offering by K Schulze.  It is considered to be his first masterpiece following the successful (musically) first three or four records.  Describing Schulze s music is sometimes not an easy task.  Compared w 'Irlicht', the first album he released as a solo artist, Timewind is far more mature and crafted.  Although Irrlicht is a monument, and was a different period in his career.  A comparison with Cyborg also would not be very fair.  Cyborg is one of my favorite records (double record) and Timewind covers different terrain (both I recommend). At 28 years old he released Timewind, and is a fine choice of electronic/ambience to pick and purchase.  I would recommend to go with the first two I mentioned (if possible buy both at once), and then go and continue with this record and 'black dance'.
