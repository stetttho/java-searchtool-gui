 Taking into account that Klaus Schulze on his first two records 'Irrlicht' and Cyborg performed an array of vast organ drone experiments, which resulted in some of the best music recorded on earth, the 1976 Moondawn sees Schulze further into his electronic music  making. There are albums that came after Moondawn, that for some reason or another, I don t find much interest in them (i,e,  Mirage).  MIrage was a record which Schulze dedicated to his passing father.  It is beautiful.  Two tracks, 20 + minute3s each.  But for my taste, too much synthesizer.  Felt like it needed something else, aside form the nice synthesizer work. It simply bored me. Now that I made my comparison to Mirage, let me tell you what I think of this awesome record 'Moondawn'.  Well, it was 1 year before the former, and it is brilliant.  Klaus creates a sort of symphonic orchestra type of feeling when you hear the first tune, 'floating'.  It is simply brilliant and full of talent, how he can make 25 minutes go by, and have you at the edge of your seat for the full ride.  Amazing, w out words. The next tune Mindphaser is a bit less than the first, but interesting nonetheless. I could 've abstained at writing a review on this album, but my love for this genre of music and for K Schulze's music in particular left me nothing else but to give my best and honest opinion. Not all his records are 5 star jobs, but part of a serious music collector's journey through music is finding music he/she likes and music he also doesn t like.  In the case of 'Moondawn', it is one that I recommend to anyone with a good ear for quality music.
