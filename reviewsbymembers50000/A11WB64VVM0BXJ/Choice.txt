 This is a very mature album for M Gottsching.  You see his growth from the early ashra years, w the first album, then others like join inn, ash ra VI, etc. This is one of my favorite albums in my collection.  I got it recently and it is one of my favorites. Expect a full on mature effort from this musician.
