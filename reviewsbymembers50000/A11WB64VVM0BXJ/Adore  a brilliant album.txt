 I wouldn t write a review on this record unless it was a seriously good effort from SP, or if it were worth anyone s time to listen.  SP is worth anyone s time to listen, at anytime, and almost anyday  Like many, groups, they touch and taste different styles throughout their life as a ' group '.  And in this album it is very successful.  I happened to get to know this album as it came out in the summer of 98 as a friend and I embarked on a 3 week journey following the rest of the Grateful Dead ( known as the other ones ), from Atlanta, thorugh the east coast and then back to the middle west - where we were from.  That bit is, you could say a personal anecdote that to me is important.  Especially if my friend who travelled with me reads this .. ever.  ( I know you re out there somewhere Jeff = )  Tracks 1, 2, 5 and then 9 through the end are what many of us seek as musical bliss, or perfection ( to the ears - aural perfection ).  I wonder .. I  d love to meet B Corgan or interview him and see what made them turn in the path of electro pop ala Cocteau Twins, Talk Talk w lots of reverb.  It sounds good.  Like a nice refreshing change.  What events in their lives in that year and the preceeding made them choose those paths.  Comparing this album with others, there is no resemblance of anything prior.  No connection to Mellon Collie, or Siamese dream .. or Gish.  The only constant genious here is the songwriting, which is untouched throughout the album and their career, which begins in 1990 and stems up to the early 00 s.  I saw them live in 1991 and 93.  Ames and IA City respectively.  And their music carved a nice bunch of memories of me and friends in our late teens ( I m 31 now ), enjoying that time and then the 20 s.  And mainly a group ( SP )that was capable of sucking you in time after time with their irresistible style.  And D arcy was quite irresistible also = )  Apologies to D arcy s husband on that one.  God bless SP
