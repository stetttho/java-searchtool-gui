 This is a fluid sounding album that can be heard from start to finish w / out much difficulty.  Now, with the bonus tracks, it s even funner.    This is an album as the liner notes mention was executed in a time when the Dead were going through slight changes and also about to encounter a big one, which was their hiatus in ' 75.  I ll leave you to purchase this great digi pack cd to tune in to what Joel Selvin tells us in about a 3 or 4 page liner note, detailing the making of this album, and all the other variables that were going on at the time.  It s been 32 years since this album was released; and its as current as any quality timeless recording from that great decade ( 70 s ).  I wonder if Phil would ve produced more music; or if ' Pride ' and UBC were his only offerings until Terrapin St ( Passengers )  These two songs weave around US Blues, Ship of Fools.  Loose L. Scarlet B.  In other words, a plethora of ear candy.  I even dig Weir s Money money quite a bit.  But after learning of the band s history that year ( astronomical figures in spending ), i can see why it was played only 3 times.  And one of those versions is here.  The one from a show just before Portland ( to give you a clue ).  I lived in the US for about 16 years.  I m 31.  So there s a sensitivity to what goes on up there.  I live in Chile; country that saw me born on 24.4 75  This is one of the sweetest albums that you could listen to at any given time.  Be it in some far away setting, or in the comfort of your living room w / your excellent stereo s.  If I were to compare this album to any other in the Dead s 30 year active career; it d be difficult.  I like everything the band put out.  Enjoyed every show i saw ( 6 total ).  And my personal criticisms to this band come in at times when I think any human would do; as it is the most normal thing to criticize ( approve / disaprove ) everything we have in front of us, be it a book, person or in this case album
