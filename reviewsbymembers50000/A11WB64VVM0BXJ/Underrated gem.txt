 What a pleasure to hear an album as refreshing as this one.  The blend of electronic, acoustic (or analog) instruments, and a nice collection of guests on this album make Flowermouth one of the best No Man albums.  The songs are incredibly original, and have the presence of guitar guru Robert Fripp - as guest - on 80% of the record. At first listen I couldn t believe ther interplay between former King Crimson sax player Mel Collins, Robert Fripp and the voice of Lisa Gerrard (of Dead can dance).  Steve Wilson shows maturity (considering this was 1994) in comparison to his full time project Porcupine Tree - which also is wonderful.  Tim Bowness is the singer and although I haven't heard many more records by No Man, has a voice that fits this band s sound perfectly.  On the first song, 'Angel gets caught in the beauty trap', we hear him sing "In my dream I feel you breathing..In my dream I feel you breathe".  These are very deep and beautiful words. I beleive this band will continue to release excellent records (as they have since Flowermouth), and that the other projects that the members of this band partake in, will continue growing.
