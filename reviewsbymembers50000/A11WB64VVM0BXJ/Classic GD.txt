 The reason i like this release so much is because they go the extra mile on the tunes.  This is taken from 2 nights plus some songs from the Milwaukee show.  Like most Dicks Picks, the songs really stand out.  The first disc which comprises a really nice 1st set stands out w/ Deal and Music Never Stopped as big hits.  The 2nd disc is the 2nd set from The UNI dome show and is one of the best 2nd sets/ or 90 minutes of dead in one disc.  And the 3rd disc is the 2nd set from the Feb 3 show in WI which is solid playing throughout. I am more a fan of progressive rock (Genesis, Premiata forneria marconi), but the tunes on DP 18 are all high energy and are classic Grateful Dead = ) Additionally, the disc w/ the Scarlet - Fire from Cedar Falls deserves 5 stars.  It is some of the best music they've done or has been done on earth = )
