 This CD is brilliant.  The reason I like it so much is that it is well played.  Its cleverly heavy and doesn't meander in pointless playing or screams or anything. Slayer is pure energy, and although I don't like all their records, this and a few others are real good. In comparison, Reign in blood was a younger and different album.  'South of Heaven' is more developed, more mature, and still gathered what Slayer was trying to do in the late 80's: create very heavy music. 4 1/2 *
