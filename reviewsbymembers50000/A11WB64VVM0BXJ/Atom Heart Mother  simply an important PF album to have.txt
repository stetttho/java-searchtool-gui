 I have written two other PF album reviews.  You can tell I like this band.  I own most of their discs and ill tell you why im rating this album.  Simply because it is great.   Although if you know a little bit about P Floyds story youll know that when in the making of this album, well people didn't expect anything that would excite the masses too much.  The song If is a good R Waters contribution.  No other song sounds like this one, not "Grantchester Meadows" or anything from Animals.  Its simply a very original song and very beautiful too.  Next is Summer 68, a concise yet rocking number.  Song #4 is David Gilmour's Fat Old Sun.  Super nice song.  The melody of this tune is guaranteed to stay in your head for real long.  And the final but not least tune is Alans Psycdelic b fast.  Admitedly by PF to be the most thrown together song theyve done, but its one of my favorites.  Theres humor in this song.  And lastly the title song, Atom Heart Mother.  A true masterpiece.  The first 20 plus minute song by these guys.  Completely entertaining throughout. So the big question is why do I like this album so much?  Because it gives your record collection a little more class.  Its a must have.
