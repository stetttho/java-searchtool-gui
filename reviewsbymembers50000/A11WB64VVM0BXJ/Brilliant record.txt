 This is one of my favorite PF records.  Along with Piper this record shines.  Its a bit different than Piper but it was probably the bands' maturing.  The opener "Let there be more light" is brilliant.  David Gilmour showing what he is capabale of and why is where he is.  The song remember a day flows right along.  perfectly.  A good work by Rick Wright.  Then "Set the controls..".  By the time you reach the title track you are very pleased at the disc you just bought.  And the ender Jugband B's is a perfect way to cap the disc.
