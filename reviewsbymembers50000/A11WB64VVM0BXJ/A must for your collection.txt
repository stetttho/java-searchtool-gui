 I think this is a great CD.  What makes it great and reason I like it is that it shaped my growing up in my teens when it came out.  Great disc.  Like other albums or cd's tyhat marked your growing up, this one was one of them.  I'm 27 now, 8 years later after hearing American Thigs, and I think it's a super f**n killer album.
