 I have owned this album for quite some time, but what makes me write a review on it is having recently obtained the movie for which this music was made for, La Valle - or Obscured by clouds.  By no means is this one of my favorite Floyd records but it is one of the most subtle and beautiful.  It doesn t have the greatness of Piper, or the sheer genius of A Saucerful of secrets.  Nonetheless it makes for an appropriate collection of songs to accompany the 1972 Barbet Schroeder movie.  I highly recommend the movie.  Additionally Floyd created some noteworthy compositions here.  The only awful, and I mean awful moment of the record is Free four.  It is the absolutely worst composition Floyd ever did.  Steer clear of that song.  Purchase the album, then get the movie.  The movie is for very exigent fans.
