 Many folks who have decided to review this double album have said they don t feel comfortable with the different arrangements displayed.  I have to agree with Dylan s voice being at a peak here.    But how can someone identify him or herself as a devoted Dylan fan and not accept such an accessible album as this one.  I think that if the arrangements are different and not what you d of preferred, try to see the result.  There are few artists in this planet who can record something and usually have at least half success.  Dylan, the Grateful Dead and others are artists who being that they were geniuses at what they did, it was hard to have a ' flop ' effort.  So I just say, try to enjoy this, becuase it s a little spoiled to say that ' I didn t like it '  The opener Mr Tambourine Man is a swell version.  Maybe the best I ve heard.  And the album progresses well ( Love minus zero, One more cup of coffee - valley below,  Like a rolling stone, I shall be released (!!), Is your love in vain ? )  Enjoy this as should be with any quality recording.  Accompany it with a good Jerry Garcia band live album.  Both groups were meant to be coupled together or grouped.  I don't think they ever shared a bill togehter, but that has to be one of the strangest things that didn t happen in rock & roll  At least the Dead did in 87 & 95.  : )  Enjoy this great live album
