 I would tend to write a review on this album with a bit of caution.  In my opinion it is not the best PT album.  That's my objective opinion.  But it is one of their best (records).  Up the downstair, The sky moves sideaways, and this are candidates to be some of the best material they put out. This is the album before the so called 'catchy' or 'commercial' side the band came to be later.  Although their more accesible material is brilliant and deserving A LOT of praise.  It is pure joy this band made it to the U.S. finally to play live and have their material marketed more widely than before, because they deserve to be heard by many audiences, and the U.S.'s is one of the biggest (considering population density). Anyway, let me give you a run down on this album which is pretty good and clocks in at around 60 min.  The opener 'Bornlivedie' is an elctronic/sample type of intro to the album, Pretty appropriate I think.  Next the title track, strong. After about 20 or 25 more minutes of music we tend to see and judge that Steve Wilson along w the rest of the group are making quite good music.  Very Porcupine tree.  'light mass prayers' is a favorite.  A light, futuristic Gregorian chant type of song, which floats in and out making the mood very spacy.  this gives way to a great track 'Dark matter.  Cool lyrics about some of the 'dark matter' that some and lots of mass and local media (newspapers, TV stations) do and say to get the public s preference.  Smart song. All I would say other than this, is to go and buy the rest of the PT catalog.  Everything from Voyage 34 on up is worth purchasing.  Cheers.
