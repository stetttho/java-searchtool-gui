 This album is good, and the reason is tht phish was going through a good songwriting period.  I'm not 100 % fond of the songs they write, althiugh here they do write good ones (it'd be like 5 % of the songs i dont like). Free, the opener is a full on song with lots of energy, and grabs you right away.  The next song, not so bright - character zero - super weak.  # 3 waste, good.  next, taste, ok (live versions are better).  Talk, excellent.  Theme, good also.  Train song, good.  Bliss > billy breathes - very good.  swept away > steep > caspian good. Overall this album is very bright, with lots of good moments.  It doesnt get me like "Rift", but for the time period ('96), and the shows from that fall tour were awesome, a good album from this band.
