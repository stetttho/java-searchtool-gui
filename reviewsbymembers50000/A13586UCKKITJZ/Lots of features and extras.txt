 This is a deal of a lifetime - you get an easy-to-use program that produces beautiful labels (I print mine on an Epson 770 inkjet), and 5000 clip art images, 100 pre-designed templates (most are very attractive and professional looking layouts) and 50 white labels. The applicator tool is also easy-to-use and allows you to perfectly center your labels on your CDs (I tried this by hand before I got this kit with disastrous results). This is all you need to add a professional touch to your music and data CDs.   The program that comes with this kit will also make jewel case inserts and splines, but I haven't tested this feature because I use CD envelopes for storage and distribution of CDs.
