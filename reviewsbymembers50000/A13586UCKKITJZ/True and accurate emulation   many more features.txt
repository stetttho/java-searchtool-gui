 Among all of the terminal emulation programs I've tried this one renders remote sessions the best.  Every one of the supported terminal types (Wyse, DEC, IBM 3151 and others) is transparent.  I love the ability to use a web browser to view the sessions, and am especially impressed that this program not only supports Internet Explorer, but Netscape.  This is much more than a terminal emulation program, however, because it also supports NFS, file and printer sharing and drag and drop copying.  Another outstanding feature is the built-in scripting language, which is easy to learn and use. Overall, if you need a terminal emulator that will provide the most accurate emulation this one should be at the top of your list.  If you also need NFS support and print and file sharing services this is the only one that fits the requirements from what I've used and evaluated.  I'm pleased with it and highly recommend it.
