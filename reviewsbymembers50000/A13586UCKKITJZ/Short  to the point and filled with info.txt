 This is the second book I've read (and reviewed) by Mr. Ginac.  He is a master at packing a maximum amount of information and wisdom into books with minimal page counts.  This requires real talent on the author's part and I, for one, appreciate it when I can improve my professional knowledge with a book that can be read in one sitting. This book is about project management, development processes and leadership, all of which are interwoven into seven succinct chapters. The parts of this book that I especially liked are: (1) The sensible and business-oriented approach to requirements in Chapter 1.  This is a recipe for success and encapsulates some of the best practices I've come across in a single short chapter.  (2) The focus on team building and leadership that is given in Chapters 2 through 4 and 6. I've endured poor leadership and have had the pleasure of working for some of the best in my 25 years of experience, so I have a good feel for what works and what doesn't.  These three chapters capture all of the good examples that have taken me a quarter of a century to discover, and provides some of the best advice and guidance you'll find in any book.  (4) The chapter on planning, like the others, distills into a few short pages some of the best advice a project manager or team leader should carefully heed.  Like the body of the book, the appendix is rich with information that is crammed into a short page count.  I'm obviously a fan of Mr. Ginac, due in no small part to this book.  If you read this one and want more I highly recommend that you read Customer Oriented Software Quality Assurance, which is also short, informative and well written.  5 stars for this one!
