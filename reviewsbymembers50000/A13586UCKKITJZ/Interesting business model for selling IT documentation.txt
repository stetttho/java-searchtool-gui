 This site is based on an interesting business model - provide IT operations and software engineering documentation in MS Word, Visio and Excel format at an affordable price.  One feature that distinguishes this business model is you can download and read any document before you buy.  This is made possible using Adobe's security features for PDF documents. You can read, but not print, or cut and paste from any of the documents.   The business model is based on the following value proposition - because it is easier to take an existing document and tailor it to meet an organization's needs than it is to create one from scratch, the potential savings in person hours for even a trivial process document is significant.   As of the date of this review there is a single document available, "Configuration, Change and Release Management Policies, Process and Procedures".  However, the list of documents that will be available include IT problem management, service level management, and related policies and procedures manuals and associated artifacts. Ordering is via an online credit card processing service that uses https to assure secure transactions.   If you are a consultant or are working on an internal IT process improvement initiative this site is worth a visit.  If you are seeking a document that is not listed, use the contact link and ask the operator if it's available - chances that it will be.
