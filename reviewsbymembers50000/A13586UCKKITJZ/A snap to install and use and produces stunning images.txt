 This is one of the easiest to install and use add-ons I have ever purchased.  I took it out of the box, plugged it in, inserted the CD ROM into my drive and it magically installed and was ready in a matter of minutes. It produces stunning images with either a push of a button or few clicks of a mouse.  I have scanned everything from a passport page, complete with hologram, to a metal plaque.  Each of these present unique challenges to copying and scanning devices because of reflections and the strange things holograms cause, but this scanner made completely faithful reproductions. The software that comes bundled is adequate, but I discovered that my copy of Paintshop Pro version 7 will automatically recognize the scanner and allow me to scan directly into that program. From there I can use the Adjust feature to quickly set quality and save the scanned image in any of the dozens of formats that Paintshop Pro supports.  I really like the small size and sleek looks of this device, and the quality of both the scanner itself, and the images it produces are exceptionally high. It meets all of my needs, which are many since I produce a lot of documentation and need scanned images on many occasions.  It is also useful for scanning and faxing from your computer, adding even more value.  I think this scanner is one of the better values in computer peripherals and I highly recommend it.
