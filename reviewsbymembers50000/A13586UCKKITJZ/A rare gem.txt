 This is one of the most business-focused books on project management that you can read.  Where other books go into techniques that are specific to project planning, scheduling and control, this one ensures that business issues are interwoven into each element of project management. Parts that set this book apart from the others include an emphasis on developing a business case and the structured way in which all project stakeholder requirements are considered in project quality and reporting.  I also like the way projects are managed at the enterprise level as portfolios and integrated into programs instead of standalone projects.  In addition, the many forms, checklists and diagrams are highly useful and can be used with little or no modification.   This book is also completely consistent with the PMI PMBOK and UK PRINCE2 methodologies, and the author's web site that supports this book contains a wealth of up-to-date information that adds to the value of this book.
