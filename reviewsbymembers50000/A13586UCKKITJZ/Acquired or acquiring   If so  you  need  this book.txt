 I read this book because it was strongly recommended by a friend whose advice turned out to be invaluable.  The approach that Ms. Brown takes is one of the most practical, straightforward I have come across. If followed it will reduce technical, cost and schedule risks that are rampant in application integrations, especially those to which this book targets:  gluing together systems that have been separately developed by two organizations and now have to be merged into a coherent whole when one of the organizations acquires the other.    The seven models proposed each address a unique requirement or situation based on a pattern.  That Ms. Brown has managed to distill integration challenges into seven models is an impressive feat.  It shows the level and depth of her experience, and from what I read in the book, combined with my own experience, she has completely thought this through. One of the most important aspects of this book is that it's balanced between both business and technical considerations, and also embodies the best project management practices.  As someone who takes applications into production and provides support I think that the overall approach set forth in this book also strikes a good balance between integration activities and post-integration support.  It's refreshing to find a book that accomplishes this. This is an important book that serves two purposes:  it is a solid collection of application integration models that should be in the toolbox of all IT/IS professionals whose job entails enterprise architectures or application integration, and it is a clear roadmap for those folks who have just been told that their company just acquired another and the systems need to be integrated into a coherent whole without disruption the business operations of either organizational unit. It serves both purposes exceptionally well. Bravo Ms. Brown!
