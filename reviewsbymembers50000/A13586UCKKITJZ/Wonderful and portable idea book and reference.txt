 This slender little book is a handy desk guide that covers some important continuous process improvement tools.  It gives a quick "how to" for the following tools that are the foundation of CPI: Tree, Pareto, Sequence Flow, Process Flow, Scatter, Run, Control and Histogram. Granted, the run and control charts would merit a book unto themselves, but that misses the point of this book - it's a handy reference and idea book that takes up little briefcase space for consultants or desk space for anyone who is involved in CPI or measurement and analysis of any kind.  I take mine with me when I am working on projects at client sites, and have found it invaluable when I am developing processes and procedures because it gives me ideas when I am writing the measurement sections of those documents. I give it five stars for clear descriptions packed into a slim book and its thorough coverage of some of the most important tools available to a CPI practitioner or consultant.
