 This site is the gateway into the Tarrani & Associates family of web pages that reside on various servers and ISPs. From this page you are directed to the following: - non-commercial main site (see ASIN B0000YMTXW)that connects to single- and multi-page topic areas on IT topics ranging from project management to software quality assurance.  My personal home page is also accessible from this site, as well as two weblogs that deal with software engineering (ASIN B0000A2TZN) and IT operations management (ASIN B0000AA2TV). - commercial sites, such as processdox (ASIN B0001F96ZO), which sells IT operations documentation in MS Word, Visio and Excel formats. - quasi-commercial sites that are non-technical in nature. The main purpose of this web page is to direct anyone looking for the growing body of knowledge and products provided by Tarrani & Associates or Team Zarate-Tarrani to the proper site, which makes navigating through this sea of information easy.
