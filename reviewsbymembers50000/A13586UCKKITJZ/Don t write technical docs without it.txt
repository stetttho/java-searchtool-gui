 This is much more than a simple screen capture program, although it does that function exceptionally well.  It is an image management program that allows you to capture screen shots that are useful for documentation, brouchures and training material, as well as manage the impages that you already have as well as those that you capture. Among the features that I like are: - handling of all major graphics types, including animated GIFs and Photoshop files - ability to create image catalogs that display your images as thumbnails - this makes finding what you need easy, especially if you have thousands of images (which I do) It has a built-in image editor that allows you to crop, rotate and color-enhance your graphics, and it does an impressive job of converting images from one type to another.  Prior to using this program I used SnagIt, which did an excellent job, but lacked the cataloging features and ability to handle Photoshop files. If you do any kind of technical or commercial documentation this is an essential tool that you'll find yourself using often.
