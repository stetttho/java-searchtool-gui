 I upgraded my copy of Omnipage Pro 10.0 Scan Suite, which is a qualifying product to upgrade to OmniPage Pro 11.0.  It was one of the smartest moves I've made.  Not that there was anything terribly wrong with OmniPage Pro 10, but the added features and performance of version 11 is plain phenomenal.  Optical character recognition (OCR) is dramatically more accurate in this new version, and it also recognizes and converts columns and tables.  It also produces a virtually identical converted page, with graphics, tables and columns where they should be, instead of in unexpected places like the previous version sometimes did. It imports Adobe Acrobat files, which is a major plus, and exports them into Microsoft Office format files - an even bigger plus.  It will also turn a scanned document into an Acrobat PDF file.  This does not supplant Adobe's Acrobat 5.0, though, because that product has capabilities that OmniPage doesn't have.  See the Acrobat 5.0 product page on Amazon for more information. Another plus is the ability to scan a page, have it accurately converted and save it as an HTML file, complete with graphics, which can then be uploaded to your web site.  It can also be used to create documentation on a CD ROM that can be read using a browser.  The possibilities here are endless and adds considerably to the value of this upgrade. ScanSoft did a remarkable job with features and usability with this version. If you are using a qualifying product this upgrade is worth every penny.
