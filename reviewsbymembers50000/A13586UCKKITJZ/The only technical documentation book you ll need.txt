 After reading my colleague's comments I rushed out and purchased this book.  I, too, am trained and certified in Information Mapping and was impressed at how closely the approach in this book is aligned to that method.  However, what I like most is the fact that this book can be used as guidance for a wider scope than just documenting software architectures because it shows how to organize your documentation requirements, develop clear documentation and manage the entire process from start to finish. I also like the clearly articulated and illustrated advice about how to augment text with graphics, and how to select the views and associated graphics to document requirements, specifications and the finished architecture.  An example of how this book goes beyond documenting just architectures is a project in which I was engaged two years ago.  One of the major deliverables was a set of operations guides.  While this is related to architecture with respect to how its used after it's in production, there were no books that fully described how to go about it in a coherent way.  Using the advice and techniques in this book I could have greatly improved upon what I did produce.  While I cannot change the past, you can be sure that I'll use this book to its fullest the next time I need to write ops guides, especially when it comes to showing component and connector views, and elements and relations. If you do technical writing either professionally or as a part of your job get this book and keep it nearby.  If you read and use the material you're ability to communicate will surely improve, and you'll be able to tailor your documentation to each segment of your audience (business and technical), as well as to clearly communicate information.  You'll also learn much about managing the documentation process itself.
