 After reading this book I realized why so many development projects that use object-oriented tools and techniques fail - they are staffed by developers who think in the traditional terms of procedures and functions.  In retrospect it dawned on me that there is a high probability that developers who started out with procedural languages view objects as functions.   This book provides a compass that will point developers in the right direction by breaking mental paradigms.  It does so by getting them to think in terms of states instead of functions, and objects as components, independent of the application being developed, with well-defined interfaces and properties that can be used to create services.  I personally learned a lot about object-orientation, which I can apply to analysis.  This book is a quick and easy read, and packs a lot of information and concepts between its covers.  I highly recommend it and give it five stars for clarity and content.
