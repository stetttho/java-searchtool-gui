 This 238-page book is a combination dictionary and collection of quick tools and tips that every project manager will find useful. There are over 150 entries that are cross-referenced by category and arranged in an easy-to-find alphabetical listing.  What I like is the step-by-step procedures for using the tools, which are augmented by usage tips and examples.  Another feature is the inclusion of obscure or archaic terms that you are sometimes hit with at meetings.  The next time someone hurls the term "slip chart" at you, you won't be scratching your head wondering what they're talking about (and you can hurl back that since you're using earned value slip charts are inappropriate!) If you are a professional project manager this book is both a reference and tool.  Highly recommended.
