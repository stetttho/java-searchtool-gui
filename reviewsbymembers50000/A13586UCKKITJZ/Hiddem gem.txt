 I bought this program on an impulse and discovered a gem.  First, it is one of the quickest ways to produce a chart (much faster than doing one in Excel), and second, it allows you to easily paste it into a Word document or save as HTML and use on a web page.  In addition it comes with a large clip are library (over 3000 images) and templates that make it all the more useful.  It also lets you rotate and crop your charts, making it even more convenient for doing quick charts to insert in Word or PowerPoint.
