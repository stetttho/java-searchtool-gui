 If ever there was a book that puts consulting into perspective it is this one.  In the Spring of 2000 I left a 24-year job in mainframe operations to join a national consulting firm as a service delivery consultant.  My first few months were filled with disorientation that led to self-doubt and an attempt to fit into a new world.  Had I read this book before the move my transition would have gone a lot more smoothly. Now that I have successfully established myself in the world of consulting I find that my new profession is a blend of being a technical expert and customer relationship facilitator.  This valuable book focuses on the latter set of skills, which are not easy to acquire, and has given me insights and knowledge that will foster my continuing professional growth. If you are new to consulting or considering the move to this profession the first three chapters will show you what to expect and what you need in order to "make it".   Chapter 4, on negotiating the client/consultant relationship, provides some of the most valuable advice I have come across.  This is the essence of consulting and something that every consultant needs to master in order to be successful (which is another way or saying "survive"). Ignore this chapter at your peril.  I thought the approach given in chapter 5 on visualizing success, communications and change was excellent.  If chapter 4 gives you survival skills, this one adds polish to your approach and further guarantees your success in delivering and executing. Chapters 6 and 7 cover areas not only important to consultants, but also to internal project teams. Understanding the situation (and requirements) is the key to developing a solution that is completely aligned to needs and expectations. I do disagree with the recommendation to develop an "as-is" model in all situations, however.  If you are developing and implementing a new process or resolving a seriously broken existing process the "as-is" step adds little value in my experience.  I reserve this approach when the engagement calls for process improvement.  On the other hand, the data collection methods and discussion of surveys were highlights that I liked very much. I also thought the entire treatment of the design process was excellent and provided a clean, methodical approach that will fit nearly any kind of consulting engagement. The lead-in to collaborating with the client on solution selection in chapter 8 is a powerful strategy - it will ensure that the client participates in the process. You will find that this approach will result in client buy-in and satisfaction - two things to which we all aspire to achieving. This strategy is fleshed out in chapter 9 on delivering the solution. There are some important key areas covered here as well. I liked the emphasis on managing quality and the advice on knowledge transfer to the client (which doesn't always go smoothly because it is not always adequately planned). The rest of the book is on developing consulting skills and covers the full spectrum of things to consider.  Some highlights that I got a lot from were troubleshooting the consulting relationship (a reality of consulting that I did not need to deal with the first 24 years of my career), and the blueprint for personal development. As consultants we are viewed as the "expert" and are always under pressure to produce results.  As such our ongoing professional development is extremely important and this chapter offers excellent advice and a set of clear guidelines for accomplishing this.                     Finally, the appendices contained additional information that any consultant will find invaluable.  While I had no direct interest in the sample RFP or proposal provided in appendices A and B, I did find the sample communications plan in appendix C and project plan in appendix D very valuable. This book is full of ideas for consultants and will also serve internal business analysts and project managers well with the wealth of advice and practical approach.  It has measurably influenced my thinking and approach and has given me a clear path towards improving my skills and knowledge.  I highly recommend this book and give it 5 stars.
