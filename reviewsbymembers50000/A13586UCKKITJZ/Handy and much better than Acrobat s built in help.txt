 Makes finding information about some of Acrobat's more obscure capabilities quick and easy. Some examples:  how to use the article tool, make sure your converted document displays bookmarks instead of just thumbnail views, and how to set security options.  Although I work with Acrobat all the time I sometimes need a nudge to remember how to perform a task and this guide provides it.  Another advantage is it is durable and compact.  I recently moved to Acrobat 5.0 and still find this wonderful little card useful.  You will really like this card if you, like myself, get frustrated with Acrobat's poorly designed help files.  This card pinpoints a lot of information much faster than the Help function in either Acrobat 4 or 5.
