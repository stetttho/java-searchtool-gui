 At 51 pages this book is a highly focused, but short, guide.  The book itself provides a process for writing help desk policies, procedures and tasks.  It starts out in chapter 1 by explaining why clearly written guidance documentation is important, then proceeds to give six steps to developing the documentation. The first is to know and understand your work environment, followed by a brief list of helpful writing hints.  Next are definitions of policy, procedure and task (the distinction between the latter two is often blurred in the real world, so this section, short as it is, is valuable).  The final three steps consist of planning and writing (1) policies, (2) procedures and (3) tasks.  The approach is straightforward, but if you've never done this before you'll find the book both helpful and well worth the price. What I most like is the book stays focused and is clearly written.  The author sticks with the basics and does not include confusing fluff or digress from the topic.  If you manage help desks this pamphlet-sized book will get you quickly started in the important job of writing consistent policies, procedures and tasks.
