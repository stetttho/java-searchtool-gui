 This book provides a straightforward approach to improving help desk performance.  The foundation, as the title proclaims, is service goals and metrics.  My first reaction when the book arrived was mild disappointment because it was little more than a pamphlet.  However, it is packed with excellent information, a lot of which has guided me in developing service delivery and service level measurement processes.  I like the way the author stays focused on service goals and his choice of metrics with which to measure the attainment of those goals.  Therefore, despite this book's page count it provides excellent value because the content is so well thought out. If you follow the guidelines you will have a good starting point for a service delivery process that is based on measured performance.  I highly recommend this book to help desk managers and consultants who are assigned to service delivery projects.
