 This book in my opinion will enhance your thinking process in terms of exercising your own creativity to solve business problems.  The tools in this book can be used to bring out your own originality and expressiveness in seeking solutions.  I liked the way the author James M. Higgins, gave real life examples of Giant Corporations that have used one or more of these problem-solving techniques. The 101 techniques described in this book are broken down to by problem solving stages: environmental analysis, recognizing and identifying problems, making assumptions, generating alternatives, making choices and implementing solutions.  Each one of these processes is described in detail with graphics and, some chapters will have exercises that are deemed helpful in understanding the technique. The techniques are presented in alphabetical order and are numbered twice, the first number denotes the techniques position from 1 to 101, and the second number is the techniques position within that section of the problem-solving model. Chapter 4 which focused on  individual techniques  is the one that I personally found to be most helpful.  In my line of work as an IT Consultant I have exercised a few of these techniques such as mind mapping, but I also found other techniques that I can't wait to start using my next project. There are many techniques to try in this book, some of these techniques you may not like, others won't fit, but overall this is a handy book to use for your problem-solving efforts.
