 The five step approach to securing and managing systems and assets that this book provides is a blueprint for a comprehensive and effective security program What I found especially valuable is the fact that the complex task of developing, implementing and managing an effective security program is clearly outlined in this book.  I also like the fact that the security exposures and techniques for dealing with them are based on CERT/CC research and experience - there is no theory here.  As such, if you follow the five-step approach and augment this with constant vigilence you will have the assurance that at least 80% of potential threats are dealt with.  The remaining 20% of the threats are constantly emerging as the war between you and the 'bad guys' unfolds, but the  URLs to CERT/CC and other security-related sites provided in this book are resources that will allow you to remain abreast of these emergent threats. Probably the most valuable aspect of this book is the incident response process, which can serve as the framework for damage control, elements of business continuity planning, and guidelines for immediate and methodical response to breaches.  In my opinion this book is an essential resource for security officers and IT security personnel and the foundation of a well planned defensive security posture.
