 The checklists in this 80-page guide are both comprehensive and complete. While this book's obvious value is to DBAs (which I'm not), it is also an invaluable tool for a number of other IS/IT areas. Specifically:   *  Change control analysts who need to develop or validate implementation and rollback plans *  Project and release managers who want to scope out and plan the key tasks for upgrades and implementations *  Desktop support folks who install and configure client software *  Help desk analysts who are tasked with developing problem screening and identification checklists.   For the last group the checklists for confirming network connectivity via Net8 can make the difference between misassigning an Oracle Net8 problem to the network group, which only slows the resolution process.  You do not have to be a DBA to benefit from this excellent book.
