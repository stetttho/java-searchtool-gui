 This 89 page book has two things going for it: (1) Logical approach to mapping work processes (2) Clear, concise writing Ms. Galloway's logical approach to mapping work processes is evident from the table of contents, which contains: Introduction to Mapping Select the Process Define the Process Chart the Primary Process Chart Inspection Points Develop Inspection Standards Draw Lines and Arrows Chart Inputs and Suppliers Chart Subprocesses Plan Future Activities She keeps this approach simple and assumes that the reader knows nothing about mapping work processes.  I like the lack of fluff and concise (if not terse) writing that is augmented by over 50 figures and illustrations. If you want to learn how to map work processes this is the book with which to embark on your learning experience. I give it five stars for its clarity and completeness.
