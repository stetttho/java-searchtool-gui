 This is a significant update of an earlier product called "SERIOUS MAGIC Visual Communicator Plus" (ASIN B000066S28).  The earlier product was one of the best tools for creating professional quality videos you could get at any price, and the same holds true for this updated version Also, the real magic remains in the software, which is a self contained environment for creating videos - not merely editing them. I love the templates that provide a 'program format' such as news, the animated backgrounds, and stock video and sound clips.The automated wizards make creating a presentation a snap, and this version adds integration with web sites, DVDs and PowerPoint. You'll need the following minimum hardware and software to install and use the software: Windows 98, 98SE, ME, 2000 or XP, an 800 Mhz or faster Pentium III processor or equivalent, a 16MB AGP graphics card with 3D acceleration and Internet Explorer 5.0 or above. For interfacing camcorders you'll need a video input card, such as a Firewire or analog capture device that is compatible with your camcorder. You also have to make sure that the interface has a Windows DirectShow compatible driver. To make sure that you are working with the most up-to-date requirements go to ASIN B00006GME4 and check for the latest updates. If ever there was a killer application looking for a market, this is it. Visual Communicator has business and personal uses that will allow anyone with the right equipment and a touch of creativity to make compelling presentations in the business environment and send greetings to friends and relatives that are far beyond what one can do with paper. It's also useful for proposals, training and just about any other use that will be enhanced by visual communication.
