 This book covers what it takes to successfully manage a rapid implementation project for any enterprise-wide application.  It does so in a structured and realistic manner that addresses risks, critical success factors and common deliverables. Project management is much more than common sense - it requires a process and skillful use of PM techniques, such as those contained in PMI's Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK).  This is reinforced by the appalling number of IT projects that either fail or are cancelled.  While this book doesn't go deeply into specific PM techniques, nor does it especially align to the PMBOK, it does provide a realistic framework.  It also gives a complete list of risks and barriers to success that you'll encounter in ERP and other complex systems projects. I especially like the way the author decomposes the systems into layers and the project approach into phases.  These allow you to step back and see the big picture, and to do a better job of estimating scope, complexity and required resources before embarking on the project.  The project management approach itself is solid, and is linked to critical success factors that will make or break any project.  He also provides excellent advice on team management, and especially team communications and cross functions. Managing complex projects are not easy, and this book contains no short cuts.  It does show you how to plan and control a rapid implementation project for any enterprise system, and if the advice and general approach provided in this book is heeded and followed your chances for success will be dramatically improved.  Just don't let anyone who thinks it's a matter of plain common sense anywhere near the project because you'll find the project to be just another statistic in the boneyard of failed IT projects.
