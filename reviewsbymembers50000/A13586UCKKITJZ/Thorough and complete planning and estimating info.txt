 This is an excellent book for project managers and key team members who are involved in development projects. Although this book is out of print it is worth the effort to track down a copy because of the emphasis on planning and estimation. This material will serve you well with any development project life cycle methodology from the Rational Unified Process to the often disdained but frequently used waterfall model. The book starts out strong with a 5-page chapter devoted to outlining the challenges that you'll face. After 25+ years in the industry I think the challenges cited are as fresh today as they were when I started out. Hopefully this succinct chapter will be read and heeded. Launching the project is covered well in the scant 18 pages of the next chapter. Chapter 3 on analysis and design is a bit out of date with respect to more modern approaches, but chapter 4's thorough and accurate treatment of project plans and estimates makes this book worthwhile. The final two chapters on implementing the project and project manager roles and qualities are mediocre. However, the 30-page appendix titled "Estimating Guidelines" is pure gold. This alone is worth the price of the book, but combined with chapter 4 it is the core of the book and a compelling reason to track down a used copy of this out-of-print book. I give it 5 stars.
