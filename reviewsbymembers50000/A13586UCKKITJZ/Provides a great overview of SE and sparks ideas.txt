 This book is a great introduction to the system engineering process.  It might be lightweight for a practicing system engineer, but for an IT professional whose background is service delivery, production support and data center operations this book opened a whole new world. An example of how this book opened my eyes is the way configuration management is explained, and how it fits within the system engineering process. IT professionals with my background are subject matter experts in change control; however, few of us (certainly myself) realize that change control is a subset of a much larger picture.  Every part of system engineering it covered in sufficient detail to understand the basics. This understanding created, in my case, a desire to further research some areas in greater detail.  Overall, seeing the process from a high-level view provided some unique insights about what is missing in IT management that can be filled by borrowing from our system engineering brothers and sisters. I found this book valuable because I did not have to wade through a dry manual and sort out the details in order to get a big picture of system engineering.  The brief, succinct chapters and excellent illustrations provided me with a coherent approach to my own job.  In fact, I personally believe that applying system engineering principles to IT service delivery and operations management will significantly improve the IT profession.  As such I highly recommend this book to my peers and anyone else who needs to see the big picture of the system engineering and how its principles can be related to their job.
