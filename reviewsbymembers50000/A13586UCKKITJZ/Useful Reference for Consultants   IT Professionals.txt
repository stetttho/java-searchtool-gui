 This book is a compendium of tools and techniques that are routinely used in one consulting engagement after another.  The topics are standard fare and are covered in a plain, straightforward manner. I use this book as an encyclopedia of techniques when I am searching for a method or procedure that fits a particular situation or requirement.  I also use it as a refresher when I set aside time for professional reading. What I like about the book is the wide range of techniques covered - everything from control charts to structured analysis is addressed, with an apparent bias towards project management techniques (crash mode analysis, PERT, critical path method, etc.) It also covers object-oriented techniques, database design and rapid application design. I also like the fact that techniques are grouped into chapters under sections that cover Principles, Information Gathering,/Problem Definition, Project Management, Systems Analysis (some great material in this section), Identifying Alternatives, Design, Testing/Implementation, and Operations & Maintenance.  This makes finding a particular technique easy to locate and to also place into the context of whatever project you happen to be working on. Why four stars?  The writing is dry, and in many sections too verbose.  Also, there is a discernible difference in writing style between authors Davis and Yen, which could have been rectified by a good editor.  Other than this minor complaint I recommend this book to consultants because it does provide a single source of reference material on a wide range of topics and techniques.
