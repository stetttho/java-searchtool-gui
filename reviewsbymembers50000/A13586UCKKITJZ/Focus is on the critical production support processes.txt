 This book is one of, if not the, best guides to developing, implementing and managing a mature production support organization.   The value of this book is that it takes a business-centric approach to service delivery, and augments material on service level management (such as Foundations of Service Level Management - another excellent book).  Specifically, this book contains sorely needed body of knowledge in a profession that has lost its way.  What I mean by this bold statement is the production support function in many IS/IT departments has devolved from service delivery to infrastructure management.  IT Services brings the focus back to where it belongs: supporting the business.  What I like most about this book is it not only shows what is wrong with most production support organizations, but it provides a clear roadmap to how to restructure production support from an infrastructure management focus to a service delivery paradigm. I highly recommend this book to anyone in production support, consultants and IT/IS executive management.  It would also be useful to ISPs and ASPs because most of the material can be applied to internal or external customers.
