 This collection of scripts is a great starter kit for new DBAs because it contains highly useful code for nearly all of the basic administration, tuning and troubleshooting tasks encountered on the job. What I like is this isn't just a collection of code on a CD ROM, but each script is carefully explained in the text of the book.  For someone like myself who is still in OCP training the explanations are almost as valuable as the code.  Although the title claims that the scripts are for Oracle 9i, they also work with 8i, and the book covers what modifications (if any) need to be made to use each script in earlier versions of Oracle.
