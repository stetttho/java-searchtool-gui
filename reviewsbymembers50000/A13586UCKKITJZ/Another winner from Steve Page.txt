 Writing policies and procedures is challenging because if they are unclear they will not be followed.  As someone who does this for clients I can attest that the writing format that the author Stephen Page suggests is the key to writing quality documents.  The template for the 7 writing elements described in this book is an essential means of providing readers with a clear understanding of the policies and procedures. The book is divided into 3 parts: Part 1 discusses the writing format, the writing process, and "Editing Checklist" to improve your writing skills for policies and procedures.   Part 2 includes the case study that is the focus of the scenarios used for Chapters 4 to 10. Exercises, suggested answers, and explanations of these answers, are included for each of the seven sections of the Writing Format. Part 3 contains three samples of policies and procedures for references and comparison purposes. In chapters 4 through 10 exercises were given.  I worked these examples through, and compared them with the samples of *good* and *not so good* answers that were in the book. I found that the book contained new ideas that I did not think of.  Of course, there can be different answers, but these are great exercises to practice on to produce Policies and Procedures that will have a consistent and organized format.     The writing format is a great template and will provide structure to your documents. This book goes right next to my copy of Steve Page's Achieving 100% Compliance of Policies and Procedures as a valuable and frequently used  tool.
