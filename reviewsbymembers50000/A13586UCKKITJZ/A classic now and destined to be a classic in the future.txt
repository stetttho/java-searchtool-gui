 This book is a refreshing approach to eliciting and analyzing requirements and has completely changed my thinking.  What I like about it (and how it influenced me the most) is the human-approach that accounts for how we illogical creatures perceive, think and react.  The authors use humor to lure us into a logical way of seeing the world and applying critical thought and a good dose of reasoning to the process.  For the first time I was able to clearly see how difficult it is to effectively communicate, which is key to eliciting requirements, and how perceptions need to be managed. The anecdotes scattered throughout this book made it lively reading (rare for a "technical" book), and the skillful writing and well thought out structure of the book leads you into regions of thought and thinking where one rarely ventures on their own. With 25 years of IT experience, and countless frustrating cycles of eliciting what I thought were firm requirements only to discover that there were still disconnects, I can only say I wish I had read this book years ago.  However, better late than never.  I recommend that anyone involved with eliciting or analyzing requirements read this book.  It will almost certainly change your approach, and will definitely teach you a thing or two about human nature.  I agree with a previous reviewer in that this book will be as valid a decade from now as it is today and the decade ago that it was first written.
