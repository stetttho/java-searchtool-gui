 I have an array of powerful graphics tools ranging from Microsoft Excel's rich charting add-in, to Visio Professional and Harvard Instant Charts. Despite my technical skills that allow me to quickly produce just about any kind of chart or graphic imaginable, I was never such how to select the best graphic or chart to convey information in the most efficient way before I got this book.   This book is a catalog of ideas and a guide for selecting the best possible way to display information in graphical format.  Now, instead of floundering around playing with two or three ways to graphically depict information I turn to this book and pick the most appropriate graphic type.  My ability to communicate has dramatically improved because now that I have confidence that I am using the optimal method to display information I find myself using graphics not only more effectively, but more wisely.   Prior to this book my graphics tools were implements that more often than not produced inappropriate charts, giving credence to the adage that "A fool with a tool is still a fool".  Since this book I now use my software tools like a skilled craftsman who has the perfect blueprint.  With 450 pages of illustrations that show how to depict information visually in the best possible way this book is my perfect blueprint.
