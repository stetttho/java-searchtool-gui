 Easy to use program for making videos. While my favorite video creation program is Visual Communicator, this one has features that make it worth considering: It uses a 3-step process: (1) capture video from a  camcorder (digital or analog), TV, VCR, or web cam. (2) add video clips, titles, music and sound effects that are included with the package (250+ special effects & transitions, 250+ video clips  and 1,000+ sound effects and 200+ mp3 audio files come with this package). (3) save your video to tape, hard drive or CD. Requirements: Windows 98SE, Me, 2000 or XP, Pentium II Processor or Better, 128 MB RAM, CD or DVD drive and sound card. For digital capture you will also need a Firewire card or interface, and either a CD ROM writer of DVD writer to create video CDs and DVDs.  I don't have a DVD writer, so cannot comment on how well that feature works. Your system also needs DirectX 8.0 or later with Video Capture Update installed. This can be downloaded from Microsoft's DirectX homepage. Note that after installing this program you may have problems playing MPEG movies in PowerPoint. The vendor's technical support page explains how to correct this problem. The program does not support SuperVideoCD(SVCD) format, which you need to consider if this compatibility is important. The video clips and other multimedia files that come with the program make it a value.  While I prefer Visual Communicator over this, it's a matter of personal preference more than which is actually better.
