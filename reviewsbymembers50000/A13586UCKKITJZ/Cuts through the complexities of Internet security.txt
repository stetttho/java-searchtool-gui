 This book should be required reading for every IT professional because unless security is everybody's business there will be no real security.  The problem to date is that IT security is becoming increasingly complex, and the reality of Internet connectivity just adds to the complexity.   What makes this book so valuable is that it clearly explains the fundamentals of Internet security and its most important parts in terms that someone who is not a security professional can understand.  Aside from the complexities of security itself, factors such as cryptography, authentication and public key infrastructure and messaging are highly specialized and difficult for the non-practitioner to grasp.  Again, this book clearly explained those in such a manner that you "get it". The authors don't stop with a great discussion of security in general and the technical issues in particular, they next lead you through the development of a plan to address common exposures.  I like this approach. I also liked the response scenarios and advice for steps to be taken when you inevitably become a victim - and chances are that you will if your company is on the Internet (and what companies aren't these days?) This valuable 375-page book wraps up with a big picture view of a total security package and two appendices: one on available security tools and the other a computer emergency response team (CERT) report template.   I highly recommend this book to anyone in IT, especially management, because awareness is the first step towards an effective security program.  It is so well written and packed with great advice and information that it earns a solid 5 stars.
