 As I write this review I am still in class for Oracle OCP.  What makes this book so invaluable is that the class is fast-paced and often zips past important topics.  This book has allowed me to dig deeper into topics covered during class and fill in material that the instructor either missed or glossed over.  This book focuses on Oracle networking, backup and recovery and SQL*Loader. It not only gives the essentials in study format, but does an excellent job of explaining each of the topics clearly and succinctly.  Although I am using this book to get through the training and to also prepare for my OCP exam, I will also keep it as a reference when I begin putting my certification to use as a new DBA. I cannot make claims about how the material in this book addresses the actual exam since I haven't taken them, but it has significantly helped me keep up in a fast-paced training course.
