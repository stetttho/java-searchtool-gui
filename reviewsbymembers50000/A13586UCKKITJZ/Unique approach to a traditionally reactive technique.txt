 My background is information systems service delivery.  I stumbled across this gem when I was searching for resources on how to structure outage investigations for applications that did not meet service level objectives. Prior to reading this book I viewed root cause analysis as a reactive tool to be used to investigate the causes of failures.  The approach taken by the author is to also use this technique as a proactive tool in a manner similar to failure mode effects and criticality analysis (FMECA). Here is a summary of what how this book approaches root cause analysis:  it begins with a section on defining problems and collecting data. This approach allows you to take a proactive approach, especially if you are in an environment that uses statistical process controls to measure process performance.  This is augmented by a chapters on task analysis and event and casual factor charting. This is where the author's approach begins to resemble FMECA techniques, which are proactive versus reactive methods of addressing problems and risks. This is followed by chapters on interviewing and reporting. I particularily liked the chapter on interviewing techniques, which added a practical dimension root cause analysis.  I also liked the way the author used hints throughout the book to reinforce methods. The rest of the brief 135-page book is devoted to forms, worksheets and checklists that significantly add to the value or the book.  I would have liked an accompanying diskette with this material in electronic format, but the lack of it does not detract from the book in any way. If you want to use root cause analysis as a proactive tool in conntection with a continuous improvement initiative I recommend that you also consider Understanding Variation by Donald Wheeler. If you are seeking a more proactive approach to preventing problems in the first place you might consider augmenting  Root Cause Analysis Handbook with Failure Mode and Effect Analysis by D. H. Stamatis.
