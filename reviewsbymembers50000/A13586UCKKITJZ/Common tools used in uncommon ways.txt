 As an IT Consultant I am always looking for different methods to solve problems.  I found this book to be simple but yet valuable.  When I first started reading this book it took me back to a book called "Visualizing Project Management" where the authors Forsberg, Mooz and Cotterman use the process of "Cards on the Wall" technique to encourage group thinking and visually determine dependencies.  This book introduces an effective way to solve problems with Post-it Note. It starts off by showing simple key principles: (1) Chunking; capturing small information of data, (2) Problem Patterns, arranging and determining relationships, (3) Guiding decisions and keeping clear objectives, and (4) the *FOG* factor (Facts, Opinions, Guesses).  The core of the book provides 6 easy to use methods: (1) Post up, (2) Swap sort, (3) Top-down Tree, (4) Bottom-up Tree, (5) Information map and (6) Action Map.  Note that "Information map" has nothing to do with Information Mapping, which is both a registered trademark and different method owned by Information Mapping, Inc. These methods are represented graphically with many examples to help you determine which method is best suited to find the solution for complex problems. What I found most helpful in this book was the step-by-step procedures in every chapter.  Every method has a clear definition of what it is and how and when it should be used.  Grasping these methods will paint a clear picture towards the direction of a solution.  I recommend this book to those that are looking for an effective, yet simple, way of solving problems.
