 After 24 years in mainframes and a year as a consultant in the much more complex world of distributed systems I wanted an introductory text on EAI that addressed the technical aspects, but was not filled with an overwhelming amount of details.  This book was a perfect introduction to EAI for me.   As a service delivery consultant I was very interested in the chapter on business drivers because my job is to align IT to business processes, so the discussion of business drivers from the perspective of EAI was something I could immediately use. The integration approaches were familiar territory based on my background, but some of the approaches provided were unique twists that I had not encountered.  What I really liked was the chapter on architecture building blocks because I was able to see clearly what it takes to design, develop and implement an integrated enterprise architecture.  I also liked the way the authors presented messaging and transaction architectures.  I was vaguely familiar with messaging architectures from my IBM days (MQSeries), and a lot more familiar with transaction processing monitors and approaches. These two chapters showed me how to apply my existing knowledge and experience to understand EAI architectures.   This book gave me a good understanding of EAI in general, including the technical and business aspects.  It went neither too deep nor too shallow.  I am not sure how suitable this book will be for business managers because it gets pretty technical in places.  It also is probably too high level for someone who has EAI experience.  However, for someone with a technical background who wants to see EAI's "moving parts" and how they fit together it is perfect.
