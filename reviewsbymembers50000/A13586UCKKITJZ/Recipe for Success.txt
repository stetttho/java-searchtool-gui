 This is one of the most impressive, information filled books I've ever read.  It manages to distill all of the important issues and factors for e-business project success into less than 250 pages.  While it looks like common sense advice, everything in this book is anything but common sense because I recognized one pitfall after another as the author described them, and know from experience that most are underestimated during project planning, but inevitably come back to haunt you later in the project.  If you pay close attention to Chapters 4 (Main causes of e-project failure), 6 (Integration issues) and 10 (Avoid pitfalls in your e-business) in particular you'll save yourself a lot of grief.   Managing e-business projects cannot be done from an ivory tower.  Get this book and benefit from the author's obvious experience. A perfect companion to this book is Managing E-Business Projects by Wes Balakian, Keith Young and Rajesh Veerapaneni because it goes into the nuts and bolts of project management using PMI's PMBOK as a framework.
