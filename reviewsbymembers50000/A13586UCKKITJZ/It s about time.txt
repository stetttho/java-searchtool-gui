 Finally!  A book that answers the real questions about testing:  how to write and manage test plans. I had despaired of finding a good book that reflected the real work testers do, which is analyzing, strategizing and writing.  Indeed, the act of testing is only the tip of the iceberg of the testing process and this book shows how to do what testers do, and do it the right way. What makes this book so special is the way Louise Tamres shows the big picture in the introductory chapter, then leads you through the process of creating and refining test outlines that are used to develop test cases.  This is the most confusing part of testing for anyone who has been thrust into that role, and is made more confusing because many companies don't have standards.  The few times I have had to function as a test analyst there was no agreed upon approach, and it was like the blind leading the blind.  This book will prevent that from ever happening again because it clearly shows what needs to be done and how.  I like the way that simple test management tools like spreadsheets are used, because a lot of books on the subject cite very expensive test tools that are outside the budget of small companies.  This makes the book realistic and practical.  I also like the way each chapter is summarized, and the cases and examples are used to make the information real to the reader. While the book shows how to develop the plans and test cases it also shows basic test techniques, including testing various software environments (web, object-oriented, performance and load, and end-to-end).  These are like a compass to the new tester because they give a direction.  I also like the way that associated activities, such as project and configuration management are included because these, too, are things that the new tester needs to be aware of. If you're new to testing get this book and keep it nearby.  If you are experienced, you'll still learn a lot from the book.
