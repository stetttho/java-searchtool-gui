 This application uses Mind Mapping techniques as the core functionality.  As someone who uses Mind Mapping to take notes, examine cause and effects and to look at dependencies I like the way MindManager automates and expands upon the technique. If you're not familiar with Mind Mapping I recommend reading The Mind Map Book by Tony Buzan before investing in this software to make sure that it fits your personal style of analysis and knowledge capture.  Another book that is more aligned to the way this software works is Mapping Inner Space by Nancy Margulies. What you get is an easy to use, visual environment for capturing information and a way to display the information to spot dependencies, causes and effects and resource requirements.  If you are working on complex projects this is an ideal way to spot issues before they arise. It's also an effective way to run scenarios when developing strategies, or to communicate highly complex information that can be quickly understood. If you are working in a team environment the business or enterprise editions of this software are a better fit, especially if your organization employs Mind Mapping techniques as a planning and/or analysis methodology.
