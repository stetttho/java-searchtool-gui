 I found having the PMBOK in Adobe Acrobat format to be a real convenience and prefer it to the paper version.  Note:  while you can download a copy of this document from PMI's web site, it's a preview version that is missing chapters 2, 4-12 and appendices A through F.  Therefore, if you need a copy of the PMBOK 2000 version your options are to purchase either the CD ROM or the book. PMI has put a lot of work into this version.  Compared to the 1996 version this one reads better, shows clearer relationships between knowledge areas, and has been greatly expanded in some of the knowledge areas - most notably risk management and earned value project management.  The CD ROM version that I am reviewing has additional refinements that make this media easier to work with. The 1996 version in electronic format was a collection of standalone Adobe Acrobat files, this version is a single Acrobat file that makes good use of Acrobat's navigation features.   If your reason for buying the PMBOK 2000 is to prepare for the Project Management Professional certification you have two choices:  CD ROM or book, because this is the primary source of test questions.  Heed the previous reviewer's comments that the 2001 examinations will also use the 1996 version as a basis for test questions.  If you are buying this book to implement project management processes that conform to the PMBOK and work in the computer industry I recommend that you also look at Information Technology Project Management by Kathy Schwalbe. That book presents a project management approach for IT projects that is closely aligned to the PMBOK.
