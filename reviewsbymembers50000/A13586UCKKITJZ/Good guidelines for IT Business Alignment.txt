 There is nothing especially profound in this book, which is a collection of nine essays more than a cohesive book with chapters that segue from one to the next.  However, it does represent consistently good practices and valuable guidelines for every facet of IT-to-business alignment.   Among the strongest chapters, in my opinion, are: 3-How Senior Managers Assess IT Practices and Business Maturity, 6-Discovering the Link between the Information Orientation of Senior Managers and Business Performance, and 8: Information Orientation: A New Business Metric: Effective Information Use in Companies.  These three chapters capture the essence of IT-to-business alignment and provide insights on challenges and barriers, and how to overcome them. Each of the other chapters were well written and each contained additional insights. This book should be on the professional reading list of all IT managers, regardless of their technical domain.  It is especially applicable to CIOs and director-level IT managers. The importance of this book to those audience is the fact that achieving alignment is something that is much talked about, but rarely accomplished. This book places the key issues in context and provides some sound advice.
