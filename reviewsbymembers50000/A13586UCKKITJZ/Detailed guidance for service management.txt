 This is a milestone in IT service management literature because as stated by others it makes the ITIL/iSMF approach available to a wider audience that it has previously reached.  What I like about this book is the way each service support and service delivery process is carefully diagrammed using flow charts, and thoroughly described.  Using this book alone you can develop processes and procedures that are consistent with both the ITIL and iSMF.  That, to me, makes this book worth many times its price because it shows what service management is and how to implement it.   If you're a consultant who specializes in IT service management this book is essential.  If you're an IT manager or CIO who is exploring the best way to implement service management this book gives best and proven practices, and provides a framework for each process area. This book is also ideal for anyone involved in IT organization or reengineering, and in my opinion should be read by all IT professionals.
