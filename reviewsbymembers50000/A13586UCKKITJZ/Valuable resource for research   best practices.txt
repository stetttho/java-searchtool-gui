 This collection of essays is devoted to all facets of aligning IT and business.  While the central theme is integration of information technologies into the fabric of business processes as an enabler, the book touches on peripheral issues that cause you to think in much larger terms.  If you take the holistic view that is presented in the book you will be armed with information, ideas and knowledge to accomplish an organizational transformation that meets your unique business needs. Essays that I especially liked are: Section 1 STARTING AFRESH: "Linking Strategy and IT-based Innovation", which gives an interesting perspective on marrying technological innovation to business strategy; and, "Computer Supported Collaborative Working". This essay will spark some ideas on how to integrate systems and business processes. Section 2 IT AND THE LEARNING ORGANIZATION in its entirety is short, but contains a wealth of information for knowledge engineers.  In Section 3, INNOVATION, NETWORKS AND CORPORATE IDENTITY, the essay titled "Innovations as Precursors of Organizational Performance" is a fascinating study linking innovation to performance, with predictive indicators.  This is probably my favorite essay.  Section 4, IT AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE, is on the mark in all respects. Each essay contained information that was immediately useful to me for a project in which I was working. Who this book is for:  executive- and director-level management in both the business and IT domains will benefit most because of the strategic nature of the essays.  This is not to say that this book does not also support tactical-level initiatives, because it does, and also provides a foundation of thought and practices for managers who occupy lower rungs on the organizational ladder.  However, the most immediate value will be to the former group.  Also, business and IT consultants will find this book to be thought-provoking and a source of viable ideas.
