 The author made a valiant effort to explain how to impelement an enterprise information architecture, but falls short. I'll start with what I like about ths book: using a blueprint approach is appealing because I place a high value on design patterns, with which this approach is consistent.  The fact that the author bases his approach on the Zachman framework is another strong point. And it is apparent that Mr. Boar knows his subject. That said, this book has a lot of shortcomings:  it is inconsistent in detail - some places there is too much detail, and other places the lack of sufficient detail requires either a leap of faith or shows that the author just hasn't carefully thought the details through.  The writing style is muddled. Unlike other reviewers I have not read any of the author's other books, so I cannot comment on whether or not this is atypical. To me reading this book was a chore.  There is more emphasis on the author's approach than there is on actually implementing an architecture.  This, in my opinion, detracts from the book. For a well-written description of the Zachman Framework and how to implement it I recommend Melissa Cook's Building Enterprise Information Architecture.  For copious detail that is given is a consistent and accurate manner I recommend Spewak and Hill's Enterprise Architecture Planning.  Either of these books will provide a more complete. clearly-written approach to implementing an enterprise IT architecture.
