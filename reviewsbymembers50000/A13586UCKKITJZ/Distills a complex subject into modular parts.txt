 This book cuts through the fog of competing standards and methodologies in the software engineering domain.  It gives a clear picture of a process and associated procedures that can be effectively applied to any capability model (CMM, SPICE), process and procedures approach (TickIT, ISO 9000-3), and does so without drifting into any particular methodology.  This is a key strength. What I found especially valuable is the way the authors clearly illustrate processes as well as artifacts.  For example, the Quantified Product Integrity Attributes illustration in chapter 6 distills on a single page a highly complex concept into an easy-to-understand storyboard.  Another example, on the facing page is the Requirements Specification Evolution, which portrays a complex sequence in a single illustration.  Since the book has around 200 illustrations, most of which are page size, in the book's 745 pages, getting a clear picture of the software development domain and its associated processes is easy.  The text is clearly written and hits all of the key areas of software development, starting with business cases and project planning.  In this one book I have found processes, procedures and techniques that I can apply to both application delivery and service delivery for clients.  Also, for the first time I was able to clearly see the "big picture" and how carefully thought-out development processes can be used to deliver value to end users instead of mere applications. I highly recommend this book and give it a solid five stars.
