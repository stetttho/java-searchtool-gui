 This is one of the most authoritative, information-rich books on technical support that I have read - and as a consultant who specializes in service delivery and problem management processes I have read many. It hits all of the critical success factors in designing, implementing and managing an effective support organization.  It goes far beyond IT help desks - the material here is applicable to support professionals responsible for product support, technical services representatives in customer care organizations, and tier-2 support. I like the process- and business-oriented approach.  The book fully covers all of the parts of mature support processes:  people, process and technology.  It provides excellent insights into what you should be measuring and reporting, and how to handle gaps in your support processes. Also, in view of the high turnover in experienced support professionals that most organizations suffer the section on staffing alone is worth the price of the book. It is obvious that the authors have grappled with this critical issue and they provide sound advice on how to overcome the people aspect of technical support. As a consultant I found the planning and budgeting section to be a big help - the information contained here will not only allow you to determine support costs (which should be factored into product prices if your organization is supporting a product), but also how to effectively manage the cost component of technical support.  If you are a consultant, this section will also give you some ideas on how to craft an effective value proposition for providing outsourced technical support services. This book makes a valuable contribution to the technical support profession and adds considerably to the general body of knowledge. If technical support or service delivery is your business you need this book.
