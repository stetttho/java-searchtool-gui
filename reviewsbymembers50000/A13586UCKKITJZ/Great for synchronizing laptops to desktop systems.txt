 This program does one thing, and does it well:  allows you to synchronize files and folders of more than one system.  I use it to move files to and from my Windows 98 laptop system and my Windows 2000 desktop PC, which is especially handy because I work on some projects on my laptop, and when I get home I prefer continuing on my desktop PC. It's a lot like the older LapLink program, and works in much the same way.   Key features include: total support for Windows 95 through XP, which means that you won't have to worry about compatibility between or among systems. Load a copy of both systems, attach a bi-directional parallel cable and go.  A few things to watch out for are: (1) Make sure your parallel port is ECP compatible.  This is an issue with older systems, especially those running Windows 95, and also make sure you use the cable that is included).  (2) If you're using Windows XP you may have to download a patch from the vendor's web site.  Although the vendor listed on this page is Enteractive, Inc., it's really made by Business Logic Corporation.  Other nice features include: it only takes up 1 MB of hard disk space (a refreshing change from the bloated utilities from other companies), it automatically detects port settings, and the split screen view of both systems. If you own a laptop and desktop system, and work on the same projects on both this is an essential program that will quickly and easily make short work of file syncronization.
