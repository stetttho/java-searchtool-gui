 This book is not about cell phones, but something far more confusing that those marvels of technology. It's about the services provided by competing providers, and how to choose the one that's best for you.  What I like about this pocket-sized book is that it's like having a consultant who understands the ongoing struggle between service providers who are trying to sell you something, and the confused consumer who is trying to make sense of the dizzying array of offering - most of which contain misleading ads and fine print.  Most importantly, though, it leads you through the process of selecting a provider and service plan that meets your needs and is best suited to your lifestyle. Highlights of this book include: simple, straightforward structure and text boxes of pointers and checklists on practically every page, the fact that the author anticipates every conceivable question you may have (and answers many that you wouldn't think to ask), and isolation of the important issues and considerations for selecting the right service plan. Although this book isn't really about phones, the equipment is covered in a succinct manner, including features, accessories and safety tips. I especially liked the glossary, which defines terms ranging from access fee to W-CDMA.  Many of the terms are technical, and many are familiar to anyone who has tried to make sense of their monthly bill (interconnect fees, local calling area, roaming charges). If you're shopping for a cell phone do yourself a favor and buy this book before you lock yourself into a service provider and plan.  It's an investment that will pay big dividends in both sanity and real money savings.
