 This 240-page book covers the key issues for managing project teams.  It covers the full range of issues and provides advice for managing project change, team dynamics and cultural diversity, and developing effective project teams. It goes into areas such as how to inspire team performance, and how to develop self-managed work teams, then transform them into self-motivated project teams.  It also contains self-assessment exercises that are valuable checkpoints as you follow the advice in the book. Most of the advice is common sense, but the material should be read by every practicing project manager at least once a year for a reminder of what's important.
