 Real women use notepad.exe to do HTML.  Unfortunately, because remembering all of the tags and special characters, even real women need help every now and then.  This quick reference guide is my constant companion when I am hacking away on my web page.  It's well laid out and packs a lot of information in four pages.  I frequently refer to the special characters section, but have also picked up a few tricks from the examples that are crammed into this guide.  It even covers cascading style sheets, making this a wonderful accessory for a geekette.  I also highly recommend "Web Design Color Reference Card" also by Bob Stein and available from Amazon as a companion to this guide.  If you've ever struggled with getting the right color using hexidecimal codes, you'll appreciate the color reference.  Together this HTML reference and the color reference card will make you a genuine MLCMF when it comes to HTML coding.  Five stars and my strongest recommendation.
