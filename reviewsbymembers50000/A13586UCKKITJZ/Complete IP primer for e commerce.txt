 This is a complete primer on intellectual property and its value to the enterprise. Key issues that are addressed include: Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)- this is probably the most important discussion in the book because it continues to be controversial. Complete discussions of all aspects of intellectual property law as it pertains to cyberspace.  The clarification of the protections afforded to patent holders that are not given to trademark holders is invaluable.  In addition, I learned much about the value of patents and how a business model can be developed around patents alone. I particularly liked the discussion of patent ownership (employee inventor vs. company to which the patent was assigned).  This alone makes the book worth reading. Case studies - many of the case studies which are used throughout the book focused on pending court cases when the book was published. Many have now been resolved, the resolution of which open more questions and further cloud issues.  I'd like to see an update or second edition that provides closure. Excellent introduction to technical issues.  The author has a knack for reducing the key elements into easy-to-understand chunks of information that teach non-technical readers quite a lot about technology. If you buy one book on intellectual property law from a cyber-business perspective, this is the one to get.
