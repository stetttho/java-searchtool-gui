 If you have a Palm, ewven an older one, and are suffering from "Pocket PC envy", you'll love this valuable application.  While it will not transform your Palm into a Pocket PC, it provides a close approximation of the MS Office suite found on the newer Pocket PCs and will increase the functionality of newer Palm models and other PDAs that run PalmOS (Handspring, Sony CLIO, etc.), and breath new life into older models.  I am using an older Palm VII and this program has made it more useful than other.   What I love is the ability to download and display Word and Excel files, but more important, I like the fact that I can create documents that are compatible with those programs running on my PC. Another thing I like is the fact that this program works with every version of Windows from 95 through XP.  Note that you need to be running Hotsynch manager 3.0 or higher and PalmOS 3.1 or higher to use this program.  You'll also need a DVD on your PC because that's the media on which the program ships. If you own a Palm, and especially an older one, you'll love this program.
