 This 244 book fills in the gaps in the PMBOK 2000, and also provides complete coverage of professional responsibility topics and requirements.  It's designed as a 120 hour course of instruction, and is focused on the important knowledge factors that you'll encounter on the PMP exam.   It provides clear and complete explanations of the PMBOK 2000 core concepts without the fuzziness or verbosity that characterizes the PMBOK.  It also contains exercises and practice exams to help you prepare, and gives tips on what to study, including material that will be on the exam that is not covered in the PMBOK.  What I like about this guide is the lack of fluff, the focus on learning the exam and the preparatory advice that is given.
