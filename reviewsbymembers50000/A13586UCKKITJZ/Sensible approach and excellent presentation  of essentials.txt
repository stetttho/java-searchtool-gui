 The simple model that is described in this book is straightforward and represents a viable, effective starting place for establishing process-oriented management.  However, in my opinion the best features of this book are found in the chapters on fundamental knowledge and background material. Section One, in particular, is one of the most readable and accurate summaries of the economics of IT management I've ever read.  If this section alone was read and understood by IT managers and consultants, and then put into practice it would go a long way towards improving the way IT supports their business constituents.  The material covers subtle and not-so-subtle aspects of investing in the right initiatives for the right reasons, and will cause any IT professional to alter the way they view their role in an enterprise. Psychology of IT management covered in Section Two is equally valuable.  It accurately portrays the separation of concerns of both IT and business, then provides tools and techniques for aligning the two.  Entire books have been devoted to this subject area, yet the author manages to capture all of the important points in a mere 26 pages. The sections on understanding problems and understanding change also stand out as exceptionally well-written recipes for managing two key elements of any process-oriented approach to IT management.  The material in these two sections are directly applicable to anyone who is involved with implementing an operational model based on the ITIL. While the model presented in this book is not 100% consistent with the ITIL, it is close enough, and if properly implemented will give a solid foundation for an ITIL-based operations management paradigm. If you work in IT operations this book is one best investments you can make.  It's short enough to be quickly read, and is rich in knowledge and techniques.
