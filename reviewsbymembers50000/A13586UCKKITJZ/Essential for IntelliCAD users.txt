 This book has two audiences: (1) Those who are exploring IntelliCAD as an alternative to AutoCAD or augmenting an AutoCAD shop with less expensive IntelliCAD seats. (2) IntelliCAD users. For the first group this book comprehensively explains the similarities and differences between AutoCAD and IntelliCAD, including the limitations of IntelliCAD and some workarounds. If you're an IntelliCAD user this book is both a tutorial and a technical reference manual.  It leads you through installing and configuring IntelliCAD, and how to use every feature, both basic and advanced.  Like most high end CAD programs IntelliCAD has a steep learning curve, and the bulk of this book is sequeced as lessons to train you in how to use it. If you're coming from an AutoCAD environment the learning curve will be less, but this book is still valuable because it has numerous comparisons between AutoCAD and IntelliCAD throughout. It also covers advanced features such as file types, how to effectively use the programming languages built into IntelliCAD, and a plethora of advice and tips on digitizers and other programmable tools used in conjunction with then program. If you are responsible for developing training materials or training IntelliCAD users, especially transition training for former AutoCAD users, this book is a ready-made resource that can be used as is.
