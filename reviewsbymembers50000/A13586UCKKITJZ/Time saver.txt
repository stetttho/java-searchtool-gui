 This incredible program has proven its value by allowing me to synchronize my phone data in my Palm VII and Nokia cell phone.  The PC application is a simple screen that allows me to read information from my phone, edit and save it back, create new entries or drag and drop entries from my Palm address book.   Another valuable feature is that I have all of my phone data backed up on my PC, so if ever I change phones I don't have to manually enter all of the numbers from my old phone - I merely have to upload what I have saved on my PC to the new one.   If you use a call phone that's supported (I have a Nokia, but a Motorola version is also sold here) this could be one of your most used programs, especially if you have a lot of numbers, or frequently add, edit or delete them.
