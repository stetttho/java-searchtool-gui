 Open source developers will enjoy this site because of the links to tools and related resources, and managers and industry followers will like the articles and editorials. I found the tutorials useful.  Most major topics ranging from CSS to XML are covered.  There are also tutorials for VBA (a surprise), UML and SQL. The site also has book reviews and a user forum.  The forum requires you to register to post messages, but you can browse through all topic areas as an anonymous visitor.  This part of the site is in a continually evolving state according to information posted.  It is functional and has a good deal of content, and has the potential to become a vibrant community. It's the editorial on the opening page of the site that grabbed my attention. The operator is astute and deeply understands the industry, both open source and shrink wrap software.  This feature alone makes the site worth a visit.
