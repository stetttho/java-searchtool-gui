 This book integrates SCM and application delivery/service delivery promotion and release processes in a single book.  The highlights include: (1) clear descriptions of software configuration management processes and strategies, (2) exit criteria for release of software into production, and the macro view of all of the relationships between and among development, QA and production. Chapters I particularly like include 5, Defect tracking, which can be used as the basis for an integrated issue management system specification; 6 and 7, modularized system integration and change control, which ties together the processes necessary to interface development and production - two different aspects of IT that seem to be on different planets, and 8, release classifications and numbering, which provides a sane and logical numbering strategy. As a 25+ year veteran IT professional I learned much from this book, and found the material equally suitable for IT professionals across the full spectrum of skill and experience levels. This is a one of a kind book that bridges development and production, and will give practitioners in both organizations a common vision and insights into the challenges and requirements that are unique to each group.
