 While this book does a reasonable job of explaining the key knowledge areas of the Fundamentals II exam, I found "OCP: Oracle9i DBA Fundamentals II Study Guide" by Doug Stuns and Matthew Weishan to be more complete and in depth.  I used that book during my OCP training as a primary reference for Fundamentals II. I've read through this book, which I got when I purchased the OCP Oracle9i DBA Certification Boxed Set, and found it to be reasonably accurate and adequately written. I would say that both books have unique strengths and weaknesses and choosing one over the other is more a matter of personal preference.  The advantage to this one, however, is the value if you get it as part of the boxed set.   Among the strong points of this book are the self tests and practice exam questions.  Weaknesses include poor editing, which seems to plague this series, and the inconsistent writing that is at times extremely clear and others quite obtuse.
