 This is a small, information-packed book that contains a collection of tools and techniques, and an overreaching method. The tools are standard TQM and process improvement implements, and are augmented by forms and templates that anyone who is tackling process improvement can quickly put to good use. These tools are classified by use: problem identification, analysis, brainstorming and consensus, etc.  The author shows not only when, but how to effectively use the tools, and gives clear examples.   The overreaching method that is communicated in this book is: (1) when possible perform improvement activities in parallel, (2) activities that are sequenced can often be improved by examining the sequence and determining if it can be changed to promote greater efficiency (and reduce cycle time), and (3) pay attention to process flow and look for barriers and interruptions that need to be removed. I like this book because it is short and to the point, is densely packed with information (even if a lot of it has been published elsewhere), and the author's approach which is to pay attention to seemingly minor details and perform rigorous analysis using the easy-to-use tools he provides in this book.
