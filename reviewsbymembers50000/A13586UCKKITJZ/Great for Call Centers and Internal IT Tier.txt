 This book is aimed at software product support specialists working for software vendors, but is also applicable to internal IT tier-2 support specialists (application support analysts). Some of the information contained in this book will give internal IT help desks ideas on customer satisfaction, support models and help desk management. However, this is not the book's primary audience. My review is from the viewpoint of an IT service delivery specialist.  Product support specialists will have a different, but loosely related, set of requirements.  The theme of this book is achieving customer satisfaction. This surfaces early in the book and recurs throughout.  Since customer satisfaction is the foundation of support, regardless of from whom of where it is delivered, I found this to be one of the highlights of the book.   Call management models outlined by the authors were valuable to me, and I found myself writing notes in the margins and highlighting paragraphs.  I skimmed call management implementation because it is outside of the scope of my speciality, but did note that this information would be of interest by anyone who is setting up an internal IT help desk.  It goes without saying that this material will be of keen interest to product support organizations that are setting up a call center.  One nice touch here is the advice on disaster recovery planning - this is too often overlooked by all organizations and showed the attention to detail that the authors gave when writing this book.  The discussions on packaging support programs and product call center support organizations gave me insights into the challenges faced by software vendors.  These insights have armed me with information from which to craft an approach to effectively deal with vendors who are typically at tier-3 from an internal IT point of view.                         Another section that I found particularly useful covered managing software bugs and code fixes.  This material is directly applicable to internal IT tier-2 support, regardless of whether they are dealing with internal developers or outside vendors.  There are some gaps here, though. For example, I would have liked a discussion on configuration control boards, prioritization of fixes and enhancements, and configuration and change management.  These subjects are important to software vendor product support organizations and internal IT tier-2 folks. This book also provides sound advice on selecting, justifying and implementing call center tools. Some of these tools are specific to product support call centers (and to an extent, internal IT help desks), such as phone systems and knowledge bases.  Other tools, such as bug tracking and problem reproduction environments, are useful to IT tier-2 specialists as they are to call centers. I found some of the appendices to be especially valuable: Appendix C, determining staff levels, and D, creating and justifying a support center budget, were excellent reading that added to my own professional knowledge. Overall this is a valuable book that has multiple audiences.  Aside from the gaps I mentioned above, I think this book needs to be updated to reflect the growing requirement for e-support.  While I was tempted to give 4 stars based on the noted shortcomings, this book is so thorough and rich with ideas and advice that it deserves 5 stars.  I only hope that the authors update this book with a second edition that addresses current realities of software support.
