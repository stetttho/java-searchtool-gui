 I purchased this program because I wanted a drawing application that could handle 3-D and wireframe drawings - things that are difficult-to-impossible to do with Visio, which I use for most of my technical illustrations.  The price was right and the fact that it was first developed by Visio (before Visio was purchased by Microsoft) convinced me that this was a good deal.  I like the user interface, which is easy to learn (I also purchased a book titled Using IntelliCAD 2001 to reduce the learning curve), and there is a discussion group on the Internet that is frequented by experts who can answer questions if you're stumped. Although this program is positioned to compete with AutoCAD, and is priced far below that program's steep price tag, my needs were much more modest.  However, IntelliCAD does handle AutoCAD files, and has most of the features, including built-in programming language support (AUTO Lisp), does complex line types and most other basic CAD features that are essential for production quality computer-aided drafting.  If you're looking for a powerful and cost-effective alternative to AutoCAD IntelliCAD may fit your needs.  If you also need  photo-realistic rendering, raster image display and display of ACIS solids you may want to look at the professional edition of IntelliCAD, which also includes integrated Microsoft VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)and integrated document management capabilities.  I strongly recommend getting a copy of the book titled Using IntelliCAD 2001 with this program because it serves as both a tutorial and technical reference manual.
