 The fact is that this book covers business rules from an implementation approach, and does so in great detail. If you are new to business rules you should first read Business Rules and Information Systems: Aligning IT with Business Goals by Tony Morgan, which is better for beginners.  That book introduces business rules at a basic level. This book expands Morgan's work by drilling down into details and exposing the nuances that a seasoned practitioner will appreciate.  However, the main value of this book is the way Ms. von Halle steps you through the complexities of implementing business rules as an organizational methodology.  This is not an easy task, but she manages to provide a complete and comprehensive approach that will guarantee success if carefully followed.  I think the work breakdown structure alone that is provided in the book makes it essential to anyone who is tasked with implementing business rules.   In addition, the tables, checklists and documents and information from the book's web site add even more value.  This is an important book about an important topic.  It's not easy to read, but the diligent reader (assuming prior experience) will find everything he or she needs to know about business rules, the value proposition for using them, and how to implement them.  It's the most authoritative book on the subject, and will probably remain so for years to come.
