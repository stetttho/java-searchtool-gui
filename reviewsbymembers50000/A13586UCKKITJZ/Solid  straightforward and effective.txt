 This is my third book by Mr. Page and it does not disappoint. I started with his Achieving 100% Compliance of Policies and Procedures, which is best suited for advanced policy and procedures developers in quality environments, and followed with his 7 Steps to Better Written Policies and Procedures.  The latter book is better suited as a training manual or quick reference guide. This book, however, is a straightforward "how to" book, and it gives procedures for writing policies and procedures that are effective and clear.  What I like about this book is Mr. Page stays focused on the basics, and sorts out the key issues.  If you've never written policies and/or procedures this book will step you through the process with no fluff.  That doesn't mean the book is terse.  On the contrary, the book explains in necessary detail how to develop policies and procedures that reflect best practices.  Having read all of Mr. Page's books, and also having an extensive background in policy and procedure development, I can attest that the approach is mature and will assure success if followed. As with other reviewers I've noticed a few typos and convoluted sentences.  However, these did not detract from the book's value because they did not change the context of the book's content or make it difficult to follow.  If you need to write policies and/or procedures and have never done it before get this book and follow it.  You'll be impressed with the results using the approach, and you'll also benefit from Mr. Page's extensive knowledge of the subject by avoiding false starts, as well as producing documents that are solid and clearly written.
