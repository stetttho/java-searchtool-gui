 This is one of the easiest ftp programs I've used and it has some surprising features that put it in the same league with more expensive programs.  For example, you can edit a text file right off a remote server, set UNIX file permissions and perform remote file maintenance if you have authorization to do so on the remote server.  These are advanced features that one doesn't expect in an entry-level ftp program. What makes it easy to use is the fact that the user interface is similar to Windows explorer, with all of the same functions, including drag and drop.  However, what sets this ftp program apart from any that I've used is its ability to connect to multiple remote servers simultaneously.  That puts it in a class in itself. I've used a number of ftp programs and this one has become my personal favorite and the one I recommend.  It will not overwhelm inexperienced users with a bewildering array of options, yet does everything power users need.
