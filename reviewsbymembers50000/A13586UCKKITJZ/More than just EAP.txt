 Other reviews of this book are valid in that Enterprise Architecture Planning is an invaluable resource for developing an enterprise-wide architecture.  However, this excellent book is also an invaluable resource for the service delivery practitioner. While the Zachman Framework is a recognized approach to enterprise architectures, it is also a excellent tool to anchor processes and procedures for delivering service and support for applications. The notion of application profiles are an excellent paradigm from which to develop problem management processes in support of enterprise applications. Ideas and concepts set forth in the book are aimed at the enterprise architect, but can also be refactored into building blocks for a service delivery plan that is tightly integrated into applications delivery.  The above statement is based on my definitions, which are:  service delivery is the set of processes that IT provides support for reliability, availability and infrastructure support that is aligned to business imperatives and requirements.  Applications delivery is the processes employed to manage business requirements and translate them into products (developed or purchased).   This book provides a sound framework for achieving the above objectives, which I am sure were not the authors' primary intent. So, while this book provides the enterprise architect with a proven approach based on a proven framework, it has additional value.  Specifically, it also provides the production services and operations functions within IT with a valid approach to integrating service delivery with applications delivery, and aligning them to business requirements.
