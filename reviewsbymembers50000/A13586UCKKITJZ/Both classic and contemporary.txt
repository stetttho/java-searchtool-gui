 Computer books written in 1997 are either obsolete or classics.  This one is a classic and a timeless one at that because it gives a straightforward approach to development projects that is consistent with best practices.  Best practices are usually born from lesson's learned from disasters.   While there have been criticisms that this book might not be up to the realities of web development, I believe that the inverse is true:  too many web development projects are initiated before they are properly planned, and are not effectively controlled because of unskilled project managers.  But that's a personal opinion.   What you will find in this book that is applicable to any development project, regardless of whether the goal is a web- or e-commerce-based system, client/server or host-based.  What you get is a structured approach to planning and estimating using proven methods (as opposed to pulling numbers out of thin air), excellent advice on organizing and motivating (and protecting) a project team, and how to manage delivery and release of a quality product.  What I particularly like is the life-cycle framework, the controls provided to manage scope and product integrity and the emphasis on testing, release and quality.  However, much of this can be mined from other books.  What sets this book apart and makes it a classic is the wealth of tips and checklists and the way the author weaves his experiences into the approach.  What makes this book effective is the copious advice given throughout about dealing with politics, people issues and other project and career killers.  This book is about surviving projects and if the advice liberally sprinkled throughout is heeded it will go a long way towards helping you to do just that.
