 Mr. Braithwaite has distilled a business-oriented approach to IT planning and implementation into 150 page book.  The central theme is to ensure that any potential investment in IT technology is thoroughly examined against technical, operational and economic factors.  This approach is straightforward and is aligned to system development life cycle model that is based on the waterfall model.  This alignment is shown in the book's table of contents: Requirements for Quality Information Systems The Principles of Quality Management Prevailing Conditions in the Information Technology Industry Automating the Business Requirement Requirements Definition Phase Alternatives Analysis Phase Design Phase Construction and Integration Phase Inspection and Approval Phase A secondary theme is to examine each of the three factors (technical, operational and economic) using an iterative series of feasibility and trade-off analyses.  The approach is to perform these analyses at each stage of the life cycle, with an emphasis on performing the most rigorous analyses early on in the requirements and design stages. I like this approach because it is a straightforward process, enforces due diligence on the part of decision makers, and focuses on business aspects instead of technology. I'm impressed that the author was able to articulate such a sound approach in 150 pages, and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a method of ensuring that investments in technology are business driven.  It earns an easy 5 stars.
