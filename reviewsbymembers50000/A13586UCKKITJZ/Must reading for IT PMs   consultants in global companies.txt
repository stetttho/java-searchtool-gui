 This is am important work for anyone responsible for rolling out large-scale systems on a global or local scale.  The book's tone is somewhat academic, but the issues and factors that it addresses unquestionably applies to real-world challenges. The two parts I liked most are chapter 4 (crossing cultural boundaries) and chapter 8 (deployment timelines).  The cultural boundary issue addressed in chapter 4 can also be applied to corporate culture as well as national and ethnic cultural boundaries, and the information provided in invaluable for anyone who works in the global domain or is a consultant who has to adjust to each new client.  Getting past the culture and internal politics is a fact of life and not addressed in most books to the degree it is in this one. Chapter 8's treatment of deployment timelines is an excellent resource for project managers.  The associated checklists provided in chapter 9 are especially valuable as well. Overall, this book is a valuable addition to the scant body of knowledge on deploying large-scale systems and solutions, and is must reading for anyone who works with global companies as an IT project manager or member of a global project team.
