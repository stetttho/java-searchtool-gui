 This book introduces security and privacy to technical and non-technical readers alike. What I especially like are: - Social aspects of security and privacy are addressed using the motives of attackers and broad profiles of attacker types, analysis of threats and countermeasures, and what it all means from legal and social perspectives. - Easy introduction to security infrastructures. The author imparts a good deal of technical knowledge without overwhelming non-technical readers. This book may initially disappoint technical readers who have read Mr. Schneier's earlier book (Applied Cryptography), but I can assure you that the technical underpinnings are only part of the picture.  This book gives a complete view of all aspects of security, and is invaluable because it raises awareness of all issues. It's all the more valuable because it can be read and understood by a broad audience. There are two other books that I recommend in addition to this one: "Know Your Enemy: Revealing the Security Tools, Tactics, and Motives of the Blackhat Community" (Mr. Schneier wrote the preface to this book), and Richard Hunter's "World Without Secrets: Business, Crime and Privacy in the Age of Ubiquitous Computing".
