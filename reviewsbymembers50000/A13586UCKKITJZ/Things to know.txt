 If you are upgrading from an earlier version you may want to consider that Corel is now the vendor for this product.  However, you would be well advised to take advantage of this upgrade from Micrografx and follow their registration procedures, which will get you under Corel's support umbrella. Reasons to upgrade include: - More stable - More templates - Full VBA support Of course, once you've used this product in any version you become addicted to the user interface, making the upgrade all the more sensible.
