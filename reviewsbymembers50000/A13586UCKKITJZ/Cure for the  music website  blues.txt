 When [a music website] went offline because of legal issues I found myself missing it, and contented myself with using search engines to find tunes I wanted.  This program, unlike [music website] which was a peer-to-peer music exchange, seeks out music titles that may be hiding on the Internet.  WHile it lacks the convenience I enjoyed, it does a pretty good job of ferreting out files I'm seeking and also has some surprisingly nice features that aren't available from a search engine, such as: - ability to preview music before you download it - will not display deal links (search engines hold a lot of dead links in their cache, which you don't find out about until you try to download and get the dreaded File Not Found error) - maintains a list of sites where you previously found files You can narrow your search to any of the following file types: Windows media, Real Audio Media, MPEG 2, MPEG 3, MP3, WAV or MIDI, or you can have the program search for any media type. No, it's not [music website], but it's better than anything else I've tried since that system went offline.
