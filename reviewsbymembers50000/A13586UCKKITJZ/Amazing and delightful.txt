 If ever there was a killer application looking for a market, this is it. Visual Communicator has business and personal uses that will allow anyone with the right equipment and a touch of creativity to make compelling presentations in the business environment and send greetings to friends and relatives that are far beyond what one can do with paper. It's also useful for proposals, training and just about any other use that will be enhanced by visual communication. What it does:  it is a self contained environment for creating videos - not merely editing them.  What it requires: You'll need the following minimum hardware and software to install and use the software: Windows 98, 98SE, ME, 2000 or XP, a Pentium III processor or equivalent, a 16MB AGP graphics card with 3D acceleration and Internet Explorer 5.0 or above.  For interfacing camcorders you'll need a video input card, such as a Firewire or analog capture device that is compatible with your camcorder. You also have to make sure that the interface has a Windows DirectShow compativle driver. Creating a video CD requires a CD ROM writer and video CD software (I use EZ CD Creator, but most other CD ROM writing software has this capability - you need to check before you buy however).  Visual Communicator produces AVI files, which can be streamed across the internet or placed on a CD ROM for replay. The package also includes a 130-page book titled "Personal Broadcasting Handbook" that is filled with tips and techniques. I am impressed with this software because it's easy to use, and delighted by how easy it makes creating videos from scratch.
