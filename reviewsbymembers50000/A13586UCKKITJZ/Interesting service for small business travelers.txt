 You're not getting a program, but a service that you may or may not find useful.  What it is: the e-service starter kit is a subscription to OmniEdit's service that hosts an editor on their servers and allows you to connect to your webpage and make fast edits using their easy-to-use editing tools.  The OmniEdit service is on their servers, which connects to your web page using ftp login and password information that you provide. There are a few limitations, such as if you are an AOL user you'll need to access the service through Microsoft's Internet Explorer after you've initiated your AOL session with AOL software.  However, this isn't a limitation of OmniEdit as much as of AOL. You can make quick changes to your web site, save the HTML files and you're done. This is not a bargin for the average home user, but can be a real value to small business owners who travel (you can access the OmniEdit service from any internet connection), and who need to make frequent updates to their web pages. You can upgrade this starter kit to an annual subscription that will save a substantial sum over the monthly fee, and you can also upgrade to their OmniUpdate service that allows multiple people to work on the same pages, provides basic content managment services and other professional features.
