 The heart of this book is a readiness framework that blends assessment, strategy and tactics and project planning. The focus is on business and customer value. I like the way the book starts, with a look at the big picture, defining your goals, and complete look at all stakeholders.  The beginning also introduces e-business models, the readiness framework itself and a quick sanity check to test your readiness. This is followed by a more detailed look at the "eBiz Readiness! Framework" and its major parts: stakeholders, components and enablers.  Also addressed are knowledge management, trust and technology, all of which are interwoven into the fabric of e-business.  I especially liked the framework metrics, which include benchmarking, customer and business metrics, and how to manage the metrics as indicators.   What makes this book practical is the map given to applying the framework for implementation of e-business processes and systems, and once implemented, how to effectively manage using an evaluation framework.  The evaluation framework covers both small- and big-business perspectives in the form of stakeholder assessments.  Also addressed in detail are trust services (perhaps the cornerstone of e-business), security, and related issues.             Another aspect of this book that I liked very much is the coverage of the e-business stakeholder model and governance, which spans topics such as globalization, socioeconomics and your defined market.  This sets the book apart from those that seem to focus on technology without a regard for the bigger picture. This book is an invaluable resource to both business planers and IT because it balances the business and technical issues, both of which are addressed, in assessing e-business readiness.
