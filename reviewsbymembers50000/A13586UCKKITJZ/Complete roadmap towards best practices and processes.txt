 This book provides a macro view of a comprehensive architecture and then systematically decomposes it into its component parts. The scope of architecture goes well beyond the technical underpinnings by extending to processes and tools. The first section covers an overview of "netcentric" computing and ties it to business imperatives. "Netcentric" within the context is all encompassing and fits within e-business and the older client/server paradigms. Technical components are thoroughly dissected in Section II, and are placed into the framework of processes and services. I especially liked the operations architecture discussed because it is often overlooked. Another excellent chapter in this section covers transition frameworks, which addresses some of the thorniest issues faced by CIOs and operations managers as systems evolve to fit the e-commerce and extended supply chain models that considered contemporary. Section III thoroughly covers designing and implementing solutions, and is, in my opinion, completely on the mark in all respects. The chapter on testing is the best I have ever read - even in books devoted to testing. I had always been frustrated by the ambiguous use of the term "test cycle". The description and approach provided in this book clarified the concept and provided a clear roadmap for a sensible testing process. The final section covers special topics and does so in a thought-provoking manner. Each relatively short chapter compressed a lot of relevant information on the chapter's topic. It was akin to attending focused seminars on security, knowledge management and the other topics covered. This book is a desk reference, consultant's life saver and solid description of an architecture. It can easily serve as the specification document for an IT reengineering project and is nothing short of amazing for its completeness and thoroughness.
