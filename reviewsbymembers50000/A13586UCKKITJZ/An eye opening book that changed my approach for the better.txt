 The approach outlined in this book has completely changed the way I tackle developing on-line documents.  I have extensive experience in a technique called Information Mapping that is an analysis and document design methodology for paper documents.  In many ways the authors' methods are similar to Information Mapping - at least at a macro level. After reading this book I've gained an appreciation for the vast differences between paper and on-line documentation.  My "paper-based" thinking before this book resulted in a waste of the underlying capabilities of an on-line document.  The authors show how to use technology to vastly improve your reader's efficiency and overall experience when seeking and reading the information you create.  If you are used to writing for paper-based publications, or have deveopled on-line pages using nothing but intuition and judegement, this book will completely change your way of thinking.
