 This book is ideal for the busy professional who want to improve his or her writing skills because it teaches the art of clear and concise writing.  What I like is that the authors practice what they preach.   The book is short and to the point.  It's also easy to read and reinforces each key point with writing drills.  It also covers common mistakes, how to structure business documents to clearly and effectively get ideas across, and makes the process of writing fun. If you need a quick refresher on writing or just want to tighten up your business correspondence this book may be one of the best investments you can make. It certainly sharpened my skills and taught me valuable techniques.
