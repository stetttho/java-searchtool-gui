 This has to be one of the most sensible, best written books on performance measurement ever written.  True, it's less than 100 pages and any single topic in the book would merit 100 pages, but the way the author clearly presents the information and his gift for explaining complex topics and concepts in simple terms makes this a valuable resource for those of us who never seem to catch up on our reading backlog. Highlights: (1) Part 1's chapter on The Balanced Scorecard manages to capture the essence of Kaplan's and Norton's seminal book on that subject.  (2) All of Part 2, including measurement models, defining metrics and the three-step method given by the author are invaluable tools.  (3) Part 3's Using Metrics to Improve Performance is on the mark in each of the chapters. Likewise, Part 4's Advanced Metrics is excellent because the treatment of process and capability metrics makes these two topics understandable (I had a hard time grasping these topics in other books). This book earns 5 stars and goes on my short list of books to recommend to clients and colleagues.
