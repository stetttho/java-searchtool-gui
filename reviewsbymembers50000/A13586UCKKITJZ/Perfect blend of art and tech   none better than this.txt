 I purchased this book primarily to learn page layout and design, and to become more proficient with working with graphics. I got much more than I bargained for!   The authors have created a perfectly balanced book that will appeal to the artist and geek alike.  I learned more about the artistic aspects of layout and design from this book than I have from a pile of others.  I also received an in-depth education in the technical aspects of creating and modifying graphics, and a large number of techniques for having both graphics and speed - even over a relatively slow modem connection.   Other interesting things I learned while reading this fascinating book are how to effectively use fonts, colors and multimedia.  Other techniques that I learned and quickly incorporated on my web page were Javascript rollovers, effective use of tables and forms.  Before reading this book I though these topics would be difficult to learn.  The clear explanations and procedures given by the authors made it easy. I also learned how to do image maps, which is not hard at all if you follow the procedures outlined in this book.   I strongly recommend this book to anyone from beginner to advanced web page developer because there is something in it for everyone.  The examples on the CD ROM were invaluable, and the tables and references (not to mention tips throughout the book) make this my sole reference and the only one to which I now refer.  Five stars for exceeding my expectations, making the difficult easy, and wonderfully clear writing.
