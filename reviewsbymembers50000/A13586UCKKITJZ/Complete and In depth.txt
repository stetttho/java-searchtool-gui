 This is not one of those books filled with pep talks and exhortations to overcome stage fright or thinly veiled Toastmaster "how to".  It's about the realities of delivering technical presentations as either the speaker or the coordinator of a presentation.  To be sure, it does address some of the basics, such as how to clarify your message with an outline, dealing with hostile audiences, and how to create effective visual aids that reinforce your message.   What sets this book apart, though, is the way the author addresses the logistical issues, which can be a coordinator's nightmare.  The advice given is born of experience and enduring the last minute pressures of getting on a plane to do an unplanned presentation the next morning. As life would have it, such events depend on luck and demonstration equipment or software functioning perfectly. As Murphy's Law would have it, these events age one rapidly.  But the author thoroughly covers all of the issues and factors, including scheduling and logistics and how to coordinate the complexities of preparing the site.  He also goes into minute details of site selection and optimum room layout, audience (and speaker) comfort and safety and coordinating multiple speakers.  Here is an example of the level of detail the book goes into, showing how well thought out the material is: managing speaking events in multilingual audiences or guest speakers requiring translators.   To a presenter this book is valuable; to an event coordinator or road-warrior presenter this book is a jewel.  It covers topics and situations you rarely think of until you've been embarrassed a few times, and is clearly and cleverly written.
