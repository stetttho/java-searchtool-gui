 This book represents the most complete and comprehensive approach to total quality of any I've read on either software testing or software quality assurance. Highlights include: - A structured quality cycle based on Plan-Do-Check-Act.  This cycle is the foundation of continuous improvement, which is the theme of the book. - Complete description of testing techniques - in this respect the book is an encyclopedia for software test professionals and a definitive reference. - Comprehensive resource for forms and checklists (I wish these were also provided in soft copy on a CD ROM or author's web site, but they are not). - Full view of metrics across every aspect of the development life cycle. In the same manner that the testing techniques are encyclopedic, the metrics are also an encyclopedia for SQA professionals. I've used this book as a reference, and it had a heavy influence on a reference chart a colleague and I developed for depicting life cycle key metrics.  It does not confine itself to testing alone, and in fact, has something for production services and service delivery professionals, as well as project managers involved with large scale development and implementation projects.  You would have to buy at least a dozen books or download thousands of documents off the Internet to get the information contained between the covers of this book.
