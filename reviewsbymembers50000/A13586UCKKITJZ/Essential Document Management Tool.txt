 This is a must-have program is you scan documents or receive faxes on your PC.  It takes optical scanning recognition (OCR) to a level I never thought possible, and is a quantum leap from the OCR software that comes bundled with most scanners.  ScanSoft, the manufacturer, claims a 40% improvement and from my experience I will not dispute this.   What I love, though is the fact that it handles columns and tables by doing a near-perfect conversion.  It will also save your scanned files as HTML, which is a real plus if you have a web site and want to quickly add pages without creating them from scratch. Adding to the power is the ability to import Adobe PDF files and convert them into Word documents, as well as to export your scanned documents as PDF files.  This feature is convenient, but does not fully replace Adobe Acrobat 5.0, which does a lot more (see the Amazon product page for a fuller description of this software). Other strengths is the "despeckle" module that will read scanned documents that have smears and other imperfections that will confuse other OCR programs. I am using this software on a Windows 98 Second Edition system with a Canon CanoScan N650U USB scanner (the scanner is available from Amazon), and have been nothing but pleased with it.  If you handle documents, especially faxes or paper, this will be one of your most essential tools.
