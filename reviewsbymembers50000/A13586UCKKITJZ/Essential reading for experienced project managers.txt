 Regardless of whether you are a PMI certified Project Management Professional (PMP), or a PRINCE2 Practitioner, or hold any other project management certification, this book will improve your skills. It does not replace knowledge or process areas on any of the existing project management approaches, but, instead, shows you how to tailor an approach that best fits project objectives.  In many ways the approach in this book is more similar to the UK PRINCE2 standard because of the emphasis on project organization and stakeholders. For readers who hold the PMP certification this book's distinction between methodologies and frameworks, and how to select and implement the most effective methodology will add coherency to the PMBOK framework upon which the certification is based.  The author's approach does not supplant or alter the PMBOK process areas.  It indirectly shows how much each process area should be given during the life of the project.  It also fills in gaps in the PMBOK approach with respect to project organization.  This material can also be effectively used in a PMO.   The project templates and techniques are invaluable tools for any project manager.  I have one issue with the book:  the URL given for the downloadable templates is a dead link.  However, I believe this is one of the most important books published in recent years, and it is most useful for experienced project managers who can appreciate the in-depth information the author imparts.
