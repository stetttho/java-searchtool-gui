 Let's play stump the consultant.  Here's how it's played: read this book first, then ask your consultant or consulting company to define portal.  I am willing to bet that he, she or they will devolve from the smooth-talking, jargon-dropping demigods to a mumbling characters who drop into doubletalk.  Why?  Everyone is talking about portals, but few understand what they are, or for what purpose they can be used.  This book, Corporate Portals, will explain not only what a portal is, but how this technology can leverage corporate knowledge across all lines of business. This book does an excellent job of explaining portals as a technology and a corporate tool. It also gives you all of the information you need to develop a compelling business case to invest in a portal implementation. The book's focus is on leveraging knowledge and creating business value.  Strong points are the sections on IT analysis and how it is linked to business processes and business requirements. The section on financial metrics analysis reinforces this focus.   Specific parts of the book that I particularly liked are: identification management, how to develop and implement a portal strategy, and the example portal project plan.  I strongly recommend this book to business process owners or executives having to deal with consultants who are recommending a portal as the end-all solution to problems.  This book will arm that audience with enough information to ask intelligent questions at the very least, and possibly control the conversations and negotiations.  If you are a consultant, get this book so you are not blind-sided by a savvy client.  Regardless of which side of the fence you are on, client or consultant, this book will provide invaluable information that may lead to significant competitive advantages and a more intelligent workplace.
