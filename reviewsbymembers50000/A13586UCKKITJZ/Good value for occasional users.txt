 This is not an integrated package, but a value bundle of ten of ProVenture's products (Business Cards, Brochures, Stationery, Postcards, Web Page Designer, Mail List, Label Maker, Invoices & Estimates, Database and Business Legal Forms). None of the programs are best in class, nor are they especially suitable for heavy professional use.  However, for occasional use (i.e., running off labels or making a batch of business cards for a small business owner), this collection is more than adequate and represents a cost-effective bargain. As someone who infrequently makes labels and brochures, and runs off a batch of business cards about every three months, I found this collection to be a time saver (over performing these tasks by hand), and a money saver (since most of my printing runs are too small to get a good deal from a printer).  If your situation reflects mine then this pack is a worthwhile investment.  It you plan on using any or all of the applications on a daily basis you'll be better off selecting more professional packages.
