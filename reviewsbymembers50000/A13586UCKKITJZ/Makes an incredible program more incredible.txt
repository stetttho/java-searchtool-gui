 When I reviewed the SureTrak program here last may I considered myself to be an experienced used who fully understood the features of that powerful PM application.  After reading this book I found out that I was only using a fraction of the features that are built into SureTrak. For example, while I knew that it supported multiple calendars.  This feature gives you absolute control and is especially useful when you're using subcontractors or multi-national resources. Until I was stepped through it by the book's lessons I didn't know how to fully exploit its power.   It was the same for reports.  SureTrak includes reports for every conceivable management style and project type.  The problem is there are so many that it's difficult to select the ones best suited to each project's unique requirements or your PM standards.  This book clearly explained the reports and clearly explained how to create custom reports in the unlikely event that what you need isn't already included.  I also learned a lot from the lessons on resource management, as well as the author's tips for project management in general. If you're using SureTrak you should get this book because it's a safe bet that you're not using everything it has to offer for planning, scheduling and control - and this book will reveal them.
