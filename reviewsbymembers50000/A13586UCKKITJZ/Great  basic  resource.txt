 This book gives a viable testing process and some excellent artifacts that will get new test engineers and QA specialists quickly up-to-speed.  Although the title claims that this book is an *automated* web testing toolkit, there is little test automation coverage.  However, getting past the title, this book does lay an excellent foundation for testing processes and procedures. The artifacts on the CD ROM add to the value, and although more experienced software test and QA personnel might find this book basic, I think that it does an excellent job.   Among the things I like most include the system independent approach that the author takes - UNIX and Microsoft technologies are given equal and unbiased treatment, and the tools that the author does use as examples reflect her objectivity. While some may lament the fact that this book is basic, I believe that the "basics" are sorely needed in the web environment because the testing that I have observed isn't rigorous if it's done at all.  From that perspective, this book may be basic, but it introduces web development and support teams to a methodical approach to testing and its importance. As long as you know the strengths and weaknesses of this book you can make an informed purchasing decision.  If you are an advanced QA practitioner, or are seeking information on automated web testing this book will probably disappoint you.  However, if you are feeling the pain of poor web QA (defects routinely caught after code or content is released), or need to learn the basics of web testing, then you might find this book to be a valuable resource.  In my opinion the artifacts on the CD ROM alone are worth many times the price of the book.  Your opinion may differ. This book merits five stars for the right audience.
