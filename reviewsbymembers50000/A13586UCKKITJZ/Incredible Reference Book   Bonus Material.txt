 There is nothing in this book's title or product description that indicates that it teaches XML programming.  If that's the type of book you're seeking I recommend "Definitive XML Application Development" by Lars Marius Garshol.  If, however, you're an architect, chief technical officer or IT functional manager this book will provide you with one of the most complete and comprehensive descriptions of XML that's available. What you get is a thorough examination of XML, from its SGML beginnings to what it has evolved into, how to use it to solve real business problems, and the related specifications.  Because this book is over 1200 pages it can be overwhelming.  However, you need not read it in sequence, or even cover-to-cover to get value.  It's a reference and a business case combined, and is best used as a resource in the architecture group or shared among developers who need to ensure that what is being developed is in line with W3C specifications. In addition, the overwhelming array of applications that come on the two CD ROMs will save a lot of time downloading trial copies from their vendors, and give you many choices to evaluate for internal use.  It also saves expensive developer (or consultant) time and corporate bandwidth. If you work with XML you'll find this book to be one of the best general references you can own. Better yet, get "The Definitive XML Professional Toolkit", which contains this book and two others, and you'll have a ready-made XML reference library.
