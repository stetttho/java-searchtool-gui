 If you want to learn about one of the most effective documentation development methodologies, or research early pioneers in the document development field, such as Robert Horn, this site is worth visiting. Another reason to visit this site is to purchase software that aids in using the Infomation Mapping approach to documentation development.  The current offering is Formatting Solutions Pro 2.o, which works with Microsoft Word 2000 through 2003.  This software also fully supports the approach described in "Single Sourcing: Building Modular Documentation" (ISBN 0815514913), and "Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond" (ISBN 0201703726). The whitepapers and articles in the Resource Center section of this site are also invaluable, and cover topics ranging from content management to standards.  An interesting set of articles worth reading if you are a technical documentation specialist for a company about to be merged or acquired is "The Writer's Guide to Surviving a Merger: Demonstrating Your Value".
