 After I finished reading this 259-page book I kept thinking of how it was organized and how the author presented the material.  Although I have been exposed to, and worked within, quality frameworks throughout my 25-year career this book triggered a clarity that brought together the essence of an effective quality program.  This happened when I drew an analogy between the book's contents and approach, and constructing a building. First, the book starts with a chapter titled "Elements of a Complete Software Quality System," which is the foundation.  It then covers what I think of as the building blocks: standards, reviews, testing, defect analysis, configuration management and software documentation.  It then fills in gaps, much like mortar, by covering associated quality concerns.  Each of these "building blocks" and the "mortar" are thoroughly discussed in separate chapters.  The actual construction comes in the final chapter titled "Quality System Implementation". This book is copiously illustrated and the writing is straightforward.  Although my analogy may be somewhat distracting, nothing in this book is - each chapter stays focused on its topic and goes into considerable depth.  The author provides you with a solid foundation, quality materials and a blueprint for creating an effective quality organization, and does so in 259 pages.  This book earns five stars for the influence it had on my thinking, and has my highest recommendation.
