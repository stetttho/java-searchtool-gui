 I love this program - it lives up to its name.  You literally click and burn and viola! Music CD mastering with no learning curve.  I was using Adeptec's Easy CD Creator Pro, which is powerful but not very intuitive for beginners.  I've used this program to make compilations of my favorite songs from my CD collection, back-up my PC, and make data CD ROMs for clients and associates.  It's fast, works well with USB and IDE CD burners, and is reliable. Using Easy CD Creator Pro I had problems with USB CD burners when other USB devices were attached.  I haven't had that problem with this program, so if you're burner is USB and you're having problems with other burner programs you should give this one a try.  I give it 5 stars.
