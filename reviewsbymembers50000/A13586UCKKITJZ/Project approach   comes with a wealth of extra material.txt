 I like this book because it's a structured introduction to disaster recovery planning.  I used this book as one resource when writing a whitepaper on recovery management, and found that the structure of the book and project-driven approach allowed me to identify and clarify key issues. While there is nothing new in this book with respect to disaster recovery planning, the way the subject is presented makes this book valuable.   Among the key strengths of this book that I particularly like are: (1) the ten-step project plan will give anyone who is tasked with developing a disaster recovery plan a clearly defined roadmap, (2) checklists and forms that support each stage of the project plan are included on the accompanying disk, making your job a lot easier (most of them will require extensive tailoring, but the format and key content areas are valuable), and (3) the author drills down into detail in every project stage, which provides even more guidance. If you're tasked with developing a disaster recovery plan and don't know where to start, or are validating or reviewing existing plans, but are not a disaster recovery expert, this is an excellent resource.  It earns 5 stars for making a complex subject understandable, providing a clear plan and for the wealth of forms and checklists that come with it.
