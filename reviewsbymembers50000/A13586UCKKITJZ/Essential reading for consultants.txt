 As a consultant who lives from one engagement to the next one of the buzzwords as projects are wrapped up is "knowledge transfer".  It is almost like an afterthought and triggers some frantic activity to throw together a last minute plan, get the client's staff to absorb an array of information in a compressed timeframe, and sign off.  This book changes that approach for me, and does so in a big way. After reading the proactive approach to planned knowledge transfer, which needs to be a part of the initial project plan, I would consider the approach I cited above to not only be unprofessional, but borders on malpractice. This book treats knowledge as a valuable commodity (something the business development types certainly preach, but the engagement team misses), and provides a methodical approach to using knowledge as a the product.  Given the fact that we consultants are selling that very thing (knowledge) in a perfect world there should be no need for this book.  Unfortunately, this book is sorely needed, and should be required reading for every consultant, regardless of whether he or she is a independent or member of one of the "Big 5". Rarely do I read a book than makes a dramatic impact on my thinking, or fills me with resolve to immediately assimilate and use the content - this one does.  I think it is an important work that is well written and gives a strong foundation for ethical practices and professionalism.
