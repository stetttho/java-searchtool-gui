 I got this book with OCP Oracle9i DBA Certification Boxed Set, so I didn't specifically select it based on skimming at a bookstore.  Yes, it has errors. Errors notwithstanding (and there are many), this book has helped me greatly during my OCP training.  However, it's important to know what there are errors, and to read the errata, else you will question your own sanity. To be fair, the book has proven more helpful than not, especially since the OCP course I am taking is fast-paced and the instructor tends to gloss over information that is more important that I realized in class. Be aware of the fact that this book does have errors, make sure you read the errata and you'll find it quite helpful.
