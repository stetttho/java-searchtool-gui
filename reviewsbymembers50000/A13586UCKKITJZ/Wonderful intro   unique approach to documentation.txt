 I like this book for two reasons: (1) it steps you through what it takes to implement a quality system based on ISO 9001:2000, and (2) it shows how to develop your quality manual and documentation using Information Mapping techniques. First, the approach to ISO 9001:2000. The author clearly explains what ISO 9001 is and what to expect in the certification process.  If you're new to ISO 9001 (or 9002 or 9003) then the comparison in Chapter 2 between the 1994 and 2000 versions can be safely skipped, but if your organization is already certified, or wish to move from 9002 or 9003 to 9001, then the explanation of the differences is extremely helpful. Chapters 3 through 8 are standard fare that you would expect to find in any book about ISO 9000-series.  What sets this book apart is the clear writing and ease of finding information.  If you've read other books on the subject you know how dry they can be.  This book is as lively as the subject matter permits (believe me, *any* book on the subject is going to be ponderous reading). Chapter 9, Transition Planning, stands out as among the most valuable in the book (or any book about ISO 9000 in my opinion) because it covers the make-of-break issues for achieving certification. As an Information Mapping practitioner I especially liked the discussion of documentation considerations. I've long been convinced that Information Mapping and quality documentation should be integrated.  With respect to ISO 9001 there has been much reluctance on the part of companies pursuing registration to stray from the rather ugly standard format of quality documentation.  I hope this book changes that because the approach that the author proposes will add value to the quality manual by making it easy to read by all levels in your company, while keeping it 'assessor friendly' for certification and re-certification purposes.
