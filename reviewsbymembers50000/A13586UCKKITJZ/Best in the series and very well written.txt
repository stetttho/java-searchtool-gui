 This book is not only an excellent study guide for both the OCP classes and the exam, but a wonderfully written explanation of the complexities of performance and tuning.  Of all of the material I've read on this subject [for training and examination purposes], nothing has made more sense or been more enlightening than this book. All of the key elements of performance tuning are covered, the illustrations are excellent and aid in understanding, and the drills, self tests and practice questions have been a tremendous help.
