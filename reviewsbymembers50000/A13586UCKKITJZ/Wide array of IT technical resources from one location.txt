 The Tarrani & Associates and TEAM Zarate-Tarrani family of web sites were established in January 2000, and grew rapidly as single- and multi-page sites based on topics.  This site was established as a central navigation point for all of the non-commercial sites.

Among the topic pages you can reach from this site are: - Software Quality Assurance - Software Change and Impact Analysis - Performance Management & Capacity Planning - Software Engineering & IT Operations Service & Application Delivery - IT Security, BCP/DR & Information Warfare Life Cycle - Infrastructure and Project Management - Information Technology Management Newsletter - Project Management Newsletter - Technical Communications Resources - Business and Strategic Planning In addition to the above, you can also two weblogs that deal with software engineering (ASIN B0000A2TZN) and IT operations management (ASIN B0000AA2TV), and other content. If you are an IT professional in practically any discipline this site is worth bookmarking.
