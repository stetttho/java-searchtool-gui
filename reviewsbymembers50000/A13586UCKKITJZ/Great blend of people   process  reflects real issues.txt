 Skillfully blends the people and process aspects of project management into a systematic approach. This is important because emphasis on people to the exclusion of metrics is a sure way to have high morale while losing control of the project.  Conversely, emphasis on process and metrics to the exclusion of people will result in alienated people who will express their low morale in the form of missed goals and in many cases fabricating metrics. This book provides the necessary ingredients for managing the people and the processes, and gives excellent techniques for setting and managing to scope, and focusing on the end goal of the project - to deliver a system - by using task/deliverable combinations.  These are mature practices and, despite the growing number of certified project managers (PMP, PRINCE2 Practitioner, etc.), are still missing from most projects. I agree with a previous reviewer that by not using earned value project management techniques (which are now a part of the PMI PMBOK) the author has left a large gap with respect to controlling projects.  It's up to the reader to recognize this and either obtain information about earned value from the PMBOK 2000 or from a book such as "Earned Value Project Management" by Quentin W. Fleming and Joel M. Koppelman. Despite the gap this is an excellent book that accurately portrays the challenges of managing an IT project and gives you the tools, techniques and advice necessary to successfully deliver a system.
