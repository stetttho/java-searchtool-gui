 Visio 2000 is a powerful, feature-rich tool.  Even if you are a long time Visio user (I started with version 4), there are so many features and techniques that you rarely use and that's where this reference card comes in handy.  I frequently refer to it and almost always find the answer to basic questions I have.  True, this will not replace Visio's documentation or any of the excellent third-party books, but it is a lot faster than stepping through Help.  If you use Visio a lot you need this card.  It is also useful to Visio Professional version 5x users.
