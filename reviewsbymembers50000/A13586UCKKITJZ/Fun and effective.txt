 This 643 page learning aid is simple to use and highly effective. It's in near pocket-size format, with an upper spiral binding to use as flip cards.  On the face of each card is a term, and on the reverse is a definition.  It's designed for you to use simple, effective memory drills to recognize key terms you will encounter on the PMP exam and the correct definition.  The definitions are usually in bullet style and are consistent with the correct exam answers.   Key points: it reflects the PMBOK 2000 edition and also covers professional responsibility topics.  You may want to also get the audio tape titled "Hot Topics: Audio Way to Get Ready for the PMP Exam" and use both as an extra effective learning strategy.
