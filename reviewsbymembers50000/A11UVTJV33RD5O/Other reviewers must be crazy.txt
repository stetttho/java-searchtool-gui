 Let me start off by saying that I once worked for a year and a half for that twin bastion of rampant capitalism and fine coffee: Starbucks. Before that, I worked for a year at my local roaster (which was, inevitably, put out of business by: Starbucks). So I know my beans. This isn't some [expensive] Capresso contraption made of brushed chrome and Italian mongoose skin (or some equally ridiculous and utterly unnecessary "luxury"). And unless you're brewing 60 pots of coffee a day, I don't see why you would have a problem with it. It grinds the beans very well: too well, in fact, the first few times. Make sure you play with the grind setting a little before you risk taking a drink of whatever you just brewed (my first pot, thanks to my mistake of playing to the finer grind side, had the consistency of jet fuel and tasted like industrial waste: my mistake). But after you've gotten the grind setting right, having a good bean and a good coffeemaker will get you a fine cup. As far as other reviewers complaining about what a mess it makes, I have to wonder if these people have ever been around coffee grinds before. It makes no more mess than any other burr grinder I've ever seen, and in fact makes much LESS than any blade grinder I've used. This is the best bang for your buck that I can see on the market. Buy without worry.
