 With "The Eye of the World" tucked under his belt, Jordan had the fan base, the financial and critical success, and the foundation he needed as encouragement to make this series what he wants it to be: and with "The Great Hunt," he starts to spread his wings a little. This continues the habit of "Eye" of rambling over the lush world that he has created, giving each nation, each people a sharply distinct set of personalities, characteristics, even accents: what other series of books do you know of where you can immediately place the nationality of a character simply by the speech patterns of their first line of dialogue, or the cut and color of their clothes? Jordan doesn't hesitate to ratchet the action up a notch here, either. The book has more of an adventurous feel to it, whereas the first maintained a sort of cool nervousness about the whole thing (actually a clever literary device to keep you sympathetic to, and connected with, the main characters). Overall this is better than "Eye," not quite as good as "Dragon," but still worthy of five stars.
