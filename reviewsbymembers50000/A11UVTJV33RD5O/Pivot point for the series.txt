 This is, in my mind, the best of the first three books, and a total pivot point for the entire series as a whole. This is the book where the main characters truly come into their own, settling into and accepting their roles and fates in the world Jordan has carved for them from the depths of his own imagination. This book also starts a habit that Jordan continues through the rest of the series of more or less leaving a main character (or two or three) almost completely out of the book. When you think about it, it is a natural and necessary offshoot of the multidimensional world he has written: he has so many parallel storylines developing on so many different planes that to follow them all steadily through each book would be nearly impossible to write and dizzying to read. You can get lost in this series easily enough as it is. In this book...though the title practically screams otherwise...it's Rand that gets voted off the island, though to great effect. Jordan does a great job in "Dragon" of containing his sprawling habits: within a hundred pages, the storylines have been set, the characters cast in all different directions away from each other, and by the end of the novel are smartly and resoundingly drawn back together in pulse-pounding fashion. Jordan would do well, in fact, to revisit this lesson before inking another word of the now terribly overweight series (an odd parallel to the fattening of America: as we demand more food, so Mr. Jordan seems to think we demand more words. I for one say: not so!). This book stands proudly alone but serves mightily as a turning point for the now ten-volume epic. Start with "Eye of the World," and I guarantee that once you've finished "Dragon," you too will soon be groaning with the rest of us for RJ to end the madness and give the series a wrap.
