 One thing has become plainly evident over the last 2000 pages or so of Jordan's magnum opus: either he's lost his mind, or he's decided to write page after tedious page of filler simply to "filler" his wallter a bit more, or he actually died somewhere in the middle of writing book 7 and, like poor Schussmayr with Mozart 's "Requiem," it has fallen to some sap on whom history will turn an unforgiving eye to take the strands of genius Jordan laid out and try to bring them to a meaningful conclusion. Given the pace with which this series has been written over the past three books (words like "glacial" and "excruciating" are entirely too forgiving), all three seem plausible. Jordan plainly has vision. Nobody could manage even the first 4000 (top quality) pages of this epic without it. And he has talent, or bored readers would have given up at "Eye of the World" and we wouldn't be here reviewing book 10. But the series has begun to lose all focus and cohesion. It is possible, even likely that Jordan...for all his talents...has simply bitten off more than he can chew (word to the wise: dragging the storylines out won't help, try cutting a few down to size and moving toward a conclusion instead). We are left with a Brobdingnagian tour-de-force that is less tour and almost toothlessly devoid of force. It will take at least two more novels, I think, to bring this to a conclusion, but the suspicious conspiracy theorist/numerologist in me smells a total of thirteen. Thirteen as a number is given repeated emphasis in Jordan's writing, and I have a suspicion that finally, hopefully, blissfully, the series is closer to the end than not.
