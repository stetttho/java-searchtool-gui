 People who liked this movie must secretly be from the '30s. It's the kind of overly sentimental garbage that, rather than being uplifting, only serves to undo itself: it's so over the top that it is completely unbelievable. Much like "Patch Adams," I can best compare this to an emotional boxing match or an effective motivational speaker: it plays you like a violin, pulling this way and that, making you laugh when it wants you to be mirthful and cry when it wants you to be doleful. But in the end, after you've left, and you've had some time to digest, you realize: it can only play one song. And it's not even a terribly good one at that. The performances in this are strong, especially Joseph Mazzello's as Joe, the main (though not titular) character; Ashley Judd is perfectly cast; Ian Michael Smith and the talented Oliver Platt manage to keep up admirably. As other reviewers have mentioned, though, this overly-Hollywood adaptation of a stirring novel plays to all the wrong themes and emotions, and ends up losing any resemblance of a decent message in its stumbling desire to make you as sympathetic as possible before pulling your heart out through your tear ducts. Watch it with a grain of salt and then spend your money on something better.
