 Look - it's inevitable, so let's get the comparisons to the iPod out of the way right away. This is not quite as stylish; you cannot create playlists on the fly or play games; and...and... Right. If you are buying an MP3 player to be stylish, you are kind of weird anyway and form over function is a poor choice in technology. If you want to play games, get a cell phone with games or something. IF, however, you want an MP3 player that plays MP3s and WMAs, has massive storage capacity, is lightweight, offer easy control of functions, and at least for me has so far worked flawlessly, look here. iPods are overpriced. Simple fact. Plunk down the money for an iPod and you get a pretty little piece of mp3 player that can't play WMAs, gets annoyed if you try to circumvent iTunes, and has a battery that will most likely die on you in a few months (look it up, it's true). Oh, but that's ok - it's backed up by Apple's legendary customer service. By which I mean atrocious and feared customer "service." Get the Samsung. It's a good player. I admit that the FM transmitter is wimpy, but I didn't buy it to play mp3s in my car - and even if I want to, I have a tape adaptor from my satellite radio that works fine with the headphone-out jack on the YEPP. FM reception is great and you can record directly from another digital source with the line-in jack...and they include the cable! (something iPods do not), along with a (albeit meagre) carrying case, FM transmitter antenna, surprisingly decent earbuds, and the USB cable. Go ahead and get it - I highly recommend.
