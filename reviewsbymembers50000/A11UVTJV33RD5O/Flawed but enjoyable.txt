 Let me start by saying that I am a Kubrick fan: I like the ending that leaves you hanging. But this book doesn't seem to really END anywhere at all: it seems that after 800 or so pages, the author had simply run out of steam. The 800 pages preceding that, however, are sheer genius. This is a tour de force of a book. You'd think that somewhere in 800 pages of descriptions of Victorian dresses and parties and social life, you'd inevitably slip into a deep and peaceful coma: but Faber's imaginative writing and quirky twists keep you wide awake(amazing how a paragraph can go from a description of cake icing on a dress to a slightly...well, seedier comparison of the same stain, a la Monica). The plot itself is complicated but not ridiculous, and it is refreshing to see an author that will tackle such hefty matter with such grace and aplomb. However, the abrupt and rather muddled ending leaves you feeling like a long, amazing meal has been spoiled by a rather frumpy dessert.
