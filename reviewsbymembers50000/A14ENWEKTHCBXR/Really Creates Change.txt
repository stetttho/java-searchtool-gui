 I read this book a number of years ago and I keep coming back to it because of its terrific message. The book is layed out on a day-to-day format with short chapters that helped me to overcome difficulties and strengthen what I need to work on.  Perfect for reading first thing in the morning.   After the first time I read this book, many of my friends asked me what I had done with myself because I had changed so much.  Very positive and very empowering.   Look for the 6-tape audio cassette program too.  It's fantastic.  Great for the car.
