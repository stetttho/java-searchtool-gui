 Having been in the military before, I was sceptical that this book would cover real tips and tricks (I've read many that just only give generalizations and the very basics). While it may be more geared towards the Army/Marine branches, it is valuable to all candidates entering the military. If your going in the military, or know someone who is, this is a must-read!  It will give you a practical heads-up and put you ahead of the game. Enjoy.
