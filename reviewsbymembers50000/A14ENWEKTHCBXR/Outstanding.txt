 The complete "Unleash Your Power Within" 6 cassette set is not easy to come by.  Unlike some of Robbin's programs that require a stricter format, the 'Unleash' program allows you to excel at your own pace (bit by bit or all at once).   Each tape covers a facet of different topics ranging from 'Creating a Revolution in Your Life', 'Critical Q's to ask yourself', 'The three steps to creating lasting change'(...I could go on and on) and they are all arranged to bring you to the next step.  I liked this program because I could listen to it in the car and, when I got home/at work, I could pop open the guidebook and go thru step-by-step exercises.  They are short exercises, but very empowering. I began reading/listening to Robbins for years now.  I have listened to everything Robbins has published many times over and it's funny how I'll pop in a tape or cd and hear something completely new for the very first time (and then it 'clicks').  If your new to Anthony Robbins, this program is a great place to start.  For the pro's, it's a must-have refresher with a number of different concepts.
