 Can you believe the whole deal for $5...?  OMG!  Amazon has the best deal.  I went to Ebay and it was a good bid but extremely high s/h. I bought this for my nieces when my sister comes by to visit.  I love playing with them and their new Easy-Bake.  They take it very seriously (little Martha's?). This is the complete kit.  Every known cookie cutter, attachement, dish, but only 2 mixes and one frosting (be prepared to search for those kits.  Mixes can be homemade (will save you a small fortune) by way of Google. You will need to buy a CLEAR 100w lightbulb (not incld). Have fun!  AMMEND:  I just pulled up this old review of mine and noticed the current price is at $19.99.  When I bought it, it was $5.68 brand new from Amazon!!!  I have noticed this terrific error in Amazon's system before--a pricey digital camera for around $30.  Keep your eye's open.
