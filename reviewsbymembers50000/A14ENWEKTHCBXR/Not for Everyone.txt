 I've read a lot of negative reviews for this product and I was really suprised with them because I just received my 'Just A Trim' and I've had a great experience. I have VERY short hair, so, I may be the exception.  Being in the military, I need a buzzcut about once every two weeks.  The large buzz shears that I normally use are cumbersome and have way too many attachements. I like the 'Just A Trim' because it's easy to handle, portable, and has just the attachements that I need. The only downfalls that I see in the product is that it needs to be lubricated occasionally (with a silicone lubricant, or, WD40) and it also needs to be cleaned often (with the little brush that's supplied). I doubt this tool would work well with longer hair, but with shorter hair, it works great.  And keep in mind...it's not supposed to give you a haircut--just a trim.  Have a Great One!
