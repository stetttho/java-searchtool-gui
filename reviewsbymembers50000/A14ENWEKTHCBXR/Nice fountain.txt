 I agree with the other customers review--what's all the belly-aching about? I received my fountain via FedEx (explains the shipping charge) and assembled it in about 1 minute.  For me, it is an ideal size for my living room sidetable. This was a replacement for a slightly larger fountain that I bought from HSN 5 years ago.  I always thought that one was a little too large and awkward. The Pagoda Fountain comes with 12 polished river rocks.  I also put in a couple green sprigs from an artificial plant to give it a more natural look.  Have fun!
