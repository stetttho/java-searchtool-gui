 This hair remover seems to represent itself as a revolutionary depilatory.  It isn't--it's the same as Nair and a hundred other products on the market. I liked the spray feature and the fact that it works in less than 8 minutes, however, my courser hair still remained.  What's worse is that Epil Stop left a stubbly effect on the area where the hair was removed.  As far as the 'cucumber and melon' scent--BS!  It has the same stinky burning-hair smell as they all do. I experienced no irration whatsoever, but I would only recommend this product to people with fine to medium hair (just doesn't cut it with course hair).
