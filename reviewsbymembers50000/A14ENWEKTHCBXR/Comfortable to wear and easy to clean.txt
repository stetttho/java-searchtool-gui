 I'm going back into the military and need to get into shape.  My recruiter told me that he and other guys in the office used neoprene belts during PT and throughout the day. I was very sceptical, at first.  After the first weekend of using it, I have lost a little over an inch on my waist.  Suprised me--it really does do the job.   Unlike a few other belts out there, this one would fit nearly everyone AND is washable. Best of luck.
