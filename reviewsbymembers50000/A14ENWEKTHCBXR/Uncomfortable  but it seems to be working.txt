 I was very skeptical of this belt when I first ordered it, however, I fiqured that it was less than $20 so I didn't have much to loose. The belt has two sensors on it that are activated independently and can be shifted to different positions.  The sensors have a 10-level strength setting with 2 different programs.  The kit also includes diet pills, a VHS tape, gel, instructions, and batteries. I started the belt out on a low level and quickly jumped up the power (low settings are useless).  The higher the settings are set on the 1st program of the belt, the more uncomfortable it becomes, but, the 2nd program is great for me.  The first program is a fast pulsating beat that seems to burn, while the second program is an elongated pulse.  The belt is MUCH more comfortable when you are sitting and relaxed. The sensors work in 10-minute bursts.  Instructions recommend using them no more than 3 times in any given area per day. The kit urges the owner to buy into a membership where they automatically receive replacement diet pills, batteries, and gel.  It's not a bad membership price, but, you can also buy replacements seperately from the company or get batteries and gel from Amazon. I've been using the belt for about two weeks in conjuction with regular situps.  I noticed that my abdominal strength is substantially better, but, I still have too much fat on my gut to see any deffinition.  I've also used the belt on my back (have former back injury) and it feels great--like getting a deep massage.
