 I acquired a plantar wart on the botton of my foot while on the beach in Hawaii.  It wasn't visually noticable, but very painful.  I have tried all of the products especially made for plantar warts and they are all very expensive.  What's worse is that they all contain the same active ingredient:  Salicylic Acid (yeah--even those pads).   That's what Wart-off is--Salicylic Acid (17%) and alcohol.  It's the strongest that I have found, without needing a prescription.  Also, can't beat the price because, while the bottle is small, it goes a LONG way (you only need a few drops per application).  It works.  Good luck!
