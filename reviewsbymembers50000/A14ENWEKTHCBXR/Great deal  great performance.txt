 I was a little weary of purchasing a DVD player for under a hundred bucks, but I am familiar with Daewoo, so I figured that I had little to loose. After waiting a little longer than expected for the delivery, I cracked open the package and saw that it was the exact product that Amazon was advertising.  Better yet, it only took a couple minutes to hook up and a couple more minutes to set up the player through the on-screen display.  I tested the player out with a CD, and it sounded great.  Later, I rented a DVD and popped it in, hit play, and I was floored--the picture is terrific, the sound is great, and the options are wonderful. I have had this player now for one month and couldn't be happier.  It has many more options available than many others that cost much more.  Recently, I had some friends over who had recently purchased a DVD player for over $230, and they were really impressed by the quality of my Daewoo player.  When I told them that I got it for under a hundred bucks, they didn't believe me. One thing that I should state here is that if you have an S-Video hook up on the back of your television (looks like a circular computer port), this player has a connection port for that too.  However, the S-Video line is sold seperately.  It is NOT necessary, but will turn a great picture into a crystal clear picture and can be purchased at any Radio Shack.
