 I'm not sure exactly why people are complaining about the machine so much.  I've had my machine for 4 months and have had no problem.  Before this machine, I had an identical B&D HomeCafe unit that broke when I dropped it on the floor. I called Black and Decker, they asked me to cut the plug off of the machine and mail it to them.  Before I could get it in the mail, I received a brand new HomeCafe unit via FedEx. Black and Decker is a great American company with an incredible exchange policy that most other manufacturers can't match.  The coffee is great.  I don't like Folgers, but the Millstone is great.  Also, I have used the Senseo Dark Roast pods in the machine for the longest time and with no problems.  However, do NOT use the Melitta pods that are available.   They are packed too tightly and are a little too small for the machine.  I suspect some people here did that and busted their machine.  There is another product that can be used with the Homecafe called EcoPod (also for sale at Amazon).  Ecopods are little refillable pods that can be used with your favorite freshly ground coffee or canned coffee.  I purchased HomeCafes as Christmas gifts and have heard nothing but great things about them from family/friends.  They all use them on a daily basis and no one has ever had a problem.  Have a great day!
