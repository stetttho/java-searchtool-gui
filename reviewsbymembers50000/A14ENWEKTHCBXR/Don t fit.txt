 I love the design and light-weight feel of these earbuds.  I can't even tell that I'm wearing them. Unfortunately, the buds themselves are too large for my ear canals.  Instead of going in my ear, they just rest on against my ear canal.  So, I'm not getting the full effect of the bass and volume.  Since I've always worn earbuds and never had this problem before, I think it's a design flaw. I'd only recommend these to people who don't listen to loud music.
