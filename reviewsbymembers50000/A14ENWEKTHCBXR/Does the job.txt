 The kit comes complete with a couple freebies in it--software/video, photo paper, instruction booklet, and (best of all) head cleaner. As with all refill kits, be sure to use plenty of paper towels, newspapers, and rubber gloves if available. Important--some people think they have had bad experiences with refill kits becuase they don't give enought time for the ink to settle in the cartridge.  Depending on the cartridge, it may take up to 24 hours before the ink will flow through to the paper (this is especially true of color ink kits).
