 I was really excited when I saw this product on Amazon and had to have it right away because I love the idea of using my favorite coffee (Kona) in my machine. When I got my EcoPods, I packed them just as the directions indicated, using an espresso grind.  It was difficult keeping the little cups closed because they just snap together, but I finally got it. After popping it in the machine and turning it on, I noticed that liquid that came out was just water.  It was just up at the end that any liquid that resembled coffee started coming out. I tried this several times, using different methods--priming the pods in hot water before puting them in, packing the pods even tighter, packing the pods with less coffee...  Nothing! Most of the time, the water just seemed to flow through the pods without absorbing the coffee. I usually don't give negative reviews, however, advice to those thinking about EcoPods:  don't bother.
