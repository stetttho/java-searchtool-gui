 Maybe you have to LIVE it to understand it, but I know how Juliann feels. Having been in love with my male best friend, I was the one rooting for her as she schemed and connived to win the man of her dreams. I empathize with her as she realizes that the man she loves is slipping through her fingers, and that maybe if he just knows how he feels... Ok, so it isn't Academy material...so what? The characters are funny, they are real, and they are loveable. Cameron Diaz definitely deserves special recognition for coming off as perfect and not fake. She is really great at the end when backed into a corner - she comes out swinging and STILL manages to maintain that perfection!  All in all, a great movie that will make you laugh, and maybe if you've ever experienced unrequieted love, you can even understand what Juliann is going through.
