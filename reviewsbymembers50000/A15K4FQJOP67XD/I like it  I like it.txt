 I purchased this book when I was looking for something that would illustrate the different artillery pieces and guns used in the War Between the States. I must have looked at 20 different books in local bookstores but could never find exactly what it was I wanted. I like this book because it gives a basic diagram of the article being shown. Even though I know the parts of a gun and the way they work, I like to see that information spelled out so there's no confusion.  If you have even a passing interest in what life was like for the common soldier, this book should be on your bookshelf!
