 I love this movie, I make no secret about it; it is definitely one of my favorites! Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal make a great team and they play off each other so well, it's just unbelieveable! What I like best about this movie is that everyone can relate to some degree with what the characters are going through. It's a classic boy meets girl; boy & girl go their separate ways; boy & girl run into each other; boy & girl run into each other again and become friends ... It's a really fun film! I think it's one of the better Nora Ephrom films to date!
