 ... at least in high school. I thought Sonny a little depressing, but he is like so many I knew when I was a teen, it seemed perfectly normal that he was never really happy. Duane seems more focused, less prone to depression than Sonny, but he has a red-hot temper when it comes to Jacy, who doesn't love him but uses him nonetheless. Jacy is a snobby, conniving, user who wants out of Thalia so bad she can taste it. Her favorite past time is making her parents pay for living in a nowhere place. The adults are the most interesting people in the book, though. Sam the Lion, Mrs. Popper, the Coach ... those are the people you want to know more about but never really do. A great book for a rainy weekend.
