 It isn't, after all, her work. I guess that maybe the sequel shouldn't have been written, but it's been done and I'd say it isn't that terribly bad...  True, the book isn't GWTW. I didn't expect it to be, and if you expect it to be, then go back and read GWTW; skip this. But if you want to know what could have been possible, read this book.  All in all, I don't think this is a bad book. I wouldn't compare Larry McMurtry to Tom Clancy, and I won't compare Alexandra Ripley to Margaret Mitchell. However, the book is written well, the characters aren't that far off base and the story line is credible, if you take into consideration the times, the factors, and the general feelings of the era. Don't take this book in your hands and expect to find Ms. Mitchell in the pages. Instead, take this book and expect to find new characters and new situations that might just expand your own mind. And just in case you haven't seen the movie, or even if you have...skip it and read the book. The two are completely different and the movie is so lame it's unbelievable.
