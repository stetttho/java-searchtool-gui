 I am absolutely stunned at the people who have said that this can be held up to GWTW! Timothy Dalton a better Rhett?! Joanne Walley-Kilmer's accent AUTHENTIC?!?! What movie did these people watch? Have these people actually TALKED to people from the south? And how can ANYONE believe these things would have happened to a strong person like Scarlett O'Hara?  I was so very disappointed when I watched this movie, I stopped five times so I could calm down. It is so far off-base compared to the book, which in my opinion, made a better story and didn't sensationalize ANYTHING to the degree that this movie did. The relationship that Scarlett develops with her Irish family is underdeveloped, the relationship with Rhett is underplayed while she is in Ireland, and she comes across as a cold hearted witch.  I was excited when I first bought the movie, remembering the book I had read by Alexandra Ripley and I couldn't wait to watch the screen version. The entire movie is glossed over! It departs drastically from the book and leaves out so much. It turns Scarlett into a potential murderer, the victim a man who wasn't nearly so evil as he was portrayed in this horror flick. If you want to see what would really happen to Scarlett, read the book. I think it comes much closer to what would have been reality, and what Margaret Mitchell would have done with the story, had she chosen to. I wondered as I watched the movie if Ms. Ripley had been shocked and disappointed as I had when I watched, and whether Ms. Mitchell was spinning in her grave. It would have been better to leave Scarlett and Rhett an unsolved mystery than to visit this horror upon them.
