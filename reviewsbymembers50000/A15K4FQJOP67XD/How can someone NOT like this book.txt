 I admit it; I loved this book. It is my favorite of all the Larry McMurtry books, and let's face it, he has written some great books. Woodrow Call and Augustus McCrae are indelibly etched upon my mind for eternity. Call is among the most complex characters ever drawn, although it takes some amount of perserverance to learn that. I was amused that he found little use for women, and he didn't understand why men found them so difficult to resist. I loved McMurtry's description of him; he seemed like the kind of person one could count on, no matter what. He is steady, strong, silent ... a true man's man, I think. McCrae is the exact opposite of Call. He is loud, at times obnoxious, can't find a reason NOT to have a woman around, and also completely loveable. I enjoyed his almost constant chatter and his "learned man" attitude towards absolutely everything. I laughed myself to tears reading about Gus's sign. His loyalty is evident, particularly to his two pigs. I thought him a most interesting character. Add in Lorena, Newt, Deets, Pea Eye, the other cowboys, and Jake Spoon, and you have a heck of a story. There is no other western I've ever read that can compare to this, whether fiction or non-fiction. I highly recommend it, particularly if you are like I am, and enjoy a good Texas yarn now and again!
