 There are not enough stars in my opinion, for this book. I was thrilled to see a book that addresses ALL the issues of the Texas Revolution - the hesitance of so many of the "leaders" of the Army of Texas; Santa Anna's inhumane treatment of POW's; the intense dislike of superiors on BOTH sides of the conflict. I was thoroughly impressed with Hardin's work. If you want a concise, accurate view of the conflict from both sides, this is the book for you. I was particularly happy with the commentary from the Mexican side, since that is not something easy to come by on this side of the border sometimes. On a note of accuracy, there have been some who call to question de la Pena's account of the fighting. Hardin used the de la Pena diary in his research, and I commend that. When I was reading reviews for this particular diary, I was dismayed to see people discrediting it based on weather! Whether or not folks realize it, YES it has been known to snow, even in South Texas, and YES there have been recorded blizzards IN SOUTH TEXAS. This reminds me of that statement, just because you haven't seen a million dollars doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Or better yet, Isaac Cline's statement in 1891 that Galveston could not possibly sustain a direct hit by a hurricane. I'll take my soapbox home now, but if you're a fan of 19th century warfare, this is a book that is a must have!
