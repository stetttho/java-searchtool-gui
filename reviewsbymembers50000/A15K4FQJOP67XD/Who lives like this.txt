 Reading this book, I tried hard not to compare it to McMurtry's other works. I wanted this book to stand on it's own and not fall victim to the "It isn't Lonesome Dove" thought. I did manage to get through the entire book, though several times I threw it down in disgust. The story is lame, the characters are charicatures, but the worst part is that the only thing that was interesting about the entire book (Sonny's failing mental state) is left unsolved. Of all the characters I read about in this book, I was more interested in Sonny and why his mind seems to be slipping. Unfortunately, McMurtry leaves this (and many other items) as a loose end that doesn't get tied up.  In fact, NOTHING is really completed in this book. It meanders through the affairs of everyone in town, and everyone in town is having at least one affair. Duane's children are spoiled, bratty, and would probably have benefitted from reform school. His wife is the Queen of PMS and his former girlfriend needs prozac.  All in all, I'd have to say that Larry McMurtry missed his mark with this one. Had anyone else submitted such a story to be published, it would have been laughed out of town. I don't see any of the brilliance that this writer has exhibited in the past (even though I didn't compare the story itself to anything, I did search for signs that it was written by the same man). Read this if you want to see what life shouldn't be like, or if you have a couple of days of bad weather and nothing else to do.
