 As I read this book, I found myself wondering time and again how the United States government could have been so irresponsible, how the Native American Indians survived to walk among us today, and how these wrongs could be righted. Of course, I found no answers, only more questions, but this book put a spotlight on the problems Native Americans have faced for hundreds of years.  This book is written from the perspective of the Native American, many times in their own words. It is disheartening to realize that some of my ancestors treated others of my ancestors with such hatred and scorn. I don't believe that all whites were like the ones discussed in this book, but I do believe that many of them were, and that knowledge is discouraging. What I learned from this book, or rather, what this book reiterated to me, is that we should all accept others for who they are; we should embrace diversity; we should love our neighbors. Even though we may not always see eye to eye, this book showed me that we have to find ways to peacefully co-exist. The African-Americans were not the only ethnic group to suffer at the hands of whites; there were many more who deserve recognition as well.  I will warn you that this book is heart-wrenching and if you are looking for something that will make you feel good about the way the Native Americans were treated by the government in the 19th century, this isn't for you.
