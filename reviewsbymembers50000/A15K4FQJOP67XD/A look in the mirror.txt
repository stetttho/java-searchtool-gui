 Growing up on the upper Texas coast, this story was a staple of our childhood. We all knew the reason for the anchor at the entrance to the Texas City Dyke and the destruction that was caused as a result of the explosion of the Grandcamp and later the High Flyer. I worked at the Monsanto plant for a time after it was sold to Sterling Chemical, and the anniversary of that day is something everyone there takes very seriously. This book explores the reasons why this tragedy happened and the response of authorities under tremendous pressure. If you are unfamiliar with the tragedy, Hugh Stevens does a great job of walking you through the events leading up to the initial explosion of the Grandcamp and the subsequent explosion of the High Flyer.  This book should be required reading for everyone who lives/works in an industrial area, local authorities and government officials. While reading this, though, I realized that this type of tragedy is not relegated to the past. Something like this can happen again, even with the safety precautions. No industrial town is immune to this type of tragedy...
