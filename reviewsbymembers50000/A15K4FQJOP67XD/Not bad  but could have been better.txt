 I love Larry McMurtry. That's not to say I agree with everything he does with his characters, but I do enjoy his work for the most part. Streets of Laredo is a good book, but I was a little disappointed with it. I have heard arguments about why Lorena and Pea Eye shouldn't be married, but to me that works. I knew the ending of this book wouldn't be happily ever after, because Woodrow Call is old, and it's apparent he has to be put to rest, so to speak, for the series to end. But the explanations of what happened to the rest of the Hat Creek gang just didn't set well with me. Newt killed by his own horse? Dish, the top cow hand, running a store?! I was disappointed in what happened to the characters McMurtry didn't seem to want to deal with anymore, and I will admit to being shocked by Newt's fate. Anyone who has read the other books in the series will understand why. But all in all, this is a good book. I found it easy to read, and these days that can be rare. I highly recommend this book to those who have read the other three books in the series. If you have not yet read them, pick them up first; read them in order, or else you'll find yourself re-reading them.
