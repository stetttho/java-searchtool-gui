 I purchased this book by accident, actually. I already had the Handybook for Genealogists and considered the two to be too close in content to justify the expenditure. I received an offer for the purchase of the Red Book at a discount and jumped on it, only to realize later what I had done. I thought about returning it, once it arrived. However, after sitting down and doing a side-by-side comparison of the two books, I realized that there is some very different information between the two. Both are quite useful, and if I ever question information in one (come on, that's what we DO) I have a second source to confirm the first. I find myself reaching for this book time after time, and not just to confirm info from the Handybook. There are certain things I find easier to understand in the Red Book, not to mention the different perspective offered. This book is, simply put, indispensible!
