 I use this almost every night. I have turned more people on to this than anything else I've ever purchased. If you love good, tender, tasty popcorn, you must have this! Since I am on a diet, popcorn is a staple for me. I have found that I can pop 1/2 cup of kernels in one teaspoon of oil! I like this much better than air popping because the quality is better, almost all the kernels pop and it's fun!
