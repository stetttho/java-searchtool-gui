 We bought a Mad Catz memory card, which was not recognized by our PS One. We then purchased a Sony Memory Card for PS One, which was recognized and asked if we wanted to format it. The PS One formatted the Memory Card and were able to save games such as Spyro: Year of the Dragon, Crash Bandicoot, and Spyro. The Mad Catz web site had suggested removing all but one controller and then trying it but we were pretty fed up at that point. Third Party memory may be cheaper, but it's certainly not better.
