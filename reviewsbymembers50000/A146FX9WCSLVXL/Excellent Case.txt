 The flipcase design protects my Palm IIIc quite well. Hopefully it will shield my handheld from drops like the one I just experienced with my Palm IIIxe in a Palm case. Unlike the Palm case which requires you to remove the unit from the case, leaving it vulnerable to drops, the Rhinoskin Combo Leather Flipcase allows you to swivel the case and detach it from a holster clip by pressing a latch on top of the clip. The unit appears to be quite sturdy, feels good in the hands, has space for credit cards or business cards, and provides easy access to the stylus, as advertised.
