 I had a Black & Decker hand mixer, which was underpowered and tended to splatter. I also ha a Black & Decker food processor, where cleanup was messy and food tended to stick to the sides of the bowl, resulting in a lot of waste. The Braun M880 mixer attachments feature a unique design which eliminates or minimizes splatter. An onion did not stick to the bowl of the chopper attachment and came out very uniform and finely chopped. I was able to knead dough for a pizza with ease. The amount of power in the blender attachment surprised me at first, tending to create a suction effect and drew the blender toward the bottom of the pot when I blended some tomatoes. The tomatoes also came out very uniform and nicely pureed. I've replaced two tools with one and have added functionality. Overall, this is an excellent product with a very clever design.
