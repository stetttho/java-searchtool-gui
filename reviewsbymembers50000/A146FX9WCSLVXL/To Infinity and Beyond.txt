 The DVD more than met both my son's (he's 7 and a half) and my expectations. For those expecting computer animation in the style of Toy Story obviously didn't pay attention to the trailers. The story is about the "real" Buzz Lightyear and not the toy in Toy Story. The characters are imbued with a lot of cleverness and imagination. XR is a great sidekick. I like Mira Nova's special powers. Booster is well played too. The people who are complaining about violence seem to have a distorted view of reality. Nobody dies or seriously injured in the movie. There are a lot of positive messages here too. Just to name two: good guys come in all shapes and sizes; you can do more working with others than you can by yourself - that applies to Buzz's new partners and to the LGM. The bonus material is good too. One of the games gives you a hint of who the villains will be in the TV series. The digital comic book is a nice touch, especially with the effects added in when you opt to have the story read to you. The song at the end by William Shatner and the Star Command Chorus was also a nice surprise.
