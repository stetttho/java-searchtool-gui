 I have just got this one a few days ago.The previous problems other reviewers have mentioned with this swing have been now resolved and the motor is VERY QUIET! also the mobile functions extremly  well.My son is 17lbs and it swings well even on the lowest setting! Great if you have a heavy baby. Go to toys R us and look for the quality approved sticker on the box .  The swing is exceptionally well made, very cool looking,and durable. The mobile is very nice ,(enough to keep a child busy for quite some time) .The music is   very calming :enought to make me go to sleep!!In fact i love this swing probably more than my son does:) (Just joking!)My son stays all day  content in this swing Without it he would drive me nuts! I had  the rubber ducky swing before ,that made so much noise it could keep  us  awake in another room! I exchanged that one for this one and i'm happy i did so.! Although pricey but well worth it's price! If you buy only one toy for your baby make sure this is it! You won't belive the peace of mind  and calm  in your home and i believe that is much more worth than 99$!!!!!(...)
