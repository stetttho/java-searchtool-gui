 Great Quality appliance practically fool proof.just put washed rice in it,water and 40 mins later enjoy! Not only it is a rice cooker but also cooks excellent rissotto, indian rice puddings,beans and rice, meat curry with rice You name it! Most useful appliance I have ever seen. The timer makes it even simpler as you can time it to make fresh rice when you come home although the keep warm feater seems to dry the rice a little bit if you are late to open it  and fluff the rice. . The cooker's titanium-coated, extra-thick, 2-1/2 mm non-stick inner pot with a round bottom provides even heat distribution and and prevents everything from sticking to it.Clean Up is a breeze.Looks very modern too with a electronic display .If you are thinking of buying a slow cooker  you can skip that and buy this instead.Sure it is expensive but the time you will save while  making your favourite foods with soon compensate for the versatility of this appliance.
