 This swing looks extremly cute ,but is unsafe.I fould my son's head  stuck in between the front and back bars! This is ridiculous!! I don't know why Fisher price can't make a travel swing that is safe for babies and can recline! This swing is too upright It also has NO head support for an infant!.By the time the baby can hold his head he will be too heavy for this swing! It will not swing my son who is 17lbs although the box says it works uptill 25lbs.. A cute design but needs some work.Fisher price rocks in its cradle swings but i don't know why they don't work on making their travel swings as good...I have tried the ocean wonders travel swing as well that turned out to be as big a disappointment at this one is....
