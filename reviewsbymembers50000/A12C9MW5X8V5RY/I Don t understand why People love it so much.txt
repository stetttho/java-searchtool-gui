 Pros one hand steering ,  Cons large and clumsy,akward 2 piece fold,not very stable,tipsy hard to fit inside small car  The Bottom Line Avoid it if you have -back trouble -limited on space  -small car  -busy -child older than 1 yr (too small for tall kids)  I was so exciteed about this stroller bought it after reading hip reviews and also liked the trendy style.Every Baby magazine I read protrayed this stroller as the coolest looking stroller on earth and used by all celebrities.But  soon after I got it i was not very happy....  This stroller is HUGE !!and very clumsy,It has a akward 2 piece fold,and is not very stable and tipsy It is very hard to fit inside small car.It would hardly fit inside my BMW 330i which is NOT a very small car!This stroller Is much BIGGER than it looks in pictures. To inform you this  stroller is NOT for you if you have back trouble or had an epidural recently as it can cause severe back aches from bending over to fold it and also hard to open chassis which takes a full 5 mins sometimes to open while standing on the street with baby crying inside the car! I ended up returning it within a week because I did not think it was worth the money. Although this stroller is projected to be very light weight and user friendly it is a complete pain to open and store .It weighs 26lbs also which is not very light weight in my opinion My friends also thought it was too large to steer inside stores and malls.In fact I got more annoyed looks of store owners than compliments....because the tires are HUGE If you need a stroller look at strollerqueen.com where there are tons of reviews for other better strollers which are much cheaper than this one and have other great features.Think twice before buying this one.Returning it is also hard as most stores will charge a 15% restocking fee if you return it. Honestly I tried to love this stroller but I could not...If you have a HUGE Suv ,a strong back and can lift weights and walk a lot ourside I can see buying this stroller would be an option as it steers very well.However if you are limited on space,looking for a light weight stroller  or hope to take it to the mall I would suggest passing on this one as it is simply a hassle to put together and although it is very very good looking stroller I don't think it is worth $729 for looks alone...
