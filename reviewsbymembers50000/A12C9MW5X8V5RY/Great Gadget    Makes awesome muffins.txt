 I thought i would be just adding to my huge Kitchen gadget collection by buying this..But i was surprised at the  performance of this.  Makes really nice muffins in  just 10 mins! My husband was so surprised when he saw them. and nothing could be more easier to do.Just remember to brush some oil on the base and you would get soft and nice muffins.4stars for this product because they are not as fluffy as store bought ones but compare pretty close and are  not to mention very inexpensive!  UPDATE: I have used this gadget several times and observed it does not cook heavy type of muffins with fruit, or other fillings well.It does brown the outside of the muffins more and keeps the inside raw .This is really good and quick if you cook muffins from simple mixes but the more exotic types would cook better in the oven......
