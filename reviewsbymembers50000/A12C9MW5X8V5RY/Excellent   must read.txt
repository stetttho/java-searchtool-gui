 Excellent book ..i think it is the most useful for step 2 out of the other books i have read..i had very little time and difficult circumstances but managed to score 84 in step 2 and i would attribute my sucess because of this book.Contains all high yield material ,and other things that you should know for the boards.....a life saver!! thanks brochert!! i agree it is a bit disorganized and difficult to remember  but still  very well worth it's weight in gold.......
