 Overall this swing is a life saver ....Without it i would be going crazy with my colicky son.I am able to rest and have several quiet hrs which i attribute to this swing.One problem.....the swing is not very sturdy,,,one feet tends to  lift  off the ground whenever it swings,also the seat is inclined to one side  ..so the baby tends to lie on one side of the seat.Also it does not have music and the mobile is pretty boring my son doesn't even look at it.With the exeption of these minor problems the swing does the trick......Keeps your baby calm and quiet!! If you want the swing that has all the bells and whistles get the ocean wonders aquarium swing!
