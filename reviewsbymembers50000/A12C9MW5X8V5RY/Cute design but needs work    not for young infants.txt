 This swing is very cute,looks adorable but is not suitable for a newborn or young baby untill at least 4mths of age...the reason it does NOT provide enough head support for young babies! My son got extremly uncomfortable and started crying as soon as i put him in this swing.although he loves his full size aquarium swing. The seat is too upright and most of the time his chin seemed to be resting on his chest! Also the hanging toys tend to hit him in the face when moving .Getting him out of the swing is hard without hitting his head in the overhead bar!i don't know why Fisher price can't make a good travel swing that will recline for a baby I have tried the linkadoos one as well and that turned out to be a bigger disappointment.Cute but needs work.....
