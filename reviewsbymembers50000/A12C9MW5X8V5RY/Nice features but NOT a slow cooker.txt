 I use this item most of the  the time and am pleased with the purchase. That being said, the buyer should be aware that it's not a true slow cooker in that  It heats rapidly then slowly. Most items are boiling in an hr even when put on the slow mode.! Because of the quick heat your basic crock-pot recipes might be hit-and-miss in this thing.The best thing howwever to cook with this is to stay at home and keep checking on it after every couple of hrs or two.YOu can't leave items in it and return home in the evening and expect things to be done! It can actually burn them if left alone!  Still, it pinch-hits for a true slow cooker in most applications.The automatic timer in it is great because you can program it to cook for as many hours as you think it might need. It makes great soups and stews, and I have also cooked some Foreign country stews in it with sucess.   Overall, I'm glad I have one, though I'd wish I'd realized at the time of purchase that it doesn't work quite like a real slow cooker.
