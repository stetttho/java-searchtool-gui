 This is one stroller that truely lives up to its name. YOu can fold this stroller and be holding your baby at the same time. It is very light and easy to lift into any trunk. I took my daughter into the store when buying a new stoller and this is the one she right away laid back and i knew right then this one. I especially like the zippers on the sides of the basket. ( easy acess when the litte one is sleeping or you have the car seat attached.My daughter is one year so i didn't get to use it with the car seat. but as a stoller alone its great!!! Its got 3 bottle holders on the outside of the basket which are fantastic. So far i have found no down sides to it. i loe it just as much as my larger stroller.
