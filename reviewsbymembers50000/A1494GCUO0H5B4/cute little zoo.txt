 This is a great adition to the little people zoo. I bought this for my one year old after recieving the farm set for christmas. She really loves to " feed" the annimals and pretend they are walking. This is the one toy she can sit and play with. with out getting fusy or bored. She can really care less about the gate that came with it and would rather throw it. But is very intrested in the animals which have to go every where we go.For the price paid i think this is a great toy and am glad i purchased it for my growing child.
