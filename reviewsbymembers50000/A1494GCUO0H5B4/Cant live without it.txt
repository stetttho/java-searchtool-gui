 What can i say about this product besidesI LOVE IT!! I have read all the reviews here and think we are all not talking about the same product. I have had my diaper genie for 10 months. It does not stink!! but just in case it does ivegone out and gotten a stickup air freshner. I also keep an extra refil on hand so when i do run out its easy as that to refill it. I read in one reviwthat it has a cutter to cut the bags? that sounds kind of dangerous to me and am thank ful mine does not include that. Some reviews make it seem like you needto be a rocketscientist to use this thing, but im an everyday mom who has no problemswith it at all. I am soon giving mine away but will definatly buy another one when i decide to have my next child.
