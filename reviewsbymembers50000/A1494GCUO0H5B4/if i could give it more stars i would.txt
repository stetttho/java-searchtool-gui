 i RECIVED THIS TOY AS A HAND ME DOWN FROM A FRIEND OF MINE. i HAVE USED THIS TOY SINCE I BROUGHT MY DAUGHTER HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL( jANUARY 2001)i have never had to change the batteries. I must have a different model then others,you can touch anywhere on the keys to get music, animal sounds, whatever.My only complaint is you can adjust it in the crib so its right where the child will kick. We take it everywhere with us. it cant be left at home if we spend the night anywhere.
