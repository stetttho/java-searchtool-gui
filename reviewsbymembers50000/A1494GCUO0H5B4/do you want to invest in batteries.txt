 this is a great product!!!( if you like buying batteries..) I got this as my shower girt and thought it was going to work great. was i wrong.. It takes 4 c batteries that last roughly around 1.5 to 2 weeks. I have a swing that batteries last longer than that!!! when it is functional it is a great way to get my daughter to sleep. the other downside i have noticed is that when batteries are running low...you cant turn it off and it just keeps going and going. but over all if you like spending alot on batteries its great.
