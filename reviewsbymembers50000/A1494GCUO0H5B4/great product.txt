 I am a single mother(meaning i go most everywhere alone). I have never had a problem getting my daughter in or out of this carrier. It was a god send. My daughter had colic for the first 4 months of life. I found that if i wore this around the house it calmed her down and i was actually able to get things done!! now that she is 7 mos and 17lbs she is getting alittle to big for it, but it was great while it lasted.
