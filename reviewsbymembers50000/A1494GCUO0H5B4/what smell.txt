 okay my daughterhashad loose stools for the past 7 days....and they stink. bnutihave used my diapergenie and have had no foul oders in the babies room. Now this is living testement from someone who has a love/hate relationship with this thing. Yes i have to empty is every 3 days. and yes it only holds about20 diapers.butwho cares?? this is a product that seals the diapers and keeps the stinkout.
