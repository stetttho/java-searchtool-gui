 This stroller is a god send!!! i just love it and so does my daughter. the only down side i found to it is yes the size of the stroller in my trunk but it leaves room for a few shopping bags. My daughter loves the fact that i can put some entertainment on the tray for her. I have no problems manuvering it trough shopping malls or stores with narrow asiles. I have been using it for the past 8 months and it still looks brand new. i always get stopped inthe malls for people to admire my stroller and my daughter also.p.s. for all you out there complaing of not being able to fit in your trunk i drive a 2000 saturn coupe and have NO trouble fitting in my trunk...along with some other things. =0)Also for all you out there who think thiscar seat is suppost to last more than 6mos. dream on these seats are made for use during thr first 6 mos. only. Also u are not suppost to have extra clothing on a child in a car seat(i.e. a jacket) if you were in an accident that would compress making the straps looser onyour child andat a higher risk ofbeinginjured. I over all give thiscombination a high rating i love it and would not trade itfor anything and am hoping that it can be used with my next child.
