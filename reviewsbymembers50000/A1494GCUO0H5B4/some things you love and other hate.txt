 I recived this from the hospital when i had my daughter. At first it was too big for her ears, no biggie i had a digital one for under arms.now that she is bigger)7 mos) we can use it. it is a great product!! instead of having to fight a squriming baby for 2 mins w/ a regular thermomoter in just a few seconds i get a good and accurate reading. I to have heard alot of greif about using an ear thomomoter but that also comes from a mom who thinks you dont worry about a temprature until its 106. over all its a great product for older infants. I would recomend
