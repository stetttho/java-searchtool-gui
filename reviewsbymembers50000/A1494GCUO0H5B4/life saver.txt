 I got this item as a gift at my shower. I thought I was never going to usethis!!boy was I wrong!! When I had my daughter I had to have an episiotomy. Not once but twice. Well my bed is very low to the ground and was hard to get in and out of. In comes this product so my baby could be at my level and I could tend to her with out the extra pain. I LOVE IT!!! she could sleep where ever I took her to a friends house to Grandmas even at my work she would sleep in it!!
