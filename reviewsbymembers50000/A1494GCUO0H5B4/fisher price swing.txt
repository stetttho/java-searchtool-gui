 I dont personally have this swing but i used it at a friends house today. It says it could be used for a 2 year old....i have a 7 month old who only weighs at most 17lbs. The swing would start to swing with alittle push from us but...about 2 minutes later it was at a dead stop!!!( and this was on high speed with new batteries) I have a graco swing at home and this only happens if she moves alot! i would not recomend this swing if you would like to use it after 5 mos,WOULD NOT RECOMEND
