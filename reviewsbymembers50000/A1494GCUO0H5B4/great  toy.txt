 I purchased this toy for my 8 month old daughter after researching it for awile and reading others ratings on it. My daughter is 8 months old and we bought this toy only yesterday. She had never before even tried to pull her self up...now she has a reason to and does it quite proudly to get the reward. She has no problem handeling the balls, in fact she tries to put 2 in her hand. As for putting this together it was no problem. The directions are clear as to what to do. The only disappointing thing i found was the music does not play long enough, i would like it better if it played continuos for like 5-7 minutes. That would bre more exciting to my daughter.
