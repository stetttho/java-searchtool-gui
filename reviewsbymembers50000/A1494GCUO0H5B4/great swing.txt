 This swing is wonderful!!! My daughter was colicky for the first 4.5 months of her life. I would put her inthis every night so she would go to sleep. sometimes it worked sometimes not. Yes 6 speeds is overkill. I dont think i ever used the lowest 2 or the middle 2. The music is great since it has a volume control. The fabric is very washable( ours had been washed almost everyday) The only problem i see now is my 7 month old 16.5lb baby can stop the swing by just sitting up. Im kinda puzzled by that because they say it can handle a baby up until 25lbs. But other than that its great
