 I have been using this highchair for the past 3 months and it is wonderful!! My daughter loves to play with the toys while i feed her. Clean up is a breeze with this, all i do is take a squirt bottle with water and a little bit of soap and hose down the tray wait a few minutes and wipe it away with a paper towel. I wash the seat pad in the washer atleast 3 times a week and have never had any problems with it. This is by far the easiet high chair i have ever used. p.s. you can buy extra pads from graco.com
