 I to thought this tub was a great idea. My newborn daughter had other ideas about it. I only got to use this once or twice because my daughter would much rather take a bath in the "big tub". Yes i also had a problem with water leaking out when i filled it up just enough to cover her and keep her comfortable. It was really hard for me to get the tub joints to lock in place and with just a kick frommy daghter it would fold. I also found that the little pad in there was no help. Is that there to prefent slipping? if so mine must be defective.
