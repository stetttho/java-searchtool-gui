 I bought this toy for my daughter when we made the transition from an infant car seat to the bigger one. I liked it at first it keptmy baby from crying. Then it just stopped working for a bit. i think weoverworked it. well now that my daughter is 10 mos. wepulleditout again. And she lovesit!!! i thinknow that she can actually see over it andsee whats going on it entertains her more. She can still pull it off the car seat and itgoes flying around butnow ithasmoreentertainment valueso that does not happen as much.overall a good product
