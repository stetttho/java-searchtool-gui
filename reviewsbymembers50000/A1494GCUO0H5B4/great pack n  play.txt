 I purchasedthispack'n'play when my daughter was 5 mos old. She was to heavy at that time for the bassinet,therefor i cannot rate that. but the pack n play it self is great. I purchased this one after my other one collapsed at 2 in the morning with my child in it. This one has always held strong and has neverlet me down. It is a great item. I can gethousehold things done with out my duaghter crawling all over the place. I would buy this allover agianin a heart beat.
