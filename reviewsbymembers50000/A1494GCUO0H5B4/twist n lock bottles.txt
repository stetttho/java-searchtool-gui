 I gave this product 2 stars for effort. When i was pregnant i saw thses bottles and loved them i bought 3 starter packs. When i got my daughter home i tried using them. first off she hated the nipple. secondly my hand was always wet from the milk leaking out. i found that if i used the playtex drop in liners it did not leak. well i eventually had to switch over from this to the advent brand and was much more satisfied. and the reason you cant find anything to go with it is because htey were pulled from the market.
