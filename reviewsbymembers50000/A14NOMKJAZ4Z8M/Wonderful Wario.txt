 Yeah, I know Wario may be the opposite of Mario, and does everything the opposite Mario does.  But what can I say? I love Wario's don't-get-in-my-way attitude.  He's so full of wonderous things to come, it's hard to figure out where the game will turn to next.  The graphics are neat.  I've just barely conquered the first world of the game today, and I'm aleardy going through the motions about it.  So much to do, so many moves.  Gold, gold, gold, gotta collect the gold! (Sorry, Wario's inner voice is getting to me.) Wario World is a blast.  The story behind Wario World is fairly simple: It's about this evil jewl thing that has been transformed all of Wario's treasure into monsters.  (Can you believe that? I bet Wario was pissed to see is gold turn into monsters! The drama!) Now he must go to this weird world where he must be beat them.  With his new punches, and moves, there will be no goons to stand in Wario's way.  I bet towards the end of the game, Wario defeats the evil jewel and reverses the spell that has transformed his gold into monsters back to normal again, that's my prediction.  Anyway, Wario World is a great action adventure game that's just a waiting to happen.  What are you waiting for? This is another great GameCube title since Super Mario Sunshine! (That's my opinion, of couse.) Go grab you a copy of Wario World.  You won't be dissapointed.   To *david* whom wrote: "This game looks weird without Mario..." Hello, I believe that the whole point of the game is to not to feature Mario.  However, Wario is somewhat in relation to Mario, only lots fatter and more greedier.  If this were to be called Mario World, then that would be a different story.  But I believe that they have already made a SNES game for Super Mario World, so they have switched it for Wario World or somthing like that.  It makes since really.  It's nice to see Wario getting fame every once in a while.
