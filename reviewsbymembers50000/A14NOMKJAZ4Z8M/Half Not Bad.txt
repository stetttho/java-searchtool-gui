 "I may be dead, but I'm still prettier than you.  Which is more than I can say for you." - Buffy to Master, Prophecy Girl What is it about BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER we love about so much? Is it the kick-ass punching and kicking the Slayer does week by week? What makes us care so much about our Slayer and her Scooby friends? BUFFY is without a doubt the best damn show on television.  Regardless if it's over.  There are so many episodes worth watching over starting from the beginning.  And the frist season of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER isn't half bad.  It was interesting watching these characters grow up, like watching your favorite characters growing with each passing season.  And what I love about the first season of BUFF THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, is that it had a great way of teen drama that deals with about this one girl, Buffy, who was often misunderstood.  And she and her friends would always solve the mystery of Sunnydale and why things happen the way they do.  The first half season was great, and it keeps getting better.  Who could not possibly watch BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and don't like it? Someone not human, that is for.
