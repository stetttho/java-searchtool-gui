 I have loved the soundtrack for "Little Shop of Horrors" film and decided to buy the 1986 soundtrack from the film, and instantly feel in love with it all over it again. The music is out of this world! There is just something about "Little Shop of Horrors" that makes you wanna get up and sing along to the music.  "Skid Row (Downtown)," "Somewhere That's Green," "Some Fun Now," "Dentist!," "Feed Me (Get It)," "Suddenly Seymour," "Suppertime," and "Mean Green Mother From Outerspace," are all stand-out songs that are great and love 'em.  So, if you are a fan of the 1986 "Little Shop of Horrors" movie musical starring Rick Morranis, Ellen Greene, Vincent Gardenia, and speical appearances by Steve Martin, James Belushi, John Candy, Christopher Guest, and Bill Murray, then there is no doubt that you should buy the soundtrack.  You will be greatly appreciated that you have bought it, I know I am.
