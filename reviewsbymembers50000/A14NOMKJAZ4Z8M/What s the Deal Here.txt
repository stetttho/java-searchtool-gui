 I would like to know when in the world are they going to release the greatest Mario Bros. game of all time on GBA?! I mean, this was the only reason that I had bought my GBA (now I have a SP as well)! I was hoping and praying that they wouldn't skip Super Mario Bros. 3, the greatest game of the series of them all, on the Super Mario Advance trilogy.  I pray that this doesn't get  left out, let alone, the original Super Mario Bros.  What were they thinking? Please game releaser gods, don't do this to me! I must own this on GBA SP.  My collection wouldn't be complete if this doesn't come out soon.  I mean, *what were you thinking* when you guys thought it would be a good idea to skip the legendary Super Mario Bros. 3! You know that this was just about everyone's favorite game of them all, so many powers and baddies, and power-ups.  I must own this, so please I beg of you, release it! Fans will be happy.
