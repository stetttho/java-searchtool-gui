 Now this is a Disney feature animated film for everyone! It's action-packed sequences keep you on the edge of your seat entertainment.  *And* for the first time in a *long* time, Disney has decided to cut to the action and take out your cherry, little animated musical.  Which I think is superb for Disney. This film starts out with a bang. (Literally) And takes us back to when Atlantis was first born. It was terrorized by invaders from another world, and soon a gigantic tsunami aroses from the surface, chasing the Atlantians.   And then we meet young KIDA and her mother whom suddenly gets abucted by this ship and takes her up, leaving Kida all by herself. Well, to make it short, I would have to say, great job Disney! If your into action-packed animated features, then *Atlantis: The Lost Empire* is the family film for you! No questions about it.  What are you waiting for? Go out and grab you a copy.  I know I did. Also, the Collector's Edition is packed with special features on the film. Which is fascinating to watch if you love exploring the DVDs. Michael J. Fox does a wonderful performance on the nerdy scientist, Milo Thatch who rediscovers the world of Atlantis.  Along with many great others. Like I said before, this Disney animated feature has *no* singing in it whatsoever.  It's straight foreward action adventure and mysterious things to come for the whole family.   *Stop reading these reviews and grab ya a copy of Atlantis: The Lost Empire!!*
