 Buyer Beware: When purchasing a cheap DVD, don't bother looking for the access to special features on the DVD menu.  You won't have any luck finding them anywhere.  I was about to give this DVD a one star rating, but due to the fact that Super Mario Bros. has to be my all-time video game-based movie, I didn't have the heart to give it one star.  But, at least the movie is in Widescreen format that's one good thing about it.  There are many viewers that might have disagree with me, but that is only because they might believe that the movie plot was not what they would expect.  But I can understand why at the beginning this movie didn't work for Mario fans due to the fact that it wasn't true to the video games.  But as time passed, people grew to understand the movie a little better.  Basically, the movie is about a parallel universe where dinosaurs have seemed to evolve into a more primal species, like us, mostly.  And then we meet Mario and Luigi, Brooklyn's all time famous plumbers who are on a quest to save a princess from a reptile lizard king, known as King Koopa.  The soundtrack to Super Mario Bros. is great, the special effect it great, and the movie has left us wondering where do they go from here? But you wanna know why there hasn't been a sequal since '93? Because the filmmakers are afraid since the movie bombed in the past, that viewers won't come to appreciate the sequal enough.  So they figured it would be best to stick with the first one.  But you never know, it could come back anytime soon.  Look at the Terminator movies: they had waited about ten years later to do third sequal, so cross your fingers, and hope for the best that someone might have the guts to write the sequal that could sweep the nationwide with moviegoers everywhere.
