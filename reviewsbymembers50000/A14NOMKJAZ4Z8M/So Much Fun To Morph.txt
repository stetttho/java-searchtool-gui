 I never knew what to expect when buying Dr. Muto.  But I found it hilarious and not just your usual platform adventure.  You must collect lots of DNA from your ray gun an order to get enough to morph into animals.  Which is my fav part of the game, morhping into fun creatures.  If you'll looking for a good time, buy Dr. Muto for GameCube, it's so much fun morphing! Also, something that I might point out to is that this game also has special features on it that are rarley seen on video games.  Its got two featuretts on it that has the art of Dr. Muto and another featurett on the worlds and creating Dr. Muto and the voice of him as well.  I thought that was interesting to see on a GameCube game, which makes Dr. Muto exciting to see how these game people bring the crazy scientist to life.  Check them out on the extras on the menu screen.  You'll be amazed out how much effort they did in creating Dr. Muto.
