 This has got to one of the finest Peter Pan film adaptation ever to grace the Silver Screen.  No matter who you are or how old you are, you can fall in love all over again about the boy who refused to grow up.  The storytelling gets deeper as we learn more about Wendy and that there is so much more to life than being a boy and having fun.  The J.M. Barrie novel of Peter Pan that you that you knew, is not what it appears to be.  It's not just about wanting to grow up, it's about friendship and adventure.  Peter Pan may live in a fantasy world past the stars and straight on till morning, but he is still young and always will reamin young at heart.  The visual effects are astonishing and better than ever can be imagined.  And so is James Newton Howard's score is heart-felt.  It makes you want to believe in Peter Pan.  Of course there's that dreadful Captain Hook (who is also played by Jason Isaacs) is a nightmare to anyone who comes aboard his ship.  Don't get on his 'good' side, that's for sure.  This is the Peter Pan you don't want to miss.
