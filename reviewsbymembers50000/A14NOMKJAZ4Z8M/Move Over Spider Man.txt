 Amazingly, "Earth vs. The Spider," has eye-poping special effects, thanks to monster-maker Stan Winston (Jurassic Park III, A.I. Artificial Intelligence, Aliens).  At first, I didn't know what to expect when I bought the "Earth vs. The Spider" DVD.  I just knew that it would be a good flick, because of Stan Winstan and co-star Dan Aykroyd! If you've never heard of "Earth vs. The Spider," this is a story about a man named, Quentin who loves comic books.  He works as a security guard at a biotech research lab.  He spends his nights at home dreaming of becoming his favorite comic book superhero: The Arachnid Avenger.  A spider-man like human that goes about saving the city from evil-doers, much like "Spider-Man." Only more like a "real spider-man."  When some thugs ambush the lab, and kill his partner.  He injects himself with a top-secret drug made from the blood of a laboratory spider.  Slowly, the effects of the injection changes his body.  Instead of trying to become like a superhero he once dreams of, he becomes more like spider insticts that infect his body.   Hmmm...interesting. All in all, this is an excellent monster movie, that will make the hairs on your neck stand up...
