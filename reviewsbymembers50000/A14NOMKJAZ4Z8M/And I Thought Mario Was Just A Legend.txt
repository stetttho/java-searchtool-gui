 It's been what? Twelve years ago when Nintend introuduced America to Super Mario Bros. And a several years later...they return, better than ever. If you ask me, I love this game! And did you now that you can even play as Luigi in the game?! I was like amazed! They have cool voice overs for the characters when you play them. They color is brilliant, and you just can't seem to put the dern thing down! You can take this portable game  wherever you want. The thing that blew my mind the most out of this game is the quality of it.  You can enter a whole new world, where you can fly, swim, duck, jump, run, and explore new and exciting places that you've never seen come to life in your own hands! I believe Mario is the greatest platform game out of them all. It's wonderful, and the Super Mario Bros. still lives! I'd highly recommend this video game for any Mario frantics!
