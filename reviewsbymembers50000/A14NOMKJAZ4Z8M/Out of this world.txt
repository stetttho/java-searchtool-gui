 Ivan Reitman has made an excellent film! You just don't know where this movie will take you.  It has great actors such as David Duchovny, Orlando Jones, Seann Willam Scott, and Julianne Moore! With such eye-popping special effects, this blockbuster is sure to catch your attention.  There are some funny memorable moments betweent Moore and Jones, which will have you dying for laughter! The main reason I found this film enjoyable and fun to watch is because of the hilarious stunts these actors play out though the movie.  It's up to these four characters to save the world from evil aliens that try to take over the world.  *We're all gonna die!* But in the end, well...I'll let you predict what might happen in the end.
