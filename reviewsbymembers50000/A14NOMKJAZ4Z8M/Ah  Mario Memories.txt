 Remember about ten or tweleve years ago, there was the Mario Brothers trying to rescue Princess Toadstool from the evil King Koopa? Well, now we can relive those Mario memories in the first five episodes of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! As most of us may know, this collection contains the live-action sequences starring Captain Lou Albano, as Mario, and Danny Wells as Luigi.  I have always been a big fan of the Mario Bros. and will continue to be one for as long as the franchise will go on.  They're funny, charming, and just plain fun.  If you wanna relive your Mario memories, then I say get this DVD set of the first five advenuters of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! (Well, OK the first four adventure, the last episode contains The Legend of Zelda.) Which of course, was apart of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show back in the day.  This collection also contains an interview with Andy Heywood (creator Inspector Gadget) and gives some information about the Mario Bros. cartoon.  If only there could be more Mario Bros. cartoons.  Maybe in the future we could only pray they would come out with new adventures.  They did it with Sonic and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  Why not Super Mario?
