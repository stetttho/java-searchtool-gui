 I have been a big fan of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer television series ever since it has been on TV.  The show has everything you need in a show: Horror, comedy, romance, suspense, and action all rolled into one action-packed hour.  And on November 6, 2001, Buffy the Vampire Slayer made television history by making the best musical episode ever for a television series.  "Once More, Feeling" is the episode title that sweeped the nation.  I was hooked, and now video games are being released on GameCube, XBox, and now Game Boy Advance.  I'm glad that they have finally decided to release a Buffy game for Game Boy Advance, now I can have just as much fun playing my favorite characters in my hands, as well as watching them kick [butt] on the tube.  If you are a slayer fan, there won't be a doubt that you should buy the Game Boy Advance game, "Buffy the Vamprie Slayer: Wrath of the Darkhul King," a great new game to your collection.
