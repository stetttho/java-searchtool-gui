 What you have here is a howling good movie, that defines all the laws of nature.  Dog Soldiers is probably the best werewold horror flick I have seen in a long time.  It gave chills, bumps, and I had to keep looking over my shoulder every time I thought something was behind me... But beside the point, Dog Soldiers is a pound-a-minute roller coaster ride that makes your heart beat faster and never wanna slow down.  When these band of soldiers go traveling into the woods, they stumble across another team that seemed to have been well--slaughtered, every inch of them.  But as they soon discover that they are not alone, something unspoken of is out there in the woods, watching them, waiting to take them one by one.  You can feel your own heart beating as you watch the werewolves sneak upon the soldiers' attacks.   I don't want to give to much info away, due to the fact that this is a very intense, scary movie that will shock you, and disturb you at the same.  Which gets you pumped up, and wanting more werewolf action.  I give this movie 4 stars, for it's witty dialouge and strong action sequences.  Dog Soldiers is a howl of a movie that devliers, and plays with your imagination making you believe in these beasts.   So, with furtherado, if you want a howling good time, then definatley go for Dog Doldiers.  You won't be disappointed.
