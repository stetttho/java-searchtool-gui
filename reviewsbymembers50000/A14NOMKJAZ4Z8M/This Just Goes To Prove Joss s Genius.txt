 With big success with big-buget movie scripts, and the critically acclaimed "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," and "Angel," Joss Whedon brings us one of the most beautiful graphic novels I've ever seen.  Something about it makes it so beautiful.  The artwork, the writing, all of it down to the last pencil outline was awe-dropping.  "Fray" is set in the far future where Manhattan has become a mutant disease in which no one notcies the monsters that roam the streets of Manhattan.  Then comes along Fray.  A street girl, not so different than Buffy, discovered the power to slay the vampires.  And with her trusty demon watcher, Urkon, together they begin training and getting ready until the battle begins.  The future never looked so good.  Fans of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer/Angel" must obtain this graphic novel for their collection.  I know I did.
