 For some reason, I decided to check out Moulin Rouge.  I don't know, maybe because it had the beautiful Nicole Kidman in it or something.  I just don't know.  But when I first viewed it, I was mesmorized! This is a musical unlike any I've seen before.  It surely captures your heart and gettting into the songs.  Of course, no one in my family understood Moulin Rouge.  I mean, what's there to understand? It's a tragedy waiting to happen.  It's about love, "overcoming all obstacles." I like watching musicals is because of the singing and the actors.  It's like pure Disney magic! Usually when the actors can't express their feelings with words, they burst into song.   There are three great songs that were performed by Nicole and Ewan, "What May Come," "All You Need is Love," and "One Day I'll Fly Away." Those songs have captured my heart and kept them in my memory.  Another reason I love this musical is because of it's comic moments in it.  It keeps you entertained at the beginning, making you wanna know what is going to happen to the characters.  And then, when we get deeper into the film, it begins to become more of a drama, beause of Satine's (Nicole Kidman) sickness.  But the one thing that I didn't understand about this movie, was the cause of Satine's sickness.  Maybe she was jelously in love, and couldn't handle it any more, and caused her to get sick.  It's a tragedy, so I guess you don't really need an explanation for it.  But one thing is certain, Moulin Rouge is a must have for you DVD collection. It's filled so packed extras and more.  The sound and picture of it all, is fabulous.  If you're one of those people that are into musicals, than "Moulin Rouge" is the one for you! It's deinatley one that you will not be disappointed in!
