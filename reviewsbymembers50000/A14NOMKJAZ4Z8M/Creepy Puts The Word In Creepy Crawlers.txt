 I never knew what to expect when I bought the movie "Creepy Crawlers" starring Thomas Calabro, Dean Stockwell, Kristen Dalton, and John Savage.  I figured it was just another campy B-movie or something.  The cover itself looks gross-out nasty.  Most people who have fears of insects or bugs probably won't even think to look at the cover twice.  But I'm a horror buff, so I can handle most films with the creepy crawly things anyhow.  So, I took a deep breathe and started watching Creepy Crawlers.  And to my surprise, that this picture is actually a good time fun.  I was also surprise, the acting was much better than I anticipated that it would be.   The Story: (***1/2 stars) "When Dr. Ben Cahill takes a leave of absence from his medical practice and moves to Orrs Island off the coast of Maine, all he expects is some quiet time away.  But the solace of the tiny isle is hattered when bizarre and frightening deaths begin to occur.  The victims appear to have died by natural causes, yet each body has red insect bits on its flesh.  When an autopsy reveals one dead man's chest cavity filled with insect cocoons, Cahill is horrified to discover that a rare breed of African cockroaches has invaded the island and they are using the inside of human beings as breeding grounds! Now, it's a race against time as the islanders try everything they can to escape the deadly insects before they are eaten alive!"                                                  ~VHS box set The FX: (**** stars) Good enough to be totally grossed out!  The Score: (**** stars) Keeps you on the edge of your seat, pumping more anticipation than you would rarely expect in a horror picture. The Picture Itself: (**** stars) The actors did a great job in protraying these characters to be enough believable to make you feel for them, (and yes, even the damned creepy crawlers that make your skin crawl, literally).  It's good enough to watch it again. So the next time yo uare looking for a really good horror flick, you might wanna check out "Creepy Crawlers," a well done movie that should get more than it deserves.  Don't judge the cover by its looks: you might be surprised to have yourself a really good time. Also, to Amazon.com: You rated this film [R] on the flm ratings when it is actually a [PG-13] rating according to the VHS box set.  [PG-13] for creature violence and peril.  Now, when I watched the film myself, I didn't really see any sexual nudity or a sex scene, which I was greatful.  There was very little mild language in it as well.  So it would be appreciated if you could change the rating back to [PG-13].  I would be apprecitaed. All in all, Creepy Crawlers is a creepin' good time!
