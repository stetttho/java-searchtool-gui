 I really haven't been a big fan of the Alien movies, until I became a huge fan of Joss Whedon's previous work for Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Toy Story, and Speed pictures.  So, as a fan of Buffy and Angel TV series, I decided to give Alien Resurrection a chance, just for Joss Whedon.  And found out that I enjoyed it.  Now I know how Joss got the idea to resurrect Buffy in the dark season six episodes.  Ellen Ripley had been been cloned with the alien queen still inside of her, so they took out the clone and killed it.  Which is probably the most disturbing thing I have seen.  For a sec there, I thought the baby bastard was going to attack the scientists or something.  But no such luck.  Well, the special effect aliens were great.  Nuff said.  If you are a fan of Joss Whedon of the Alien movies, I would say that you should add this to your collection.
