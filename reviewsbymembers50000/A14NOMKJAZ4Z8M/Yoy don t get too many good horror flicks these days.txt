 Well, Jeepers Creepers is truly and utterly horrorfying if I may say so myself! I mean, just the thought of getting trapped down in that dark tunnel surrouned by dozens of naked sewed bodies together...ugh! Just the thought it gives me the creeps! (If you have seen the movie, you'd know what I am talking about.)  Anyways, the movie Jeepers Creepers, is about two kids on their way back home from college, Darry and Trish.  But when then unexpectedly come across a mysterious pipe out in the middle of no where, that is next to an old abandond church.  When  the teens drive by, they notice a strange guy dropping *dead* bodies into the pipe covered with blood stains. After about five minutes into the film, we see an excellent dull moment with the Old Truck and the kids.  The soundtrack and camera angles are so wonderful well done, that it sent chills up and down my spine.   Victor Salva is a wonderful director who knows what he's doing, and has casted a brilliant cast.   I'm proud of this movie for several reasons,  1.) It sticks to it's genre. 2.) You don't see too many horror flicks that stick with it's genre. 3.) And with the right score and directing, you get it a bone chilling treat! Thanks Victor for making this film a success! It keeps you entertained from frame one 'till the very last one.  Jeepers Creepers is a must have for those who love a good scare.
