 Outlook 2000, the full-featured big brother to Microsoft's free Outlook Express, is an amzing piece of software -- and amazingly complex. Microsoft's own help files barely begin to explain how to unleash it's full  potential.  Every time I pick up this book I discover something new.  It's  essential for anyone serious about getting the most out of their email.   Like all the books I've seen in the Woody series, this one is full of  clear, easy-to-access explanations of some very complex topics.  A real  winner. If you've invested in Outlook 2000 you shouldn't pass this book up.
