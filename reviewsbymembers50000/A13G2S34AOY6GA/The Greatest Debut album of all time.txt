 This was the Orb at the dawn of a new era in music - as leaders.  Acid House & techno had been around for ages, but this was new.  Instead of flashing lights and lots of shaky movements, the Orb brought in cushions and soft drinks.  What a relief.  I was knackered. I've seen them live many times and always thought they were crap to watch - except at the Rainbow gigs up Mount Fuji in Japan.  But on your own, or with a bunch of like minded friends, there is little to beat chilling out, lying back and taking in the back side of the moon.   This is their best stuff, by miles.
