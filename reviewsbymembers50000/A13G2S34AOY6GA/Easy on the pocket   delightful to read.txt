 Insight Compact Guides are great.  This one has 12 routes for you to follow as you travel through this stunningly beautiful country.  All the major sights are featured with pictures and a rating.  I like this feature since - as you will find - the authors are pretty good judges of what is worth seeing and what is not.  It's also nice to see the Aland Islands included as one of the trips.  My wife and I had a tremendous time cycling around them in the early autumn of 1999 - when the sea and sky were deep blue and the myriad forests a swathe of gold and red.   There are two big selling points for these guide books.  One they are very small, light and easy to follow.  Two, into a mere 100 odd pages, the authors have crammed a wealth of info/pictures on the country, its history, culture, customs - as well as 12 unfortgettable journeys.  Five stars and lots of lovely memories.
