 The Concise Guide to Economics a is small libertarian stroll through economics and finance. It's good in that themes are dealt with briefly, leaving interested readers with additional references.  The tour through microeconomic issues is refreshingly honest, clear and insightful.  The author's objective is to explain why socialism is nonsense and why the equilibrium models of perfect competition/perfect information are dangerously simplistic.  Cox does a splendid job here.  Then we head off into macroeconomics and here the pace and pleasure drop off.  Brevity becomes his weakness as complex big world topics are covered in a dozen or so short paragraphs.  Not much of value is revealed, other than the authors obvious belief that central banks are the problem and a return to the Gold Standard is a must.  The final third of the book is devoted to methodoly; like the labour theory of value which forms the chassis of Marxism.  Again brevity sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.    In all, not a bad little book.  But if you really are looking for serious insights, you'll have to look elsewhere....or read the many quoted references.  Three stars.
