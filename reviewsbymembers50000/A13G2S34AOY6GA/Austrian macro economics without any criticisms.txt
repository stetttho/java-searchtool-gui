 A lovely succinct account from four towers in a tradition of economics that is widely represented in the financial markets.  Roger Garrison - himself a leading light in modern times - leads off with a brief overview.  The nice thing is that Garrison manages to get it all across without resorting to waffle - another Austrian tradition.  In fact, in my view, Garrison is the star of this review since his ability to keep it simple is a tremendous asset.  Anyone familiar with the dark mutterings of academics in Austrian academic journals will know exactly what I'm talking about.    Aside from Garrison, the pieces by Rothbard and Harberler are the best since they tackle the central issue of Trade Cycle theory - that any system run by central bankers is inherently unstable since their tinkering with interest rates leads directly to the business cycle.  Much better to have a competitive banking system without a central bank and a curency tied to gold.  That way credit expansions will never be explosive.  Of course, what they don't tell you is that their proposals are inherently deflationary and force deficit countries to do all adjustment when they experience balance of payments problems.  Rothbard's piece sets out the mechanics of the Trade Cycle especially well and everyone should be able to understand what he's getting at without too much difficulty.  It's no more difficult than the average economics course on an MBA programme.  That's hardly difficult, is it?    Readers wishing to understand the micro-economics of the Austrian school should also check out some of the recent publications of one Israel Kirzner.
