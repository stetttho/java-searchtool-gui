 Crimea is a good, sturdy, British account of one of history's least understood crises. The build up, the major battles, the rivalries between the allied powers and the Turks, the shameful hospital conditions, the Charge of the Light Bridgade and the lingering effects on European politics that eventually led to WW1 are all there. Royle writes well, although his style is a wee bit pompous and pro-British for my liking.  Previous reviewers have complained about the lack of maps. There are maps but they are hand drawn affairs and aren't listed in the table of contents. Why? The mind boggles. It would have taken five minutes to prepare a list. There's no chronology either - a major omission given how little is known and how little has been written on the subject.  The other complaint I have is the book's attempt to cover everything without covering anything in detail. For example, it is widely believed that Florence Nightingale was a hero and the instigator of modern medical facilities. Royle thinks not and casts aspersions without ever coming up with evidence. Field battles come and go in the middle chapters without a sub-text explaining where everything was heading.  But, even though there are problems, Crimea isn't a bad book. In fact, it's quite good and has a fast paced text that is so often missing in books of this kind. I liked the sections on the build up best since you get a good feel for the state of mind in the major centres of Constantinople, St. Petersburg, Paris and London. The final sections too, on the long term effects of the war and the peace treaty are pretty good too.  In all a good book. Sturdy, highly readable and without errors if you know how to read and write in The Queen's English. Three stars.
