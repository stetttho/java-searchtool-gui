 Nick Rider's travel guide is by far the best book for visiting Maya/Toltec sites in this region.  I always use a Cadogan guide when one is available.  They are the most intelligently written and informative of all the guide books currently on the market.   Although they can be a bit dry, they are normally written by people who really know their subject well.  Rough Guide/Lonely Planet/Let's Go guides, for example, are heavy and filled with reams of irrelevant pages you will never look at if you have ever ventured outside the safety of your living room.  Cadogan guides assume you have a brain and you want to find out as much about the local area as possible - while still providing the essential travel tips.     This one covers the Mayan region of Southern Mexico, Belize and Guatemala.  Where it excels is its descriptions of the amazing archaeological sites you will encounter, their history and the relationship between indigenous Maya people and those descended from the Conquistadors.   The author was a postgraduate in Mesoamerican studies and provides - what I think - is one of the best introductions to Mayan culture, architecture and its famous calendar that I have encountered.  For those who are interested there's also a list of further Maya reading, a great food section and loads of stuff on towns/cities, travel timetables and dinky places to stay.  Armed with this book, you'll really feel you are being accompanied by a knowledgeable guide who isn't there solely to relieve you of your money.  On many occasions I found the book more insightful than hiring a local.   Thankfully, Cadogan have revamped the cover and it looks much better.
