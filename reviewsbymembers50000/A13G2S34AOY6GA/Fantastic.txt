 This is Peter Hopkirk's classic account of the nineteenth century cold war struggle between the British Empire and Imperial Russia.  Hopkirk is a devil with the pen and knows how to spin a great story.  The end result is a gripping tale, the kind of wild adventure story my grandfather used to tell me when I was a child.   Five stars simply isn't enough.  This is terrific stuff.  For those who don't know, this is the story of how Central Asia became part of the Russian, and then Soviet Empire.  Russian expansion to the southeast caused consternation in British India where military planners became convinced the Russians were out to invade the `Jewel of the Crown'.  There followed a century's worth of cold war espionage between the empires that involved all maner of characters and military encounters.   There are invasions and wars in Afghanistan, where the Brits were turfed out twice, Russian conquests of the Emirates of Khiva & Bokhara and legions of adventurers heading off into the wild blue yonder on missions to map the region and foil the enemy.   All their stories are here.  You'll have to pinch yourself to believe some of them.   What an adventure story this is.     Five Stars.
