 This was the book that got Krugman noticed by the generalist audience.  For the first time he managed to shrug off the academic arrogance that predominates his profession and write a short and very readable intro to the world of political economy.   Peddling Prosperity is good, not because Krugman takes a pot shots at everyones' favourite bogeymen, but because he explains basic economic concepts so clearly and shows how they apply to everyday life.  Basic concepts like the savings-investment gap, why productivity differentials don't matter, rational expectations and the laffer curve are all explained clearly.  PK then explains how the the election choices that ordinary Americans have made since the 1960s have been influenced by them.  The economics is well done.....although his political bashing becomes somewhat heavy handed in places.   The thing I didn't like was the US focus of most of the book.  There are bits on Europe's airbus project and Margaret Thatcher, but that's not really representative of the much bigger world that most of us live in.  Thankfully, his later books get more and more international.  This one is really just a primer for what comes later.
