 Another bomb from Lonely Planet.   Incoherent, often wrong and poorly written.  It amazes me how this company's guide books have become the most popular amongst young travellers.  This one covers the entire Scandinavian region - including the baltic republics and St. Petereburg.   Like most of the regional LP books, this one doesn't follow a standardised format and provides the reader with reams of useless information. How anyone is supposed to plan a trip using this book is beyond me.  Garbage.
