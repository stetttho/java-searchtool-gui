 Eyewitness Travel Guides are really great value and this is a very nice guide book.  Take an Eyewitness Guide and a Cadogan Guide (if available) and you will have all the information you might possibly need.  Forget the competition.  This is the kind of intelligent tour guide you have been waiting for.    The introduction is a beautifully illustrated time line of Portuguese history since the 1200s.  The city and surrounding area is then broken up into sections and each is introduced by use of picture-driven accounts and easy to read descriptions of what you will encounter.  There are nice maps and each area is described in such illuminating detail that you cannot help but get up early and get down to it.  Each place of interest is preceded by a list of opening times, map locations and details of how to get there by using public transport.   It's all highly readable and also gives useful tips on where to eat, what to do, where to stay and how to get about.  The nice thing about the hotels and eating guides is the way this book breaks down its recommendations by price - allowing travellers of varying budgets to enjoy their time in this fascinating of cities.   This is a very good book indeed.
