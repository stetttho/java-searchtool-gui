 I've been interested in Mayan culture since I was a kid.  I went to the Yucatan for the first time in 1999 and used this as a light refresher course on the region's 'discovery'.   It's a great little intro containing lots of details about the early adventurers - and their ideosyncracies.  There are great pictures and illustrations which go along with the text.  It all links up really well and takes you through many aspects of the main cities that have been uncovered.   That said, it doesn't tell you much about the history of the Mayan culture.  You won't come away understanding anything about the Mayan calendar, social customs or their religion.  It's really just a good yarn about the mad blokes who roamed the forests looking for adventure...and found it.
