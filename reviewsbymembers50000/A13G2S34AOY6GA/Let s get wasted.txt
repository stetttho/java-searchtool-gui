 Hunter S Thompson's editors claim that this is his long lost first novel.  Why do I not believe them?  In any case, it's pretty entertaining even though there isn't much of a plot.  It's very much like HST's perceived lifestyle imprinted on a short novella with lots of drinking.  Now isn't that a surprise.     One thing I really liked was the size and the type font.  I bought mine in Norway and it came in a tall thin format that shrunk each para down to almost newspaper size.  For me, this made the book very easy to read and much more enjoyable.
