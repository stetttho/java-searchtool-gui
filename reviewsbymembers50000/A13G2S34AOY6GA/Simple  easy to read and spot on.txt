 Economics for Professional Investors is one of the best economics texts around. It's much better than all the highly mathematical rubbish that comes out of academics. This is a hands on, do-it-yourself, economics manual by a professional economist who works in the financial markets and knows how to communicate. Lee covers all the ground necessary to understanding how economic policy leads to bull and bear phases in the stock and bond markets. This is the only text I know of which clearly describes how buying and selling of goods and services affects the balance sheets of ordinary people, companies, the banks and the central bank. It's the sort of book that leaves you feeling you've actually learnt something useful. Naturally it's very monetarist. Some will like this. Others will hate it for much the same reason.
