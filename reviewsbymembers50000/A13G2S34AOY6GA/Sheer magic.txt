 Gibson is gifted in the way most other sci-fi writers aren't. He has a habit of coming up with plots and ideas which then come true. Almost everyone else has the Star Trek mentality whereby all the aliens are actually humans - but with funny noses and bad teeth.  Neuromancer is best for its dark dub-reggae atmosphere. The plot is a bit wayward, but then when you have such new writing and such depth of imagination you smply don't care. Gibson set off the whole cyber-world genre with this novel. Anyone interested in the internet and its futuristic poossibilities should look no farther than neuromancer.  Brilliant.
