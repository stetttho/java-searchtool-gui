 This book isn't worth the money. The only Frontier in Finance that I went through was my sense of value for money. I can't believe I paid US$53 inc. postage for something so superficial. Anyone who works in the dismal science or financial markets will learn nothing from this book. It's little more than a survey of US investment returns from the mid-1970s. Non-US markets get scant attention and the chapters on bonds are wearisome.  In any case, anyone running a portfolio should know by day two that commodities, cash, bonds and equities perform differently at different stages of the business cycle - and, more often than not, in ways that most people don't expect. Often, but not by any means always, it's the information that isn't publicly available that drives relative asset prices. Investors caught up in any of the recent Emerging Markets crises now know this only too well.  Taylor's main audience seems to be the small time investor who punts US stocks - i.e. the type who thinks that equities actually make you richer without upping the stakes. But that type of investor is normally into momentum trading and that has nothing to do with business cycles.  Sadly, it is rather hard to see how the information in this book would be of any value to ordinary people.  Explaining economics and the meaning of economic statistics to small time punters is often like trying to teach Americans the rules of cricket.
