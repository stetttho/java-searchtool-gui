 The Origins of the First World War is a highly readable and enlightening tour of the world in mid-1914.  Joll doesn't come at you from any particular political perspective and grants you access to all the arguments for the conflict.   Nationalism, politics, military expansion, big business interests, imperialism along with conditions in each of the beligerents are examined in a free flowing easy style.   Joll does a very nice job in demolishing the Marxist line that WW1 was the result of imperialism and big business interests.  By the end you are left convinced that, while the German naval expansions of 1912 were ultimately to blame for the process that led to war, each country got involved for entirely different reasons.   There are good maps which give are easy to understand.  I do have some criticisms though.  Each chapter is self contained but doesn't have any sub-headings or breaks.  The editors could have spent a little time breaking up the text in each chapter to make the text a bit more readable.   There isn't a great deal of attention to longer term history - such as the lingering impact left by the Crimean war and its peace treaty.  But these are relatively minor quibbles about history writing that almost ranks as a work of art.   Joll was a highly gifted historian.
