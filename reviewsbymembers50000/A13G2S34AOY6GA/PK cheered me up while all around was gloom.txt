 It's 1999 and March. I'm in hospital with a very serious thrombosis in my right thigh.  A friend turns up and gives me PK's latest - with a cheery smile. This'll cheer you up, Sunshine.  This might be the last book I read and you bring me economics???? Fortunately, he was right.  I laughed a lot and cried at the foolishness of the carpet-baggers.  I'd read a lot of PK's reviews in Slate before and it was lovely to have access to the best of them, here in a single cover.  They range from rants on trade issues to a medley of observations on the Asian Financial Crisis.  His piece entitled Bahtulism will remain a classic for years....just for the title.  For me, what makes Krugman really great is not whether he's right or wrong, it's the fact that he can articulate his views quite beautifully and still explain where they are derived from. Many of academic peers are either good at being lurid pontificators (Hanke) or dry academics (Meltzer). Krugman is somewhere in the middle, except his economics is the witty, scarcastic kind.  Imagine how good he'd be if he converted to the Gold Bug camp.  Loonies with an articulate spokesman.  Now that would be something special.  Since I'm still alive and I laughed through most of the bad times in theatre, I'll have to give PK the five stars he's due.
