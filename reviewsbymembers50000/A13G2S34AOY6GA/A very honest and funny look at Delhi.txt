 Dalrymple is fast becoming a superstar in travel writing.  Read City of Djinns and you will understand why.  His style is authorative, yet not pompous.  His anecdotes are funny without being offensive to local sensitivities.  Everything he writes will bring back images and feelings amongst those who have travelled around the old decaying Mughal city.  What a beautiful place it must have been in its heyday some 300 years ago.  He doesn't come at you from any pre-disposed angle.  He just tells you what happened during the Moghul, British and then the India days from the view point of every day people.  And unlike many a British writer, he doesn't shy away from taking the arrogant colonialists to task for their blatant mistreatment of one of history's richest cultures.  The decline of the Moghul empire comes across as equally pathetic.  The racial hatred that has followed partition is also laid bare in the most frightening detail - a sea of Muslims and Sikhs sent to inhabit each other's territory with no chance of ever going home.  This is travel writing that is frustratingly good - and often very, very funny to those who grew up in either India or the UK.  If only I could tell stories as good as this.  Five Stars.
