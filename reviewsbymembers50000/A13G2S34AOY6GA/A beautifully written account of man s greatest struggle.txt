 Antony Beevor's account of Hitler's biggest mistake and (possibly) World War Two's greatest battle is a riveting read.  Rarely have I come across a text which has gripped my imagination and haunted me with equal vigour.  The scale of the struggle and the blunders - on each side - was immense.  Russia's mistreatment of its own soldiers was almost unfathomable.  Almost 13,000 Russians were shot by their own side for desertion or for showing signs of cowardice (whatever that might have meant).   The extent of Hitler's megalomania comes to light right at the beginning and shines ever more brightly as the battle progresses.  By the end, you realise he was little more than uneducated fool who didn't give a stuff for the armies of volunteers and conscripts that fought on his behalf.  Hitler's generals, Von Paulus in particular, seem to have been totally hamstrung by their leader's ever changing battle plans.  Their Russian counterparts suffered the same difficulties at the hands of their great leader - although in the end the battle appears to have been won by theatre generals who decided to take matters into their own hands.  One wonders how things would have ended if Stalin had been on the ground and not many miles away in snowbound Moscow.  Beevor does a wonderful job relaying all the information to a generalist reader.  Some have slighted him because it is written in a journalistic style.  I think this is big strong point since his easy prose makes Stalingrad a much more enjoyable readable.   You'll need sleeping pills, for you won't forget this book in a hurry.   Five Stars.
