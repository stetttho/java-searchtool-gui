 I tend to agree with a previous reviewer. Eyewitness Travel Guides are great for seeing the sights in large cities. But when on the road, they are a bit less than fantastic. My wife and I used this one a few years ago on a tour along Route 1 from Calistoga to San Diego. Most of the info was very useful. The way this guide book introduces the area and its culture is one of its strongest points. Its picture-driven approach is also a big selling point. Four stars.
