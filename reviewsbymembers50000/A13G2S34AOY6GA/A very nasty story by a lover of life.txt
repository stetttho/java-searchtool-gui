 Breaking the Maya Code is a great introduction to the complex world of decipherment.  M.D. Coe - a leading figure in the story - knows most of the modern characters and has the writing skills to really bring the subject alive.  Breaking the Maya Code begins with a wide-ranging introduction to the discipline of linguistics.  There follows the story of how the Mayan script has been brought alive over the last one hundred years.   Coe's familiarity with most of the modern characters, and his frustration with non-linguist archaeologists, means that this is not altogether a happy tale.  Academic back biting, sabotage by old-generation prima donnas and subterfuge by the dirt diggers, has held back translation until very recent times.  Coe believes this is a disgrace give how little time it took to decipher Egyptian and Hittite scripts. But there are modern heroes - Mexicans, Russians, Americans, Europeans etc - in a very international cast. These names are almost dietised by an author who clearly loves his profession and those who go out on a limb to make discoveries that others would try to block.   Great Stuff.
