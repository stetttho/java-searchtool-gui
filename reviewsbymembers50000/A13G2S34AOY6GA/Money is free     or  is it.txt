 This is probably the worst personal finance book I have ever read. I almost gave up after page 20.  The style and flow is horribly kindergarten and the ideas so rudimentary that it's hard to believe anyone agreed to print it.  RDPD contains a very basic thread which tells you to maximise your asset growth to cover your outgoings (duh!) and then goes on to tell you something about how Kiyosaki became a millionaire. Exactly what is true and how one should start geting rich is pretty hazy. Financial details are thin and his methods vague at best.  It's more of a motivational perk-me-up than a useful guide to making money and achieving financial independence.  If there is something positive to come out of the book, it's Kiyosaki's constant preaching that a house is just as much a liability as an asset and buying the family home early on in life can seriously impede your ability to achieve financial independence through leveraging your balance sheet.
