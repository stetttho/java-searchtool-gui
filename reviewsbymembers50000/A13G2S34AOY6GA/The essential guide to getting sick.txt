 Cadogan's Bugs, Bites and Bowels is the best health guide for travellers.  I travel a lot for work and pleasure and always use it when preparing to leave.  The text is bang up to date and easy to understand.  You get all the details on where you're at risk, signs to look for and lots of advice on what to do if your luck runs out - for each and every possible ailment. Everyone who is planning a trip outdoors should get a copy.  Five Stars.
