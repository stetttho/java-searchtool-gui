 The Worst Case Scenario is a very simplified picture-driven reference book for all of life's potential disasters.  And it's great.   Each waiting banana skin is treated with at most eight bullet points and a few illustrations.  There are bits on surviving hazards in adventure sports, wilderness trips, kidnapping, car crashes, quick sand, fights etc. ..... all things that the ordinary couch potato would likely never experience. (One reviewer below describes how bored he is writing his review since it was such a boring book.  Says it all really, doesn't it).   But in the end, is there any point in forking out your hard earned cash for some very, very simple survival tips?  Of course there is. You never know, you might just read something here that will come in very useful one day.  And that's the whole beauty of this series.  Life is full of unexpected problems and the people who survive are the ones who are prepared.  How many readers know why you should open the door or smash the windows when your car is in a river and sinking fast?  How many know why a stick will save your like in quicksand?  Not many.   Couch potatoes beware. This book might add years to your life.
