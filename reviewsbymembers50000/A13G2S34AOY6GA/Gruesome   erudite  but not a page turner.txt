 Sheldon Harris is considered the foremost authority on Japanese atrocities during WW2.  Here he documents the atrocities carried out by Hirohito's scientists in Manchuria in the 1930s and early 1940s.   He begins with a chapter or two on Japan's own Angel of Death - the architect of the infamous U731 experiment camp in NE China.  It's not particularly engrossing, but I suppose a character profile is necessary.   Then we get into the dirt - which is basically a highly detailed account of the depravity waged in Manchuria.  Local Chinese communities and POWs were subjected to spine chillling experiments, no less depraved than the low points of Mengele and other Nazis. The most disturbing fact is that the army wasn't the main sponsor at the beginning. It was the Japanese academic community in Tokyo and Kyoto.  It wasn't until the army discovered how effective the germs would be against the Allies that they became interested.   Then comes the second half which details how US and Soviet forces gave quid pro quos to Japanese scientists for their 'information'.  No one who has read anything about the end of WW2 in Europe should be surprised what Harris reveals in here.  I found this book quite boring.  I didn't manage to stay the course.  It took a couple of sessions to near the end.  I still haven't finished, some eighteen months after waging war on page one.
