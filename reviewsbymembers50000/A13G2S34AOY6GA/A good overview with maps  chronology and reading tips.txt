 The book begins in 1789 and ends in 1914, taking the theme that the nineteenth century was about peace and development - not about war.  It starts with revolution in 1789 and ends with the disastrous events of August 1914....a revolution since it made the United States a global power and shaped the Twentieth Century. In the middle there is peace...well, relative peace.   The Nineteenth Century is split into six sections - domestic politics, culture, society, economics, international politics and imperialism - and attempts to be an overview that will appeal to everyone.  I found the sections on imperialism, politics & economics the most interesting ... although the most readable sections of the book are the intro and finale written by the editor.  The book contains a really great chronology of the main events during the period.  The biblio leaves the reader with plenty of follow up leads.  And the publishers also provide pretty detailed maps of Europe and the world at various points along the way. Faults-wise, there are a few.  One, it's not really a blow-by-blow account of the main events.  It's more of a big picture or thematic overview and the reader may be susceptible to attention fatigue unless gripped by a need to know.  Two, you don't really go away with a real sense of what happened to the world, because of what occurred in 19th century Europe.  The linkeages are left for you to fill.  Fair enough, but one chapter wouldn't have hurt.
