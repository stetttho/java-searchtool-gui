 If you've travelled a bit in your time and know how to book tickets or manage your money, there is very little that this book will tell you that's useful.  My wife and I spent three months in Australia in late 2000 and barely used this book at all. It was heavy and it tried to cover everything.  It failed miserably and ended up being used as a door stop.  It just doesn't cover anything in sufficient enough detail to allow you to plan a journey properly. There are reams of intro pages giving advice on travelling that would only be useful to people who'd never travelled outside their own country. For example, what is the point in giving maps with one way airline ticket prices? There's a thing called the internet that's been around for quite a long time.   The information that you actually need isn't there.. i.e. stuff like international telephone codes, daylight saving rules etc. Half the info on accommodation is either wrong or out of date. Worse it's geared towards the budget traveller.  Many long-term tourists nowadays are taking time off after a few years of full time work. They have money and want to get a broad range of prices covering various classes of accommodation.  LP can't supply the goods.  In general, Lonely Planet guides are becoming victims of their own success.  They're bloated and boring.  Unless things change dramatically, this was the last LP guide I will ever buy.  I know many people who feel the same way.  Very poor indeed.
