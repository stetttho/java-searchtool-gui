 I bought A fire Upon The Deep when it first came out in the UK - circa 1992. In the intervening nine years I have tried to get past page 20 about six times. On each occasion I have failed - primarily becuase I couldn't follow what was going on. Vinge switches focus so often, and with such abruptness, that the reader is left wondering if this book was written for the author's own amusement, rather than the enjoyment of the paying audience. I'm sure that the legion of Vinge-lovers will hate me for disliking AFUTD and will probably try to claim that I'm a bit thick. Duhhhh! Good night children.
