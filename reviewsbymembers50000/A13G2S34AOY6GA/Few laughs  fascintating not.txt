 I read this one after finding it mentioned in Bill Bryson's Made in America.  Since the former isn't very interesting, it's no surprise that this one isn't either.  If you want chatty anecdotes about the inventors and their madness, this is for you. If you want to see how inventors have really made an impact on the twentieth century and living standards, then you'll have to dig a bit harder.
