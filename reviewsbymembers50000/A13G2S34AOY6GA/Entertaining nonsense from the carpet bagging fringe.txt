 Wilson's thesis here is not new and this is not a book for the gullible.  The theory is this: The world as we know it is not the first civilised society to have lived on terra firma.  Atlantis was located in Antarctica (strange how there's no evidence other than some raggy old map found on a pirate ship).  Some undisclosed catastrophe led to the abandonment of the continent and civilisation spread across the globe from this single initial starting point (strange how man has evolved and writing didn't just appear).  Since then man has lost much of the knowledge amassed up that point. (Such as the power to talk to aliens???) Wilson is a very good writer and this is more than just a rehash of the dishonest carpet-bagging tripe that that Graham Hancock trieds to pass off as serious research or new thinking.  It's a very coherent and elegant trip through the thinking that lies behind this left-field school of thought.  Wilson regales the reader with the evidence from Egypt which - he thinks - disproves the dirt-diggers (who, at least, have some hard facts behind them) and generally sets about amassing a wealth of evidence that there are things discovered in the ancient world that cannot be explained by modern science.  One example is the tall stone jars of ancient Egypt.  Wilson explains that these could not have been produced to such a height and with such intricate precision without the makers having access to very advanced sonic drills.  Where did they get them?  At this point, the mind boggles at what is about to come leaping from the next paragraph.  Fortunately, Wilson isn't stupid and doesn't head off into the netherworld of aliens and stargates etc.  Personally, I find it hard to believe that these guys still have the self-respect to stand up and repeat themselves to an ever shrinking audience.  But at least Wilson's pulp-fiction is interesting and entertaining ... as opposed to join-the-dots Hancock and his evidence-free cashflow & PR machine.
