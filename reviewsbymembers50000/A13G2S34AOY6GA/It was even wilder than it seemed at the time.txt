 Jon Savage's trip through Punk begins about 50 to 60 pages in - after some early flummery on Westwood and McLaren. From there on Savage just can't tell the story fast enough. This is a cracking read and, for me, a chance to relive a childhood. What a breath of fresh air Punk was. And what a story this is. England's Dreaming really gets you deep into the madness. For that's what it was. McLaren, the egoist business man, versus Sid and Lydon versus Richard Branson and the record companies. It was a game of chicken between the lot of them. Sadly, Sid lost in a big way. McLaren and Lydon? Well, they were responsible for two of the greatest pop classics of all time...Double Dutch and Public Image. The record companies now have the internet to keep them awake at night.  As for Ronnie Biggs. Well the law finally got its revenge in 2001 as skint Ronnie flew back to Blighty on a plane chartered by the English tabloids. Chat rooms across the land debated whether England's favourite villain should serve his time or get his final wish of one last pint in an English pub. The wigs have yet to decide the ending. But what a ride it's been.... Some reviewers seem to dislike Savage's apparent closeness to his subjects. I think that this makes for even better copy - especially the passage down the Thames on the night the dream came crashing down.  England's Dreaming is, quite simply, a wonderful book of life on the edge. The UK in the early to mid 1970s was an awful place. Punk changed everything for a lot of people.
