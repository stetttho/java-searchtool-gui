 The authors may be stars in the Maya world, but I didn't like this book much - especially after paying almost US$50 for the hardback version.  It may have great illustrations and very informed analysis of certain city lineages, but it doesn't give you a good flavour of the history of Mayan civilisation.  It's very academic in its approach and covers less than a dozen cities in the region.  Its conclusions on the rise and fall of one of Mesoamoerica's foremost civilisations were a bit perfunctory for my liking.  Stylish but dry. Two stars.
