 I got to page three on three occasions and it's now collecting dust. Owen Lattimore may have been a explorer and a beacon for sensible China research during the US witch hunt days, but this isn't gripping travel writing.  Maybe it's the fact that he uses old fashioned transliteration of Chinese names, I don't know, but I just couldn't get into it.  I'll definitely try again, another time.  First hand accounts from explorers heading off into the wild blue yonder are normally hard to put down. If ony Lattimore could write like Great Game guru Peter Hopkirk. What a shame.
