 If you want the definitive picture guide ot the wonderful archaeological sights of Mexico, then this book is it.  All the major cities are covered in spendid colour - as is Mexico city.  The eidtors have done a wonderful job in bringing the highlights alive.  When you open the pictures pages you will really want to see the real thing up close.  But outside, this area, the book doesn't really have all the information you really need to plan a trip and fully understand what you are seeing.  I really like the Cadogan guide books since they are extremely detailed.  This is a bit brief for my liking.
