 Landor's memoirs may be the pulp fiction of Victorian travel writing, but it doesn't come much better than this fast paced account of his quest to become the first white boy in Lhasa.  An Explorer's Adventures recounts his stiff-upper-lipped travels in Tweed across Himalayan mountain passes with a ragbag posse of helpers, lepers and bandits who often threatened to mutiny when faced by ugly women and men with long tongues.    There are inumerable tales of scrapes with local chiefs whose goals in life were to keep Johnny Foreigner out of Tibet with the promise of beheading if they didn't succeed.  How many of Landor's tales are true we'll never really know, particularly his miraculous escape from beheading, but it's a cracking read and another great glimpse into the minds of men from yesteryear.   A word of warning though.  Political correctos with no sense of humour or perspective should steer well clear.  This is blatant white man's burden stuff and only those willing to set their moral timepiece to London, 1897 will get anything out of this.    It goes without saying that fans of Hopkirk and Flashman should head straight for Checkout.  A hoot!
