 This is a collection of Bordo's scholarly work on the Gold Standard. It's mostly academic in style and contains quite a lot which will be beyond the generalist reader. Also, there is little here that will be new for those who know the topic well.  What I did like was the introductary chapters which describe how the system worked at different times and also how differently its workings were percived amongst central figures at the time. I found this very useful since most texts would have you believe that the system was a smooth functioning and uniform entity. It obviously wasn't. Thank you MB for this valuable insight.
