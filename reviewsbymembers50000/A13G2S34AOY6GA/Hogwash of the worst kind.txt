 This is about the closest you can come to publishing work that is plainly dishonest.  I'm a financial economist and have to be able to back up everything I say in front of an audience.  Hancock doesn't bother himself with such niceties.  His adopted strategy seems to be that if he can get his theory on television, then the general public will be more likely to buy it and peer pressure will make people less willing to challenge the obvious absence of fact.  Most people I know who bought the book, bought it for the pictures taken by his wife.    In Heaven's Mirror, Hancock takes a well established theory and traipses around the world trying to find and publish even the most spurious evidence that fits.  How can anyone be expected to believe that something earth shattering occurred 12,000 years ago when the evidence amounts to little more than a blustery text and a join-the-dots star map that is, at best, a dodgy fit.  Isn't it strange how there are only a handful of sites cited as evidence.  If he was right about a single origin of mankind, wouldn't there be a constellation of sites from around the world to back him up?   Strangely, there are less than half a dozen.  In my profession, this is known as data mining - a cardinal sin, and one which would consign the researcher to the intellectual rubbish bin.     If Atlantis is your bag, then try Colin Wilson.  He writes well and brings the story alive by looking at the long sweep of history and the anomalies about ancient civilisations that cannot be explained by mere co-incidence.  Atlantis may be a load of hogwash, but at least he's entertaining.
