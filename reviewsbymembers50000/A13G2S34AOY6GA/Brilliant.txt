 What can you say.  A high octane trip through the mad money-crazed world of the 1980s.  Everyone's out for themselves, not giving a monkey's for anything, anyone or even themselves.  And then comes the big payback when the whole thing's a cynical lie and you're nothing more than a little fish trying not to get eaten.  It's a real world version of the US film, The Trueman Show - except no children would ever be allowed to watch and everyone is a loser. Five stars, just for the swearing.
