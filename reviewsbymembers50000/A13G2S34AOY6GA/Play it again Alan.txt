 This book is an exception in a market flooded with similar tales.  While they all seem to start off with the South Seas Bubble and then trudge through the familiar seed beds of tulips and Real Estate, Devil Take the Hindmost skips quickly on to more recent scams.  It's a fast moving tale of greed and fear that in my opinion is one of the best on the market.  Chancellor, an ex. financial journalist, writes extremely well and knows how to spin a good story.  After all, that what all the bubbles were based on.  Hot air and hapless dupes.  Devil Take the Hindmost wasn't written late enough in the day to get into the most recent latest madness - the global IT bubble centred on the US.  But all the recent scams are there -: Michael Milken and his junk bond extravaganza in the 1980s, the Japanese equity bubble and the missing artwork masterpieces in the late 1980s and the Hong Kong property and Red Chip bubbles of the mid-1990s.  Working in the emerging markets field, I'd say market bubbles are a lot more common than some of the previous reviewers seem to believe.  I've seen almost half a dozen in Asia in the last six years.   In a nice touch, Chancellor skips forward in each chapter to look at how history repeats itself which vicious regularity.  After reading this you'll wonder why the recent technology bubble ever took off. There have been so many of these scams in the past that surely someone must have seen the crash coming.  Of course, there were many, many cassandras and many foresaw the final reckoning.  But no one listened.  No one bothered to work out their risk-reward profile.  In many cases, they didn't even understand that reward and risk go upwards hand-in-hand.  They were all too busy buying over-priced stocks and bonds in companies that had little more than an idea behind them.  Sound familiar?  Well, first there was a spot of trouble in the South Seas.  Then things got crazy in Tulips, The Gilded Age, Real Estate, Transistors, Junk Bonds.........
