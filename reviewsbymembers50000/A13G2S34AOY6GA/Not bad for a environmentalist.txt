 In his latest offering, Hoeg takes a stab at contrasting man's love of power with his real place in the eco-system. The result is a mildly sordid & romantic tale with a hugely green ending. Man's world order is ultimately destroyed by his own arrogance and failure to see the warning signs.  This is not exactly a new idea is it?   Overall, and despite Hoeg's lovely way with words, this isn't up to much.  The idea of apes living with humans reminds me of stories of alien replacements in America.  Hoeg's apes lack credibility in much the same way.
