 I read this book about four years ago and still wonder what it was actually about - Joan Miro makes more sense to my mother. Imagine publishing claims that you discovered the fourth dimension while staring into your bathroom mirror. And then expecting people to take you seriously.  If one of the reviewers who liked this book wants to reveal God's Secret Formula to me I'd be delighted to hear from them.  I'm never going to find out what it is by reading this narcissistic rubbish. 'Nil Points!'as they say at Eurovision.
