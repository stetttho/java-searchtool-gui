 Grey's tale of love and betrayal in Indochina is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It's almost seven years since I read it for the first time, but I still remember being transfixed by the atmosphere in this epic tale.   Saigon begins in the French colonial days of the early 1900s and explores the often cruel relationship between imperial master and servant.  There then begins the rebellion and the central love affair between the Vietnamese and Americans that moves in parallel throughout the book until the French are expelled and then when the last American chopper lifts off for freedom.  Grey's descripton of the final moments and the fight to board is breathtaking.  What makes this a truly memorable read is Grey's ability to carry a complex theme with a such light touch.  Never do you feel bored or weary.  Five Stars.
