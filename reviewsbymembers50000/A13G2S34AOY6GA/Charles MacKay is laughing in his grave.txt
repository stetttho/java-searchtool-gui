 I love reading the reviews of this book.  The one from Canada in early 2000 should become a classic.  If only the reviewer had read some financial history and maybe 'Extraordinary Popular Delusions & The Madness of Crowds' by Charles Mackay. He'd have realised that the 90s IT-bubble was nothing new and merely the latest in a long line of manias that date back centuries.  They all had sad and sorry endings.  This one was no different. Full marks to Sarlos for having the guts to publish contrarian views with such impeccable timing. It just goes to prove that American investors can be just as unsophisticated as their so-called Emerging Markets couterparts.
