 Like many, I spend my weekends away, up in the hills and along the trails of Hong Kong's wonderful country parks. There are rugged mountains, beautiful beaches, shady & forested valleys with deserted little villages and the occasional stunning view of Victoria Harbour. One of the best-loved trails is the Maclehose Trail, named after Governor Sir Murray Maclehose who headed the 1970s project to maintain and preserve Hong Kong' stunning landscape while allowing the necessary economic development to carry on apace.   This book is a fabulous collection of photographs from along the 100km trail. Each of the ten stages is described in words, photos and delightful Chinese calligraphy. It's more coffee table than some might like, but for those of us who know what it's like to climb Ma On Shan, reach the top and look out over the small expanse of Hong Kong and its many islands, the book's images will bring back many hard-won memories. For those that don't, well, buy this book and get out there.
