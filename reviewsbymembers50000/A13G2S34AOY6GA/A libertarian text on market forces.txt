 The basic thrust of Kirzner's IEA pamphlet is to examine the differences between textbook perfect competition and the Austrian discovery process - and how this affects long-term growth in the economy.  It's a micro text that's a little dry in places.  But overall, Kirzner succeeds in keeping the reader on board.   Once the main differences are out in the open, the author then goes on to describe how the discovery process affects different markets and differing situations - advertising and insurance.   How Markets Work will be of value to financial economists and analysts working in the equity markets.  It contains lots of examples of market processes that would be very useful in valuation analysis.  What it isn't, though, is a generalist text.  Three/Four stars.
