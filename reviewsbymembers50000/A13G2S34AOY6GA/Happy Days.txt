 For part of our honeymoon, my wife and I decided to tour Norway and the rest of Scandinavia.  For Norway, there was no better guide than this little book.  It gave us all the info we needed - baring accommodation.  But that can be seen to easily by popping into Norway's myriad tourist offices and booking ahead. It's great for a number of reasons.  One, it's very small and fits in your pocket - unlike most of the competition.  Two, there is little so-called 'travel advice'.  It focuses mainly on the best places to visit, what you can see when there and then ranks them in orders of fabulousness.  The nice thing is that each chapter is a self-contained route that you can follow by car, by train or in Norway's case, by boat.  Three, there are colour pictures of each destination along the route - to whet your apetite.  Yes, there are one of two that look a bit dated, but most are nature pics and these won't change much in a 1000 years, never mind fifteen.   I really liked this book and found it extremely useful - along with its Finland counterpart.  What better than a guide book that's ultra-light, clearly written and full of colour pictures.  Top marks Insight.
