 You can't miss.  I re-wrote my resume using this guide and it started  getting me to the top of the stack.  Being a computer consultant; in a  highly competative field, it was important to keep my resume short and  sweet.  This book was the ticket.  The book is broken into two parts:  part  one covers how to put a resume together (you the product and  advertisement), form and substance, format options, first draft, look and  feel, editing and rewriting.  Part two contains:  examples, tons of them!   There is just about one of everything.  Anyway, a must have for anyone  concerned about beating out the rest of the pack!
