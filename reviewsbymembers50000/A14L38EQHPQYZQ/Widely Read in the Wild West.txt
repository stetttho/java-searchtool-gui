 Blackstone was widely read in America for a century after it was published.  Lawyers practicing in the West almost relied entirely on this and the Bible to defend or prosecute.  This particular series of volumes is  a reproduction of the original publication by Blackstone (which BTW had  eight revisions while Blackstone was still alive).  The print is large and  dark (and very 18th century, i.e. ss is S (or f)), and makes for easy  reading.  The Editor's notes appear at the beginning of the book and are  not intrusive of the volume itself.  Overall a very nice reproduction and I  found it a nice read.
