 Brian Daley does a fine job of staying true to the original Star Wars movie characters.  Normally I am not a Daley fan, disliking the Coramande stories, and if it had not been for the "Star Wars" title I  probably would not have given it a second glance, but I'm glad I did.  All  three stories stand on their own, but together weave a great saga-like  tale.  The best (I feel) of the three is the first:  Han Solo at Star's  End.  The publisher's description does not do it justice, I feel it is  movie material.  The story's ending is very well written, you feel as if  you are there with Han fighting the Empire.  "Lost Legacy" is the  second best, but just a bit "outside" Han's character and a bit  too spectacular.  Overall, this is a great series of books wrapped  (finally) into one.  Well worth the purchase price.
