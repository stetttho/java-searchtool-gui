 Stop right here!  This is the book you need for helping you write proposals (consultants take note).  Tom Sant does a great job of presenting a difficult subject giving plenty of examples that you will find very  useful (a CD with all of the examples would have made this 5+ stars).  The  author starts by giving you a short lesson on how to be a pursuasive writer  (there are lots of hints and tips here): how to pursuade, you as a source,  establishing credibility, and writing to your audience.  Proposal  development is then covered in detail:  the process, getting organized,  etc.  Finally, the proposals:  Letter Proposal, Formal Proposal, Research  Proposal, Grant Proposal (with at least two and sometimes three examples of  each; I especially liked the fact that I had three Executive Summaries to  examine).  The author also speaks on automating your process and adding  bells and whistles to dress up the proposal.  A pretty good index wraps up  the package.  An additional appendix with a propsal writer's checklist is  included.  I consider this book to be a must have for every manager doing  proposals.  It will definitely help you win business!
