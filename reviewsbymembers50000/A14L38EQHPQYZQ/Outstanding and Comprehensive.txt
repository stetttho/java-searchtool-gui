 This book makes a great followup to Bob Larson's book "In The Name of  Satan"!  Dr. Murphy has written a comprehensive and inclusive book on  spiritual warfare.  He backs himself well with Bible scripture.  One  warning: this is not casual reading as the book is somewhat encyclopedic.   However, it has proven excellent in deepening my understanding of spiritual  warfare, and Satan's tactics and strategies!  Highly recommended reading.
