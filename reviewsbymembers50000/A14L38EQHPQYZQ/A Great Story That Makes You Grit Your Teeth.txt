 This is one of those stories where you wonder how it can all come out all right.  Where a multitude of wrongs must be resolved by someone willing to do right.  A stranger comes to town and shortly after getting a drink is  challenged by the town gun.  The stranger comes out on top and everyone is  convinced that the he is Kilkenny, the famous gun-fighter.  The stranger  does not correct their misconceptions.  The town to show it's grattitude  begins offering free food and services, and the stranger stays, but there  are those who know how Lance Kilkenny operates and the stranger's behavior  does not jive with their knowledge. A great story made better with crisp,  clear audio, special effects and well cast characters.  The audio is easily  heard in a car environment.  Well worth the purchase price.  Run time:  60  minutes.
