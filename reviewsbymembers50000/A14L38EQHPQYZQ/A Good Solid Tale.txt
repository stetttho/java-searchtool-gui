 This is a short review of the Audio Cassette version (2 Cassettes, Run Time of 3+ hours).  I really enjoyed this story.  Sound effects were excellent, and the story line holds together quite well, even though obviously abridged.  Kevin Conway does a credible job acting out the various characters of the story.  I especially liked that this book ties together the "Generations" movie to the "First Contact" movie.  The portrayal of the Klingons was very good, however, the Cardassian roles were a bit fuzzy and less defined (as written).  The role of Scotty seemed more gratuitous rather than useful to the story line.  Overall, a really good STNG audio book.
