 This is one of the better boxed sets of audio stories.  It contains: A  Job For A Ranger (Currently out of print, you cannot obtain this one  seperately):  Chick Bowdrie is called in to investigate a bank  robbery/murder in the town of Morales.  In the course of the robbery it  would appear that the bank clerk had been killed deliberately and $10,000  made off with.  Four men seem to have been involved, but none of the town's  people recognized the robbers.  Jim Bates, the banker, will be ruined if  Bowdrie doesn't catch the robbers quick.  What Chick doesn't know is that  the men will murder again to cover their trail. Bowdrie Passes Through  (Currently out of print, you cannot obtain this one seperately):  Bowdrie  hurries to the town of Mesquite to help an old friend, Josh Pettibone, only  to find his friend in jail and Josh's kids under attack.  Josh is accused  of poisoning a fine mare belonging to Nero Tatum.  In the past Josh spent  time in jail because of run-in with Nero's brother Bugs.  It would appear  to the town of Mesquite that Josh was out for revenge, but Bowdrie doesn't  think that is the case.  An excellent story where Bowdrie plays the defense  attorney in a kangaroo court! To Tough To Brand (Still in print  seperately):  Bowdrie is called in to investigate the disappearance of  $15,000 from the O-Bar-O owned by Lee Carnes.  The lead suspect is the  missing ranch foreman, Bert Ramey.  Ramey's daughter, Karen, doesn't  believe he would stoop to stealing, let alone leave her behind.   Complicating things is a hired gun, Bart DeGrass, who seems to have designs  on Karen.  Bowdrie has his hands full in solving this one! All three  stories are well cast, with great special effects (i.e. horse sounds, gun  shots).  The audio is crisp and clear even in an automobile environment.   Run time: 180 minutes (60 minutes each).  Well worth the purchase price.
