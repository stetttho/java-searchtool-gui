 A difficult audio book made enjoyable only by the readers (Nimoy and Doohan).  The book is easy to follow and stays pretty true to the original Star Trek characters, but I found the plot hard to follow (swallow)  sometimes.  The audio is nice and clear (even the special effects) in a  noisy car environment.  Nimoy and Doohan are the only redeaming factors in  a otherwise unmemorable book.  3 hours.
