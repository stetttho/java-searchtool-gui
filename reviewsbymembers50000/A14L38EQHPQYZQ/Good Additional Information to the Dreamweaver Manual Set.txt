 Sorry, my review title says it all.  Essentially if you are looking for a book to walk you through learning Dreamweaver (and have it done step-by-step) this book is not for you.  This book would not work for you  very well if you are learning from the Dreamweaver download.  Instead I  suggest using the online tutorial and help (which, BTW, are  excellent). Now, with the negativity aside, let me tell you what is  great:  it covers Style Sheets, Timelines, Frames (boy talk about being  nasty sometimes in DW), and Automation.  All of these are intermediate  topics and not for the shy of heart.  I liked being able to turn to an  additional reference for tips and techniques (of which these are scanty in  the DW docs). Anyway, well worth the purchase price, but not a beginner's  book.
