 Having been in the HTML world now for a number of years, I am constantly looking for better references and tutorials.  Elizabeth Castro has done both with this excellent book on HTML.  Again and again I find myself  turning to this book to find ways of doing things that I used to do in  JavaScript (the "Gee I Didn't Know HTML Would Do That!"  syndrome).  What I like most is the format of the book; an excellent index  allows the reader to easily look up specifics.  The book contains some of  the following chapters:  Text Formatting, Images, Layout, Links, Lists,  Tables, Frames (a big problem area for a lot of web programmers, well  presented and explained here with some pretty neat hints and tips), Forms,  Style Sheets (happily, this is heavily explained with four chapters  dedicated to it's many facets), Scripts (wow!  An HTML author who finally  admits there are other languages out there!  The author even spends a  little time on the basics of JavaScript, however, she stays true to the  focus of the book, only showing enough to wet the appetite before moving  on), debugging (this is another biggy rarely covered by HTML authors, again  well done here).  The author spend some time even on publishing a web site.   The problems and solutions to getting:  a domain name, web host,  transferring files, getting listed on search engines, etc.  Several  appendices:  Tools, Special Symbols, Colors, and Tag Compatibility are  covered.  The index is very well done.  This book is a must buy for any  serious web developer.
