 This is one of those you will listen too time and again!  Crisp clear audio, good character voices by the actors.  Excellent audio special effects.  All easily heard in the environment of a car.  The story is great  also:  four ranchers had settled an old grant...legally, when suddenly a  young Mexican brings in a few head and claims some of the range.  Things  begin to fly apart after that.  Then the rain quits falling and things  begin to dry up...  An excellent buy!
