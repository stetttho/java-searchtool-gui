 I found this an enjoyable tale.  Kim Sartain riding through the countryside, footloose, is challenged off of a piece of range.  Wrong thing to do.  It turns out that the range is unclaimed.  So Kim claims it!  Net  thing you know he up to his ears in a war.  Of course there is a love  interest.  Then the other side starts hiring gunmen and things really get  heated up!  The audio is crisp and clear, well cast, and has very nice  special effects.  Well worth the purchase price.  Run time:  60 minutes.
