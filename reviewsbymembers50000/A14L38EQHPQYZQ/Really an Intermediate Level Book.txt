 This book is not truely for beginners.  I would suggest a good book on JavaScript (for those sketchy in this area), an then a good book on HTML (again for those beginning to learn to Web program).  DHTML is a  combination of intermediate to advanced HTML and JavaScript.  Now with that  said, this book does a good job presenting DHTML clearly.  Here is a list  of some of the topics covered:  Cascading Style Sheets (basics, fonts, text  control, properties, margins, borders, positioning, ad-nausium...), DOM  (Document Object Model), Dynamic Techniques/Solutions, JavaScript and  DHTML, Layers (a real biggy for me), and Visual Controls.  Both Netscape  and the ubiquitous Internet Explorer are covered (with a couple of chapters  specific to their uniqueness).  Appendices include:  CSS Quick Reference,  Layers QR, and Resources.  The book is rounded out with an excellent index.   I especially liked all of the cross-browser information (comments, code  techniques, what would work and what wouldn't, how to adapt).  I would have  liked to have seen more on JavaScript integration with visual controls, but  oh well.  In addition, more information on CSS techniques with JavaScript  would have been nice, and when dealing with IE it would have been terrific  to have had some VBScript comparison code.  Overall, I would recommend this  book for the serious web programmer's shelf.
