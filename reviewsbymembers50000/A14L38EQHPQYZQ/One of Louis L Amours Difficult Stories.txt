 I have trouble with the main character in "Man Riding West."  Personally I would not have gotten into the situation that the he did.  Sometimes it seems that Louis L'Amour was scratching around for a story  line. The main character, Jim Gary, has been away from home for some time  and is slowly drifting back when he joins up with some men running cattle.   But, something isn't right with the setup, and as the days pass, Jim  wonders how he can extract himself.  Then one night, during a storm,  hearding cattle, Jim's whole world is turned upside down. The audio is  crisp and clear, and easily heard in a car environment.  The characters are  well cast and the special effects quite good.  Because of the dramatization  I enjoyed the story anyway and recommend the audio book.  Run time:  60  minutes.
