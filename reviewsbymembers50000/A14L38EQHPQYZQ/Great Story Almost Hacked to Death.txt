 David Stiers does a great job with the voice characterizations of this Tom Clancy best seller; you will have no problem keeping the multitude of characters straight.  My biggest disappointment was in how far down they  had trimmed the rendition.  For those of you who have not read the book the  audio will be very good, but you will find the characters lacking depth and  the story literally whizzing along without really being that riveting.   Still, the audio is crisp and clear in a car environment and will be  entertaining.  3 hours.
