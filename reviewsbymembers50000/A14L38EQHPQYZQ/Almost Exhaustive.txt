 This is a must have reference if you plan on doing any amount of Outlook programming.  The book is edited by Sue Mosher (of MS Outlook 2000 Programming in 24 Hours fame).  Byrne (the author) does a good job of  laying out the "world" starting with brief (30 pages)  introduction of Outlook, some examples of what you can create, and the  various design tools.  Next comes a quick guide to building applications  followed with a full blown example (which BTW works).  Other sections cover  building forms (controls, fields, properties, actions, folders, events,  outlook and command bars, the assistant), VBA and VBScript (this BTW is  where you will spend most of your time wearing the book out), and how to  distribute (and maintain) applications.  Byrne then goes on to advanced  topics like COM Add-ins, Home Pages, Data Access, ActiveX, MTS, and  Exchange Server scripting objects.  To top it off a CD with complete code  examples is included.  The book literally paid for itself shortly after  coming in my door.  The only thing I wish it had examples of is Javascript  for which there are nil, but this is Outlook afterall!
