 (This Review is for the Audio Version of the Book).  Mr. Takai does an excellent job of narrating his own autobiography injecting a personal note into the book.  He is a clear speaker easy to understand even in the  noisiest of (car) environments.  The first tape covers George's life  "before Star Trek" talking mostly about his life in the  "camps" during WWII.  I especially found this interesting as I  knew little of what this was about.  The second tape talks about George's  Star Trek life.  The people he met and how he felt about them.  His take on  William Shatner is especially interesting!  A very enjoyable set of tapes.   3 hours.
