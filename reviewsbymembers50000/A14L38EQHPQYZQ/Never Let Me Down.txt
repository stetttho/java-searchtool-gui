 A very well written book on the history of the Civil war west of the Mississippi.  Monaghan covers many of the battles I had tried in vain to locate details on.  Covered are the battles of: Carthage, Wilson's Creek,  Pea Ridge, Prairie Grove, and Westport.  I especially found interesting the  involvement of the Five Nations out of Oklahoma.  Much is covered  concerning the conflicts between Kansas and Missouri, but Texas, Arkansas  and others are treated with some detail.  Monaghan's writing style is  excellent, giving you a good feeling for what happened.  You will read and  re-read this one.
