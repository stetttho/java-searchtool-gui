 The audio version (although abridged) loses nothing in the story.  John Rubinstean does a terrific job of voice characterizations and you will have no problem keeping the characters straight.  The audio is crisp and clear  and easily heard in the noisy environment of a car.  My only gripe is that  some special effects would have been nice.  This is a riveting, non-stop  action audio book and well worth the purchase price.  6 hours.
