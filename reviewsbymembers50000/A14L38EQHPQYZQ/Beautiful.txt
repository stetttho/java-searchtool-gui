 This hammer, although pricey, was worth every penny I paid for it! It is very light! After putting up quite a bit of flake board (pretty tough stuff to nail through) I found myself in pretty good shape, fatigue wise, compared to when I used my old framing hammer. Be careful, it is the same shape and size as a regular framing hammer so when you pick it up you might accidentally hit yourself in the head with it! It's that light. After having read a few reviews I lightly ran a filed over the waffling to flatten it slightly and perhaps reduce wear. This seems to have done the trick. I really like the nail holder for allowing me to get into high-up places and drive with one hand. Nice feature. Anyway, if you can, purchase this. It is worth the money in my book!
