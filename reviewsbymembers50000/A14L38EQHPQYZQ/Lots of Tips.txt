 Gosh! I found this book useful and am amazed at the flames of other readers. I found information here that none of the other (Que, Sams, Wrox, etc.) books had. For example: Mailto, Submit-it. In this it solved some  problems for commercial pages I had developed that I could not (repeate  could not) find in any other book (or even the news groups). The only  reason I graded it down was due to the organization. There I do agree with  the other readers. It would seem that this book was rushed out the door to  print.
