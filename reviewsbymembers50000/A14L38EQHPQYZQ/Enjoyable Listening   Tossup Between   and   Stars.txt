 James Doohan does a credible reading of this somewhat mediocre book.  I gave it "four stars" because of this.  Otherwise the story is a "three star tale."  The synopsis above does a good job of  describing what happens.  Scotty is one of the "officers" trapped  on the shuttle and Doohan reading the part of his own character comes off  very well (as you should expect), not to mention that his  "solution" of the KM scenario is rather interesting.  This  "book" would have been even better if there had been some sort of  special effects (like background noise in the shuttle, or engine sounds  while telling the KM stories).  I recommend it, but there are better  stories out there.  Run time: 90 minutes.
