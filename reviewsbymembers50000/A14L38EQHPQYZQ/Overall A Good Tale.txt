 Originally I was not even going to pick this up.  Then someone actually  gave me a copy as a gift.  Well, I was then obligated to read it.  Glad I  did!  Of all of the alternate universe stories that I have read (i.e. L.  Sprague de Camp, Harry Harrison) this one did not disappoint.  Turtledove  does a great job of making his characters believable.  I especially enjoyed  General Lee.  The author, I felt, was very true to the historical man. I  found the ending to be a little weak, a bit pat, and very quickly wrapped  up (i.e. all-in-all disappointing).  The Rivington Men, men out of time,  had gone back 150 years to change the outcome of the Civil war for  mysterious purposes.  They brought with them many weapons from the future  which they presented to Lee's army.  At first with no strings attached, but  later...things change.  Among the weapons were thousands of AK-47's  complete with ammunition and training by the men from the future.  With  weapons like these, Lee could reverse the fortunes of war to the South's  favor.  I wish that the author had spent as much time on the ending as he  did developing his characters, giving them depth and believability only to  rush to the finish.  However, if you are looking for a good alternate  universe/timeline book.  This is a good read and well worth the purchase  price.
