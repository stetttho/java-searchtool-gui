 I found this to be a bit predictable, but still a very good audio  dramatization.  The characters were well cast, the audio was crisp and  clear with great special effects and it played well in a car environment.   Lance Kilkenny drifts into town (again) in bad need of a rest.  But the  town is anything but normal.  Soon he finds himself mysteriously manoeuvred  into a confrontation with the town marshal, but things are not as they  seem!  Well worth the purchase price.  Run time:  1 hour.  (From the Audio  Rendition)
