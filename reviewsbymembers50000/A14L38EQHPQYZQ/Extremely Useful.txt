 I have been following Bob Larson now for several years both on his radio  show and in his books.   "In The Name of Satan" is a factual and  accurate introduction into spiritual warfare.  He writes from a Biblical  AND Christian viewpoint; backing his experiences well with scripture.  His  theological and practical stance do not depart from the Bible.  A  recommended followup book would be Dr. Ed Murphy's "The Handbook for  Spiritual Warfare"
