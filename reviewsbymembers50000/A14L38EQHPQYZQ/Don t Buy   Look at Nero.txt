 First, let me state, that I am a BIG fan of 4.x.  It was a great program.  When Roxio went to 5.0 it was a huge mistake. Two products really were bad.  First was Roxio's Easy CD Creator Basic (bundled with a computer I just purchased).  It was supposed to come installed, but did not work.  After countless hours messing with support, on-line forums, etc. It still failed the same way, and never did work.  Sooo, I then did something "not-so-bright" and decided to go with Roxio CD Creator 5.0 Platinum.  Second big mistake.  First it required that I download an update from their web-site for it to work correctly (I am running Windows 2000 and parts of this product are incompatible with the operating system - goes for XP also).  I created a couple of coasters (i.e. failed CD burns).  The real grief was when I tried to un-install the product.  On re-boot I received a blue-screen-of-death!  Turns out that Platinum does NOT remove a couple of driver entries from the registry, but DOES remove the drivers from Windows!  According to the various technical forums I visited, this is a know problem with Win2K and XP.  The result is several hours trying to rebuild my system (there is an easy fix, but Roxio doesn't tell you what it is, I found it out on a support forum).  Anyway, in my book, any product that flames your operating system is a virus, not a useful program.  Oh, it is pretty easy to use feature wise, but I have had nothing, but problems getting Platinum to: recognize my CD drive (a Toshiba, go figure), run (after three different installs, taking different paths in the installation it finally came up), un-install!  A poor product.
