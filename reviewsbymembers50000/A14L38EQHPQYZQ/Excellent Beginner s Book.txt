 Ok, it would appear that people have reviewed this one to death, but I felt the need to add my two-bits.  Here goes: This book covers the essentials in learning Flash 4 from scratch (buy the book and download the  trial version).  Very well laid out with step-by-step examples to teach you  all the basics/intermediates of Flash programming.  My only gripe was that  it didn't go into outside interactivity enough (i.e. Flash talking to  Javascript to Flash).  Now what would really be great is if the author  would come out with a more advanced book.   This book also makes a great  reference with a decent index.  Well worth the purchase price.
