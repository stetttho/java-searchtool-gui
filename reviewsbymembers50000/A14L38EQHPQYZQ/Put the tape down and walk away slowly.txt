 This review covers the audio cassette book (2 tapes, 2.5 hours).  I was pretty excited in getting this audio book, full cast, new sound effects, original music, etc.  I just wish the story line would have been better.  Perhaps the hard-copy books were good...  It did have the feel of being over-edited.  Each tape starts off with a cap/re-cap of the story (as if this was originally intended for a mult-week radio broadcast...which it probably was).  The story takes place after "The Last Command" Thrawn book, and does a good job of filling in a lot of the details prior to "Jedi Search".  I found it very informative, just wish it hadn't spun through so quick.  What I get for an abridged version.  Anyway, the acting was decent, and I really like Billy Dee Williams' part.  Anyway, consider carefully before buying.
