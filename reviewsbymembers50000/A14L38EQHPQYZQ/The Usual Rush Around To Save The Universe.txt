 This review covers the audio cassette book (2 tapes, 3 hours).  Okay, really 3.5 stars.  This audio book had so much going for it: a great start, a terrific plot buildup.  Then...nothing.  It became overly predictable, along with a very rapid wrap-up.  The bad guys get waxed, everybody who needs it is rescued, and comes out the stronger, ad naseum.  Anthony Heald does his usual great job of voice characterizations (or I would have rated this much lower).  The sound effects and music are great, and expected.  Overall I would be cautious in the purchase of this audio book.
