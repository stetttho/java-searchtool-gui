 I found this book to be a good place to begin learning Outlook Programming.  Mosher does a great job narrating a pretty dry subject.  I found the code snippets to be correct and applicable (I still use some of  the examples in my production code).  If you want to learn about Outlook  programming (and why you should program Outlook) this is the book to take  you to the intermediate level.  Subjects covered: form design, the VBA  environment, coding basics, special Outlook techniques (Object Models,  Custom Actions, Stores and Folders, Items, Events, Menus, Toolbars),  debugging (a biggy), ActiveX and other controls, reports (some are pretty  limited, but not the book's fault), and the author even touches on Exchange  Server and Data Collaboration.  A pretty good index ties things up nicely.   This is not an advanced book or a reference, but a tutorial.  A very good  buy.  No CD, but I found the code examples to be no big deal to type  in...after all this is Outlook we are talking about!
