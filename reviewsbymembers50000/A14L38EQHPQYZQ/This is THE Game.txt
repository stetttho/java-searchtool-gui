 Of all of the strategy, tactics or first person games I own, this is the best and most often played.  I have even tried BZ II and found it to come short of the original.  There is not much I can add to the publisher's  description above, however, I will say this:  once you play you will be  addicted.  The challenge, no matter how many times I have won, is still  there.  This is the best entertainment investment I have ever made.  I  especially like two facets of the game.  First, you have the option to play  either the Americans or the Russians, you are not limited to one or the  other.  Second, there are support groups on the web that allow you to  download new maps, map generators, etc. for endless hours of additional  fun.  Well worth the purchase price!
