 It is not very often that I get wildly excited about computer books, but, well, this one did it!  Piemonte and Jamison have compiled a list of tips and techniqes that really help.  For example: the book paid for itself  immediately by helping me overcome calling a word document directly from  Outlook (try to find a readable white paper on that one!).   The only  reason that I gave it four out of five stars is that some of examples are  buggy (I went out to the web site and downloaded the code...which did work  and all was well).  The code snippets are plentiful and complete.  I have a  multitude of Outlook and Exchange books and have done several projects to  date using both Outlook 98/Outlook 2000 and Exchange Server 5.x.  This is  now seriously dog eared.  If you are doing are going to be doing Outlook  programming of any sort get a copy for your library, it is more than worth  the purchase price.
