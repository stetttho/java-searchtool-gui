 Liking Pilgrim's Progress immensely, and seeing this audio book available, I couldn't resist the urge to learn more about Bunyan.  I was pleasantly surprised to find this an excellent "read."  The book is read by  a man (unknown) who does a good job without a boring voice to the listener.   Starting with Bunyan's childhood experiences, to serving in Cromwell's  army, to finding the Lord, to serving Him in prison is a terrific story.   Somewhat humbling (like Pilgrim's Progress).  Anyway, well worth the  purchase price.  Run time:  about 60 minutes.
