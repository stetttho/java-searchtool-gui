 Overall I feel this is a good buy as I have identified several older model weapons without much trouble.  However, trying to find more recent model guns has been dismal.  For example try to find any of the new Sig Sauer  pistols or any of the new Derringers!  Anyway, I have identified a couple  of H&R pistols (pretty neat trick, good black and white photos helped  tremendously) and a couple of rifles (one a Winchester rifle and you know  how many flavors of those exist!) again by picture then description.  I  like how the book is broken into three sections (pistol, rifle, shotgun).   The pistol part is broken into semi-auto then revolver for each company  presented.  I would have liked to have a more comprehensive breakout of new  weapons (as I mentioned before) and more information on the various  companies (some had nothing but an address...if that), but all in all a  must have books for my library.  A good buy.
