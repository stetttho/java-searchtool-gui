 Chick Bowdrie is called in to investigate the disappearance of $15,000  from Lee Carnes' O-Bar-O ranch.  The lead suspect is the missing forman,  Bert Ramey.  However, Ramey's adopted daughter Karen disagrees, saying that  Bert would never have done anything like this let alone leave her behind.   Compicating things even further is a hired gun, Bart DeGrass, who seems to  have disigns on Karen.  A fairly twisty plot makes this a great short story  by Louis L'Amour.  It takes Chick awhile to figure this one out.  The voice  characterizations and special effects are well done.  The audio is crisp  and clear even in a car environment.  Run time 60 minutes.  Well worth the  purchase price.
