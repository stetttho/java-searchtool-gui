 This is the "basics" of metallic cartridge reloading.  All of the mainstream (and some of the not so mainstream) cartridges are here.  I personally load several different types (both rifle and pistol) and  constantly consult these two volumes for information on SAFE reloading.   The first volume covers the actual reloading information while the second  covers ballistics.  I like how the ballistic information is presented by  calibre and then grain of bullet, this allows me to easily find what I  want.  Finally, I like the graphics of the various bullets, even if I am  not shooting Hornady rounds I can look up the equivalent weight and  beginning working up a round for my bullet.  The covers appear to be very  durable (I have had my set for a couple of years now).  Well worth the  purchase price.
