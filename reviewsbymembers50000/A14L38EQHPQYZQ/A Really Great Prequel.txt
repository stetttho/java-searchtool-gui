 This review covers the audio tape version (4 Cassettes, 6 Hours).  This was a really good pre-SW Ep 1 movie.  It goes a long way to filling in a lot of the chess moves made prior to Trade Federation blockade of Naboo.  I felt that the story was a little rough in places, as though trying to keep track of one too many story tracks.  Alexander Adams does a very good job of acting out all of the parts, with the usual good music and sound effects blazing away in the background.  The audio is crisp and clear, and is easily heard in my car's stereo.  Well worth the purchase price.
