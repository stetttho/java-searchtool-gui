 An invaluable spelling resource!  I use it more than daily and it contains  most of the words that I use in writing (when in doubt I go to my handy  dictionary).  In addition the book also contains: common abbreviations,  proofreader's marks, a punctuation guide (boy is this handy), and a table  of weights and measures conversions.  A truly useful tool!
