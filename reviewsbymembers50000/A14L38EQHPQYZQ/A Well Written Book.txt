 Ok, first off, this book is gone.  It has been replaced by Installing Red Hat Linux 7 (same ISBN BTW)!  Now, that aside, here is a brief list of the TOC: Introduction to Red Hat Linux - Discusses the various flavors of Linux and why you should use Red Hat :-). Preparing Your System For Red Hat 7.0 - This is a really great chapter!  It talks about all three flavors of RH 7.0 (i.e. Workstation, Server, Custom), how to collect hardware information about your system, and how to set up dual-boot/multi-boot. Beginning Your Red Hat Installation - How to set up your boot sequence, installing from the CD (not as simple as you would think), creating boot floppies, installing over a network, using virtual consoles. Red Hat Installation:  Basic System Configuration - configuring your system (partitioning, formatting, network support, mouse, time zone).  Also goes into configuring your initial accounts, passwords, authentication (Root password, et. al.).  Completely de-mystifies these processes.   Red Hat Installation:  Basic Software Installation - Covers selecting a group package for your chosen class (workstation, server, custom).  Selection of individual packages: application development, X windows, database development, office and word processing, other shells (i.e. BSD), and other servers like KDE and GNOME.  The author explains how you can locate the various packages, verify their dependencies, installing from command line or X windows, machine specific configurations, and creating boot disks. Starting And Stopping Red Hat Linux - configuring the loader, booting, run levels, resolving startup problems (module and hardware), starting services, compiling your own modules, terminating services, shutting down. Configuring And Customizing the X Window System - XF86, graphics cards/chips, Xconfigurator, starting, GNOME, KDE, windows managers. Configuring Linux - system administration (linuxconf), network adaptors, nameserver, gateway/routing, hostname search path, printers (a really useful chapter). Using Local and Network Storage - adding storage devices, partitions/disks, partitioning, file systems, swap space, removable media, using networked file systems, NFS, Samba. Installing Other Software - RPM packages, RH Package Manager, viewing contents, installing and updating packages, removing, finding new, using packages from other Linux distributions (yay! somebody finally addressed this although it is brief). All chapters are carefully laid out and explained walking you by-the-hand through difficult areas.  An excellent index rounds out the package.  198 pages.  A definite must for your Linux bookshelf.
