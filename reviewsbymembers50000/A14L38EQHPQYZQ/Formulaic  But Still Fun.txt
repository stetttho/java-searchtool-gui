 Louis L'Amour starts out with an introduction on gunfighters that was very  interesting. He actually got to meet several. I found this story to be  relatively easy to follow.  Chick Bowdrie is heading west in Texas to  investigate a very large theft.  He come upon the scene of a battle  recently over.  Fourteen border outlaws lie dead in a small arroyo.  The  clues are few and the tracks: none.  Chick begins tracking them in his mind  and starts to uncover a very elusive gang of men who will murder to obtain  their goal.  As usual, L'Amour writes a captivating tale.  The voice  characterizations are well cast and the audio is crisp and clear; easily  understood in a car environment.  The special effects are great (bullet,  horse, etc.).  Well worth the purchase price.  Run time:  60 minute.
