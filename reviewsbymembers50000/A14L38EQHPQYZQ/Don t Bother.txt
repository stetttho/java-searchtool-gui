 I really like the Christian Classics series, but this one did not translate well into audio form.  The reader (an unknown man) does a good job in reading, but has a voice that will knock you out (asleep that is,  not a good thing while listening and driving).  I have yet to get all the  way through.  This is not recommended unless you have insomnia and are  listening at home.  The book urges the reader to pray, covering various  experiential reasons to do so (some Biblical references are thrown in, but  not enought to my liking, oh well).  Pass this one by, there are better  audio books out there.  Run time:  90 minutes.
