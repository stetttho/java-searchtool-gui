 The "Celtic" part of the title is what caught my eye, so I bought this for my wife and I thinking that it would be Irish folk tunes.  Suprise!  The music is quite contemporary and very nice listening.  Sarah  Lacy's voice becomes almost liquid at times and trying to use this for  background music doesn't work (I find myself stopping and listening,  pleasant)!  The rest of the group does a wonderful job with piano, acoustic  and electric guitar, bass, and drum.  My favorite piece is "Tell Me  Now."  Well worth the purchase price for this gem.  Run time:  around  55 minutes.
