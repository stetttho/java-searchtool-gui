 Chick Bowdrie tracks a killer to Almagre, a place going full-tilt with the brakes off.  Benelli, a local cattle baron, has the town wrapped around his little finger.  Chick has a really hard time finding one man among so many  bad guys.  Oh, and there is of course no marshal...he died stopping a  bullet recently.  A really good mystery by Louis L'Amour.  Well worth the  purchase price.  Casting of characters was well done, audio is crisp and  clear in a car environment.  Run time:  60 minutes.
