 In this story the Marshal is the typical Louis L'Amour type:  smart and  clear headed, being cautious, but not necissarily the gun-slinger type.   Marshal Fitz Moore sees a strange grey horse with an unfamiliar brand tied  up out back of town early one morning and it sets off a series of events  that get him in deep trouble!  The "girl" in this story is  anything, but typical (of course appearing in the middle of the trouble).   The audio is crisp and clear in a car environment.  The characterizations  are well cast.  A good story, made great in this audio rendition.  Well  worth the purchase price.  Run time:  1 hour.
