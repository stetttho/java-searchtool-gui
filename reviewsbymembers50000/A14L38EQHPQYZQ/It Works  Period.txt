 After going around in circles trying to get Roxio's products to work, I finally caved in and followed some good advice: try the free download of Nero 5.5.9.0.  Having been unable to burn a CD with Roxio (let alone produce coasters - see my review on Roxio CD Creator 5.0 Platinum) I gave this a whirl.  Install was clean and easy.  The inteface came up when I double-clicked the icon (somthing Roxio refused to do at first).  The program recognized my drive immediately (again something I had to coax Roxio to do). It was pretty intuitive and straight-forward.  I was very rapidly able to burn a 700 Mb backup CD of my files. I cranked up the write speed to 8x (something that I was never able to do with Roxio w/o getting buffer underwrite/overflow errors) and it not only worked, but it flagged me on a couple of things that I had forgotten.  Pretty nice!  Buy this!  I did.
