 Marshall and Manuel have assembled a significant anount of material that  has been written out of today's politically correct history.  Starting with  Columbus and working through to the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the  authors take details from newspapers, books, diaries and other materials of  the times and weave a story of Christianity and the founding of the United  States.  They show that the two were intertwined and not meant to be  separated.  A drawback to this kind of writing is that it can not be taken  as a serious history text, but rather as a historical overview or treatise.   In other words, there is a significant amount of personal comment from the  authors.  I found quite a few places where the authors imagined comments or  scenes about people; what they thought or did.  This is unfortunate and  caused me to downgrade the book slightly.  However, these parts are well  written (as is the whole book) and do not detract.  Well worth the purchase  price.
