 This review is for the Abridged Audio version (2 tapes, 3+ hours).  Let me start by saying that John De Lancie has a great gift for reading audio books and replicating all of the characters very well (even the women!).  If it had not been for him, I would have rated this book three stars.  The premise was a little vague.  On the one hand there were the physical limitations of how much matter could exist in the alternate universe, but on the other the Enterprise crew was trying to stop an invasion?  Perhaps some of the story ended up on the cutting room floor?  It seemed very weak to me.  Also, the crew does the usual pulling an improbable series of miracles out of a hat in order to win the day.  Predictable.  I enjoyed the special effects, quite good; they did not drown out the narration at any time, and added much to the story.  Hmmm, in retrospect, perhaps the story would rate two stars, and De Lancie actually brings it up to a 4?  If you like De Lancie, then buy this audio book, if not then the story is not worth the purchase.
