 This story grows on you.  At first I didn't like the characterization of  the hero, but after listening a couple of times that went away.  The story  is about Jeff Kurland, a young kid trying to scrape out a living raising  cattle in the high country.  Living hand to mouth with just a few head of  cattle and trying to impress one of the local ranchers to let him marry the  rancher's daughter (sound a little formulaic?  It isn't!).  Winter is  setting on and an escaped killer is on the loose.  Jeff gets trapped in his  cabin (with the killer) when the pogonip snow falls...and the story begins!   The characterizations are well done (with exception I first noted), and  the audio is crisp and clear in a car environment.  Well worth the purchase  price.  Running time:  1 hour.
