 The audio adaptation of this book is quite well done.  Denis Lawson (Wedge Antilles) does a credible job with the characterizations, well enough for the listener to keep the various characters straight.  His voice does not  drone (important while driving)!  Timothy Zahn has woven a terrific tale of  the newly re-founded Republic and their struggle to survive the remnant of  the now beaten Empire.  Or is it beat?  Admiral Thrawn is simply amazing  (it is difficult to write about someone as being intelligent and actually  having him be that way).  I can add little more to the publisher's notes on  the story.  The audio and special effects are crisp and clear.  Run time:   180 minutes.  Well worth the purchase price!
