 I had this book recommended to me by an individual who does Flash for a living.  Overall a pretty good tutorial book for those who want to do Flash inside Flash.  IOW little interactivity with the web/programs outside of  Flash's little world.  The only place I found useful in the book concerning  this was the appendix.  Otherwise, and excellent book with outstanding  examples.  I found great use when doing timelines (although sometimes they  "skin the cat" with the most difficult method).  Overall a good  reference to keep by your side when creating Flash objects.
