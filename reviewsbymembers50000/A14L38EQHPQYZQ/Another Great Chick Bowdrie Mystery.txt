 The characters are well cast, the special effects are well done, and the audio is crisp and clear in a car environment.  On a seldom-used smuggler's trail between Mexico and Austin, a man lies dying.  Chick hears the shots,  but doesn't get to the man in time.  Hauling the body into nearby Valverde  he finds out that a ranch owned by beautiful Rose Murray is in trouble and  that she had been expecting the stranger to help out.  Gold is involved;  stolen over 20 years ago and never found.  Then someone takes a shot at  Chick, and he finds himself personally involved!  A really good tale.  Well  worth the purchase price.  Run Time: 60 minutes.
