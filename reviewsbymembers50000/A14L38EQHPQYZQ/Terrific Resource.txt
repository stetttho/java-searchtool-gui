 I have bought a LOT of copies of this book and handed them out to friends.   This is a must for you library.  Dr. McBirnie does an excellent job of  tracking down not only the twelve apostles, but Luke, Mark, Paul, Lazarus,  etc.  He makes a clear distinction of Church history, legend and myth.   Very useful to anyone teaching from the New Testament.  The author does an  excellent job listing his resources at the end of the book (in case you are  hungry for more) and includes a comprehensive index.  Highly recommended.
