 Anthony Heald does a nice job in reading the Omnibus.  His voice (and the special effects) are crisp and clear.  Heald is good at characterizing the voices so that each character is distinct and easily recognizeable.   Anderson's books are great although at times difficult to follow (and a bit  spread out over the place), but still enjoyable.  I liked/disliked...the  jury is still out...the idea of having the Jedi Academy where it is, but it  seems to work and is well woven into the story structure.  The author is  very true to the characters from the movie(s).  Run time is 540 minutes.   Well worth the purchase price.
