 Despite recent reviews this is a book I plug  wherever I go (and that gets much borrowed from other programmers when I am onsite).  It is an excellent reference to HTML v.4.x.  Organization is the only complaint:  Instead of  truely encyclopdic it is broken into seven categories like:   General-Purpose Elements, Special Characters, Table Elements, Form  Elements, etc.  I don't even bother with this I go directly to the index  and find what I need.  Saves time (but I agree you really shouldn't have to  do this). However, the examples are very good and the coverage is  excellent.  Well worth picking up a copy.  Don't let the title fool you  into thinking that you will learn HTML from it, this is a reference not a  teaching book.
