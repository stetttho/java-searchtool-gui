 (This review refers to the Audio version of this book).  A crisp clear rendition of the book with good special effects, BUT a boring boring boring story.  I made it all the way through (90 minutes), but almost not worth listening to.  Also, way too short for the purchase price.  Your money is better spent elsewhere.
