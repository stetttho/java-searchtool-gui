 A while back, being interested in time travel stories and alternate universe stuff, I found this small tome and decided to buy it.  Best purchase I have made in a long time (like others I have read and re-read  this one until the pages are dog-eared).  Dr. Padway's character is  thoughtful and intelligent (being so and writing him that way are two  entirely different things showing off deCamp's brilliance at character  development).  This Conneticut Yankee (Padway), instead of lamenting his  predicament (i.e. being catapulted to 500 a.d. at about the moment Rome  falls for good), immediately goes about to see if he can change history  (ah, parallel time line development), and finds out how tuff that can  really be.  Even making friends you can trust is a bit of a challange.  The  only thing I find wouldn't work today is that in deCamp's time they still  taught Latin in the grade/high schools/colleges as required material so  that Dr. Padway at least has some familiarity with the language in the Rome  of otherwhen and allowing him to overcome that "very" nasty  barrier with some ease.  A highly recommended book.
