 This is Milne's only foray into writing an adult-level book  (unfortunately), having written it for the sake of his father (a consummate  lover of mysteries).  A country side mansion is a common gathering point  for several of the upper crust of British society.  One of the guests  invites a friend of his over to meet the host.  As the friend arrives the  host suddenly dies behind a locked door.  Foul play is immediately  suspected, but the police are stumped.  Somewhat formulaic, this mystery  had a couple of unexpected twists and turns which kept me guessing, until  near the end, what had happened to the host (yes, even the manner of his  death is mysterious).  I was pleasantly suprised when I realized that all  of the data to solve the mystery had been there all along, but I had missed  it!  This smacked a little of Christie and Holmes wrapped together (perhaps  an unfair comparison, but I did enjoy this book).  Well worth the purchase  price.  156pp.  I wish there had been more books like this from the author.   A shame.
