 I enjoyed reading the book so I was skeptical that the audio would be as good.  It was.  Simon and Schuster have done a great job abridging the book onto tape.  The audio is crisp and clear.  Boyd Gaines and Ken Jenkins do a  terrific job as the voice characterizations for the book.  I felt as if I  were listening to General Franks himself.  "Into the Storm" is  General Franks' personal story of his life from Viet Nam to the victory in  the Gulf War.  Great listening, well worth the price.  5 hours.
