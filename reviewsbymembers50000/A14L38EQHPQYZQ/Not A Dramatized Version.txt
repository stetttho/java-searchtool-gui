 Narrater:  Unknown, but good speaking voice.  The reader does a good job of voice characterization.  The audio is crisp and clear, being easily heard in a car environment.  From the back cover: Keep Travelin' Rider:   Tack Gengry comes home to find his ranch and girl stolen by outlaws who now  run the town and everyone in it. Lit a Shuck for Texas:  The Sandy Kid, a  man who discovers gold and comes face to face with killers who try to steal  his claim. The Nester and the Piute (my favorite):  The Nester tracks the  Piute just to make his day. The purchase price is quite resonable, but  don't expect a dramatized version.  2 Cassettes.  Run time:  2 hours.
