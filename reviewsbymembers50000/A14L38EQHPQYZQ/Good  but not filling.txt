 This review covers the audio cassette book (2 tapes, 3 hours).  This was a pretty good tale, but, as an abridged version, it felt like some things were left on the cutting room floor.  Once again, Anthony Heald does a great job in acting out all the various characters.  The story line was weak and choppy.  It does, however, fill in some of the gaps between episodes V and VI, so worth listening to for that.  The sound-effects were well done, with the usual music score from the movies.  Worth the purchase price.
