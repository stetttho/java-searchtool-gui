 First let me state that the interface takes a bit of getting used to AND for you old time Star Fleet Battles people, there are some changes to the way things are managed ship-wise. Okay, when I got used to everything by running the various tutorials (which were quite fun - you get to blow some things up), you finally can go and play against the computer. The AI is pretty good.  I haven't found very many ways to fool things.  I found that when an opportunity presented itself, no matter how small, the computer would attempt to take advantage of it (i.e. firing on a weak or down shield, speeding up to gain range from your heavy weapons). The graphics are excellent.  It made me smile to see that they kept the 2-D look and feel of SFB, and being a fan of the miniatures I liked it that they kept the ship types and shapes also.  With this game things hop and the stuff flies!  The drones are very well done.  Especially when running frigates you can actually see detail on them as they pass by! Anyway, this game is really addictive and I have already burnt too many hours playing it.  Well worth the money! BTW, you do not need to buy any of the previous Starfleet computer products.  This one has all that the previous ones have and more (I own all of them).  So save your money for any future expansions of this product.  Enjoy!
