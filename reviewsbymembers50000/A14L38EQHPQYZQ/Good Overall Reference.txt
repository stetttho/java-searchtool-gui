 I purchased this book in 1996 and it has withstood the test of time.  A good reference on how to start your business and keep it going.  I find that I turn to this book even now when I want a reminder on how to do  something (like bid proposals) or something new (like growing my business  beyond just me).  Ruhl has compiled real world experience from many  consultants (mostly on-line) and placed that information in a useful order  (with a decent index).  Well worth the purchase price, get it for your  library!
