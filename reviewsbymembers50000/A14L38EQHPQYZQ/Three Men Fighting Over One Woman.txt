 Lou Morgan takes a shooting job, something he has earned a serious  reputation in doing.  A man, Lou named "The Scholar," because of  his looks, is interested in a particular ranch; run by the lovely Nana  Maduro.  Another rancher, Henry Witterling, is making moves on Nana and The  Scholar wants him removed from the picture.  Unknown to all parties is the  fact that Lou knows Nana and used to be in love with her himself.  He takes  the job, but it is for his own reasons, not the money, but Nana!  As Lou  begins to get involved, it becomes obvious that there is much more to the  picture than a couple of men fighting over Nana!  The audio is crisp and  clear in an automobile environment.  The voice characterizations are well  cast, and the special effects excellent.  Well worth the purchase price.   Run time:  60 minutes.
