 Edward Herrmann does a first rate job in narrating Executive Orders.  His voice characterizations are easy to understand and keep straight.  The audio is crisp and clear and easily heard in the environment of a car.   This is typical Tom Clancy fare.  You will find yourself on the edge of  your (car) seat for the whole duration!  Well worth the purchase price as  you will listen to it again and again.  6 hours.
