 This collection of Peter Marshall's sermons is thought provoking and  deepening for those who would grow in their Christian faith!  I found the  sermon labeled "By Invitation of Jesus" to be excellent.  This is  not a dry series of discourses, but a living breathing set of gems!  Highly  recommended.
