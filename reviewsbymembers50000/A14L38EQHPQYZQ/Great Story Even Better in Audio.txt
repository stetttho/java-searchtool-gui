 A terrific adaptation!  The voice characterizations and audio special effects are excellent.  Clear and crisp and easily heard in the environment of a car.  You feel the bullets whipping by!  The story line is about Chick  Bowdrie riding to Deadwood to pick up a prisoner.  He meets a girl (of  course) and things get a lot more complicated.  Especially since the  prisoner has friends trying to break him out!  Chick has his hands full (as  usual)!  A great buy!
