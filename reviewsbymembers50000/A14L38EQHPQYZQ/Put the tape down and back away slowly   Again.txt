 This review covers the audio cassette book (2 tapes, 2.5 hours).  Okay, I should have known better from the previous book, but I am a glutton for punishment.  Again, good audio, great special effects, excellent music score.  Lousy story line.  The only value I found with this book is that it explains a few of the things that happen between the Thrawn series and the Jedi Acadamy series.  I was probably mistaken in my last review about the over-editing, this just appears to be so-so writing.  Choppy story line, poor plot.  Overly powerful jedi, under powered dark-jedi (rediculous is the word I was thinking).  Two-second love interest...no, really!  Talk about your flash in the pan!  Consider carefully before buying this audio book!
