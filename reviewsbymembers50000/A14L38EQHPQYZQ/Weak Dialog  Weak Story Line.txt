 This is a review of the Audio Cassette.  I was pretty disappointed with this audio book.  It sounded as if critical components of the story had ended up on the editing floor.  I had trouble following things.  For example, how exactly was Ghazi utilizing sub-space to reach his audience when everything pointed to radio waves being used?  The actor who played Ghazi carried the story; he was quite good and "into" his part.  Takai sounded wooden at times.  At one point the background sound affects and the music actually drowned out the Sulu's voice!  I found it a very mediochre audio book, and if it hadn't been for Ghazi it would have gotten a 2 star.
