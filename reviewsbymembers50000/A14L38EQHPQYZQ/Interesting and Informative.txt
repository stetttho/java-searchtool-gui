 Having read "The Light and the Glory" I was interested in their  next in what has proved to be a nicely laid out on-going series.  This  installment carries on from where the first left off.  Starting with the  Constitutional Convention in 1787 and moving through to 1830 the authors  spend a considerable amount of time on a much shorter piece of American  history (the first book covered over 300 years).  Again the authors  concentrate on re-introducing the reader to history that has been recently  omitted from our now politically correct historical texts.  The authors  take details from newspapers, books, diaries and other material of the  times and weave a story of Christianity and how the founders wove it into  the fabric of the early United States government.  The authors once again  introduce a drawback by adding personal conjecture and subjective comment  (nullifying the book as a true historical text).  However, this does not  detract from this book being entertaining and informative reading.  I  especially enjoyed the bin on Thomas Jefferson as a Deist and his personal  agenda upon becomming President.  In addition I found the diary information  from both sided in the War of 1812 to be fascinating.  I also was left with  a much greater appreciation of how God moved in the early days of the  United States.  Well worth the purchase price.
