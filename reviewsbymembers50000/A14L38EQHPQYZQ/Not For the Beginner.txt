 This book (despite it's intent) is not really a beginner's book.  I'm not certain really where it belongs.  The author fails to explain some things; as if taking it for a fact that the reader is a person with some  experience.  Now, bashing aside, I found the book useful in several cases.   Fireworks is an awesome tool, especially when used in conjuntion with  Dreamweaver.  However, Fireworks is not an end-all be-all.  Some of the  "side effects" or quirks, ascribed to the book in previous  reviews, are actually Fireworks doing.  Where the author fails is in  explaining these anomolies.  The book is organized well with a chapter for  each of the following subjects:  Basics, Document Setup, Colors, Path  Tools, Selecting Paths, Working With Objects, Fills, Strokes, Effects,  Text, Automation, Pixels, Importing, Optimizing (this is really good),  Animation, Hotspots/Links, Slices (a difficult subject, made easier by the  author.  I spent a lot of time here), Behaviors, and Exporting.  There are  appendices for:  Defaults, Keyboard Shortcuts, and Regular Expressions.  A  decent index rounds out the book.  I would have liked more in-depth  information on connecting JavaScript to objects and also some of the  pitfalls of integrating Fireworks projects into Dreamweaver, or integrating  Flash objects into Fireworks.  If you want to learn how to use Fireworks,  then my suggestion is to go through the Tutorial included with the  downloadable (and Full) versions of the product.  If you would like to  expand your knowledge or perhaps fill in the gaps, then this book is good  for that.  However, I suggest that readers check out the "Fireworks 3  Bible" as a better buy.
