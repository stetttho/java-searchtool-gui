 Putting it bluntly I love Sally Kenyon's voice in this!  This short story has been seriously enhanced with actors and special effects (listen carefully for wind noises in the background).  Everything is well  presented.  The sound is clean and crisp and easily heard in the noise  environment of a car.  The story itself is very well laid out and flows  nicely.  The story is about a would-be rancher (Mac Marcy) who buys a  two-bit ranch on high, dry ground and begins to run a couple of hundred  cattle (for which he has saved several years).  Things are complicated by a  rich next door ranch and a serious lack of rain.  Enough said.  You feel as  if you are there.  An excellent buy.
