 This volume is quite complete containing:    Life of Flavius Josephus     Antiquities of the Jews    Wars of the Jews    Antiquities of the Jews:  Flavius Josephus Against Apion    An excerpt from Josephus'  discourse to the Greeks concerning Hades and others included in the  appendices.  Also included are a chapter on the Jewish weights and  measures, a list of ancient testimonies and records cited by Josephus,  texts of the Old Testament parallels to Josephus' accounts and a harmony of  the numbering systems in the Greek and English editions.  Original full  page illustrations are peppered throughout. Very complete.  My only  complaint is in the print which is a type of old news print font and pretty  densly packed. Overall a very good reference.
