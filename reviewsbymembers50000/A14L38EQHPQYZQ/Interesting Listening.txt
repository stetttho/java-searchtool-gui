 Not exactly for the weak constitution, the audio version of Foxe is quite good.  It is obviously trimmed back from the written version, but still contains the mainstream content (all of the most important martyrs are  present).  Foxe, a significant figure in the Protestant Reformation, was an  eye witness to many Christians being killed for their faith (both  Protestant and Catholic).  This persecution lead him to delve into other  persecutions throughout the Church's history with the result being this  book.  The audio is read by a woman (unknown) who has a clear speaking  voice and comes across without boring the listener.  Well worth the  purchase price.  Run Time: 90 minutes.
