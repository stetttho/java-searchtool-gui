 I am not what you would call a regular reader of motivational material (being highly self-motivated myself), but I found this audio book interesting and thought provoking.  Stephen Covey does a good job reading  his voice is crisp and clear even in the noisy environments of a car.   Covey breaks out the seven most effective habits used by successful people  and makes them easy to understand and incorporate into your own life.  2hr  30min.  Worth listening to.
