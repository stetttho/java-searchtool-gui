 Having already reviewed the book I would like to go on and add a couple of comments on the audio version.  While the material was well presented and Hanegraaff has a clear speaking voice, there were times that the background  score began to drown him out.  The music could have been better chosen and  more subdued.  The majority of the important text from the book is  presented however, and listeners will not be disappointed.
