 Holtz does a pretty good job with touching on all the areas of Computer Consulting from the home or as an independent.  My only complaint is that the author does not spend enough time with things like:  creating proposals  (an example or two would have been nice), fee structures (how to set your  fee competatively), overhead calculation (only touches on this).  A good  starting place, but more in-depth books are needed to make a successful go  of it.  Do not depend on just this book.
