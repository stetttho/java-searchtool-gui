 The authors have crafted a great reference.  I found this to be an  exremely useful basic to advanced VC++ programmers manual/tutorial.  Every  topic is well explained and leads you by the hand through several difficult  areas.  The amazing part is that the authors cover everything including the  kitchen sink (i.e. Windows CE).  Topics covered include: Windows, VC++,  and Application Framework Fundamentals:  Windows and VC++, MFC Application  Framework MFC Library View Class:  AppWizard, Event Handling, GDI, Common  Controls, Dialogs, ActiveX, IE (albeit 4.0), Win32 Memory Management (an  extremely useful chapter for me), Bitmaps, Multithreading (another very  well written chapter on what could be a difficult subject) The  Document-View Architecture:  Menus, Keyboard Acclerators, Rich Edit  Control, Property Sheets, Toolbars, Status Bars (and other basic stuff),  Reusable Frame Windows Base Class (a nice chapter), SDI, MDI, Printing,  Help, DLLs COM, Automation, and OLE:  COM basics, Automation basics,  Uniform Data Transfer, Structured Storage, OLE: components and containers  (this is very well treated), Active Template Library basics Database  Management:  ODBC, DAO, DB Templates Programming For The Internet:   TCP/IP, Winsock, WinInet, Programming with IIS, ActiveX document servers,  Dynamic HTML basics, Windows CE Appendices Include:  Message map  functions in MFC, and MFC library runtime class identification dna dynamic  object creation. As you can see; this is exhaustive.  Examples are  plentiful and relevant and fairly bug free (I have actually used the CD-ROM  quite often).  A comprehensive index wraps up the whole book quite nicely.   This is a must have for anyone who is a beginner (and definitly for the  more advanced VC++ wannabes)!  Well worth the purchase price.
