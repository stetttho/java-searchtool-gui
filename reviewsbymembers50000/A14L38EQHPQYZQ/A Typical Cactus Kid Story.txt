 I found this story to be a bit predictable, but the characterizations were good and the special effects are a great addition.  The audio is crisp and clear and easily heard in a car environment.   The Cactus Kid, on the way  to meet his girl at a social, is waylayed by the Fernandez brothers bent on  revenge for the killing (by the Kid) of one of their brothers.  Then they  deicide to further the revenge by kidnapping the Kid's girl, Bess, and  bringing her (and the kid) to an old indian medicine ground.  No one, but  they, know where they are, and all will think the Kid and Bess have eloped  together.  It looks as if the Fernandez brothers will get their revenge  with no one the wiser. At times it is a bit difficult to follow the  story, but a couple of listenings cleared it up (some).  Anyway, I enjoyed  the tale and recommend the audio book.  Run time:  60 minutes.
