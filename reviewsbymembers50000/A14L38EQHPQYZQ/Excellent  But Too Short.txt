 Kit Carson was a man of few words in life and in his own autobiography.  It is unfortunate that such a dynamic individual didn't write down more!   Quaife does a terrific job with the notes.  Explaining everything that  Carson failed to include.  This is a common problem as, for example, Kit  Carson will say something to the effect:  Fought indians today, and Quaife  will fill in all of the details about what tribe, how many, who was killed  or wounded in both parties, etc.  I am fascinated by how much detail is  known of Carson's time.  Very readable, my only complaint was that it was  too short!  The editor has included a nicely laid out index.  I found the  book well worth the purchase price!  BTW, for those of you looking for  information on William F. Drannon, he is not mentioned anywhere in Carson's  autobiography.
