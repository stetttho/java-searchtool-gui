 I challange you to find a more comprehensive book on VBScript!  This did the trick and solved several problems/issues that I had been having (all of them very complex) when dealing with VBScript in HTML (and ASP for that  matter).  The only problem I had was with the index, which could have been  more complete. This book is presented as a tutorial (even written to some  degree as a tutorial), but it's usefulness is as a reference (and a pretty  advanced one I might add).  Well worth the purchase price.
