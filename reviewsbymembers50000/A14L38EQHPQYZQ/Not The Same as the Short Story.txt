 Someone rewrote this...and it is better!  I have a copy of War Party so am familiar with the original story.  This is similar, but unwinds like a movie!  Great audio characterizations and special effects.  Clear and crisp  and easily heard in a car environment.  The story line is about a  mail-order bride who has trouble adapting to her new way of life...and  husband.  She runs away and then night falls.  Then she meets a stranger...   Excellent buy!
