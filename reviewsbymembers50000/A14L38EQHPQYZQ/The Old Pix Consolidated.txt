 I originally grew up and attended church in the North East.  Among the Sunday School materials distributed was a little pamphlet called Pix.  Almost every week Pix would contain a couple of pages of the Bible rendered  in cartoon.  Cook publishing has taken most of these and compiled them into  one volume (yes, I still have some of the original Pix even after 30 years  and I have found a few installments to be missing from this Bible, not a  biggy as everything of importance is there, especially the Gospel message).   I found that my children really didn't start getting into the  pictures/stories until they were around four so you may want to gauge  accordingly (some of th pictures/themes presented are complex for younger  ages).  Even though this Bible is in cartoon form there are plenty of  references to the actual Bible so that if you question something you can go  look it up (a feature I like a lot).  In addition there is an  "Index" of scripture at the end.  Matthew through John are  condensed into one "book", and the New Testament as a whole is  paired down (this is obvious as the "story" content is rather  lacking, i.e. letters of Paul, Peter, John).  Hebrews through Revelation  covers only three pages (I wished they hadn't done this, Pix covered  Revelation quite well and they should have included all of the original  pages, instead it gets about 2/3 of a page).  Included are several  historical/archealogical tidbits scattered throughout.  I consider this a  must have and would definitely like to see a fully exhaustive update with  every cartoon from Pix included.  Well worth the purchase price (for adult  or child)!
