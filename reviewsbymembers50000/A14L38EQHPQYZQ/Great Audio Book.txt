 This review covers the audio cassette book (2 tapes, 2.5+ hours).  The music score was great, the sound effects terrific, and the acting very good.  The plot...well that could take some time finding, but remember episdoe IV!  Anyway, I really enjoyed this story.  It takes place at about the same time as Ep. IV, and covers things more from the perspective of the Empire.  Well worth the purchase price.  I will have to see about getting the next two in the series.  I want to see what happens!
