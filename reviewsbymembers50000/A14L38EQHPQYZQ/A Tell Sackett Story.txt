 Tell Sackett owns a peice of ground in the Camp Verde country that refuses  to yeild any gold.  All around him his friends are pulling out hundreds of  dollars, but for him: nothing.  Those who do make it rich cannot leave for  fear of the Cooper gang which knows who has the gold and who doesn't.   Lately anyone trying to leave with any form of wealth is robbed and killed.   Several miners approach Tell and offer him several hundred dollars if he  would transport 50 lbs. of gold to the bank in Aubrey (three or four days  ride).  Tell takes the job.  The next day on the trail he runs into a woman  on foot.  Her horse had thrown her.  Now with a woman in tow and the  Coopers on his trail that gold weighs even more than he is comfortable  with!  The audio is crisp and clear, the characters are well cast, and the  special effects are quite good.  I like these dramatizations, for while you  are listening to them it is similar to watching a movie!  Well worth the  purchase price.  Run time:  60 minutes.
