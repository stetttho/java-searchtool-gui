 Let me put a plug in from a layman's point of view:  Great book! Ok, now why would a layman even be interested in this book?  Simple, with all the experiental preaching going on these days my search for: "what makes a  good preacher?" and "how do you know what good preaching  is?" has led me to this book. I have known about expository  preaching (and have been priveledged to have listened to preachers who  actually preach consistantly from the Word) of course, but wanted to learn  more.  The Olford's book does a fabulous job.  First and foremost they  define the role of a preacher (the Call of God, The Word, living the life  of a Godly man; being a man of God, and doing the work of God).  Secondly  they go into the preparation of the sermon (I have listened to many  preachers that sound as if they prepared their sermon the night before, and  I have had some even confess to me that that was precisely what they had  done!).  Lastly they explain delivery of the sermon (proclamation of the  Word AND Salvation). This book describes that preaching the Word should  be an exciting experience (in the preparation, delivery and expectation of  change in individuals by the Lord)!  I especially like the author's  emphasis on fearless preaching (i.e. speaking on how today's happenings  compare to the Word).  Definitely no P.C. preaching here! It now holds a  prominent spot on my bookshelf!  Definitely worth the purchase price.
