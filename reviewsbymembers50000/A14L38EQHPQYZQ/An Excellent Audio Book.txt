 This is to review the audio cassette version.  Run time over 3 hours (2 cassettes).  Nimoy does a very credible job in reading this and portraying the various characters in the story.  Sound affects are excellent, and the music does not get in the way.  The story line does a great job of tying together some loose ends of Spock's past.  We find out what led to Spock joining Star Fleet and as an added bonus how he ends up in the diplomatic corp (sic. STNG - Romulans).  Even with jumping back and forth between past and present the story holds together quite well.  Anyway, I highly recommend this audio book, very enjoyable!
