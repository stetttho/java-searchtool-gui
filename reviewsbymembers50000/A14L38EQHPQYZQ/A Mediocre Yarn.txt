 No, Dale Brown is not another Tom Clancy.  However, this particular book does a credible job spinning a story around a resurrected B-52 fleet.  Joseph Campanella's voice characterizations are quite good and easily  recognizable allowing the listener to keep the many characters straight  while concentrating on the story line.  The audio is crisp and clean making  for easy listening in a high noise environment.  I especially enjoyed  Brown's geographical description of Taiwan, and warfare between China and  Taiwan.  However, landing a modified B-52 in Taiwan where they did...naw.   Anyway, 6 hours.
