 I found this to be an excellent book to go from Beginner to Intermediate level JavaScript. All topics are covered (some like "Storing Information in Frames" are a little choppy and hard to follow). I was  able to use several of the examples in the book to enhance websites that I  maintain, AND to move off of the unpopular VBScript allowing things to be  more browser independent (i.e. Linux)! That made it a pretty good reference  as well. Overall a good book for beginners.
