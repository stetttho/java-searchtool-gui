 This review is for the abridged audio version (2 tapes, 3+ hours).  Jonathan Frakes did a great job reading this, he has a good voice, and does a credible job in recreating all of the characters.  The story itself was very engaging, but disconnected in a few places (not bad, but it was obvious that some things ended up on the cuttingroom floor).  The sound affects were good, never drowning out the narrater.  Overall a good purchase, and I recommend it.
