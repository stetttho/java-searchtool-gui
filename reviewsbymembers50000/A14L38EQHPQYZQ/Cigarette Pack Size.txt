 I was having some trouble roaming around my house with my laptop and WPC11 (Linksys) PCMCIA card. Signal strength did not appear to be that great. I found that tipping my laptop on edge I received a good strong signal. This led me to do a little on-line research and I found this article:  http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,20417,00.asp  On WEP and antennas. I almost purchased an antenna for my WAP11 (Linksys) unit, but instead decided to try the WUSB11 first. Glad I did. The price for an antenna ($30 to $60) is comparable, but the flexibility of the WUSB11 is preferable I reasoned, if it worked.  It did. Out of the box it is plug-and-play. The box contained: the unit, a 6ft USB cable, an installation CD, and a quick-install guide. I was up and running in about 3 minutes (took me a couple of those minutes just to turn on my laptop!). It was that easy. The time included configuring the WUSB11 to interface with my SSID and WEP settings! Wow! Okay, now for the test: will it work better than the WPC11. I began roaming my house, and with the exception of a couple of remote closets (really dark anyway), I received a 50-80% signal everywhere! Antenna orientation is a major factor on reception!  I decided on a more rigorous test: would it work out in my garage (separate from the house). The farthest corner of the garage is over 100ft away and the signal would have to travel through 3-4 interior walls, 1 exterior brick wall, and 1 wood covered garage wall. Signal strength was 60%! My WPC11 would barely register out there.  Okay, sold. I will be purchasing a couple more of these to allow me to place computers around the house for the rest of my family and NO wiring.  I highly recommend the WUSP11.
