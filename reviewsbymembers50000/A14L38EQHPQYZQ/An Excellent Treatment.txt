 I found this to be a very useful book.  The examples were relevant (and  not buggy - a definite plus, and useful!).  This is one book where I  actually used the CD-ROM instead of throwing it into a drawer (where most  of my Book/CD's end up).  I purchased the first inception of this book and  didn't know if getting an update would be necessary (the COM+ seemed of  little additional benefit).  I was glad I went ahead and got a copy.  Some  things have changed! Some of the chapters covered: COM/COM+  Internals Understanding COM+ Objects COM Servers Apartments and  Multithreading (a real biggy with me) Remote Activation MTS Run-Time  Environment Transactions MMQ Distributed Applications Also covered  are Distributed COM+ basics, interface-based programming (101), internals,  and designing interfaces.  Everything is wrapped up with a very good index.   Definitely worth the purchase price.  A must for every serious Web/n-Tier  programmer.
