 Alexander Adams does an excellent job of reading the unabridged version.  His characterizations are clear (as are the special effects) and easy to recognize (a must when narrating a long story).  Brooks does a great job in  filling out the characters (something the movie fails to do) and you get a  real sense of being there.  The "race" was especially good. 9.5  hours.  Well worth the purchase price.
