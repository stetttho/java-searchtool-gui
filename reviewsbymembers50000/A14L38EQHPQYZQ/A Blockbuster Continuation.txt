 In the first audio book, "Heir to the Empire", the story was read by Denis Lawson (Wedge Antilles), who did a credible job.  With Anthony Daniels (C3PO) things have improved considerably.  Daniels has a  much better reading voice.  He has great voice characterizations allowing  the reader to easily keep the many characters straight.  Once again the  special effects are excellent (blaster fire, star ship engines, etc.).  The  audio is crisp and clear in a car environment.  Timothy Zahn continues the  story of the fledgling New Republic.  Admiral Thrawn (of the Empire) is the  last surviving Grand Admiral, and his plans to bring down the New Republic  are slowly culminating.  In addition to that threat the NR has also to deal  with a new Dark Jedi.  Zahn does a great job with the old "wheel  within a wheel" type story.  There are several (but not too many)  threads running through the book that make it very entertaining and keep  you longing for more.  Well worth the purchase price (I can't add anything  more to the publisher's review).  Run time:  180 minutes.
