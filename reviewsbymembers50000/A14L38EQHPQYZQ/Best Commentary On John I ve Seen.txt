 Borchert has compiled an extremely thorough volume.  He is conservative in  his approach bringing together the latest in exegetical discoveries.  My  only regret is that it covers just the first 11 chapters.  I look forward  to his second volume!  Highly recommended to those wanting to dig deeply  into a very deep book!
