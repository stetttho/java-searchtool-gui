 This book spends the first 200 pages covering the basics of the flash tools, creating graphics, animating techniques, and sound integration. Then it dives into the good stuff: Flash interactivity (i.e. Actions/Event  handlers, Movies, ActionScript). Then the book covers interactivity with  other programs: Raster graphics, Vector Graphics, Quicktime, etc. Finally  distributing your flash movies. I gave this four stars because I found the  150 pages of "Using Flash with Other Programs" marginally useful.  To have been a really great book I would have liked to have seen more  JavaScript, advanced control usage (i.e. combobox, listbox, slidercontrol),  and "page-to-page" information transferral examples (all  intermediate to advanced concepts).  This book also makes a good overall  reference and has a decent index.
