 "The Face" does a great job of laying out the "facts" of evolution.  Some of the areas covered are the survival of the fittest, Pseudosaurs, Punctuated Equilibrium, the eye, the egg, entropy (my  favorite), and recapitulation.  Also tackled are such subjects as  Theological Evolution, empirical science, and the fossil  "evidence."  The appendices include information on Bible origins,  human cloning, and refuting abortion arguments.  Hanegraaff's writing style  is succinct and to the point, being enjoyable without boring (a must when  presenting what could be extremely dry material).  A very useful and  interesting book.
