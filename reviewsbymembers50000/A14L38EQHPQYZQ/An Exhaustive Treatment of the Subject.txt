 Matt Bortniker has written a great reference!  Every facet of the subject  is well laid out with relevant examples (the only bothersome aspect of this  is having to go out to the web and download them).  Some of the chapters  include: MTS and the Distributed Environment Introducing MTS  Explorer COM and MTS Architecture Transaction Processing Designing  MTS Components and Interfaces Building MTS Components Managing  Components and Packages Implementing Security (a real biggy for  me) Debugging MTS Components (another tricky subject, well  covered) Administration Data Services and MTS MTS and the  Internet COM+ Also included are a complete application (Sales Order  App) and an MTS type library reference (this was really nice to  have). Downsides:  No CD-ROM and they really squashed the print in tight  in some places.  Everything is well laid out and explained clearly.  I have  found this to be one of my more used COM books.  A nice index rounds out  the whole package.  Well worth the purchase price.  A must have if you plan  on learning intermediate to advanced topics in VB and MTS.
