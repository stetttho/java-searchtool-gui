 This boxed set brings together three of the best Chick Bowdrie  stories: South of Deadwood - Chick is sent to retrieve a captured leader  of a deadly gang.  Deadwood is way outside of Texas, and Chick must bring  him back cross country.  The only problem is that the rest of the gang is  still at large and gunning for Chick.  Louis L'Amour does an introduction  on the town of Deadwood. A Trail West - A gang has kidnapped the daughter  of a Texas judge to keep him from sentencing one of their own in prison.   Chick is sent to retrieve her.  Or die trying!  This one ends up in  Arizona.  Louis L'Amour does and introduction on women of the west (which  was very interesting) (BTW-this one is out of print now and can only be  obtained with this set). Where Buzzards Fly - Chick is sent to  investigate a big robbery that has happened in west Texas only to find that  the robbers have been murdered (all fourteen of them) and the loot has  vanished without a trace.  Chick must trail them with his mind and his  wile.  Louis L'Amour does an introduction on gunfighters (some of which he  had actually met). All three dramatizations are well cast.  The special  effects are excellent.  The audio is crisp and clear and easily understood  in the noisy environment of a car.  Well worth the purchase price.  Run  time:  180 minutes.
