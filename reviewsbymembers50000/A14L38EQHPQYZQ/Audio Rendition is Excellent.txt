 Timothy Zahn tops himself with a slap bang ending to this Star Wars saga.  There is not much I can add to other reviews.  However, the audio book is abridged and some of the story seems to skip forward at high speed.  Once  again Anthony Daniels (C3PO) does a great job reading.  His voice  characterizations are the same as in "Dark Force Rising" allowing  the listener to keep the many characters straight and concentrate on the  plot(s).  The audio and special effects are crisp and clear and easily  understood in a car environment.  The best of the three books and well  worth the purchase price.  Run time:  180 minutes.
