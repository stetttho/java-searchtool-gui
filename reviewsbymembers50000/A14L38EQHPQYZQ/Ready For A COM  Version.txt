 Mary Kirtland has written a terrific resource for those who wish to know  more (i.e. go from basic to advanced) on how to program with COM and MTS.   I found the example code (and companion CD-ROM) very useful and relatively  bug free.  Some of the chapters include: Windows DNA (now .NET) COM  (101) Data Access Fundamentals MTS ASP Extending MTS Application  Definition and Modeling Building Data/Business  Objects Packaging Building the Presentation Layer Debugging and  Troubleshooting (an excellent chapter on a tricky subject) Performance  Validation Deploying Extending the Application COM+ (pretty good for  when this was written, it is time to update the book with the latest and  greatest, however). Most of the information here is still relevant,  especially to those with a smattering of COM or MTS under their belt and  are hungry for more.  Everything is wrapped up well with a comprehensive  index.  Well worth the purchase price.  Definitely a must along with  "Programming Distributed Apps with MS COM+ and MS VB."
