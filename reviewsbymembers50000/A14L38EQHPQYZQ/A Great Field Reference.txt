 First, this is not a "teach yourself book" it is a reference,  geared toward field engineers.  With that said, this is a fabulous carry  everywhere reference (small; roughly 8"x5"x1" in size) that  has just about everything you need to know (from a DBA perspective, that  is) for maintaining/installing/etc. SQL Server 7.0.  The book is broken  into four sections:  I.  Administration Fundamentals - Configuring and  Tuning II. Administration - Managing Enterprise, Core DBA,  Security III.Data Administration - Backup/Recovery, Import/Export,  Distributed Data/Remote Servers, Replication IV. Performance,  Optimization, and Maintenance - Monitoring/Profiling, Creating  Tables/Indexes, DB Automation/Maintenance Having worked with SQL Server  for several years now, I have always dreamed of having a book that  summarized (with examples) all aspects of installation and maintenance (and  wasn't a 4" thick luggable).  Stanek has done it.  The contents are  well laid out with a very thorough index.  Examples are well laid out  (step-by-step) to get you through what-ever issue you are working with.   The book contains stored procedure calls, but is not a Transact-SQL manual  (actually it would be nice if the author would come out with a T-SQL Admin  Pocket Guide also!). I consider this a must-have for every SQL Server  DBA's library.  It will not gather dust, but instead become VERY dog-eared.
