 I have used this book for since 1995 to help manage computer projects at/on both formal and informal environments.  The step-by-step layout allows you to adapt the techniques in this book to whatever you happen to  be doing.  The only thing I could wish could be added would be some  information on managing object oriented projects (something I have had to  improvise on...lazy as that sounds!).  Anyway, this book is excellent and  should be on the shelf of every project manager's desk.  After six years I  still take it down and browse through it for suggestions.
