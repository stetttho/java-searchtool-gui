 This is in review of the Audio version (1 Cassette, 1 hour run time). I was, overall, disappointed in this story.  The thought of Captain Sulu crawling around on hands and knees through ductwork was humerous (although Kirk did it at least once).  Takai sounds wooden in his acting role, and is at times drowned out by the sound effects (at least when listening in an automobile).  I did enjoy the story, but it jumps around a bit, and the thought of a Star Base or base of any kind easily being taken over is ludicrous.
