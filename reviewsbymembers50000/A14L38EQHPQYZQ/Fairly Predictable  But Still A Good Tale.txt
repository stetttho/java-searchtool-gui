 I found this story a bit difficult to follow (it gets better after a couple of re-plays).  Handy, a drifter, arrives just in time to offer to track down some stolen money.  Of course there are girls.  One you dislike  immediately, the other takes a bit longer to dislike.  Anyway, of course  Handy isn't tracking down the money for nothing.  He wants the girl (the  first one).  Oh well.  Anyway, Handy finds that he has taken on a bit more  than he bargained for!  Things just are not all that they seem.  Audio is  crisp and clear with well cast characters and good special effects.  Well  worth the purchase price.  Run time:  60 minues.
