 This reader is botha wonderful introduction to the sci-fi world of Philip K. Dick and a brilliant read in itself.  Dick has written some of the most provocative short stories of the genre since Bradbury and Asimov and many of them are contained in this collection.  His stories are written with a keen surrealist wit and a very dark sense of humor, as Kafka himself might have written science fiction.  Stylistically, Dick is more straightforward than his contemporaries Burroughs, Pynchon and Wilson, but thematically, his ideas are just as complex and intriguing (if not more so) than those of said authors.  This makes for an thought-provoking read that is also enoyable (a rare find among "serious" fiction writers).  In short, if you haven't read Dick, this is the best and most economical introduction to his stunning body of short fiction.  If you are a long time fan, chances are, most of your favorites will be here, all bound in one volume for easy transit.
