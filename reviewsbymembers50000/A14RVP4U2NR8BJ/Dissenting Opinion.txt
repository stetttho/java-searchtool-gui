 This is the third time I have reviewed this movie, but I just have to submit a dissenting opinion to counter all these action film meatheads who can't separate sci-fi from hi-fi.  Look.  There is more to film than eye candy, visual effects and surround sound.  How about content?  If you really consider the Matrix in comparison to truly great sci-fi, like 2001, Blade Runner, Brazil, even Gattaca, it falls very short.  The matrix makes attempts at being literate, but the plot is so contirived and narcissistic that it defeats its purpose in that regard.  The Matrix is the antithesis of a good sci-fi film for these reasons: 1) it does not challenge social issues sufficiently as sci-fi does/should (unless you count the trite issues of reality or conformity), 2) it does not balance out form (FX) with content (storyline), 3) the metaphor and allegory are extremely overdone so as to appeal to a lazy audience (I find this underestimation very irritating, as should you as an intelligent viewer), etc., etc.  I could go on, but I won't.  I do however, disagree with the reviewer who blames this movie for the social ills and school shoootings in the good ol' U-S of A.  This movie is not a cause of any social disease.  It is just yet another symptom of America's defiant barbarism, but if we want to find the source of WHY murder happens we have to look into ourselves for that answer.  Don't be another lazy American.  Blaming the media is just full of fallacies.  There is good cinema and bad cinema.  This one happens to be the latter.
