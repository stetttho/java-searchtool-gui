 I must admit, I bought this one on a whim.  I have been a long time fan of the Automator since his production on Dr. Octagon and I expected nothing less than a good album when I heard he was teaming up with Del for this release.  But when I popped it in the CD player I could not believe my ears!  This is the greatest thing to happen to hip hop in a long, long time and yes, it IS better than Dr. Octagon.  The production is the best I have ever heard from Dan the Automator and Del's lyrics also are in top form here.  The concept is focused, the beats are tight and the scratching courtesy of Kid Koala is superb.  The hooks are catchy, but not poppy.  Del's lyrics are political without resorting to preachiness and his vocal delivery and literate sense of wordplay are among the most compelling I have ever heard.  In short, this album is everything I look for in a hip hop record: intelligent, focused, innovative, and, most of all, fun.
