 Pigface has put out so many releases in the past ten years that it has been hard to keep up.  For me, only Fook was consistently good, but the other albums had some really brilliant tracks.  I applaud Martin Atkins effort to combine all this brilliance on one CD, Ok, 2 CD's.  The first CD is a proper "hits" package with the strongest tracks culled together from Pigface's 11 releases.  The second CD contains remixes, radio spots, and unreleased material.  All in all, this is an excellent introduction to Pigface's impressive oeuvre.  Who can deny that a collaborative project featuring members from groups as diverse as Nine Inch Nails, Skinny Puppy, KMFDM, Ministry, Revolting Cocks, Dead Kennedys, Throbbing Gristle/Psychic TV, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Shonen Knife, Pixies, Big Black, Jesus Lizard/Scratch Acid, PiL, and more would result in some of the strangest, most provocative msuic that no one has ever heard?  If your musical tastes border on the unusual, the experimental and the downright weird, you NEED this one.  Fans of Butthole Surfers and/or any of the abovementioned artists (and their myriad of side projects) would revel in the sound contained within these two CD's.  Check it out.
