 I gave this movie three stars (all 3 for effects) in a previous review, but I thought I would weigh in one more time.  I am changing my score to counter the flood of five star reviews being given to the Matrix.  All reviews given for this movie read as slight variations of the following:  "great effects and the story is good too!"  EXACTLY.  Effects before plot, style before substance, form over content.  Good sci-fi movies acheive a synthesis of these elements.  The Matrix does not.  It has a half-realized concept and its effects are extremely overdone.  For TRUE classic sci-fi check out 2001: A Space Odyssey, or if that's too "old" for you, try Gattaca or 12 Monkeys.  Oh, and P.S. the acting is not that great. If this is your favorite film, you just haven't seen enough movies.
