 i think some of the negative reviews are actually written by people with a stake in other MP3 players, i dont see how anyone can not fall in love with this perfect design.  if you want a watch with a digital face, you dont buy a cartier!  if you are looking for simplicity, beauty, design and function, look no further, this is it....it's like listening to your own radio station anytime anywhere, who needs satellite FM when you can get the ipod shuffe?.....full disclosure, still using a PC and cant wait to get rid of it
