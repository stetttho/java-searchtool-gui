 Leave Me Be is one of the many outstanding tracks on this superb album from the McGarrigles.  Leave me Be is heartbreaking and wonderfully written and performed, I just can't get enough.  I just got this album last week and I have been on heavy rotation on my CD walkman ever since.  If you have not heard them yet, you are in for some of the most amazing music you have ever heard.  Beg...or borrow!
