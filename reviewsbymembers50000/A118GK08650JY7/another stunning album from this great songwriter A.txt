 wow, another perfect album from ron, he does not know how to write a bad song, not even a bad line, this album is full of brilliant songs, it amazes me that he is not better known, he writes beautiful lyrics and melodies that i do not tire of no matter how many times i listen to them, it's hard to describe his music, i imagine if you mix leonard cohen, early dylan and paul simon, you might come close, the production by steve earle is just fine, but then, it could have been produced by the backstreet boys and the brilliant songs will survive.
