 I've had my shuffle for a month now and i don't think i can live without it. I use it on my commute to work, at the gym, at the grocery store, when I take out the garbage. It's like having your own soundtrack. I have 3 other regular ipods but they were a little too bulky and fragile to bring everywhere. I like listening to my 6,000 songs randomly which the shuffle does a perfect job of, itunes is so easy to use compared to music match and all the other stuff out there. the battery life is amazing. Get the white sony fontopia earbuds, they go awesome with the shuffle.  At this point, I think I would rather give up my TV and laptop before the shuffle, never thought I would say that. I listen to Bright Eyes, Mozart, Joni Mitchell, Billie Holiday, Supertramp, etc randomly, I know it sounds weird but I really enjoy the mix. I don;t know why people complain about the lack of a screen, after all you are putting in your own music, if you don't like it dont put it in!  Hate to gush about any product like this, but it has really made my life that much more pleasurable, so I am hoping that you will give it a chance.
