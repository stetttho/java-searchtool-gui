 Matapedia, the title track alone is worth the price of this album, in fact, I would gladly have paid [money], maybe more just for that one song.  It is probably one of the best songs I have heard in a long time, why it is not a classic, I don't know.  But the other songs, especially Going Back to Harlan, are all superb material, from two of the most talented and underappreciated performers today.  Get it now!
