 Took me a long time before I gave in and bought this CD.  I did not instantly take to it like I did all the other Lucinda CDs but after a couple of spins, I find myself digging it more and more.  More bluesy and some folk tunes here and there but overall, a mini masterpiece, a must have for any Lucinda fan.  My only regret was that I waited so long to get it.
