 I have been using the case for 2 weeks now, it took a long time to get it from Amazon but it was definitely worth the wait.  This case is truly a thing of beauty, I can't imagine anyone putting so much thought into the design of a case for an MP3 player.  I would imagine this is somthing that Gucci would have designed and sold for $300 and everyone who has seen my shuffle case has fallen in love with it.    It is a tad heavy but otherwise, it is perfection.
