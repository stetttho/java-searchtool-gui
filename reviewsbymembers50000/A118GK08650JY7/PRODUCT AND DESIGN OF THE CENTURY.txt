 This is my first apple product in 10 years and it is truly a work of wonder, beautifully designed and works perfectly, no one should be without one.  I got it yesterday and I am all smiles today, imagine having your whole CD collection in this tiny device.   Be warned that the PC version does not automatically sync up when you connect to the USB port, you have to click on the Sync button in musicmatch.
