 WOW!  Everyone who has seen my black 4G ipod has ordered one, even those who hated ipods for no reason.  This is an amazing engineering feat, I have no idea how they fit all that in to a player the size of a credit card.    It's got a beautiful color screen, syncs with your outlook contacts and calendar, stores photos, games, clocks, and best of all it's got iTunes.  I really don;t see how they could improve on this besides maybe getting a protective coating on the black nano.  It does scratch real easy.  And contraty to what was posted, you can get 2 lines of free laser engraving when you order from the apple store online.  Also, the battery lasts plenty 14 hours, who wants to carry around bulky AAA batteries around all the time.  I think the competition might just have to close shop pretty soon.
