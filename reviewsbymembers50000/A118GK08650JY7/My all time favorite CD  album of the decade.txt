 If you are looking for the perfect pop song, look no further, there's 14 of them right here.  They are deceptively simple. When I first heard this CD (through Lucinda Williams' recommendation, and she can do no wrong by me), I thought it was nice.  Simple pop songs with pretty melodies and lyrics,  thought I would listen to it a couple of times and stack it away, like I usually do.  I tend to get bored with music pretty quickly, the few CDs I could listen to over and over again are  Bob Dylan's Blood on the Tracks and Lucinda's Car Wheels, and now this little album.   It just grows and grows on you, the melodies and the lyrics may sound simple at first but they somehow they grow more enchanting with every listen until it brings you into this other world.  I am convinced that I am listening to a genius singer-songwriter, can't really explain what it is, but I remember when I was a kid and learning to play the piano I first heard Mozart and I am getting that same feeling again......
