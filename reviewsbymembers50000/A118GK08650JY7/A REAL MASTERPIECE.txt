 To me, this is Lucinda's best work.  Everything else she has released is brilliant but this one really comes together.  I really like every song on this CD, even the bonus tunes and the unfinished last track.  This one ranks right up there with Joni Mitchell's Blue and the best of Dylan, maybe even better.  My only regret is that she did not release more music between the wonderful Happy Woman Blues and this album!
