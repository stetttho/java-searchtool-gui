 I first heard of the McGarrigle sisters way back in the seventies when Linda Ronstadt covered Heart Like a Wheel, and suddenly discovered them again when I bought Emmylou Harris' incredible Wrecking Ball because I wanted to hear her version of Lucinda Williams' Sweet Old World (great cover but the original can't be beat).  I discovered then that one of the best tracks on the Emmylou album "Going Back To Harlan" was written by the McGarrigles.  I got all curious and decided to come to Amazon to find out what else they have done. That was the best thing that happened to me the past 6 months.  I first ordered this album out of curiousity and just fell in love with every single track.  It is a total miracle and disgrace that this album is not on the TOP 10 ALBUM of ALL TIMES.  I can remember very few albums and artists that have touched me as much, perhaps Joni Mitchell's Blue and Lucinda Williams' Car Wheels.  I have a feeling that this one has legs and will remain my favorite for a long long time.
