 only got the album today in the mail and it's a stunning, beautiful piece of work, i only recently starting listening to ron and am amazed by the ease at which he turns out seemingly simply lyrics that are so touching, and the most beautiful melodies in the world....words cannot describe this artist, do yourself a favor, listen to this or any of his albums for 4-5 times and you will fall in love......this ranks right up there with Other Songs and Cobblestone Runway, superb.
