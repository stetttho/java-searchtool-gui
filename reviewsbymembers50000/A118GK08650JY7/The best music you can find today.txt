 I am not sure why I love their music so much, it does not demand attention the same way as the music of Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan or Lucinda Willims.  But the Mcgarrigles write and sing witty and sensitive songs better than anyone else can and I am totally mesmerized by it.  It brings me back to to another place and time, when people still cared about things (you know, pre-MTV, Survivor, etc, etc).  This album has a couple of stand out tracks, and of course Rufus W takes over whenever he appears on a track but that's cool, because they are all so talented and so under appreciated.  Get this if you want to treat yourself to some really amazing music that sounds like it was recorded around the fireplace somewhere in Montreal.
