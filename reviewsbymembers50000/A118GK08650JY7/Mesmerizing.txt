 Ever since I got this CD I have not been able to take if off my CD player.  I hesitated to buy this CD for a while because I just was not sure how her real early music would sound but it ranks right up there with her self-titled album.  It's a little more country-folky but it's less produced and the songs are REAL.  I don't think there is a better songwriter than Lucinda around today.  This may not be for everyone but it's perfect for me.  I played it at least once everyday for a whole month and I am still loving it!  It works for whatever mood I'm in, but best when I'm driving in the country or late nite.
