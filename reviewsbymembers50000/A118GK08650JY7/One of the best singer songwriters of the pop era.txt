 I would rate Joni Mitchell, Lucinda Williams and Ron Sexsmith as the top 3 songwriters of the past 30 years, if not 50.  It took a little while for me to grow into his groove but once I got there, I was totally hooked.  Beautiful melodies ala early Paul McCartney, senstive lyrics think Paul Simon, it boggles my mind that Ron is not a much bigger name.  As to his reference to religion in the latest album, I think it was his response to Sep 11 and was in no way condescending.  I first heard of Ron through Lucinda William's Starbucks Personal Choices CD and this is my first exciting discovery in quite a few years, the last being Lucinda a few years back.  I am going to see Ron perform at Joe's Pub in the Public Theatre NYC tonight and I can't wait!
