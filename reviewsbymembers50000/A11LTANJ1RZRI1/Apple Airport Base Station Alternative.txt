 I have an Apple iBook with an Airport card. I bought this Netgear Router for 1/4 the price of the Apple Airport base station and it was plug-n-play! Using MacOS X there is no software to install. You use Internet Explorer with a HTML-based "wizard" to help you configure the Mac and change the router's settings. You do have to make some changes in the Network System Preference panel. I created two new "Locations," one for an Ethernet connection to the router, and another for an Airport wireless connection.
