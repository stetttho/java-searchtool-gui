 After connecting the 6 cables, I first inserted a CD. The sound was excellent, thanks mainly to the subwoofer. Then I tuned to my favorite classical music FM station. I couldn't get a good signal with the included antenna wire. I had to buy a PAL to coax adapter to connect it to my attic antenna. The signal was better, but still fuzzy, as though it was not tuned-in completely. This shouldn't happen with a digital tuner. (Another radio worked fine, so it wasn't a bad antenna connection.) That night, I found more issues: 1. Unbelievably, there is no "sleep" function to turn the unit off. 2. The color-changing displays are too bright, even set at "dim." 3. The backlit clocks are hard to read from an angle. 4. Altho the CD sounded great earlier, when I was lying in bed closer to the speakers, there was a noticeable background hum. 5. In the morning, when the radio went on, the sound quality was terrible! With the "wake to music" option, the radio plays from only the tiny left or right speaker (alarm 1 or 2), and the subwoofer does not function. It sounded as bad as a cheap pocket-sized radio! The Amazon Friday Sale price was too good to be true for this system. Alas... it was. The lack of a sleep option was enough to make me return this, even if everthing else had been OK. Fortunately, I was able to save shipping costs and return it to a local Sharper Image store.
