 As others have mentioned, the instruction booklet is almost worthless. I went to the manufacturer's website: www.oregonscientific.com, it wasn't any better. TIPS: 1. You need a very small jewelers screwdriver, pref. a phillips head. 2. There are 10 tiny screws (2 sizes) you must remove from the outdoor unit! Have containers ready to hold them. 3. After opening the outdoor unit's battery cover, remove the batteries, take out the clear plastic spacer, reinsert the batteries, and MOST IMPORTANT-- press the reset button next to the batteries with an unbent paper clip. 4. BEFORE closing-up the outdoor unit, do the following on the indoor unit-- 5. Remove battery cover, remove the batteries, take out the clear plastic spacer, reinsert the batteries, and press the indoor unit's reset button above the batteries with an unbent paper clip. 6. Wait a minute or two for the indoor unit to lock in on the outdoor unit's signal. The top two lines of the display will flash until it finds the signal. 7. If the display keeps flashing, press the OUTDOOR unit's reset button again. 8. Then press the indoor reset, again. Once the display stops flashing, then close-up the outdoor unit. Don't jiggle the outdoor unit or it will record that as "rainfall." 9. I could not get the rainfall total to reset with the "rain reset" button. I had to do the full reset on the indoor unit. 10. If all else fails.... Reset, reset, reset! Outdoor unit first!
