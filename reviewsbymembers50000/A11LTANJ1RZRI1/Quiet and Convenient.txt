 I bought this trimmer because I wanted a quieter alternative to a gas engine. It is well balanced, especially with the angle adjustable handle. I use this primarily for trimming grass along my backyard fence and it does a reasonably good job and no battery rundown problems. As mentioned in other reviews, the auto-feed is balky. As you trim, it begins to "fade." Then suddenly it's back to full trimming. Once you get used to it, it's a tolerable trade-off. The wall-mount storage holder/charger is great. The charger has lights to indicate charging status.
