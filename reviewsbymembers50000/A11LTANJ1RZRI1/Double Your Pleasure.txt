 I bought this as a monitor for my home office, thinking I'd use the TV tuner as a PIP (picture-in-picture) image while working. So far it hasn't gotten to my desk! I first set it up as a TV in the bedroom, just to be sure it worked. It is a great little TV! Then it went on the kitchen counter. So much better than a big boxy TV taking-up a lot of space. I want at least one more of these! Two minor issues: the sound is a bit tinny from the small built-in speakers (turning up the Bass setting helped.), and the on-screen controls are hard to read from more than a couple feet away. (The optional captions are larger and easy to see.)
