 As mentioned in other reviews, this production is fabulous! Even if you recorded it when it aired on PBS stations, consider buying the DVD. (no pledge breaks, no cuts!) Also, the DVD has DTS 5.1 and Dolby 5.1 surround audio tracks. With surround on, you feel you are sitting in the audience! The reason I gave it 4 stars, rather than 5-- one disappointment. There is no captioning option. Not even the closed-captions from the broadcast. Having the "libretto" displayed, made it more enjoyable.
