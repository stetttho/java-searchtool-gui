 I was looking for a pasta and steamer insert. I came across this all-in-one set and it was cheaper than the pasta insert. With the Calphalon name how bad could it be? Overall I'm pleased with it. It's much heavier than I expected, and does it's job perfectly, for me. The drawbacks, as mentioned in other reviews, are the handles on the steamer--it's hard to keep them out of the food, and the large quantity of water required to use the pasta insert.
