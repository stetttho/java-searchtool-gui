 I did the initial stride length set-up as listed in the instruction booklet. Then I dropped the pedometer in my pocket, along with a pen and notecard, and headed out to a trail that had mile markers. As I walked, I noted the pedometer steps and mileage at each marker. The number of steps for each mile was within 5 steps, but the mileage was shorter than it should have been--reading about .75 per mile, instead of 1.0. When I got home, using my notes, I recalculated my stride based on the steps for 6 miles. Since then, I've always been within 0.1 miles of the mile markers! Because it works accurately in my pocket, it goes everywhere with me. I've been amazed at the number of steps (and miles!) I log just working around the house and yard.  UPDATE: Bad news--As wonderful as this pedometer is, it didn't survive a trip thru the tumbling front-load washer. Good news--it's now $10 cheaper than the 1st one I bought. I'm ordering two of these and will stash one away for a backup or great last minute gift.
