 It's only good feature is that it fits the camera like a tight glove.    But...    1. It's not leather, it's black and silver vinyl, and no protective padding.    2. There are no extra pockets or room in the case for spare batteries, the USB cable, etc. You could drop a loose xD memory card inside.    3. There are no belt loops or a strap on the case. You have to use the narrow strap on the camera. Because of the openings for the strap, the case is not fully enclosed. Keep it out of the rain!    I'll take the camera with me to local stores and try to find an enclosed, padded case, with storage space and at least belt loops. I'd looked a bit before I bought this case, but because of the prominent zoom lens most digicam cases are too small.
