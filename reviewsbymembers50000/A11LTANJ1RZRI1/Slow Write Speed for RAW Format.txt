 I've had the CoolPix 8800 for about 2 months. It is a remarkable alternative to more expensive digital SLR cameras. My first priority was to buy a camera that had RAW (Nikon NEF) file format capabilities. The 8800's 8-megapixel RAW images are 12 MB files. Even with a 50X CompactFlash memory card, individual files can take as long as 10 seconds to write/save. And while the file is saving, you can't adjust settings such as shutter speed or exposure. It can be a very frustrating wait.   I'll keep trying various high-speed cards, hoping I can get better results, and update this review if I find "the perfect card." (NOTE: Write times are much faster using the multiple JPG or TIFF formats. But if you're not going to use RAW, there are less expensive alternative cameras to consider.)  I would still buy this camera over anything else available when I purchased it. The 10X zoom with VR image stabilization is unbeatable!
