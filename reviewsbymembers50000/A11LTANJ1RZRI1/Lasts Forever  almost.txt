 I replaced my  almost 14 year old Genesis grill with the Gold-B. I recently moved, and thought the old grill wouldn't survive moving. It still works, but its frame and enameled flavorizer bars are rusty. So I left it with the old house. The new one seems to heat up much faster. That could be the age difference. I also appreciate the swing-up and removeable shelves on the Gold-B.  Even if your not a big meat eater, you'll find many uses for the grill. I use it to roast red peppers, sweet onions, and many other veggies. Often served over pasta with a fresh grind of parmasean. I use the grill most often for roasting a whole chicken. You've seen the infomercial for an electric roaster where they exclaim: "Set it, and forget it!" Same thing on the Weber! Preheat. Oil the bird. Place it in the middle of the grill, and set the burners to "MOM" (med/off/med. 90 mins. later it's done to perfection! And you can bake regular or sweet potatoes in the middle with the chicken. Later, grill some peppers, onions and zuchinni over the ouside burners to complete the meal. I have one complaint. I have to lift my grill over a slight step up from the driveaway to the garage floor. There is not a comfortable hand hold at either end of the grill. I'm also going to treat those small wheels as if the're fragile. They sure look delicate. One tip to new gas grillers. Buy a second tank! I bought one locally for [$$] + fill. Tanks only go empty in the middle of cooking.  ;-)
