 I had the one slot version and thought it was just "OK." Recently, I bought the two slot version and like it much better. (Maybe the first one wasn't right to begin with.) The wide, long slots are great for non-standard breads, waffles and bagels. I usually keep bread in the freezer for freshness, and the "Defrost" button gives me almost the same toast as I'd get from room temp bread, without changing my normal setting.
