 There is enough room in the outside pocket, and a mesh pocket inside the top cover, for memory cards, an extra battery, even the USB cable. A set of two belt loops would feel more secure than the single centered belt loop provided. I still want a larger belt pack (or small backpack) that will accommodate the camera, accessories, and other supplies for an all day outing.
