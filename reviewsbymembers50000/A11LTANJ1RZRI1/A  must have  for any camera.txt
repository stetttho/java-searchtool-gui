 There's a PhotoBert CheatSheet for most camera models. Get one for yours! No one can remember all the features and setting options on a camera. The CheatSheet has loads of info to jog your memory, and probably show you a few tricks you don't realize are in your camera.  I keep my CheatSheet in the camera bag, and with the lamination, it's reasonably weatherproof. The type is small, so be prepared with reading glasses, or a small magnifier.
