 I have this pad and the larger Podium CoolPad (ASIN: B000117DEE). I use the Podium CoolPad for my 14-inch iBook when it's on my desk at home. It's larger and height/angle adjustable. I keep this smaller CoolPad in my case for travel. It fits my older 12-inch iBook better than the 14-inch, but still quite useable.
