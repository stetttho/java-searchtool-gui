 Ok, Nicholas marries Eleanor because his brother ruined her and she may be carrying his child. Then he supposedly falls in love with her but keeps a mistress(he's only sleeping with her for the sake of his country...he  doesn't enjoy it...what a load of garbage)and avoids Eleanor so that he  won't hurt her by going from his mistress's bed to hers. Personally, I  routed for Eleanor to run away with Lord Middleton. I mean I felt  absolutely no sympathy for Nicholas..in fact I grew to seriously dislike  him. I'm sure that England could have found some other way to get the  information Nicholas was looking for without his mistress. In the end  Eleanor just forgave him and took him back because of course he did it for  his country and didn't mean to hurt Eleanor. If you are looking for a story  that leaves you feeling like things worked out the way they should and the  characters deserve to live happily ever after this is not the book for  you!
