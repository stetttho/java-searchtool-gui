 Normally I like Lisa Jackson's books however in this story was a great disappointment to me. Trask had used Troy in the past to put her father in jail. She had thought that he loved her. Now he's back and looking to put  her brother in jail too. OK...after's he's finished locking up her whole  family she's supposed to marry him and live happily ever after right? It  turns out that her father was innocent and just covering up for her  brother...Trask wasn't even sorry for sending an innocent man to jail....by  the end of the book I hated Trask..I kept hoping that he'd go away.~~
