 This was the first book that I have read by this author...and I wasn't disappionted. Booker Hayes has come  for his niece who Thea has been raising. Thea is considered too tall for any man to want and doesn't trust  that Booker wants her for herself and not just as a mother for his niece.  If you are looking for a story that leaves you with a happyending this is a  book you want to read.
