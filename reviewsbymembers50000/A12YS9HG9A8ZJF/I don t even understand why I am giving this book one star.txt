 I found this book to be a total waste of time and it actually made me angry. The midwife Tara had been gang raped not once but twice in her past but joked about it and laughed. I have never met a woman who had been raped  once that thought it was funny enough to laugh about at anytime, regardless  of coming to terms with what had happened to them, let alone having been  gang raped twice. She then went to say that Tara was unable to have  children due to a veneral disease contracted due to the rapes which she was  unaware that she had and so had gone untreated causing damage. Get  real..this woman is supposed to be a midwife and she didn't know that she  should have gotten checked out? Ms. Early does no help to the cause of  midwives here. I will avoid any books by this author in the future if this  is an example of her books!
