 Randall Clayton, the Duke of Beldon falls for Cait Harmon. When she becomes pregnant he is forced to marry her. He can't admit how deeply he cares for her so when she loses their child he rekindles an old affair with his ex-mistress. He soon comes to his senses and realizes that he truly loves his "Caitie" but it is too late. She has discovered him with his mistress and leaves him. She joins her father in Africa where he is searching for a lost necklace. Rand quickly realizes just what his inability to admit his feelings has cost him and journey's to Africa to try and convince Cait to give him another chance. But he realizes that it's not as easy as that....love isn't the problem..trust is. Can he ever get Cait to trust him enough to restart their marriage? I have always loved Kat Martin's historical romances but her last two(including this one) have left a little to be desired. Although I like Rand and Cait and the story sucks you in, I had a problem with the infidelity storyline. I like a story that makes you feel good but the affair left me feeling disappointed. I also felt like Ms. Martin wrapped up the book to easy. I was left feeling as if things ended too quickly and easily. I am hoping her next book will be more like her older romances such as Gypsy Lord(great one!)
