 Molly had always loved Liam but he had never seen her as anything but a friend. Now Molly was changing everything about herself and suddenly Liam noticed that Molly was everything he wanted in a woman. This was a great  story! I enjoyed this book so much that I didn't put it down until it was  finished~~
