 Of course I'm rating this five stars just because it is a great buy for those of you who don't already have other Sinatra albums.  In fact, almost all of these tracks are on The Best of the Capitol Years, and are many of  his "greatest hits."  However, some of his great concept albums  of the 50s are NOT represented here, specifically all-ballad ones such as  Where are You and No One Cares, both arranged by Gordon Jenkins, whose  arrangements had a lusher, darker sound than Nelson Riddle's. Close to You,  arranged by Riddle in an intimate chamber-music setting is also  unrepresented here, and is in fact STILL unavailable to date.  It's the  only Capitol album of Frank's that I still lack.  Other swing albums such  as the exuberant Sinatra's Swingin' Session and the earlier Swingin' Easy  are also not represented, and would give a more rounded picture of Frank's  many swing moods. Come Fly With Me is great stuff, but who can resist the  other equally-as-good tracks from that terrific Billy May-arranged album,  especially Brazil, Autumn in New York, The Isle of Capri, etc., etc....  I  fear that most music-lovers will never know the many styles and moods of  Sinatra's art!
