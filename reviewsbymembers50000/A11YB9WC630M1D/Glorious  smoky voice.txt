 This is a compilation album originally released in 1957 after Chris left Bethlehem Records for Atlantic.  She made only a handful of albums for Bethlehem in 1953-55, and, judging by these select tracks, they are all  excellent and very worthy of rerelease.  The remastering is excellent,  especially on the big band numbers like Miser's Serenade, which sounds like  it was recorded yesterday. Chris is featured here with a variety of  ensembles:  Sy Oliver and his orchestra, The Ellis Larkins Trio, The Vinnie  Burke Quartet, and the Ralph Sharon Group (who would follow her to Atlantic  for several outings.)  Chris is in gorgeous voice throughout, and very  assured and polished in these early recordings.  She doesn't backphrase as  much as she would later.  In fact, All About Ronnie, her striking signature  song with a "smoky saloon" small-combo feel, would sound much  different on her Chris in Person live album a few years later.  Lush Life  effectively features an "offstage" flute representing the  "siren song", and is one of the very best interpretations of this  classic.  The last four tracks, featuring the Ralph Sharon Group, are  indicative of things to come.  From This Moment On and In Other Words (Fly  Me to the Moon, one of the first interpretations of this song), are given  sophisticated treatments.  In Other Words shifts meter from a triple feel  to a duple feel on the repeat, anticipating Quincy Jones's famous  arrangement for Frank Sinatra by more than a decade.  The other two songs  from this set are the kind of obscure yet haunting songs that Chris (and  June Christy) would champion throughout their careers.
