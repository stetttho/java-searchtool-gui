 I am a huge Tony Bennett fan.  I especially like his jazz albums and backup groups.  Pianist Ralph Sharon so often sets the tone, I cannot imagine Tony without him.  There are so many Greatest Hits anthologies out there.  Columbia first issued the superb "Jazz" compilation, and the "Forty Years" 4-CD collection.  All other anthologies are pointless, especially since his newer material is still widely available.  Next, in rapid succession, have come "The Ultimate" and now "The Essential", replicating many tracks.  Some of Tony's best albums have yet to be released in their entirety.  What about "When Lights are Low," named by biographer Will Friedwald as one of the best jazz vocal albums ever recorded, and "My Heart Sings?"  I did manage to find on EBay a Japanese version of "Tony Sings for Two," a duet with Sharon.  This superb album has yet to be released stateside.  We've only heard bits and pieces on compilation albums. Come on, Columbia!  Why hold out on us?
