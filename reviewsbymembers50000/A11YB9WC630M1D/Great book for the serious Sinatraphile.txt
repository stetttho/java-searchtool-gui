 Will Friedwald has deservedly won great acclaim for this highly entertaining "dissertation" on Sinatra's music: his  vocal technique and style changes through the years, his classic albums, and his  arrangers and studio musicians.  Friedwald guides us album by album,  grouped by arrangers Axel Stordahl, Nelson Riddle, Gordon Jenkins, and  Billy May.  Other chapters discuss his big band years and his later years.   Friedwald's taste in music closely parallels my own, and I am not surprised  that he is also a big fan of other great vocalists such as June Christy,  Mel Torme, Ella, Chris Connor, etc.  He concentrates most importantly on  the concept albums and the great tracks that aren't necessarily the  "big hits," but are great achievements in popular song.  His  suggestions on what to avoid are almost always on the mark.  I was amused  by his descriptions of Don Costa's "elevator music" arrangements,  and of poor Linda Ronstadt, who does not fare well in this book, as some  incensed readers have pointed out (lighten up! ).         Friedwald has  evidently interviewed hundreds of musicians associated with Sinatra in one  way or another, and therein lies the greatest strength of this book.  Some  of his stories told by people who were there at the time are so memorable,  I still chuckle when I think of them a year after I read the book.  His  description of the recording sessions for the Sinatra/Ellington album are a  hoot. One wonders how this album is as good as it is.  Also, Billy May  seems like a fun character, and also a most modest fellow. This is the  only book about Sinatra's music that the serious listener should trust when  collecting his albums.  His descriptions of the classic 50s album Close to  You are the only way I have of knowing what the album is like, since it is  unbelievably out of print.  Yet how many CDs have My Way on them?  Also, I  never would have known about the great torch song album She Shot Me Down  (1981), inexplicably underrated and hard to find. My only suggestion to  Mr. Friedwald would be to think about the concept albums more as a whole,  and how arrangers Jenkins and Riddle linked the songs together harmonically  and (sometimes even) motivically.  I think he will find this phenomenon in  the Christy/Rugolo albums as well.  Moreover, a careful listener can tell  where deleted tracks were SUPPOSED to be, such as Everything Happens to Me  in She Shot Me Down, The One I Love in No One Cares, and the Nearness of  You in Nice'N'Easy.  Big hint:  Come Waltz With Me was NOT supposed to be  the first track of All Alone (this would disrupt the two  "bookends" of the album featuring the female vocalist), and the  Nice'n'Easy album was most likely originally to be titled That Old Feeling.
