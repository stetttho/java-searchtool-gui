 This is the swingin'est Bobby Darin album on the market today.  I usually try to avoid compilations, because I like to hear whole albums in their original forms, but this is a terrific collection of some of Darin's best  from the Capitol years (1962-65).  This CD keeps the momentum from  beginning to end, and is reminiscent of Sinatra's exuberant swing albums,  with Darin clearly enjoying himself on every single track.  The Billy May  arrangement for Once in a Lifetime is one of the most astonishing I have  ever heard, and Darin is at his enthusiastic best.  The previously  unreleased tracks are all excellent as well. Since this collection contains  most of the Hello Dolly to Goodbye Charlie album, one has to wonder why  Capitol is so reluctant to release Darin's albums in their entirety.  As it  is, two other great tracks, Goodbye Charlie and Lonely Road, are buried in  the Capitol Collector's Series CD, and BELONG with these great swing tracks  (there's room!) Also, 10 out of 12 tracks from Oh! Look at Me Now are found  on the Spotlight on Bobby Darin CD.  Why not just release the entire album  on one CD with "bonus tracks"?
