 This is my favorite Clooney CD from the Concord Jazz Series.  The selection of songs, the pacing, and the arrangements are all impeccable.  Any Place I Hang My Hat is Home receives definitive treatment, as does  Dream combined with Hit the Road to Dreamland.  Talk to Me Baby never  sounded better.  Clooney has great fun with GI Jive, Hooray for Hollywood,  and Goody Goody.  I Remember You is refreshingly done slowly with guitar  accompaniment only.  There is even a haunting newer song written by Barry  Manilow and Mercer, When October Goes.  I only wish that Clooney's version  of Fools Rush In could be placed here somewhere.  It was recorded later for  the soundtrack to Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, another  wonderful collection of Johnny Mercer songs by various artists including  Diana Krall, Joe Williams, kd lang, and even Kevin Spacey!
