 Paul Weston has always been widely praised for his arrangements of Jo Stafford albums.  (They were husband and wife, after all!)  He knows just how to complement her uniquely haunting voice with the perfect arrangement,  never overpowering.  We sense and feel the longing in her voice, which is  very rich and warm, deemphasizing vibrato, and sounds very human to me.  (I  don't hear the coldness some people mention -- it's just her unique  timbre.)  This album contains mostly ballads, for which Jo has a natural  affinity, and all great standards, but she also demonstrates her great  swinging style on If I Were a Bell. The documentation for Corinthian's  CDs is poor, but I assume that the last three tracks are from the Jo +  Broadway album.  To my ears, they are not quite up to the rest.  Corinthian  could really do us all a favor by letting us know information such as  recording dates.  Also, a misleading aspect of their packaging lies in the  retitling of some of Stafford's albums, such as I'll Be Seeing You -- to  G.I. Jo, leading me to originally believe this album was from the 1940s  instead of the 50s.  The Big Band Sound CD contains practically no  documentation.   I would buy almost anything Stafford/Weston from the  1950s, if I only knew what I was buying (I wasn't around back then.)  I  also wish Corinthian would rerelease the Ski Trails album with tracks in  the original order (as they were intended) and NOT interspersed with  Christmas songs!  If need be, separate the two albums.
