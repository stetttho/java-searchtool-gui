 This novel is not satirical, but dead-on accurate in its observations of a certain stratum of English society which is no longer shamed or shocked by its own actions.  Brenda is put off by the "monstrous way" Tony  has behaved -- namely, not allowing her to continue as the  "victim" of the divorce proceeding.  Her "friends" aid  and abet her philanderings while gossiping behind her back, and allowing  her to become penniless while they go off on holiday.  Mrs. Beaver, whose  son is the amoral, parasitic lover, is interested in the affair only by  what can be gained monetarily from it.   The astonishing twist in the  story line, following Tony's harrowing adventures in the Amazon jungle, is  perplexing to some readers, but in fact serves as an interesting comparison  of the two totally different environments Tony has had to deal with, one of  "civilized" society, and the other of the jungle.  The more  "civilized" people in the jungle (all the English-speaking  characters) create just as many problems for Tony as the bats and  mosquitoes.  (Perhaps some of the previous reviewers could have thought a  little more along these lines before writing a bad review.)   Also, one  has to think how Tony could have avoided his misfortunes.  He is undone by  his staidness, until it is too late.  Perhaps Waugh is commenting on the  English gentry in general(?) Waugh also pointedly observes how the  upper-class children are brought up by nannies and stablehands, while the  parents remain aloof to their daily activities.   A great novel causes  the reader to think on several levels, while also being an entertaining  read.  This novel accomplishes both goals.  Every word and action has its  significance in a great work such as this one!
