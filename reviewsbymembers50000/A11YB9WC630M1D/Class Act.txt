 Jo Stafford's collection of songs from the World War II era -- songs of longing and nostalgia --is probably her most moving.  Recorded in 1958, this concept album (originally titled "I'll Be Seeing You")  boasts lean Paul Weston arrangements, never veering towards the maudlin, of  course, and typically seamless phrasings from Stafford.  She was born to  sing these songs, and her voice and interpretations here are unforgettable.   "I'll Be Seeing You" is given the definitive treatment -- Jo's  descant above the orchestra's melody on the repeat is indescribably  beautiful.  The breezy "No Love, No Nothin'" tries hard not to be  humorous, and offers a tasteful contrast. Two tracks from the original LP  are missing (Yesterdays and I Should Care), and the remaining tracks are  not in the same order as they originally were.  As in my review of June  Christy's Something Cool, I have to disagree with recording labels that  tinker with albums (for whatever reason? ), particularly the very special  "concept albums" from the '50s, like this one, which were not  intended to be a collection of potential "hits" with arbitrary  ordering.  On the original LP, the first track, "I Don't Want to Walk  Without You," led effortlessly into the second track, "It Could  Happen to You," by a common tone -- the last orchestral pitch of the  first song turns into the new key of the second song, a characteristic  Weston technique. Regardless of packaging annoyances, this is a loving  Memorial Day tribute for our war veterans.
