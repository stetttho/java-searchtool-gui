 I just want to make it clear to customers and editors alike that Chris O'Connor is NOT the female jazz singer Chris Connor, who was popular in the 50s and was a protegee of June Christy.  I haven't listened to Holler, so  I'll just give it one star (sorry Chris O'Connor!), but I hope customers  won't buy this thinking they are getting Chris Connor, because these are  TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE!
