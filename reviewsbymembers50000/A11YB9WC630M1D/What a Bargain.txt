 This is a terrific compilation of Sinatra's Capitol recordings of Johnny Mercer songs.  These tracks are all from his peak period in the 50s, and are taken from several of his great albums, and therefore vary enormously  in mood and arrangement:  some ballads, some swing, some chamber settings.   The biggest revelation is the ballad treatment of Day-In, Day-Out,  masterfully arranged by Axel Stordahl.  It was never released in Sinatra's  day!  Then, compare it with the swing version of the same song from the  album Come Dance With Me!  Another favorite of mine is often-overlooked I  Thought About You, a medium swing track from Songs for Swingin' Lovers,  arranged by Nelson Riddle.  Sinatra manages to inject just the right amount  of melancholy and wistfulness in his voice to convey the feeling of a man  thinking about his lover as he watches several scenes go by from his train  window. I guarantee that once you hear this CD, you will want to collect  the original albums.  I know!  But this is a great start.
