 I'm writing to answer Melissa's question.  She wonders why Darin's hits like "Mack the Knife" and "Beyond the Sea" are not in this compilation.  He recorded those tracks on his album "That's All" for the Atco label (Atlantic records).  Later, he switched to the Capitol label, which sponsors these Ultra-Lounge CDs.  These labels obviously don't share material.  "That's All" is available on CD, as well as many compilations containing his hits.   Also, to update a previous review I wrote, Darin's Capitol albums "Oh! Look at Me Now" (arranged by Billy May) and "Hello Dolly to Goodbye Charlie" (arranged by Richard Wess),where many of these tracks originated, have finally been released on one CD.  Look for it!
