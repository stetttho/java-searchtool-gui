 I have always relied on Leonard Maltin's Video Guide for older movies.  It is REMARKABLY accurate and consistent in its ratings for films up through the '70s, both American and foreign.  For newer films, he is dead-on most of the time.  Actually, I find myself consulting both Maltin and Roger Ebert for more recent films. For example, I prefer Eyes Wide Shut and American Beauty (both new masterpieces) to The Cider House Rules. One suggestion:  Amadeus is every classical musician's favorite film -- much better than Impromptu, Immortal Beloved, and all other preceding film-bios of classical composers. (The recent Topsy-Turvy is nearly as good.)  It is profound and unforgettable, all the way up to Salieri's haunting closing line, and while taken from a stage play, does not resemble one in the least.  The abundance of music is a PLUS, in my book, and the film captures time and place beautifully.  To dismiss it as "fatally overlong" is ironic, and reminds me of the Emperor's admonishment to Mozart of "too many notes -- just take out a few here and there," and Mozart's reply "It is just as long as I require.  Which few do you have in mind?"   Considering I have viewed this film over 10 times and never grow tired of it, I would suggest that Mr. Maltin kindly rethink his rating. Amadeus deserves 4 stars, but I would settle for 3 1/2.  Also consider that every Kurosawa film ever made, however brilliant, is "fatally overlong" and slow as molasses besides.  I have always found Throne of Blood and Seven Samurai overrated, yet greatly admire Stray Dog, Yojimbo, and Ran.  I realize I'm in the minority concerning the former two, however, and am willing to learn more about them.
