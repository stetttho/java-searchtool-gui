 Revolver-1966 When trying to pick the greatest Beatles album, it really comes down to a matter of opinion.  However, Revolver should definitely be in the top 3, not just for the Beatles, but for any entire rock collection.  This album was a huge stepping-stone for the Beatles and rock n roll.  Revolver marks the second album that the Beatles had begun doing new things on that they couldn't reproduce on stage (a big reason they stopped touring).  Though they would soon have more musical ambitions, Revolver was the newest and most innovative thing the Beatles had done up to this point.  It is not a hidden fact that Revolver was greatly influenced by the drugs the Beatles were taking at this time, most notably Lsd, and it definitely shows. The drug influences are most clear and obvious in John's songs, mainly "She Said, She Said", and "Tomorrow Never Knows", and these are actually some of the standout tracks on the album(look what those devil drugs have done!). Yet, let us not forget Paul as he, in some people's opinions, has the best songs on Revolver.  It is easy to see why this might be.  He writes the famous "Eleanor Rigby", the softer songs on the album "For No one" and "Here There and everywhere". George also shows some great songwriting in "Taxman" while Ringo still had yet to write his own song but does sing "Yellow Submarine" (probably the worst song on this album).  However, this does nothing to bring it down and it is easy to tell why it gets such great praise.  Let me just say that it lives up to its name as one of the greatest albums of all time and if you don't have Revolver you have no music collection.
