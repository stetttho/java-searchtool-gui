 That's really all that can be said, but I will go on anyway.  You can give me all the negativity you want, I expect it.  Good Charlotte is an embarrassment not just to rock music, but also to music in general.  They are a joke band that would only have helped rock if they never existed.  This band better live it up now because after they break up, that's it.  They will have no legacy, no influence, or leave behind any incredible songs or albums.  They are listened to by pre-teen girls who think they're being punk, and only pre-teen girls who think they're being punk.  Anybody else who listens to them deserves to be made fun of and laughed off the face of the earth.  In a perfect world, these guys would read this review and cry.  Too bad they won't even look.  Yeah, they don't need to care, they're laughing all the way to the bank and all that stuff.  But that's all they're gonna have is money, which makes them (since they play instruments) a little better than Ashley Simpson.  However, when they break up no one will even remember that, then they'll be no better.  Honestly, I probably wouldn't feel so strongly about this if they're fans weren't always going on about how bands like The Clash and Led Zeppelin suck and it's "all about Good Charlotte", because it is definitely not all about Good Charlotte.  Remember, vote yes for helpful.
