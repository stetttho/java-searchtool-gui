 This movie is a disgrace to Batman.  I tried to watch this a while ago because I hadn't seen it in years and I couldn't do it.  I could not make it to the end. There already is a cheesy and lame Batman movie by Adam West.  Why waste some great characters like Bane and Mr. Freeze in such a terrible movie.  Although there are many disappointments, Bane is the biggest for me.  He was this incredibly strong and ruthless crime lord who broke the Batman.  In this movie he can't even talk much less fight effectively.  Plus, he gets defeated by Robin, very stupid. Batgirl is pretty useless too. Not the right origin and she's just really annoying. It would be better if her part was just used to take up time, at least we'd know they didn't try. Bruce Wayne is alright, but you take all this other stuff and throw it in with some ice skating, a terrible script and bad Batman, you got Batman and Robin.
