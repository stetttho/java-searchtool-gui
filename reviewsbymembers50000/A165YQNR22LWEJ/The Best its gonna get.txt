 The Stones have produced so many great songs over the years (although  not much in the past 20) and as we all know have had many different greatest hits collections. However, this one stands out in my mind as the greatest.  The greatest thing about this CD is that every song is listenable.  With some of the other greatest hits cd's there are songs that some people are glad were put on but others not. With this, anyone can enjoy any song without saying "why'd they put this on here". My only real criticism of this album is why no "Last Time". This was probably one of their top five biggest songs at this time, yet its not on here. I've wondered this since I got it and, although I'm not even a big fan of this song, it has never made much sense to me.  Anyway, for the casual fan who's never really listened to or heard much of the Stones music, the standout tracks for me (or for the best introduction)would be Sympathy For The Devil,(I Cant Get No)Satisfaction,Street Fighting Man,Gimme Shelter,and Midnight Rambler. After these the best ones are (in my opinion)Jumpin Jack Flash,Brown Sugar,Paint It Black,Under My Thumb,and Honky Tonk Woman. So if you asked me, I'd say this is essential to any music collection. A great way to get the most of the biggest hits.
