 First off, I just want to say that all these Amazon reviewers are right by giving this movie the credit it deserves.  It really is a fun movie to just sit down and enjoy.  As a kid, I loved this movie.  Last Action Hero (and Conan) was what introduced me to Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Even today I like it and think it's a really good movie for a number of reasons.  One of these reasons is the original plot.  The idea of making alternate universes collide isn't that unusual, but the way it is used in this movie is pretty clever.  When doing this, they are really able to show the differences in each world and it becomes very entertaining and plays a big part in the plot.    The acting isn't outstanding, but with an action movie like this it's good enough not to get on your nerves.  Although the kid (Austin O'Brien)can get annoying sometimes, I kind of feel that's the way he's supposed to act.  He's havin one really weird time and shows it.  For me, probably the greatest thing about this movie is what most people disliked; it is one of the most stereotyped action movies there is.  But this was the point, that's the subtle humor, get it.  This is what most people failed to see, the fact that Last Action Hero is making fun of those other lame action movies.  Hopefully after reading this, you'll get it, and enjoy an underrated Schwarzenegger film.
