 I just got this book and let me just say that the words inside are some of the finest ever put between two covers.  It's all so informative.  So much so that one may think that it is perhaps, too informative, but I doubt it.  It's perfect.  You'll find some of the most obscure and some of the most well-known facts, on the same page.  Incredible.  The main thing I like about this book, is that it's much different from these types of timeline books.  Rather than saying "this happened, then this happened", it does that and provides much more information by giving background stories of many of the artists, and also providing a lot about the impact the person or band had.  Also, it's great how the devotes entire pages to show the significance of some important events in rock history.  This does a lot to show why some of the greatest bands of all time are considered some of the greatest band of all time.  So after reading this, you'll never wonder why again.  The bold type really helps out too, if you're looking for someone imparticular.  Also if you're a Beatles fan, the only thing you're not likely to find out is how many times they went to the bathroom each week.  So, in short this is the rock n' roll book I've seen and I highly recommend it.  Anything not in here probably isn't worth knowing.
