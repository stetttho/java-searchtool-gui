 Yes, this is the best Snapcase album (Steps isn't an album, it's an EP but that one's just as great), it's hard hitting and catchy. What I liked was the somewhat warmer feeling which I kinda missed on the first album, which was great but a bit cold at sometimes. This album has great vocals, nice n screamy and great lyrics along with them. Some of the killer songs are, IMHO, Caboose, Killing yourself to live and Zombie prescription, but in fact every song is great. I think this is coming very close to THE best hardcore album ever made.
