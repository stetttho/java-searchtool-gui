 Funky, freaky, groovy. Those words describe this album perfectly. Their metal/heavy rock is subtly combined with elements ranging from funk to hiphop, and their influences range from Mr. Bungle and Deftones to Primus and RHCP. It also has a very positive mood which can you make you feel better within minutes. I've been listening to this one for quite a while now and I noticed that, even in wintertime, this album makes you feel like it's summer. And that's something to cherish.
