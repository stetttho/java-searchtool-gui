 ...that Portishead is one of a kind. I truly love their music, but it's a pity that they're so unique that it's almost impossible to find similar bands. Thank god I have found some (Goldfrapp, Mazzy Star, Hooverphonic - the latter being my least favorite) but still Portishead is on top. The music is just great and very soothing. The hiphoppy beats combined with the beautiful melodies and of course the terrific voice of Beth Gibbons make this album a masterpiece in triphop. Get it!
