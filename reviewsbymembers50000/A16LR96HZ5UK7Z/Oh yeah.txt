 Looking for some great triphop (and already having all of Portishead's albums) I remembered having heard a song by a certain band called Hooverphonic some time ago (the song was, BTW, Mad About You from 'The magnificent tree') and so I went to look for Hooverphonic records. The shop I went to only had this album available so I took this one. At home I listened to it and I was completely amazed! Wonderful! Believe me, Belgium is one of the greatest sources for good music in Europe (Holland is too, ever heard of Face Tomorrow?).
