 Battle Royale directed by Kinji Fukasaku 2000, 114 mins.  Damn kids these days. Won't listen, no sir. Don't go to school anymore. Fieldtrips, though. Definitely.  Place: a remote island. More specifically: some dark room on that very island. Filled with a bunch of damn kids. And soldiers, and Kitano. Yup, our favorite Japanese actor/director/poker-face 'Beat' Takashi Kitano. He introduces the students, nay, 'students' (hell, if you don't go to school, you're no student either) to our favorite game: Battle Royale. By now, we have all heard about it, yes, we all know what Battle Royale is, but the kids are, of course, clueless. However, the rules are quickly explained (including a more than delightful instruction video) and well, let the games begin. The kids are supposed to kill eachother, and only one can remain when 72 hours have passed.  This is of course a great story for a movie (or manga, or, initially, book), and, glad to say this, Battle Royale delivers. The acting is more than just mediocre (Kitano is great; the 'I'm-dying-hold-me-while-I-say-my-last-words' scenes are laughable though), the action is superior. Some good plot twists add to the good feeling the movie gives you, and with a nice ending it definitely satisfies. Add to that Chiaki Kuriyama, Aki Maeda, and Kou Shibasaki, and you know you gotta watch this.   As for the gore, this movie doesn't totally let you down. Although not tremendously graphic and explicit, there's some nice and brutal scenes in there. Scary? Not at all, but that's not the point. Battle Royale is an extreme adrenaline rush, which really must be experienced. Although it hasn't officialy been released in the US, one should really try to get his hands on a copy (import or something): don't miss it.  mos says:  Scares? 1/10 Gore? 5/10 (it's there, but it's not so explicit at times) Number of cute Japanese schoolgirls? A nice collection/10 Fun factor? 11/10 Chiaki Kuriyama in a yellow training suit? 10/10
