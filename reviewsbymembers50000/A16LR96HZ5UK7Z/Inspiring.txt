 For me this was a total revelation. I already was sXe, mainly influenced by the likes of Snapcase and Better Than A 1000. I had heard of these guys but never heard their music. Until then...... Damn! How could I not have tried this sooner! It's just brilliant, from beginning to end. Ian McKaye's more recent band Fugazi may not be one of my favorites; this is just perfect. What can I say? I could write a thousand words about this (actually, that's my max...) but I'm short on words. Just listen to it and you'll know what I mean. Try it if you like Better Than A 1000, Dead Kennedys or Youth Of Today. Old School hardcore stuff!
