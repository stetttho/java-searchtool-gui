 The plot's simple, anything but unique, clich, and what-not; (minor spoiler possibility) a photo crew ends up in a house in the woods (for what reason? I don't know, really). On the way there they hit some thing, which immediately disappeared again though. In any case, being stuck in the house, some monster (the thing) with a giant phallus comes and terrorizes them.  Gorn? Hell yeah. Amusing? Moderately. I personally liked the first entry in the series, Guts Of A Beauty, better. However, that doesn't mean this one's bad. Or well, it's bad, but it's still fun, too. There's no real story, no development, some clich characters, copious amounts of rape, a swamp thing with a giant phallus, and a necrophiliac girl. Altogether, that makes for some slightly above average 70+ minutes.  The special effects are very poorly done though; if you have seen the cover art and thought, "Oh my, now that looks retarded", this is a shot from an actual scene in the flick (referring to the Japan Shock edition!). There's some more badly done scenes, although the scenes with the necrophiliac girl are excecuted generally nice and are highly amusing.   In the end, I'd say recommended if you like gorn, but the first entry in the series, Guts Of A Beauty, 'd be a better choice.  mos says:  Scares? -20/10 Gore? 6/10 Size of that giant phallus? 10"/10 Fun factor? 6/10 Guts Of A Virgin? Well.
