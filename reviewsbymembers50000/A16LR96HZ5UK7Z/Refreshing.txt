 After the kinda dull Riot Riot Upstart this is kind of a relief actually. AF was softening. And why?! I dunno! What's more important is the fact that these guys still CAN kick a.ss. And this is the proof. Yes, all tracks may be quite similar so I'd rate it with 4 and a half stars but well, that's not an option, so I'll give em five. It's a very fast album, and I'd definitely advise this if you like old AF albums.
