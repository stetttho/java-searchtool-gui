 This actually is the album that got me into Slayer. The first Slayer song I ever heard was Serenity In Murder and at that time I thought it was one of the best songs ever (it's been a couple of years ago) so I bought the album. I was stunned since it had nothing but classics on it. Crushing, heavy, brutal, lyrically extreme (not THAT extreme but you know what I mean); everything I expected from a good record. This record is also responsible for getting me into deathmetal and thrash, since the speed and heaviness really appealed to me. Of course I got some other Slayer albums too but I only like the older ones (South Of Heaven, Reign In Blood), because everything that came out after Divine Intervention (with the exception of that punkalbum, hey, it's got Minor Threat covers :) just [stinks].  The guitarplay is absolutely great too, from both those guys, but I prefer Kerry King's leads. They're just better and rock more and I don't know. Hanneman's leads are cool too, but not as cool as King's. Tom Araya's voice is still the best thrashsinger ever, he's got a dark, deep voice which fits the music and lyrics and the drummer is just a good drummer, he's got some power and can drum pretty fast. Lovely.
