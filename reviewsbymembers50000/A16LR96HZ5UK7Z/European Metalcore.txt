 This is great metalcore from Belgium and I would absolutely advise to all of you metalcore fans out there. It's uptempo, it's got great riffs and the singer's got a brutal voice! Another great release from GoodLifeRecordings, a Belgian hardcore/metalcore label. See if you can find other released of 'em too, like Angel Crew or sumthing.
