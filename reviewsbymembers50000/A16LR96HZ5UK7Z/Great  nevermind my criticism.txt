 This album is simply great. I have been a longtime fan of Snapcase and to be honest they just never cease to amaze me. This album is way more diverse than any album before, although those albums are all quite different too; still, this is just beyond. You can still call it hardcore, but I think you have to be rather open-minded to do so. It's quite soft actually, real 'hardcore' songs as heard on PTU are nowhere to find and even the scrapy edges in Daryl's voice are gone. To some it may be disappointing, and I would understand that, because it shows how shortsighted the hardcore-scene still which I think is very sad. "I love hardcore but I hate the scene", Zoli said and those are wise words. Snapcase is being innovative and it's not well received. It's not their fault. Although I may sound really really positive I do have some criticism. In some cases the music is maybe a bit too watered down to be called Snapcase. I love these guys, but if you would take out the Vocals on some pieces (like Exile Etiquette) you'd probably think you were listening to Tool. You could say it's a compliment, and of course, yes it's sort of a compliment too but I think Snapcase should watch out because they might drift too far away from what they were doing and that might lose them alot.
