 This is absolutely a youthcrew/sxe/old school hardcore classic. it's fast, furious and very heavy, but at the some it still carries a very positive aspect. This album was an absolute relief after the quite disappointing album 'Beyond Planet Earth' by Shelter, another band of leadsinger and songwriter Ray Cappo. Also their other release, Value Driven, is worth a try, although this remains to be my fav BTA1000 album. By the way, Shelter's back too. Check out their brilliant album 'The Purpose, The Passion'.
