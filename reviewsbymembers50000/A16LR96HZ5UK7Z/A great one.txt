 I'm a fan of the Discworld series but I only started reading about a year ago so I'm now reading Lords and Ladies, that's why I don't know if any Discworld book after that is better. Still, this is one of the greatest Discworld books I read so far. It's got a great story line, I think, and the characters are great. This is also one of the first Discworld books that actually is really good and deserves five stars (although there may be some exceptions); most of the earliest work is, tragically, not so good. Which I, by the way, didn't notice until I tried and read 'The Colour Of Magic' for the second time, which was, in my memory, one of the greatest books ever. It bored me though. Still, if you're new to the Discworld series, I think this one, Moving Pictures, is NOT a good starting point! Just start at number one, you'll see some characters introduced and well, it's not THAT bad, although it's got some strange parts if you compare with the now standard Discworld science. This is a great one though, one of a kind; it's a funny take on Hollywood and I'm sure you'll love this! Read it!
