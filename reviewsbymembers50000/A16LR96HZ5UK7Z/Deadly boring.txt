 And I'm dead serious. This is not intelligent and fabulous, this is simply not quite good. Everyone reading this will probably I'm a proghater, a Toolhater or a numetalhater (although I don't even think Tool is numetal) but I'm not. I used to be a big fan. I considered Aenima the perfect album. The songs took seven minutes, sometimes longer but they didn't get boring. They always had hooks and were just amazing. Here, I miss the Tool feeling and, most importantly, I miss the songs! Missed chance for these lads.
