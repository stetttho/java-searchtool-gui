 Seriously, if I could I'd rate this CD with six stars! Ayumi is the greatest pop-icon ever, IMHO! She's got it all, the looks, the voice, the songs! Ayumi is just so cute! This CD is wonderful! I have just ordered it and I'm waiting to get this CD but I know most of the songs already. And they're great songs; rocksongs, dancesongs, ballads; you can find it all on this record. For instance, 'Real me' is a R n B-ish song which is sung in English mostly, Hanabi is a great ballad, July 1st is a great dancesong and Heartplace is a great rocksong. Love it!
