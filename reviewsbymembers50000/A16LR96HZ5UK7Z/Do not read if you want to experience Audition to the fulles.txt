 Audition directed by Takashi Miike 2002, 115 mins.  Meet Shigeharu Aoyama. He is single, and you know it. And Shigeharu knows, too. And his friend, Yasuhisa Yoshikawa, weeeeell, he knows too. Good thing Yasuhisa is in the movie business. 'How about a little audition, Shigeharu? You can choose your favorite chick out of the girls that come auditioning.' Needless to say, our 'hero' accepts this (admit it, strange) offer and after a fairly amusing audition, one candidate remains.  Enter Asami Yamazaki. Gentle, shy, quiet, pretty. Shigeharu's wet dream, so to say. Date date date romantic romantic romantic yatta yatta yatta. But wait, isn't this a Miike film? 'Visitor Q'-Miike? 'Ichi'-Miike? Well, yes. That's the guy. Where's the sickening stuff/ultra-violence then? Well, be patient. It's in there. Somewhere. I could tell you. But I won't. I wouldn't want to spoil everything.  Yup. Audition should be watched blankly. By now, we all know the cover art, maybe the trailer, and everything has been spoiled. Just try to watch it without thinking of everything you might know already, and prepare for this joyride. Enjoy it.   Sven says:  Scares? 3/10 (we all saw it coming, anyway) Gore? 4/10 (that's for doing things off-screen, points go to the bar and the sack) Points Asami would score on an impression-on-first-sight test? 10+/10 Fun factor? 10/10 Points Asami would score on a personality test? 1/10
