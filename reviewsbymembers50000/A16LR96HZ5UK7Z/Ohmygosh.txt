 When I first heard this album, I was totally blown away. It was a revelation. Within a very short time, it grew to be one of my favorite albums of all time. Now, that has been quite a while ago, and still this album is one of the best musical productions ever released. It's only like 30 minutes long (which might be a disappointment for some) but for me it's the perfect length for a punkrock album. Too bad the album cover's that bad. But well... The lyrics are very great. They are intelligent and, at least for me since I'm Dutch, sometimes hard to understand. But when you take the time for it to read them, you will find out what a masterpiece you are holding. Also the music is brilliant. From the opening song Change Of Ideas all the way to The World Won't Stop it's nothing but a constant orgasm. 30 minutes long. Favorites? Nah. Every song is as great as the others. Absolute classic, just get it.
