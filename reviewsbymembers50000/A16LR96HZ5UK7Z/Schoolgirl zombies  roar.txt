 Stacy: Attack Of The Schoolgirl Zombies directed by Naoyuki Tomomatsu 2001, 80 mins.  Stacy is a movie about, you guessed it, Stacy. Or well, Stacies, actually. Teenage girls, aged 15-17, somehow just die after experiencing some kind of Near Death Happiness. After dying, they turn into, yup, zombies. (the title didn't really give that one away, did it?) They demand to be chopped up into 165 pieces to be 're-killed'. This is what the 'story' revolves around, although the story is not really of any importance, or so it seems.   We see a girl who (unconvincingly) experiences the earlier mentioned Near Death Happiness and then goes on the look for someone to chop her up when she dies and turns into a zombie (uh). She finds a puppet-maker, Shibu, who agrees to kill her. Another (sub?)plot revolves around a guy whose sister has become a Stacy (he had to kill her after that) and therefore joins Romero, the special unit that kills the Stacies. It's quite confusing, and too pretentious by far, but besides all that, the movie provides a whole lot of fun. Tongue-in-cheek scenes (one involving some kind of TelSell advertisement where a 'Blues Campbell's Right Hand #2' is sold) help to keep your attention to it.   The movie isn't really scary (read: not at all), but the gore and fun make up for it. A strong stomach is advised for some scenes, such as the one where a Stacy gets decapitated, and some others where people get devoured quite gruesomely (guts ripped out and such). Watch it if you like zombies, Japanese schoolgirls, or both.  mos says:  Scares? 0/10 Gore? 7/10  Japanese schoolgirl zombies? 10/10 Fun factor? 7/10 Hundred-n-sixty-five-pieces? Many pieces, but not 165/10
