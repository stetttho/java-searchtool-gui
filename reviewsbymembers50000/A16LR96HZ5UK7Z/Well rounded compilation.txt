 First of all, if you own all regular Ayumi albums, this CD is fairly obsolete right now. You may still want it for the 'A Song for XX' songs that got new vocals, or some of the new mixes (like 'Boys & Girls'' - mind, I didn't say REmix) but those differences are so incredibly tiny it's not really worth it. By the time this was released it was worth buying, definitely, for it had 'M' on it which hadn't been released by then. But, since it's also on 'I am...', why would you still buy this CD? Well, although I own all regular Ayu albums I still bought is. It looks nice in your collection, the booklet is gorgeous, the songs are still good and the compilation is okay (although some top-notch songs are excluded, like, where's 'Poker face'?). It's definitely worth a spin, since it does pretty much sum up Ayu's first three albums. Besides from being obsolete, there's nothing wrong with this release. All the songs are still awesome, thus I'm giving this baby 5 stars.
