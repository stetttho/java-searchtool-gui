 After the way too early end of Kyuss, thank god there were some incarnations. Including QOTSA, as you probably had guessed. Where the first album still carried heavy influences from Kyuss' later work (And the circus leaves town, Sky valley), this album introduces many new styles and blends all those into one new style: Queensrock. Nah, just kidding. At the core this is still stoner rock but it's way beyond that. Every song is completely different from the one before it. And the one next to it. And still every song is as great as the other. Great laidback singing too. Just great!
