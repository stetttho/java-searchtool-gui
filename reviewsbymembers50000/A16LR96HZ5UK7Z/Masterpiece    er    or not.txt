 First Impression - Truly amazing EP. I love it, as always great music provided by the Dillinger Escape Plan and also great vocals by Patton. It's quite a change. Where Patton's predecessor Minakakis did nothing but scream, Patton's vocals are more diverse. I do NOT want to call this an improvement, at least not immediately, since I liked Minakakis' voice very much and I never got bored of DEP. Still, I hope Patton and DEP continue to cooperate, since it IS a good combination....Okay, I've listen to this somed times again ...When I heard this EP first, I thought 'okay, his vocals are nice' but no more than nice and the worst the thing is: they don't fit with Dillinger's music! I read a review, stating Patton sounded kinda like Davis from Korn, well that's half true. The screams of Minakakis were much more in place! If you want a really good DEP record buy 'Calculating Infinity' or buy the best they ever made: 'Under the running board EP',...
