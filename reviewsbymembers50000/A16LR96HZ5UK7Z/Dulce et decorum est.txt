 This album's great. I know Deicide has been criticized but well, I don't care. They're said to be too satanic, too stupid... Well, I still love this album. I don't care how satanic they are, as long as they don't start doing stupid stuff like that Burzum-guy an' the Euronymus stuff and that. I don't care how stupid they are, for me they are deathmetal geniuses together with the likes of Nile, Cannibal Corpse and Cephalic Carnage. I might be forgetting some, but well. Sorry. Just get this. Slowpaced deathmetal in the style of eh... well.... oldschool. Like Ramses from Nile. Groovier than Doc Dre. Or something like that.
