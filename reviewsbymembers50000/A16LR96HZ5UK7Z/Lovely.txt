 This was the third album I got from Kyuss, since I got em in wrong order (I started with ...and the circus). Therefore, it was strange at first. The production was...er...less. Hmm. The songs were...er...different. Damn. I actually didn't listen to it for a long time until suddenly one day, this song popped into my head. I couldn't remember whose song it was so I had to go through my CD collection - not a big job really, since I knew from many CD's it wouldn't be those. I ended up with a bunch of CD's from Fu Manchu, Kyuss, QOTSA and some more.  That is, you'd probably guessed, when I learned the song was 'Molten Universe' from this album. I listened to it, loved it and I still do. After all, the production wasn't THAT bad (I've heard worse and since I listen to Minor Threat alot, I'm used to it) and the songs were different, but good. Like it.
