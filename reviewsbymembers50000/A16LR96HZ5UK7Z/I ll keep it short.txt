 This is plainly a must-have. Not only for all of you fans out there (like me), but also for just anybody. I know what you are thinking: Buffy - vampires - high school - Dawson's creek... STOP! That's a stupid comparison. BTVS has got so much more than just some horror and a bunch of highschool teens. It's mysterious and kick a.ss!
