 What the hell is this? After Mantra, which was a bit strange at some moments, this is even weirder. What happened to Shelter? I think if Ray Cappo really desires to make also this kind of music, besides the hardcore/punk music, he should give it a different name. This is so far from the original Shelter and it's such a contrast. Ok, not in terms of Paradise Lost or sumthing (thank god) but... rap rock? ska? Please! Good try, but hey I don't like ska that much and I hate rap rock (read: all those Limp Bizkit copycats and LB theirselves of course) so please...keep up the good work you got into with Quest and Attaining. After this 20 Summers was released, which I personally found a total relief, and the Purpose Passion, which was even better. I suggest you get one of those two, or one of the two I mentioned right before them. Or all of them. Just buy this one to complete your collection. And yes, the lyrics are brilliant and not all songs are bad. Why do you think I rated them with three stars...
