 One essential record, to say the least. No Doubt's Singles Collection is one of the best compilations I've seen, since it actually does cover almost their entire lifespan. Well, 1992-2003 then, and no songs from Beacon Street Collection are included (sadly but understandable); nevertheless it's a record with nothing but top-notch picks. The Singles Collection also shows the admirable progress No Doubt made; from a rather naive (but cute!) lil' band back in 1992, to an all-star band with gifted musicians and a strong and fierce front-woman, that can even get away with a nice lil' cover! Funnily enough, this lil' cover, It's My Life, is actually a reminder of No Doubt's roots, since they used to have a whole lot of new wave influences. And well, Talk Talk... that's new wave pur sang. But! New wave is NOT a dirty word (anymore), possibly even thanks to No Doubt, listen to this collection and be amazed. From the almost agressive punkrock of Excuse Me Mr. to the laid-back ska-influenced Underneath It All and the dance joint Hella Good, this is one solid compilation any No Doubt fan should own.
