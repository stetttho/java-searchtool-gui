 This is one of the best Death Metal albums ever made. It's very, very brutal, fast and heavy; like it should be. The musicians are very good and know what they play; the guitarplaying is simply genious and the drummer is one of the best ever. The grunt kicks [butt], and the lyrics are something different too (not what you'd expect from a band named Dying Fetus), they are more politically instead of bloody and gory which is the standard for deathmetal, so the lyrics are more grindcore-ish. All eight songs are great, and they do not all sound alike, which is great for a death metal album, because if that happens it gets too average and Destroy the Opposition is FAR above the average.
