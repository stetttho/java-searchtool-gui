 This is a great comic. I stumbled over it when I was searching my local comic bookstore, since I was pretty dissatisfied with the irregularity with which Battle Chasers was released. The cover really appealed to me, being a fantasy fan, so I took it home and read it and immediately I loved it and I went back to the store to get all the other parts. The drawing are good and the inking is AWESOME. The story is maybe not so complex but it sure is a fun read. I know many people comment on this comic as it being too simple but that's only a strong point, since there are already so much 'heavy' comics out there (by the way, it's not THAT simple). Along with Bone and Battle Chasers the best comic ever.
