 It's good. That's the only word I can come up with for this album. You can definitely hear that these guys have been around for some time. The songs are catchy (in their own, strange way), the vocals are great (!really brutal!) and the lyrics, hmm. Been there, done that. But I must admit that I don't really care for the lyrics and after all, titles like 'Hacksaw Decapitation' are better for deathmetalsongs than something fishy as 'Baby one more time'. Good deathmetal album for the newcomer. By the way, great artwork.
