 Deicide has lost it's glory. Not all of it, since there are still some great songs on this album (my personal fav is Let It Be Done) but the rest is just too average. Which is the best word for this and which is the reason I gave this three stars. Although the old Deicide albums (the first one especially, which is my fav death metal album of all time) are absolutely classics and far above the average, this is just bad. It lacks progression, originality (also for the voice, Benton had a cool voice, now it's mostly plain grunting), and good songs.
