 This is one of a kind, truly, and it's in one word amazing. The beats are just great and the lyrics are some of the best ever, especially compared to all that gangsta [garbage], which I've heard too much these days. The first song I heard from these guys was Drop, which is still one of the best hiphop songs ever, IMHO, along with Hell On Earth from Mobb Deep and some other ill tracks from other artists (Mos Def, Roots, Cannibal Ox). I think these guys are on of the top hiphop groups around, placing them in line with names as the earlier mentioned Mobb Deep, Mos Def and The Roots, which are all fabulous hiphop artists. This album proves it.
