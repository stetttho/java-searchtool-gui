 For me, Chrono Cross is the best game ever! When I first played this, I was totally blown away by every single aspect of the game. Firstly the graphics, which are the most beautiful ever seen on Playstation. Then the CG movies. Awesome. I know there are some CG's from Square that are even better but they're in the top three. Then the music. Absolutely perfect! I was stunned! You can also buy an album with all the game music on Amazon; it might be a bit expensive but believe me: it's worth it! Ambient and orchestral stuff. Gameplay. Also just great. The battle system is very original and works great. The enemies: if you just play this game normally you shouldn't have any problems fighting enemies, although there ARE some tough one; like that crazy bot on the highway and of course the bot in the Fate lab. But well, don't let me spoil this for you already by telling every detail. M'sorry. Last thing. The plot. Is this plot made up by human beings?! It's so intelligent, unique, fantastic... I could write down a hundredthousand superlatives (oh wait actually a thousand, that's my max again) to describe this game but I'll keep it short. Just get it.
