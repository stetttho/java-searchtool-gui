 This here album, which is rather old already, is nice. Very nice. It was the first Merzbow album I ever bought, having heard some songs of it and very much liking them. After giving this disc numerous spins, I still do. No, this is not 'just' noise. Same goes for people saying every Merzbow record sounds alike, no, not true. 'Tauromachine' is kind of 'beat'-orientated, if you could say 'beat' at all considering it's Merzbow (then again, we all remember Merzbeat). Most of the songs have a subtle beat and/or drone going on ('Cannibalism Of Machine''s is quite obvious, same goes for 'Heads Of Clouds', etcetera), mixed with some good ol' harsh analogue noise. Thank god this is not a loop-record tho, keep that in mind: beat is not loop. For people new to Merzbow, I'd say this is a nice start (hell, it was my first Merzbow album as well), since it's not just good, but quite listenable too. Is that a compliment? Noise, listenable? I don't know, really, if it is, but it's meant as one. Yes. One fine record.
