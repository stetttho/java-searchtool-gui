 Well, it's kinda hard for me to choose my favorite in the Discworld series since every episode has got its great moments. Still, I'd choose this one. For me, it's the best work mr Pratchett has every delivered. Humoristic of course, and as always a brilliant plot. And interesting characters. They're all elements Pratchett got famous for and well, let me tell you he really deserved it. For those who think LOTR is a bit too heavy this is perfect, since it's much easier to read. And for those who love LOTR (like me), well...this is perfect too!
