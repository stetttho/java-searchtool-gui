 I can tell you one thing: this CD is pure chaos. It's everything. Warm, cold, horny, epic, painful, powerful, harsh, soft, musical, hateful, lovely, strange, alienating. It's everything but normal. The CD has 19 tracks, although the CD can be considered as one big 'track'. It's a perfect balance between distorted vocals (not many tho, it's mainly about the music), noise and maniacal breakbeats. This is the ultimate soundtrack to a horror movie. For a live record the quality is quite good. Stereo and all the blahblah, it's just good. We hear Masami Akita's (Merzbow) harsh noises being supported by evil Alec Empire, better known as THE MAN behind Atari Teenage Riot, who is behind the DJ kit and mic. Also some guest mic appearances by other ATR members. All in all this CD is an experience you just gotta live through. Awesome record. Alec and DHR Records, thank you so much for releasing this gem!
