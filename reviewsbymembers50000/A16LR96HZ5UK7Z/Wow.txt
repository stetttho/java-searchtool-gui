 Lovely album, in the vein of, I'd say probably, Queens Of The Stone Age, although there are some (major?) differences. First of all, Queens are from the USA, Millionaire from Belgium. QOTSA are worldfamous, Millionaire not. Queens' music is diverse, but all stoner-rock-diverse, Millionaire goes all the way from stoner rock to laidback triphoppy stuff.  Of course, there are also some similarities. One: both singers/guitarist have played in other well known bands (Kyuss / Evil Superstars), they're touring through Europe together and they both made great albums. I'd advise this for any hardcore Queens and/or stoner fan.
