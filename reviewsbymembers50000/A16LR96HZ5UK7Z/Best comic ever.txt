 No, but it's coming damn close. If it wouldn't be released so irregularly, it could have been. Still, this is a must-read.  Joe Mad's drawings are great and are heavily influenced by Japanase drawing styles (and since I like manga and anime, that's great) but still don't become one of the masses because they are kinda different. The inking is WONDERFUL, thanks to the inker-with-the-funny-name. The story is great (so far) and a must for any fantasy fan.
