 This CD is in one word incredible. Just like every other Star Wars album, this one is great too. By the way, for the one that said the Cd is defective: It's not, but the dumb ... at the label company made 4 covers and put 'Will not play on PC and Mac' on only one of those 4 covers (namely the Yoda cover). There ya go. Buy this!
