 Great! I love Beth's voice, it's beautiful. Probably any Portishead fan will like this, although there is a big difference between Portishead and this album. Portishead is rather cold and distant music, this CD is much warmer, which is caused by the music. Portishead always sounds very sad (it makes me think of rainy streets in London), Beth solo (ok, not solo but with Rustin Man) has a different touch. Hard to name it. Sorry.
