 For me, ATF is Deftones' finest work to date. While White Pony was very eclectic (beautiful of course, five stars!) and Adrenaline was very hardcore based (once again five stars) this CD has the perfect balance between those. It has very peaceful, gentle songs but, on the other hand, also very angry, aggresive songs. Still, they are all in the same style, and that's where White Pony was different. It contained songs which were very much like the old stuff (like Korea) but it even had triphop (Teenager). Hmm. Sounds like I'm criticzing that CD now, but that's not true. I'm just trying to point it out why I called this one my fav. Anyway, the music is great and also the vocals stand out. The lyrics are great too; sometimes very abstract but that makes it more mysterious and it also contributes to the arty feeling Deftones' music always has had. Also a guest appearance on this album by former Sepultura singer (now Soulfly - I don't like em very much) Max Cavalera on Headup and a hidden track. It's called Damone, by the way. Well, I could only advise you to buy this. It's special and unique. One to love.
