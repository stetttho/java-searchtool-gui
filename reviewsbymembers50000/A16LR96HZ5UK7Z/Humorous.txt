 Seriously, buy this CD so you can laugh at the songtitles. The music is er... well, Napalm Death's 'Scum' had better songwriting and Carcass 'Reek Of Putrefaction' had a better production, which should say enough. But really. I mean. "Kyle From Incantation Has A Mustache"? "You Look Adopted"? "You're In A Come"? Enjoy.
