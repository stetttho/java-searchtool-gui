 This mini-album captures the true the spirit of New York Hardcore; hence the title probably ^_^. I love NYHC and especially Madball, so I picked up this record, having read somewhere that Freddy featured on one of the songs. I listened to it. Thought. Could this be...? Listened to it again. Thought. Yes, it really is... ONE OF THE GREATEST NYHC ALBUMS OF ALL TIME! It may be only fifteen minutes or so long, the music is powerful and the way it should be (hardcore!), the vocals are [...] amazing, and well, the lyrics are...er...kinda cheesy actually. Unity, pride, I've heard it all before but I don't really bother with it. As long as it's sung with belief, which is totally the case here. Five stars for this baby.
