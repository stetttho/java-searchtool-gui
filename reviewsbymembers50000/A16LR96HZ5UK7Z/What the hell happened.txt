 Hmm... something is very very wrong. At first I was happy to hear AFI was recording a new album, but the song Girl's Not Grey, which was available for listening through their website, actually made me kinda nervous. Was this where AFI was going? I remember those good old AFI days: the A Fire Inside EP still carries two of the best hardcore songs ever (3 1/2 and Overexposure, duh!), Answer That was just great. Black Sails was a change of style, but it was still a fine album and Art Of Drowning was sort of a perfection of the Black Sails style. This was not was I expected. Although I listen to many styles of hardcore and punk (and others types of music, such as jazz and various types metal) this couldn't satisfy me at all! It's so cheesy, and Davey Havok looks like a girl, but well that doesn't really influence the music (or does it?). The music kinda reminded me of Saves The Day and Midtown, emo-pop-punk, with some goth influences. Which is totally different of their old stuff, which was more influenced by Minor Threat and Negative Approach. I even start wondering if Davey is still straight edge!  It's sad but the AFI: East Bay Hardcore days are over... If you want some top notch AFI, get the A Fire Inside EP or some other old stuff... ANYTHING but this!
