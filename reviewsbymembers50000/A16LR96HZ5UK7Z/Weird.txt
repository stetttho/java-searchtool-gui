 ... Yes, this book is hard to understand and read. That's where its beauty lies. For me, it's a pleasure to read it. Although the story's wiven through the book, you can follow it hardly. But for me, the story is not what the book's about. The book is just a great series of great sounds, wordplays and everything and it is in it's form as great as any other piece of abstract art. Because that's what it is. Abstract art. We have abstract paintings (do I have to name examples?), abstract music, so why can't we have abstract literature? I think it's very interesting to read this and give your own meaning to it, as you (might) do with abstract paintings and/or music. In that way it's a great effort of James Joyce, since you can give anything your own meaning: music, paintings... except for books. Books are beautiful but at the same time there are unwritten rules for books: a storyline, grammar... I could go on for hours. James Joyce breaks with this tradition. But that's great! It has been done before in every form of art! Look at the way music evolved: from classical music all the way to grindcore. There's such a big difference between all those. Music can be simple, and difficult, and I dunno how to explain it. It's just not so rule-based as literature. And therefore, once again, we should cherish this piece of art. It's groundbreaking. Can't say anything to that.
