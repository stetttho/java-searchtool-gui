 I think this is Kyuss finest album. It has nothing but great, incredible songs on it. This was the first Kyuss album I bought ever and was amazed by the incredible songs and the great singing. It's a pity these guys have been around so shortly, leaving only four (yet four great!) albums behind. Anyone with just a little bit feeling for stoner rock should immediately buy this album!
