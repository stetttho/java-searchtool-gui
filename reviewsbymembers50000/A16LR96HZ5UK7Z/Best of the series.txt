 I find this compilation the best in the PunkORama series, with PunkOrama #3 coming in close on number two. It's got some great songs and not only those from (then) more recent records, it's even got some oldies! The best songs on this comp. are IMHO those by The Descendents, Pennywise, Down By Law and Bad Religion. It's got some bad stuff, Joy Killer being the best example of this. Eew. That sux. For the rest it's great but onyl four stars since I hate compilations.
