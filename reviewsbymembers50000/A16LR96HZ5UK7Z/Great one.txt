 This is a great part of the Discworld series and actually the first one that really got onto me. The story is pretty good, about Death needing a break (DEATH, I mean) and his search for a replacement, which is, you'd guessed, Mort. The book is really funny, and the characters are funny and a bit more realistic than most characters from the first two Discworld books (yeah, I know this is number FOUR but I didn't like number three, Equal Rites, very much). Overall one of the better ones in the series.
