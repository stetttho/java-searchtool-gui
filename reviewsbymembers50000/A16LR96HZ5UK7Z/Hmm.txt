 To be true, it's not bad, but I own way better grindcore albums. It has a very clean production which of course can be seen as a positive aspect, but in the case of grindcore it's more to be negative. The songwriting's ok. I prefer other stuff though. Nasum's not the best band in the genre. Keep looking. Still, if you're just getting into this type of music it might be a fine introduction, since something like 'Scum' by Napalm Death is way beyond this. Still, it's worth it. Especially because grindcore is kinda hard to get... at least here in Holland it is.
