 Yeah, I guess it's fine. Well, the music is. The singing kinda irritates me. Not my cuppa tea. But still, musically this is one helluva album. And the voice...you'll get used to it. It's worth it. This is great deathmetal with a more screaming-like grindvoice rather than a grunting deathvoice. Strange combination, yes.  Yes, I know this review doesn't make any sense. Sorry.
