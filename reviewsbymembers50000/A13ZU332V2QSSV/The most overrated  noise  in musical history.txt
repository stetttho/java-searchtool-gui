 I can only assume that some cruel, but well respected music critic, gave this noise a high rating as a joke to see what would happen...and sure enough, a mindless, Stepford nation followed his lead. Surely, he is now sitting back somewhere, laughing hysterically and thinking "GOTCHA !" My assessment of this dreadful noise is this. Imagine your worst enemy making the most unpleasant noise he can make for an hour or more, never going up nor down with the irritating pitch, but going on and on and on with the hideous, evil, suicide-inducing sound until it becomes utterly unbearable. That describes perfectly Ms. Hill's prank/joke of an album. Absolutely the most hideous noise/sound I have ever heard. Raise your hand if anyone can say truly say that they play this CD often and enjoy it ? Do you know anyone who plays it ? Now, raise your hand if you were duped into believing this was music but now realize you were the victim of a cruel joke. AHA !! I thought so :)
