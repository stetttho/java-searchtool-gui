 There's not too many things as pleasurable as discovering an outstanding "new" author, being highly impressed with his novel, then realizing the author is a veteran writer with many books under his belt. "The Church of the Dead Girls" absolutely floored me ! I truly enjoy the fact that I can turn into a gushing fanatic to recommend a novel, being that it happens so rarely, but this thriller/mystery is so perfectly realized, please allow me to gush. Mr. Dobyn's prose is exceptional. An obviously intelligent man that not only knows his craft, but truly seems to enjoy and respect it as well. This story begins with a gruesome discovery in a small town, as three missing young girls are found. Then the author backs the reader up a bit, taking us to the beginning, and simply unfolds the story in such a brilliant and deeply involving manner, you will repeatedly have to remind yourself that this is a work of fiction. The author leaves no character unturned, as each one is richly developed, as well as the setting and each scenerio that takes place. This author's intelligent prose practically leaps off every page as the mystery and suspense keeps building. A complaint I hear often from avid readers is their disappointment with a book's ending. Well, I'm happy to announce that this ending is superb, and matches the brilliance of the rest of the novel. If you are tired of the generic and cliched mystery and thrillers that saturate the market these days, then I HIGHLY suggest you seek this novel out. One of the greatest that I have read in a long while, and for once, all the great reviews from the very notable critics were accurate.  This novel is a winner and hits the bullseye...dead center !
