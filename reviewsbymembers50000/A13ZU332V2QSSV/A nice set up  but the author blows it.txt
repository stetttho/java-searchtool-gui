 The notion of a traveling vampire show coming to a small American town in the 60s, during a summer when three teenage friends are "awakening" into adulthood, was truly a great idea. Mr. Laymon certainly pulled some of this idea off, but, unfortunately, he stumbled badly, and what could have been an intriguing story falls flat. The biggest disappointment of this novel is the author's ultra-silly humor, which is never funny, just simply juvenile and irritating, and it's there...basically on every page....during every scenerio...and it really destroys any suspense or momemtem the story may have built up. I did indeed finish this novel, suffering through the great amount of unfunny humor, and I must admit, the preposterous ending equalled the lame humor in it's level of disappointment. There were some (very few) passages that satisfied, like Dwight's awkward feelings concerning his love for Slim, but these were always capped with some silly line, or a never-ending bit of sarcasm from Rusty. This "over-kill" is throughout the entire novel, and it's sad that such a good premise for a story was ruined. These same comments also apply for the only other Laymon novel I read, "Bite" and judging from these two novels, I don't care to read any more from his body of work. I truly love horror, and I enjoy a great sense of humor, but unbearable silliness is not my cup of tea.
