 In "O is for Outlaw," Ms. Grafton once again demonstrates her unique talents for keeping an on-going series fresh and immensely readable. In this chapter of the Kinsey Milhone: Alphabet series, the author gives us fans a little more insight into Kinsey's very personal and mysterious past life, while at the same time offering us yet another intriguing and very satisfying mystery/thriller. There is so much to admire about the author's wonderful prose, and her ability to tell a flat-out great story with each novel, but, I must pin-point her most valuable gift to her fans....and that would be her absolutely unbeatable sense of humor, which she so wonderfully injects in the entire series. When writing Kinsey's views and thoughts of the world and it's inhabitants, this author will have you rolling on the floor.....as her perceptions are so dead-on and down to earth, surely, everyone should and could relate. Applying this level of humor into  very serious and dangerous cases can not be an easy task, but Ms. Grafton does it brilliantly. These books are so well written, one has to constantly remind themselves that Kinsey (and all her escapades) are a work of fiction. I look forward to each new novel, and all past 15 are highly recommended. A truly great author that should appeal to any avid reader.
