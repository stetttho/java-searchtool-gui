 Read this exceptional thriller and I guarantee that the character, Mary (Terror) Terrell, is one that you'll never forget. To be more accurate, this is a novel you'll never forget. Robert R. McCammon's brilliant prose, intelligence and his true love of his work shines brightly in all his novels, and "Mine" is no exception. The terms, "Heart Stopping," "Hair Raising" "Fast and Furious," and "Edge of Your Seat,"  are being applied way too often on countless unthrilling thrillers, but trust me, they certainly fit the bill for this novel. From beginning to end, this is truly one fun, brutal and beautiful rollercoaster of a novel. All the lead characters are extremely well developed, the pacing is sheer perfection, and the story is sensational and utterly believable throughout. This book is one of those rare gems of fiction that will force the reader to believe that it's a work of non-fiction. Mr. McCammon has the rarest of talents to capture heart pounding intensity and set a mood and atmosphere so well, you will "melt" into the story. If you are tired of all the lackluster thrillers that are saturating the market currently, seek out "Mine" and get reminded of how this genre should be done. Robert R. McCammon is a master, and this novel is just one of his many masterpieces.
