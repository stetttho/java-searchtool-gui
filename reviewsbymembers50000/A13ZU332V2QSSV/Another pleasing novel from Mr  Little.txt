 The Summoning is the 5th novel from Bentley Little that I have read, and thus far, is my favorite. While reading his novels, I am constantly reminded of certain events from other horror writer's works, but strangely enough, in this case, it's a good thing. As for originality, his strength there lies in his ability to shock the reader. Mr. Little can shock the most jaded horror reader, myself included, and this is a most welcomed gift. Occasionally, he will get a little farfetched and a supposed shock is mostly silly and vastly unbelievable, but this is a seldom occurance and most of his intended shocks do just that, and when you least expect them. I personally believe The Summoning has the better character developement of the 5 novels I have read, as I truly responded to and cared for each of the main characters. The over-all story was intriguing, but like I said earlier, it reminded me of several novels I have read before, with all the best bits and pieces combined to create this story. The Oriental angle was a breath of fresh air. Regardless of a few minor drawbacks, Mr. Little's novels are certainly enjoyable to read and one gets their money's worth.
