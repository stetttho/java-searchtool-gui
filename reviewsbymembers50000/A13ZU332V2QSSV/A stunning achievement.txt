 Ms. Loveless doesn't offer us this CD as an hommage to old school country or traditional bluegrass and gospel, rather, she presents us with this wonderful album as if it's the only music known to mankind, and she sings it from the bottom of her soul ! A superb mix of the above mentioned genres, without a misstep on the entire CD. It has been a long, long while since I have enjoyed every single song on a country album, but this one cured that problem. The more I listen to it, the better it gets. Like I stated, every song is great, but, beginning with song ten and ending with song 14, Patty offers us a suite of music that is truly some of the most beautiful and haunting songs ever captured. Her remake of her own song, Sounds of Loneliness, will give you goosebumps, as will, You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive. Where is all the promotion for this stunning collection of songs ? I happened to see a review in Spin Magazine (of all places !) and they gave it 9 out of 10, which is an impressive feat. If this glorious album doesn't win best country album of the year, then I will lose what little faith I have left in this dreadful countrypolitan scene. This is THE album Patty has hinted at on her previous ten albums and it's truly the jewel in her crown. My hat is off and I take a deep bow to Ms. Loveless for a job extremely well done. If this album isn't in your country collection, then it should be !
