 This novel appears to be one of those cheap, formulatic horror novels that are a "dime a dozen," but, as I discovered, it was anything but. The basic story itself is a little familiar, being: man against an evil, centuries old species that comes out of hiding for survival purposes, but, the author tells this somewhat familiar tale in such an exceptional and very intelligent manner, that the reader will forgive any feelings of deja vu. Douglas D. Hawk is an obviously intelligent man whom appears to have done his homework concerning his chosen craft.  His characters are well developed, his settings are well crafted, and he has a great sense of humor that never sinks to silliness. This novel moved at a brisk pace throughout, keeping the reader's full attention. An avid reader can see the outcome a mile away, but, once again, the author does an admiral job of putting a "freshness" to an often told tale, thus, the ending remains pleasant and satisfying. I would recommend this novel to all horror lovers in general.
