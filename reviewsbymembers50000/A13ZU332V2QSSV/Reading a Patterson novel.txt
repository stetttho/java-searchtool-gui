 ..is the equivalent of watching one of those endless supply of "teen slasher flicks." Formulatic, aimed at a particular audience, and the reader gets the impression that the author is cranking out this drivel solely for the money. That Mr. Patterson is a hugely popular author and having back to back #1 bestsellers, is more of a mystery and thriller than anything he will probably ever write. "1st to Die" is my third and final novel I will read from him. After finishing, I realized he basically writes the same novel repeatedly, but, making a few necessary changes as not to plagerize himself. He stretched his imagination as far as it would go this time around....the lead character was a female ! Why didn't he just call her Alex Cross ?....that name would certainly apply in this ultra tired story. My overall summary is, if you've read any of his books, then you've already read "1st to Die." Simply imagine Alex Cross as a female, and, of course, you already know the story.  YAWN .
