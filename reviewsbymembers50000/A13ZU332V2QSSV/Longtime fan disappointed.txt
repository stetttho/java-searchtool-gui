 When one really admires an artist's work, it's easy to overpraise their weaker efforts due to that great admiration and respect. I am indeed a great fan of Ms. Williams, but I just can not make myself enjoy nor admire her latest release, "Essence." My first response after hearing it was to think it was lackluster, rushed and (dare I say it) boring. There wasn't any of the rawness, simple but brutal honesty, playfulness or snappiness that I've come to expect from a Williams album. Believe me, I've given this CD many spins trying to force myself to like it, but it just won't happen. It remains boring and subpar. I will admit that the title track is a slow-burning, sensual effort, but, it stands out mainly because it is surrounded by many hollow and disappointing songs. When I first heard that Williams was releasing a very personal and introspective album, I was happy and imagined an instant classic, but alas, all I got was a huge bucket of lackluster. I really can't complain too much as her last three efforts were spectacular and will certainly hold me until her next release, which I'm sure will be back on track.
