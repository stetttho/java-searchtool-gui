 ...that a novel about WWII, Nazis, spys and werewolves could have been written ? Not only did McCammon write it, he did so brilliantly. When I read the subject matter of this novel, I was skeptical, even though being a huge McCammon fan. Well, when I finally got around to reading it, to say I was impressed just wouldn't cover it. I was floored. Folks, this is an extremely intriguing story that is fast paced, well thought out and written with that exceptional flair and style that McCammon is so gifted with. A thought provoking fictional tale that blends in non-fictional events with beautiful harmony. This novel will stir every emotion in your senses while constantly keeping your pulse rate pounding. If you are seeking an intelligent and thoroughly satisfying thriller to read, then search no further...just read "The Wolf's Hour."  It will have you howling at the moon in it's praise.
