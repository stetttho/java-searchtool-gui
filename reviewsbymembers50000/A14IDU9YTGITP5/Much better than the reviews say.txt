 I expected the photos to be hard to discern, as it was stated by other reviewers.  As a Master Electrician, I found that this is not the case.  Apparently, the photos are not for amateurs, since it requires someone who has actually seen such wiring "in the flesh" to really understand them. No other book deals with old wiring so well.  The subject is too often neglected by the industry.   The author wisely recommends consulting an experienced electrician.  Unfortunately, too many young ones do not understand old wiring and many old ones are up to date with the current electric code.
