 Although set in the environment of a war movie, this screenplay is more appropriately a psycholigical study of how government really works.  Unfortunately, there are fewer in government like Colonel Dax.  Politicians are more apt to protect their own skins at the expense of their ethics and the welfare of the citizenary.  As a retired Federal employee and analyst with 33 years of experience in Washington, DC, I consider myself well qualifed to comment.  Unfortunately, politicians are more interested in protecting their own position than the welfare of the public.  If the public benefits, that is considered "extra."  The novel and the movie could have easily been set in the White House and the current situation in Iraq.
