 I bought this dvd player, because it is one of the first ones that will play dvd-ram disc's that have been recorded on my Panasonic dvd recorder.  I really like the remote on the dvd recorder.  The remote on this dvd player is just as good.  I bought this player to replace tow cheaper players.  The first was a Daewoo, and the second was a CyberHome.  Both of the remoted on these were hard to use.  All of the buttons on the CyberHome dvd player's remote were small, marked with small print and looked alike.  From now on, I'd cleck out the remote, before I bought any other device using a remote control.  As a satellite TV and home theater installer, I have experience with thousands of remotes, and I can navigate amost all of them with ease.  But for long term use, I prefer one that is easy to use.
