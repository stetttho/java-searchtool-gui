 I bought this saw 22 years ago and have used it since. I am a professional electrician and use a circular saw from time to time on the job for wood braces and supports. The saw has never been serviced or repaired. Some 7 years ago, I bought a Freud carbide blade from Home Depot. That's all I've done to it, and it keeps on going and going.  When it no longer works, I'll get another. But, at the rate that it last and last, who knows when that will be.
