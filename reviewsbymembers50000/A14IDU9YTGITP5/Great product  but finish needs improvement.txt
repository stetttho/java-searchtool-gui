 Overall, a very well designed and functional product.  Too bad that the edges and corners of the aluminum sheet components had to be deburred, and the corners had to be rounded.  If not done, the edges could cut your hands and the corners could tear your clothes or upholstery in your wehicle.  Seems like fewer and fewer manufacturers are likely to completely finish their products anymore.  I guess hand finishing is too expensive.  That's why manufacturers are going overseas for cheap labor and hand finishing.
