 I compared this Panasonic screwdriver with the Milwaukee 2.4 volt 6547-22.  It's basically the same screwdriver.  The Milwaukee is also made in Japan.  With the Milwaukee, you get two batteries, a fitted case, and three bits, including a 1/4" socket adapter and drill bits. It even comes with a 1/4" Jacobs chuck that fits the driver's 1/4" hex socket.  The Milwaukee has a five (5) year warranty on everything except the batteries.  The batteries are warrantied for one year.  Eveyything is true from the other reviews on this tool and especially the Milwaukee.  Further, the red body of the Milwaukee is less likely to get lost than the black Panasonic at the work site.
