 I own both this drill and the earlier similar and slightly larger model, the 6213.  I have three single speed Makita cordless drills and have owned them for 25 years.  I will no longer buy another.  The clutches failed on both the 6227 and the 6213 within weeks.  The drill motors just keep spinning, and the chuck does not move. The three single speed drills continue to function flawlessly.  Thank goodness I can use my 12 volt batteries in one of them and in my impact tool. I have just purchased replacement drills from the new Ridgid line at Home Depot.  These have a three year warranty and a Lifetime Warranty, if purchased before December 31, 2003.
