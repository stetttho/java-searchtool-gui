 I've been using these for years in the satellite tv, alarm, and the electrical industry.  The 18" length is just ideal for drilling from outer walls into the interior, through top and bottom wall plate studs into walls.  These are fast drilling and long lasting.  I have them in 1/4, 5/16, 3/8 and 1/2" diameters.  The 5/8's will be ideal for standard sheathed cable. Just ordered two more.
