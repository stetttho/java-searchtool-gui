 I once thought that when you bought a square and took it home, it was square.  I just got this square today, and I am surprised with its quality and accuracy.  I used it to check carpenter's squares, tri-squares, carpenter's speed squares and a precision Starrett branded machinest's square.  Each was off up to .010" except the Starrett, which came in a close second this one.  Not bad for the Starrett, since it is over 30 years old and has been dropped many times on a concrete floor. The INCRA is better than the Starrett, since the Starrett is rusted and pitted from years of sitting around in the garage shop.  I know that this is one of the best squares I've ever own and will own.  My next purchase will the one with the 45 degree angle.
