 Evidently, TiVo got Humax (a Korean company) started in introducing their TiVo by manufacturing them first on the same assembly line.  These are marked "Made in Mexico."    On a receint visit to Circuit City, I saw four boxed examples of this TiVo on the shelf.  Two were marked "Made in Mexico" and two were marked, "Made in China."  All of the displays were marked "Made in Mexico."  The one that I received directly from TiVo is marked "Made in Mexico."  It appears to be of the same exact quality as the TiVo branded machine that I have owned for over one year.  Except for the face plate, color of the case and a the color of the screen backgrounds and the inclusion of Humax on a few of the displays, it is nearly identical to the TiVo branded unit.  I don't know if the ones marked "Made in China" are of the same quality or if they will continue making them on the regular TiVo plant in Mexico.  But, be aware that there are two versions with different UPC codes.
