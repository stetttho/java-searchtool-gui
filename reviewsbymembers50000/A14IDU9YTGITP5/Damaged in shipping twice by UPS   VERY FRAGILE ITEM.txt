 I have been very disappointed with this product.  It was delivered twice by UPS damaged.  The factory packaging was very poor.  The ladder appears to be a good idea, but it does not meet up to the standards of other Little Giant Products that I have owned.  I have always highly rated Little Giant Ladders and prefer to use them over any other product. The first was crushed at the top.  The second was bent at the steps reinforcement bars.  Amazon.com will not ship a third and refunded my money.  If this item is so fragile in shipment, I doubt that it would be durable in everyday use.
