 I got this for my wife, who had asked for a place to keep recipes.  This is a great storage solution, because it allows so many different formats:  clippings, printouts, the included cards and full-page recipe sheets, anything.  I'm not a huge fan of the cover; I would have liked the book even better with less ornate stuff on the cover.  But it's the kind of thing one can excuse, given the high quality of the overall product.  It's much more useful than competing products, as far as I can tell.
