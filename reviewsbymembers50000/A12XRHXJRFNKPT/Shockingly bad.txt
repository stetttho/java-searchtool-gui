 I must have seen some kind of "director's cut" of Gladiator; that's the only way that I can explain the fact that everyone seems to like, or at least to tolerate, this complete waste of film stock. I've rarely seen a movie with a real budget that was more poorly written.  Every line made me wince.  And the historical inaccuracies are so widespread that it's really not possible to talk in any meaningful sense about this movie being a tale of ancient Rome. You'll probably like it, though -- everyone else seems to.
