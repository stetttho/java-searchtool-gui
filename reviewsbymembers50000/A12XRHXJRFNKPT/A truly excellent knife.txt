 This knife is made of lots of good, hard steel. I've had one for the last -- let's see, how long...?  10 years.  And I could easily have it for another fifty; unless you're a professional chef, you're unlikely to use up  the blade in a lifetime of sharpening.  Ultimately, when you choose a  Henckels knife, you need to hold them, because they make three handle  styles, all of which are combined with those terrific blades.  They are  stainless, so they don't hold an edge as well as the old-school carbon  steel, but they also avoid rust that way. You can't go wrong with this  knife.
