 For a few months, I bemoaned the fact that nobody was taking the obvious step of giving users both cordless flexibility and optical precision. Logitech was the first to pull it all together, and they've done a really good job.  The mouse is comfortable in the hand, with nice curves and reassuring heft.  It feels solid in every aspect:  The firm, springy response of the buttons matches nicely with the unusually--and pleasantly--resistant feel of the scrolling wheel. I can't think of anything I'd change to improve on this mouse.  The weight, the solidity, and the free movement all combine to make a mouse that just feels right.
