 I have to admit, I was taken aback by just how closely Dimitri follows the  old-fashioned disco sound.  When people say disco these days, as often as  not, they mean some form of disco-influenced dance music.  Here, they mean  disco. That's not necessarily bad (some might disagree, but ignore them).   But if you're going to go really old school, make sure that you keep  changing the dynamics and that you avoid clashing melodies.  I don't think  Dimitri does a very good job of either on this CD.
