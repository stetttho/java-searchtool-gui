 If this were a single disk--Derrick's--this would be a 5.  DC does his typical banging house, mixed to the point where it dances on the edge of cacophony.  And it's great, particularly the remix of 'Bushes,' which is one of the best pieces of house music around. Luke's disk isn't as virtuosically mixed, but it's solid.  If I heard him at a club, I would have thought highly of his mixing skills.  But the tunes are way deeper than I like 'em.  By song 4 or 5, I'm always reaching for the Eject button, because I have to switch to something with a little more oomph before I drown in the murkiness. Worthwhile, still, especially because Classic puts out singles that blow away most of the ... that I have to flip through in the bins at local record stores.
