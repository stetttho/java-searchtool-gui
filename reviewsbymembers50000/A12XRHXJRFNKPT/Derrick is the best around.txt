 With Derrick Carter's mixes, the boundaries between songs vanish.  The man  mixes two records for a looong time -- one providing the bang, the other  the swing.  Vocals, horns, basslines and pianos flit in and out of the mix,  and unless you own the vinyl yourself, it takes a long time to figure out  where it's all coming from. There are DJs who are a little cleaner than  Derrick (not many), but none who are more inventive and ambitious.  He's  putting together a symphony made out of wacked-out house music. I'd say  the previous reviewer was mistaken: this CD is a pale imitation of bootleg  tapes that are out there.  That being said, chances are good that this will  be the best mix CD you own.   If you aren't impressed with Derrick  Carter, you just don't know house music.  I can't wait for another CD  release so I can enjoy being blown away all over again.
