 This is a good primer on Information Architecture.  But I get the feeling  that these guys decided just to knock off after 150 pages.  That was easier  than contending with the knotty implications of all the conflicting  structural imperatives that IAs deal with day in and day out. Given that  the authors work at nothing but Information Architecture, I sincerely hope  that they have a far greater depth of knowledge than this book conveys.    Mostly, the message that rings through this brochure is: "Principle  x is highly valuable sometimes, but it all depends on how it interacts with  principles y and z, and you'll just have to figure out what's the most  important as you go along."   Well, duh.  Those compromises between  design principles are the hard part of the job, and the authors don't  provide a solid practical or theoretical framework for working through the  compromise process.
