 The ONLY reason for me to "upgrade" from 4.0 to 5.0 was that Roxio couldn't play nice with the CDDB people, and 5.0 could supposedly talk to the new online songs database. Except it can't.  I can't wait to see whether they'll ever own up to admitting that they've completely misrepresented both 4.0 AND 5.0, and that now NONE of their software has this feature. I can't stress enough that one should not buy this product -- particularly if you have an earlier version.
