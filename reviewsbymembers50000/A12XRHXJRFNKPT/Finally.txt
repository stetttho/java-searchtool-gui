 Finally, a case that really makes the Palm V really useful.  Because the V is so slim, this case lets you maintain one wallet, rather than keeping track of both your organizer and your money (although the wallet is admittedly bulky). My one little pet peeve is that, because the Palm is taller than dollar bills, the money pocket is very deep, making retrieval in the checkout line a little difficult.  If they constrained the depth of the dollar pocket, this product would be ideal.
