 I'm always interested by reviews that like or dislike a mix CD because of the records.  I spin records myself, and I think a good DJ can make any records work within the context of the larger work of art he/she  creates. John Digweed is so smooth, and so tasteful in his composition,  that I don't mind the fact that this CD set is composed entirely of trance  music, which I normally can't stand. I listen to this set frequently,  just to pick up on the subtleties of how Digweed mixes.  And I plan to buy  more of his work, because he's just that good.
