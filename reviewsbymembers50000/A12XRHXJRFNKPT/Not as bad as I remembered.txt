 Any self-respecting Simpsons fan will tell you that the show got off the ground slowly.  It was only in the magnificent third and fourth seasons that we finally started to see the wonderful psychedelic satire that centered around Homer, instead of a cloying family sitcom that worshipped the cowabunga antics of the precious brat Bart. But this set of DVDs cleans up the picture and the sound, and reminds fans that even the first timid season had some uproarious humor. Now I just have to watch them again and again until season two comes out.
