 I got into Mark Farina as a house connoisseur.  I consider him to be one of the very best house DJs out there, and I try to catch his act live whenever possible. I've only heard him play his signature "Mushroom Jazz" a couple of times.  I picked up Volume 3 to get an idea of what he could do with a whole different genre of tunes. It's flat out stunning.  I'm a DJ myself, and I couldn't even *notice* many of the mixes.  With a few others I could notice that they had happened, but couldn't pinpoint the beginning or the end.  And with a very small few I could tell exactly what was happening; in these few cases, it occurred to me that it's amazing he was able to fit those two songs together at all, much less make it sound good (which he did).  He's in a whole different realm of smooth, one most DJs can only dream of reaching. Not only have I never heard these downtempo, jazzy tracks mixed better than this before; I have trouble believing that they *could*be mixed any better. Buy it.  Period.
