 This CD covers a lot of ground.  It goes from sped-up Jungle brothers  through a whole lot of Skint label sort of stuff, some more traditional  breakbeat/bigbeat, some heeeavy acid... it's very eclectic, and fun to  listen to. The mixing strikes me as being a little bit awkward.  The  records are always well synced up and more or less in tune, but the  transitions are both predictable and noticeably abrupt.  Before hearing the  CD all the way through, I had already developed a pretty good sense of when  I would be hearing the next record come into the mix. Buy it anyway.   This album is a lot of fun.
