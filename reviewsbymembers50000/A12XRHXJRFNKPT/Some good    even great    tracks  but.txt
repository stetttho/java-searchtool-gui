 I kept reading things that said, basically, Carl Cox is the greatest techno DJ in the world.  So I had to buy this album. I just don't see where the acclaim comes from.  The guy throws down some fat wax, for sure  (at least on disc one). But the transitions from track to track are pretty  consistently ragged.  If I were a club owner, and some kid off the streets  gave me this as a demo disk, I doubt he'd get the gig, because the beat  matching just doesn't cut it; the mixes consistently strain to stay in  sync. If this were a live set, I could understand.  But the liner notes  say that he cooked the FACT 2 collection up in a studio.  I just can't  imagine putting out a CD that isn't perfect if you're not trying to record  a live set.  And it ain't perfect. If somebody told you that Carl Cox is  the best techno DJ in the world, and you're looking for evidence, look  elsewhere.
