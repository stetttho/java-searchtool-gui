 I've been a fan of Mark Farina's spinning for a while now.  When I got this disk, it sounded oddly disjointed to me at first -- he tweaks the EQ in all sorts of unexpected places. As I listened to it a few more times,  I began to realize that the disjunctures I was hearing had nothing to do  with the transitions between songs.  Instead, he was breaking up the songs'  own internal continuity so that his blends of records took on their own  full personality; the parts of the record that sound smooth are, in fact,  the mixes.   The mix between "Glasgow Jazz" and "C'mon  Clap Your Hands" goes on for upwards of two minutes, and  "Glasgow" only plays by itself for about eight seconds. Right at  the end of the mix, he drops the bottom out almost completely, and comes  out into a bridge in "Clap Your Hands."  The first eight or ten  times I heard the CD, I thought I was listening to one track, with a kind  of weak, EQ-tweaking mix into the next track.  When I finally sorted it all  out, I realized I'd been had.  It's one of the best transitions I've ever  heard -- and I've heard a lot.  Anyone who wants to steal some house  technique should buy this CD for that mix alone. And that's one of about  ten mixes on the CD that will drop your jaw to the floor -- once you've  actually listened to it enough times to realize the magic act that Farina  is putting on.  You'll just shake your head and say "Huh?" until  then. One down side: most songs on the CD play for only a few minutes,  and most of the time they're being mixed with other records.  The one  record that he really lets go (to the tune of about 12 minutes) is record  12, which in my opinion is the weakest of the bunch, and could have stood  to be about 6 minutes shorter. But it's not enough to detract from an  amazing virtuosic show on this disc.
