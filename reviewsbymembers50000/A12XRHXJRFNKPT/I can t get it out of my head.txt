 I was really awed by McCarthy's descriptive style when I read Blood Meridian.  But I remained unconvinced of the claims to greatness I had heard from so many others.  Too often, I thought, these characters are just trudging across the Southwestern desert; no matter how beautifully one describes that desert, it starts to get old. But a week after reading this book, I still found myself thinking about the judge.  The judge is one of those characters and/or ideas that you come across in a book that you just can't stop thinking about.  His thoughts on the truth, and the savagery that those thoughts engender, are unforgettable now; they're burned into my thoughts. I'm not willing to go out on a limb, as Harold Bloom does in the Introducation, and put Blood Meridian up there with the very best of Faulkner and Melville, but it is certainly well worth reading two or three times.
