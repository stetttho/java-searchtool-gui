 I thought I was all set to go out and start making a web site. This book set me straight.  Philip Greenspun savages most of the conventional wisdom on designing "Killer Web Sites," and presents a high-speed,  high-reliability minimalist alternative. I tired at times of the  relentless attack on idiocy; junkware must indeed die, but sometimes  Greenspun wastes valuable pages explaining why.  He proselytizes a touch  too much (although I may just think that because in my case he was  preaching to the choir), and does not really show how other DB/server-API  applications could do the same things as his custom-made  solution. Nonetheless, this tome amazes me.  No other technical writing  on Web publishing I've seen (except possibly Lincoln Stein's) has such  clarity.  And no other book even approaches this one with regard to social  awareness, humor, or non-computer ideas. This book by itself will not  enable anyone to build a website like the ones Greenspun describes.  Part  of his point, though, seems to be that anyone promising a publishing  panacea is a snake-oil salesman.  He does, however, present a theoretical  underpinning that will strengthen any future publishing decisions.
