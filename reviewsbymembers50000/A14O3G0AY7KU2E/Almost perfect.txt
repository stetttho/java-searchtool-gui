 I got one of these and absolutely love it. Very lightweight, long-lasting rechargable battery, charged by my USB connection, plenty of room for music, UMS, sleek, easy-to-navigate, very good FM tuner, records MP3s directly, good internal mic for voice recording. Just a couple of minor niggles: 1) it will only record MP3s at up to 128kbs (usually good enough, but not always) and 2) it won't take signals from unpowered external mics (I have a small Sony stereo mic that would be superb with this tiny recorder --- no cord necessary --- but it's an unpowered mic --- iRiver MP3 players can handle it, but this is the better player in all other respects). For standard uses, this is the best MP3 player I've seen.
