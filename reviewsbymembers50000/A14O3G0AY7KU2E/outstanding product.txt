 Thumbdrives are great; have got them for my kids. But if you want to share data with other devices than computers, more generic flash memory (like SD) is preferable. I've got a few SD cards for my PDA, my camcorder, and my laptop (it has a built-in SD drive). The Bonzai allows me to swap cards/files with these devices and other computers (with USB ports), using thumbdrive-like device. Big advantage of Bonzai is you can swap out SD flash memory, using it for multiple cards. Or even if you only used it as a thumbdrive, it has the advantage of being upgradable. I started using it with a 256MB SD card; just got a 1GB 32x SD card and it flies.
