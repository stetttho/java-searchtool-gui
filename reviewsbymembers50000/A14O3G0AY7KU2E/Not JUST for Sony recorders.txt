 Contrary to earlier review, this microphone works GREAT with devices other than Sony; just make sure that your recording device provides plug power. I use this microphone with my iRiver iHP-120 20GB MP3 Jukebox --- records great stereo sound directly into MP3s. Fantastic for recording my kids' concerts. Highly, highly recommended.
