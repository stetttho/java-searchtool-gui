 I was not deterred by the previous reviewers' comments here; they mostly referred to shipping times being poor, not on the quality of the unit itself. The other critique was that it wasn't a full 256MB, which is true, but is also the case with all "256MB" SD cards. Having had good experiences with Viking CF cards, I decided to chance it. Got my card quickly (from another reseller); unfortunately, the card was DOA (defective on arrival). Writing data to the card was extremely slow, and would generate many, MANY write errors when sending it large files. What's the point of getting a 256MB card if you can't write large files to it? So, I returned the Viking card and got a Lexar 256MB SD card instead & it works great. Maybe I just got a rare, defective card, but I'm not brave enough to waste anymore time on it. So, though, I didn't agree with the previous reviewers' reasons for rating this card so low, they did get the ranking right.
