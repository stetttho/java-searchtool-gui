 I wasn't at all sure that a monopod would be an acceptable alternative to a tripod for getting nice, sharp images, especially with a telephoto lens. Have been pleasantly surprised.  I bought the MP-15 to use in circumstances when I didn't want to lug a tripod around; like on day-hikes, etc. Figured the MP-15 could double as a walking stick. It works admirably as a trekking pole; very solid (though heavier than ideal for that purpose). Interestingly, though, I have found that I often leave my digital SLR attached to the monopod and carry it horizontally -- my camera balances the extended monopod. When I see something I want to shoot, I bring the MP-15 to the vertical, quickly adjust the height of the monopod (if necessary), make any last minute camera adjustments and start clicking away. Very fast and convenient. I have also found it very convenient to strap the MP-15 to the crossbar of my bicycle when I'm taking my camera "on the road".  The things I like best about the MP-15 are its 1) solid feel, 2) long extension, 3) ease of quick height and orientation adjustments, 4) quick release shoe, 5) compact transportability, 6) combo metal spike / rubber tip. I agree with other reviewers that foot piece is of no use (I use a rubber band to bind it up). The pan and tilt handle has one problem (though not the one reported before -- it is trivial to lock the handle so that it doesn't interfere with the grip). The problem is that it is too long; it can catch you in the shoulder when you're trying to get your eye up to the camera's viewfinder.  Many features to recommend it, only a couple of minor niggles against it; it's an excellent value. Highly recommended.
