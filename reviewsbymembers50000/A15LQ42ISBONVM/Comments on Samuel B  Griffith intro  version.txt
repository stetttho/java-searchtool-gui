 I won't talk about how good Sun Tzu is, as you probably already know.  Instead, I'll share my opinion on how good this translation is. --------- 1.  Is the translation consistent with the Original? I have not read the entire book in details to assess all the chapters.  However, as the first sample page clearly shown, "Therefore appraise it in terms of the five fundamental factors and make comparisons of the seven elements later named.", the translator has indeed taken some liberty in translating Sun Tzu Art of War.  "xiao zhi yi ji" indeed refers to the seven estimate (ji) later, but nowhere in the original text was "seven" mentioned.  This sounds picky, but from this example you can tell that the tranlation focus more on the meaning rather than maintaining direct translation.  2.  Elegance of the translation?  Sun Tzu is actually a great Chinese literary work, it uses antithesis, rhythm, and other techiques to convey meanings.  As indicated above, this translation focus more on meaning, you do not get a feeling of what the original text is like.  Of course this is not a major problem for most people, as they read Sun Tzu  for the content only.  In sum, it's readable but rather plain. 3.  Format of the book? This version contains some commentary of Chinese scholars, the format goes something like this: several Sun Tzu's sentences-> commentary-> footnotes-> repeat.  That might be helpful to some people, as the scholars expand and help explaining on Sun Tzu's text.  However it's kind of annoying if you just want to read Sun Tzu without the bothersome additional interpretion.  I suggest you to see Amazon.com's sample page to determine whether you like the format or not. -------- Overall, the translation seems to be ok.  I do not agree on all of the interpretation from this book, but there are no major mistakes.
