 Heroes of Might & Magic is still one of the best Turn base strategy games.  I spent hours & hours on it.  Since the original & the expansions are very hard to get, I was glad to get this complete package at such a good price (I had the orignal III, but  couldn't find the expansions anywhere).   Get it if you like turn base games, I promise you that you won't regret it.
