 An astronaut got sucked into anther part of universe,  met aliens and starts looking for home.  It doesn't  sound original, but such classic idea is very appealing  when it's done well.  Farscape certainly exceeded my expectations.  The acting is generally above average.  The special effects  are done well and enhances the show's atmosphere, but never  at the expense of the plot.   This DVD is an good intro for the series, but I gave it  4 stars because it doesn't seem to have subtitles for all  epiodes.  My other complain is that one character just started  to appear (in the 2nd disk?) without introduction, so if you  haven't watched this series before it's kinda weird.  Still, I highly recommand this DVD, like others said- you will  get hooked!
