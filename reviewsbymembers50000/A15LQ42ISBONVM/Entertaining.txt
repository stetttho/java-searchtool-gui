 If you like Robert Jordon's Wheel of Time, you'd probably like this book too (Same premis of boy hero battles great evil, but more conventional in many ways).  I don't recommand the entire series, but the first book is worth buying (I feel everything gets worse after book 1...) Good: -Classic appeal.   As mentioned above, you would know the premise instantly.  The familarity has an odd appeal.  You know, the prophecy, the old wizard, the hero & the girl, and the evil dude. -Some interesting variation Seeker of truth, confessor... etc are interesting. -Ending Yes, there is actually an ending.  Although it leaves opening for a new book, it's not like other annoying book where you must buy another one to find out what happens (I hate that).  The main conflict will be resolved at the end. Bad: -not-so-great writing Don't expect excellent prose or anything like that. -cliche while classic stuff is good, sometimes Goodkind uses them without  significant change... that's BAD.
