 My friend TJ loves Expendable because of the ideas in it... me? I like the book simply because it's a well-written first-person sci-fi novel.  The main character Festina Ramos, the interesting Explorer (All explorers are misfits unwanted by the society, hence "Expendable")... wacky Admiral Chee that cracks me up... and strange transparent alien Oar... all vivid characters that I enjoy reading about. I highly recoomand it.
