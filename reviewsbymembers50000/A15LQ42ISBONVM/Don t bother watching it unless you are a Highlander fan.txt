 I am a big fan of Highlander TV series, and I like Highlander movie one and three.  That didn't help at all, I still think End Game is a bad movie. I can see why this did so bad in the box office.  You need to know the movie and the TV shows very well, or you'll be confused.  I wouldn't mind that if the overall movie is done well just for fans, unforturnately that's not the case.  Relationships underdeveloped, scene of Duncan and Connor's fight too awkward emotionally, and the plot is not solid enough. Despite that, there are still three reasons to watch this DVD- Cool action scenes (great sword fights), Connor & Duncan together (yeah!), and the extra features & earlier cut of the movie.
