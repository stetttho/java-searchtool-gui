 It's not the violence nor other potentially controversial issues themselves that are enjoyable, it's how these things enrich the character/plot that makes this series great.   I just love the characters in Berserk, even though the plot isn't exceptional.  This is far more dramatic and enjoyable than the Record of Lodoss War anime (although they do suffer the`same problem of using too much still images).  In short, I recommand this to anyone who doesn't mind the R-rated materials.  The DVD extra on dubbing is funny, but none of the features adds to the anime itself.
