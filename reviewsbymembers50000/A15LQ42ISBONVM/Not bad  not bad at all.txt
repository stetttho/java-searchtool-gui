 I just got the game today.  I have been a fan of the Series since HMM one.  If you played previous ones before, you know what you will get in essence.   If you want to know the difference between this one & the old ones...  -Well, the graphic is a lot better, the creator once again did an excellent job.  I am impressed. -You get the same problem as the old Heroes III- Long loading time if you don't have a new computer. -Heroes could be used in combat.  COOL idea. -The stats, magic, & heroes leveling has more depth... but it makes the whole system more complex.  In other words, a bit more interesting, but you lose the simple elegance of the old Heroes.  If you have been a Heroes fan, buy it.  If you are new to the Series, I suggest you try Heroes III complete first.
