 I read all these reviews that said this book is wonderful.  This sounds to be such an interesting mystery book with non stereotyped strong female character and my favorite first-person narrative.  So I bought it.   Well, I was disappointed. The main character is indeed sort of interesting, but the book is too slow for my taste.  After the author mentioned the murder at Prolog, nothing really occur for a long time.  Perhaps some people will enjoy reading about the interaction between characters in DETAIL, but for me, a 240-page mystery novel that doesn't present main conflict until page 110 cannot be qualified as an engaging mystery story.  I understand there is a need to set everything up... but half of the book?  All I can say is that  I am selling this novel to the local used bookstore. The book description is too misleading.  If you want to read good, fast-paced mystery, skip this book (I recommand Janet Evanovich's "One for the Money" instead). ...
