 You know there is something wrong with the movie, when you came back from restroom and ask "what did I miss?" and your friend tell you "nothing". The idea that two persons met by accident and the girl let the fate decide what happens next is very interesting, but the execution of the movie is just not up to standard.  This 91-min. movie is too slow, the time spent on transistion is meaningless, and the inital scene between the main characters are too short. I give it one star for the idea, another one for the delete scenes (which shows what movie could have been, makes you wonder why director cut some of them), and another one for the occasional romantic atmosphere it creates.
