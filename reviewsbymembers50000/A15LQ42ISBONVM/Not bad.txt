 For a general audience, this is a very good book about USAF's major hardware/platforms between Vietnam and the 1991 Gulf War.  Author's selections indeed serve as good explanation of USAF's success in the modern time.  The writing style is concise and clear.  In addition, the book describes basic project history and discusses the performance in a meaningful context.   However, if you have studied air power for a while, this book doesn't add any new insights.  In other words, if you are one of those people who buy periodicals like "International Air Power Journal" regularly and have books such as "Storm over Iraq" and "ransformation of American Air Power" on your bookshelf, you are better off spending the money elsewhere - there isn't really any "shocking frankness" or special revelations for air enthusiasts.
