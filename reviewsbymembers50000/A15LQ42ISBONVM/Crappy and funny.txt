 This is not so good - whether it's technical or plot aspects.  By technical I do not mean the somewhat entertaining special effects, I mean that if you like military aviations at all you will find the details absurd - for an example, who in the right mind wouldn't use stealth combined with beyond visual range missiles at all, and choose to dogfight with the Russian Flankers the first chance you get (I know dogfight are more fun to watch, but couldn't the director at least show the attempt for BVR engagement first then dogfight)?  This list of complains could go on and on.  Of course if it's only technical inaccuracies, then it doesn't matter that much because most people won't understand the differences anyway.  I don't expect popcorn movies to be masterpieces, however not even the hot actor/actress could save the movie from cliche plot and horrible dialogues.  I laughed so hard during many scenes because I couldn't believe the director and writer decided to proceed with the same old stuff that were used to death already.  I typically could not guess plot twists, but in this movie I spotted what's going to happen long before it occurs on the screen.  In addition, many of the good parts are already shown in the preview.  In sum, I think if you have really really low expectations and only watch this for special effects, you might get something out of it.  Otherwise I don't recommend this in general, 2.5 stars.
