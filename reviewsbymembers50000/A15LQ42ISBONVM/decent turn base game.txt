 pro: -Interesting pictures.  Those demons, undeads, dwarfs etc... are just cool! -Plenty to play.  You can play quest or saga, choose 4 different races and 3 types of lord (Warrior, Mage, or Guildmaster) -Not a bad turn-base game.  You know there aren't many good turn based games (I am sure you can count them all with your fingers: Heroes, Fallout...), Disciples is not bad.  It's somewhat similar to Heroes of Might and Magic, but it offers enough fresh stuff to make it worth playing.Inexpensive for a cool game.  Is a great deal. con: -Graphics not great.  This is a 2D game, although there are some nice pictures, the interface is too small and graphics aren't very good compare to today's standards. -Not easy to learn.  If you have played Heroes of Might and Magic perhaps it's not as bad.  However the manual is  so bad that it won't be easy for anyone.  I don't know whether this only apply to Gold Edition or not... The 15 pages of nothing is just NOT acceptable. -Interesting but lacks depth.  This game certainly cannot compete with Heroes of Might and magic.  Row combat just doesn't offer that much variety. ------ In sum, it's worth buying, but don't get too excited about it.  It's an entertaining but not groundbreaking game.
