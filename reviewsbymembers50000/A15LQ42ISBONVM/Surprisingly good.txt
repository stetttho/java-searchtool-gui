 Since the main character is from "Hercules", I had my doubts.  I picked it up anyway, because Gene Roddenberry's name is on it.  I am glad I did. The show does have some weakness- 1. Special effects are always interesting, but look fake sometimes 2. The premise seems to be a little bit shaky: why would those crew decided to join the idealist Captain? They are obviously not the noble type. Despite those two flaws, it's still worth watching.  The concept is original (in the sense that the variation of classical theme done well), the story is good (I think "double helix", the last episode of Vol 1. is the best so far), acting is adequate.  In sum, the series has a promising start.  It's certainly not Farscape or Star Trek, but you'll enjoy Andromeda if you like this type of sci-fi shows.  As for DVD itself:  Good- Many special features (alternative takes were interesting). Good picture quality Bad- No subtitles...
