 This excellent book focus on explaining the flanker variants, particularly Su-30 and later ones.  It's one of the most up-to-date books on Su-27, with many interesting pictures (such as Flanker's cockpit display when it dropped bombs, production line pictures, different variant prototypes in flight... etc).  It's a must have for readers interested in Russian military aviation.
