 Two words- TOO SHORT. I sat there for fourty minutes, waiting for the build up that never came.  It just left me hanging, my first thought was "That's it?  It's over?" Tha main character is almost likable... almost.  There is no drama, only short action scenes that looked cool but you don't care about.  The plot line is weak, settings are irrelevant and have no effects on the story whatsoever.   When you missed 1. Character-driven story 2. Pure entertainment 3. Great plots, what do you have left? Nothing of course, just some pretty pictures.  Perhaps if it was longer, they could make it work. I decided to give it a try because the DVD mentioned "Ghost In The Shell".  Well, big mistake, this didn't even come close to the level of GITS.  In sum, I don't recommand it.
