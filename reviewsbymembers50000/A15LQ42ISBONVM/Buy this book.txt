 To be honest, I am not a big mystery novel fan...  It's probably because I had bad luck- I kept picking up lame cliche mystery novels that are predictable and, so I lost interest in this genre.   This is the book that got me back. Harlan Coben has done a great job, I can see why this novel won some awards: the character is lovable and the hard-to-guess plots.  Go buy this book, you won't be disappointed.
