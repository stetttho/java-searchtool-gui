 This album is definately the greatest hits of opera compilation - even those not familiar with opera will find they know a good portion of the pieces. The sound quality is really good and overall I feel like this is a  moving and impressive CD. Sure your cool opera friends won't let on they  like it,  because it's a lot less cooth than owning all of the full operas,  but I have a lot of fun listening to this. A great starter disc for anyone  looking to get into opera, or a general great addition to any collection.
