 Ok, I heard MTV and Yoga in the same sentence and I thought "oxymoron". I really had the lowest of low expectations, assuming that the poses would be wrongly named, poorly executed, etc. I thought the use of Lori Trespicio from The Real World NYC as a "host" would be eye-roll worthy. The promise of background music from a great DJ (he did the soundtrack for the movie "Go") actually was off-putting in this setting. I was surprised on all counts. I've been involved with yoga for years and the poses were named correctly and executed properly, the instruction was clear and easy to follow. Lori was really in the background and didn't speak throughout the whole thing (she was just used as an example of a beginner) so her presence was absolutely unnecessary and a weird selling point. The instructor, Kristin, turned me off at first because her mention that this wouldn't be like the yoga most people think of with it's "hokey new age music" put the fear into me (I like the meditative music the yoga schools I have been in use). I actually found the soundtrack pleasantly inconspicuous (and loved that it can be turned off so all you hear is the instructor- I can put on my own background music, yay!) The poses were poses I have done in school before and I liked their explanations of important points. Honestly, Kristin was as good as some yoga instructors I have had. This is a very good tape as long as you can fit a mat in your room. I am almost shocked.  Be forewarned that you need a yoga mat before beginning this. I also think final relaxation needs to be longer, and is best done with something like a cooling mint/lavender eye bag, so you might consider lowering the lights and pausing/stopping the video when it gets to final relaxation. Also, even the beginning steps might be a bit rugged if you're really out of shape and you can skip some steps until you get stronger.
