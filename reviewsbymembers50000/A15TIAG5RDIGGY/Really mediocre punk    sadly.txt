 I've always been absolutely amazed by Rancid's work- they so far surpassed their peers it was unreal. This album, unfortunately, is a blip on their record. There's absolutely nothing on here that I'll ever remember, just fast growly speed-punk with no tune. Since Rancid are such great songwriters it seems as though perhaps they deliberately tried to write a collection of anti-songs this time around. I'm not really sure what that's about, whether they became self-conscious about their reputation as some folks on here say, or maybe if they just got sick of the old style. I imagine this stuff would be really, really fun to hear live, and to stomp to, but it's really nothing I'd want to sit around and listen to.  The album's design is really self-consciously "Crass" as well... interesting.  Anyway, most disappointing. Can we get back to the real heartfelt yet stomp-a-rific music of albums past? (I personally dug  "And Out Come the Wolves", to give you an impression of my taste. This is nothing like that.)
