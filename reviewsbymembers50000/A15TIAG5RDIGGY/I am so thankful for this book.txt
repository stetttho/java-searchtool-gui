 I had never bought a "for dummies" book before, it seemed like conceding that I was slow at a particular topic... however, I saw all of the good reviews on this one and thought I might give it a shot. All of the other knitting books I read didn't explain things as they need to be explained to a beginner- even if they were meant for a beginner. It seems as though most authors forget how beginners think. This one is just great- friendly, lively tone, well paced, great illustrations. I am just so glad I own this book- it's one of my favorite knitting books I own, and I own a lot of them. I'd recommend this to any beginner as absolutely essential.
