 I have only done 2 out of 3 workouts so far "Energize" and "Tone" so I can't speak to all of this, but I liked the first two. What was odd to me was that the second seemed far easier than the first. I was surprised- I thought I'd be working up a ladder. "Energize" really gives me a workout, and I am in the intermediate range. It's really invigorating with a lot of emphasis on sun salutations with pushups, lunges, warror 1, etc. I'm pretty well worked out after just that portion. (Tone takes it a little easier in this arena). Kest can be a little annoying, and he does man-handle his students (male and female- he seems to take turns- in "Energize" he positions the women, in "Tone" the men get it), but he's thorough and explains clearly. He's also good at reminding students/viewers what the point of yoga is and what they should be focusing on. Yoga in jeans though? Ouch ;> After doing this workout I felt like my body was aligned differently and I stood taller. Recommended! This is one of my weekly staples. I just wish hitting the chapter button skipped past the introductions (I don't need the glamour shots of Bryan every time) rather than skipping between workouts so I didn't always have to fast forward. (p.s. the on-screen class possibly has even more men than women in it, unlike most with their token male member, so I agree with many reviewers that this'd be a good one for a guy who's already fit to try to get into yoga)
