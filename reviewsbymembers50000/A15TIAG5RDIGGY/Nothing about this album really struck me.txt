 Ani's newest album provoked absolutely no reaction in me on first listen. Absolutely nothing. After a second go at it, I almost like the "Reckoning" disc. This album really is 2 different parts rather than merely so much material it had to be on 2 discs. "Revelling" is all uber intrumenty big-band, horns etc. music, much like most of Ani's new stuff. "Reckoning" does have more than just acoustic guitar on it, but it's more reminicent of Ani's older stuff (in my opinion, this is a good thing). I actually think it was a really cool idea to put the two styles on 2 discs and do a double album of that. I find myself listening to Reckoning and not to Reveling, because I originally got into Ani due to way her older stuff sounded, and actually don't like the more jazzy horn-oriented stuff. Still, neither disc really has anything that makes me want to sing along or tap my foot or read the lyrics and try to sell the album to friends. Some of Reckoning reminds me of being in a martini lounge- when the guitar kicks out and the vocals are just over piano... There's some stuff with the horns and some extremely annoying choruses, on Revelling, that I outright dislike. I made the mistake of listening to Reveling first and almost rushed to resell the album. The packaging and art on these discs is great. Very beautiful set and a visual treasure for your collection. That is, if you buy it. I'd recommend downloading some mp3s of it or burning a copy of the disc from a friend. Not really something you need to own.
