 Beginners is definitely a misnomer here, unless it's just referring to an introduction to ashtanga. I am an intermediate yoga practitioner and I wouldn't wish this video on a yoga newbie. While you can turn on a pose explaination track, no modifications are shown on the main track. The instructor honestly seemed bored; her voice was about as excitement filled as Ben Stein's in Ferris Bueller. You know... "Bueller? Bueller?" The pacing of this is so slow I wanted to start counting sheep, but it manages to not feel relaxing at all. The sequencing seemed uninspired, and I grew quickly bored.
