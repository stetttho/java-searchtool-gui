 It shouldn't surprise me that people who weren't fans of Jhonen Vasquez's work before this animated venture have seen it. After all, it stands on it's own. I'd be able to spot this as Vasquez's work in a heartbeat though- it's got the same coloring he prefers to use (blacks, purples, greens), and the very distinctive animation style (oddly cute characters). One of the things I have always loved about his cartoons (animated and still) is his gift for the absolutely absurd. The lines in this are infinitely quotable- and the voice actors are great- especially Gir's- "I'm naked! Naked naked naked!" "I love this show!" While the subtitles on this disc are useless, they did make me laugh- I mean all DVDs have to have a subtitle feature, right? Ha, as I'm typing this I am rehashing all of my favorite moments, lines, images- etc. I love when Gir leaves his navigation chip at home to make room for his cupcake, and his fuel to make room for tuna. I love the head pigeons and that when the electronic house gets built the first thing that appears is a couch. Vasquez's characters are always manic as well- alternately shouting and muttering fiendishly. Zim reminded me of an alien Johnnny (if you don't know, check out his comic series- Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, Squee, and I Feel Sick). The parent-bots actually remind me a lot of the zombie people in Johnny too- but I should stop comparing, this is one of the weirdest and most original cartoons to make it onto a major network- possibly ever. Jhonen Vasquez is a real sly character and while I don't know how Nickelodeon wound up picking this up, I'm glad it did.
