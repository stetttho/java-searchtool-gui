 This is far and away one of the best autobiographies I have ever read. It's clearly written, engaging, and fascinating. Really gives you a ton of perspective on the man and his ideas, how brilliant he really was. He details the paths he took the choices he made, and offers a million anecdotes about patients and how they led to his theories. Important to anyone who enjoys religious studies, psych (duh), anthropology, and history. Just wow. I loved it.
