 This book is great if you're looking to figure out whether your shih tzu is showable and can participate in competitions. Other than that, there are far more helpful books out there in terms of puppy care, how to work with and train a shih tzu, etc. I didn't learn anything from this book since I don't intend to show my dog. There isn't anything else in this book that is unique or particularly well done. If you do want to show your furry friend... this might be for you
