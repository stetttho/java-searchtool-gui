 I got this as a wedding present from friends who knew how stressed out I was/am. I honestly thought it'd be terrible- I am just really dubious about such products. I took out an inflatable soft head pillow, a strap to attach it onto a chair (my desk chair! I thought- the pictures showed a car seat but I share my car so I decided to mount it to my desk chair). Well, I use it there and I use it on the couch to massage my neck and back. It feels soooooo good. I mostly sit upright with it and start from the top of my back, working down. You can adjust how far apart the little rotating knobs are and what direction they go in. After a little tweaking anyone could get a good massage out of this. Really impressive, even though it's a little creepy to watch the "hands in a bag" do their work. I highly recommend this as a pampering tool, relaxation device, stress reducer, etc. Only thing- it said not to massage before bed because the massage would be stimulating and keep me up- no way, one massage from this thing and I am ready to have a nice nap :)
