 Ok, Kirby is just about the best thing I've ever seen. He's cute and pink and he inhales his enemies. The best part is that when he inhales them he can swallow and become them.  This is just an amazingly cute and fun game. I love the Mario series for it's cute, dreamlike worlds. This has that, plus an arguably more fun hero.  I could continue raving here.
