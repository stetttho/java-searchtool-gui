 This did read more like a legerbook of facts and names than a memoir- I think Mrs. Consuelo Vanderbilt Balsan was being particularly deliberate about the way this was structured. It was almost like a series of notes to herself- 1945, specific house, x and y were there. x was charming. I wonder if this is just how memoirs have changed- enh, but then again, I have read some much older memoirs that were more personal. Balsan did put a lot of herself into this, and her opinions were present, contrary to what others asserted in their reviews. The reader definitely gets an impression of her, however, we're only let so far in. I guess this kind of reads like the social column of a newspaper... 300+ pages of it. I have read a lot of contempory memoirs and they very much describe daily events, how they were, what they felt. Somehow this is different. She stops right before giving anything real away, I suppose. She is like so many older women I have known (not quite her contemporaries) who will tell you that something was unpleasant for them, and then won't tell you why or what they did about it, or how it's linked to other events. I don't think it's fair to call her a name-dropper. Her friends did happen to be people who are well known, and one can't write a memoir without talking about one's friends! I don't get the impression that she thought mentioning all of these people by names validated her life, but rather that she expected that's what would interest other people. She was wrong, in my case! I was most drawn in by the early part of the book, when she detailed how much she suffered at the hands of her mother. But she was sparse and careful there too. I admit to being bored reading this, but I learned a lot from it!
