 Actually, I found this to be rather pointed. An MFA student (Evelyn) who reminded me of many pomo chicks I have known, decides to see how completely she can get a guy (Adam) to change for her- from his image to his friends. This was as drastic as it was because he had no idea they didn't have a real relationship and that she was doing everything she was doing in order to document it and then put it on display- but really it was just illustrating the nature of many relationships hyperbolically. The actress made a really good sociopath.. woooo. And c'mon, the guy did look better later- but his "before" photo was like one of those from a magazine makeover where they mess up their hair first and put them against a paste-colored background so Evelyn kinda cheated
