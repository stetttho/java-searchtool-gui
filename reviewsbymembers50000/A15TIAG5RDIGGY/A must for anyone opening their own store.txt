 There was definitely some really useful information in this book, and I learned some really cool things about how stores ought to be laid out. If I were opening up my own store I'd make sure to read this. I think a lot of stores need to be more deliberate about where they place items, info. they want read by consumers, racks, baskets, and chairs. It's all the obvious stuff in here that people just don't seem to think about. My local CVS could take the hint about putting baskets elsewhere in the store besides the very front. As Underhill points out, I don't know whether I'll need a basket until I'm in the middle of the store and have picked out a few things. And I'm more likely to buy more if my arms don't get filled up. I admit to not being able to go into a store now without analyzing it, but this book repeated itself an awful lot. I felt like the whole thing could have been condensed into an article, or might have been more fun if it was presented as a series of case studies. Just my .02.
