 When the DVD loaded and the menu looked a bit cheap, I was worried. I was further worried when the initial screen loaded and because this was filmed in Jamaica they'd decided to open with the obligatory reggae music. I was afraid the music would maintain throughout and be a distraction, but it faded into something softer that I hardly noticed after a few minutes.  The first thing that occured to me was that this was definitely more of an intermediate workout. I could do all of the poses, but was putting a fair amount of energy into it. I was fairly pleased. Modifications were well explained and both of the instructors on this disc were pleasant. The first twenty minutes, focusing on the arms, flew by.  The second 20 minute routine (focusing on "the butt"), which I did in the same session, (20 minutes isn't long enough for me, 40 is a little light but fine) contained the same basic 2-person structure. I felt like some of the poses in this section were redundant, and some literally were repetitions (the table series, for example.)  If the two sessions were more compatible, I'd order a copy of this (I rented it). As it stands, both are nice by themselves, but don't work together unless you're tolerant of redundancy.
