 Thank you, Nintendo! Finally a screen I can actually see! The graphics look amazing. This little pocket sized system is one of the cooler gadgets I've seen in a long time.  I love that it folds up- with the screen folded all the way up it's just like playing the meatier old gameboys. With the screen folded in, it's much smaller and easier to tote around. The rechargable battery is great. The silver looks classy, and I love the game selections.  This is at long last a portable video game system that I actually can use out of the box without buying any adapters or accessories.  I am in love.
