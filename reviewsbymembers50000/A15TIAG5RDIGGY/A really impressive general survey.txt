 I have read about a million books and magazines and articles on the shih tzu as a breed recently (as I just adopted a rescue puppy) and this one was by far the best-the only one worth even mentioning among those I read. It doesn't just cover the general (nebulus) history of the breed or how to show a dog, but really everything about the different stages of the dog's life and how different aspects of training apply to the breed (not just how to crate train, but how to crate train a shih tzu!) I learned some great puppy tips and some new things about shih tzus in particular. Tons of cute photos as well. As I mentioned, I found in my reading that most books/ magazines emphasize how to figure out if your shih tzu is show-able and if then, to start getting it into shows and competitions. This book didn't emphasize that at all, but rather focused on responsible dog care, really knowing what you're getting into by getting a shih tzu puppy, and everything that could possibly come up as a question in the life of the dog. I learned a bunch of techniques and tips as well. The writing style was clear and friendly, the values were apparent, and the tips really work.
