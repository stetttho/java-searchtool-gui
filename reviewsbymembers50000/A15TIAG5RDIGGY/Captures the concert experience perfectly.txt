 The tour was gorgeous and this is a gorgeous CD, very minimalistic, beautiful in it's simplicity. PM's voice resonates on this CD with emotion of a sort that just can't be captured in a studio. I generally dislike live albums- they're nothing but less polished, messy versions of studio with screaming fans interfering. These versions are definately something I'd want to keep in addition to the studio versions. This album has a very "real" feel to it; rather than being a bunch of shows chopped up, it's one show recorded essentially start to finish. The crowd cheering didn't even bother me- it actually added ambience and context. Very good audio quality, though I'd skip the second disc if I were you- it's nothing but end of concert filler. If the point hadn't been to put out a CD of the entire show, Metropolis could have done us all a favor and just made this a 1 CD deal.
