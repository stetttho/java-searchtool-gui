 One of the most wonderful movies I have seen in some time- it covered topics that could have easily been cliched and overly moralistic- it could have been predictable and sappy. It was none of those things. I thought I knew exactly what I would be seeing, and I was wrong. Incidently, this is a film about a great teacher, at a boys prep school, and how he changes the lives of his students, and in one case doesn't. This film becomes more profound the more I reflect on it- it was more real than a movie, than most movies that try to be real even are. I constantly failed in my predictions of where this was going while watching it. This will be among my favorite films I have ever seen. Films than inspired me to live my life differently. And not just because I'm a teacher...
