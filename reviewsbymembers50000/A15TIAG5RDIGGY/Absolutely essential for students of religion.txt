 This book delivers exactly what it promises; I am using it in a course at Brown University and have found it to be a concise, yet thorough introductory guide. I think of this as a good book to use as a springboard into deeper research, or  as a handy guide for looking up quick facts. Hopkins is a clear writer and - don't let the cover turn you off- an engaging one!
