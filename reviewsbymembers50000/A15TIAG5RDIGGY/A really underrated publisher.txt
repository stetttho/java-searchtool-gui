 I got this book as a screener for a class on Adobe Illustrator and I am really impressed. For one, it's not an overwhelming book- it's got beautiful color graphics and spaces out the text very well on the page so it's easy to follow the examples. Plus, there are a whole bunch of really good example files you can download from the publisher's site. The examples here really help you learn the software bit by bit. Nothing about this book is intimidating; it really helps you get into the software without frustration. There are a couple of confusing passages, but that's many less than most books have. Plus, I've never enjoyed all of the black and white books filled with text out there nearly as much as I enjoyed this. Better than the more popular titles, no names mentioned.
