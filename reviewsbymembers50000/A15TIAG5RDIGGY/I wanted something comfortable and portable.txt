 I wanted something comfortable and very portable to use with my iPod. I hate earbuds, so the ones that came with the iPod weren't something I wanted to use. After doing a lot of research I settled on these for their reported combination of comfort, the fact that they fold up, and their sound quality. I haven't been disappointed. I love the way music sounds on these and they're so comfortable- never have I had as comfortable a pair of headphones. I am completely satisfied. I got these over the 100s because well, higher number = higher quality, right? Heh, not sure, but I'd definitely recommend them to anyone I know and in fact did just recommend them as a Christmas present for my sister.
