 This is the kind of book you use if you have time to go through all of the tutorials in order- I use it in a specific Pagemaker class and we go through the Lessons 1 at a time. I wouldn't recommend this as a reference book though- as something to look up specific things and how to do them one at a time. I do have to say, this book is pretty borning, dryly written and doesn't touch on a lot of the more creative ways Pagemaker can be used. A book called Adobe Pagemaker Basics is a good companion to this, with info on color and drawing in Pagemaker. It's hard to sit and read this book straight through and not want to eat your head. You'd need a lot of discipline and motivation to get through this outside of a class. Rather than being a classroom in a book I'd call this a "book for a classroom".
