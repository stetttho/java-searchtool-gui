 My son wanted this game because he loves Monster Trucks.  He got frustrated on "normal" mode, so we switched it to "easy" and he enjoys it a lot more because he can win.  The graphics are pretty good, though not great, and the sound seems pretty realistic. I tried playing it and I enjoy doing the "cash grab" and "points" mode.  Death match is a little harder since you have to be the only truck left standing when time is up.  I don't really like the save feature.  It appears to save the file based on your progress and doesn't give you the option of naming your saved file.  If more than one person wants to keep track of what they are doing, you just have to save your file to a different memory card, I guess.
