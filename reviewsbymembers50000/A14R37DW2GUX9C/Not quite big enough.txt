 I confess that I didn't buy this - it looked too small in the store.  I ended up getting the G Pak, and I really like it. It was big enough to hold dozens of games, memory cards, cables and at least 3 controllers.  The only problem we had was when we put the Intec monitor on our Gamecube.  The case wasn't made deep enough to accomodate it.  Our work around was to put the controllers on either side of the Gamecube and the games discs (in small protective cases)in the outer pocket that the G Pak provides.  The games were supposed to go in built-in pockets inside the main case.  The great thing about it is you just unzip the case, plug in the AC or DC, and play from the case.  No problems with overheating and its easy to close up and take into the hotel room.
