 My son got a pair of headphones very similar to these - made by Panasonic.  He thought they sounded pretty good, but then he's 12.  He got them because earbuds hurt his ears.  Since these rest over the ear, they worked better.  Personally, I listened to them and I thought they sounded cheap, plus the plastic arm that keeps them in place over the ear broke in one week's time.  Now he has to hold one of them over his ear until we can get something better.
