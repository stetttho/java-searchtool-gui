 We bought this monitor specifically so our kids could play the Gamecube on a long road trip. It met our expectations. It is easy to set up, and had no problems running it through the power outlet in our minivan (this is the replacement for the old cigarette lighter). I did complain to Intec that our monitor had only one headphone jack, even though the box and instructions showed that it had two. Intec apologized that their box and manual had not been updated and offered to send us a splitter so we could hook up two headphones. I agree that the video display is not as good as a TV but my son had no problem seeing the images from any angle. You'll have a hard time reading text on that small a screen, though. I do agree with the person who said that the volume control was very sensitive, but it was no big deal. We didn't notice the hissing sound one reviewer complained about. We took the AC adaptor along with us and hooked it up in the hotel room, too. In summary, I would buy it again (...) because the portability was the most important factor for us. It certainly kept the kids happy in the car!
