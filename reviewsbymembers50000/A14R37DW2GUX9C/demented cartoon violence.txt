 I agree with the other reviewer.  The DVD consists of a lot of short cartoons in which most of the cartoon characters get blown up, sawed in two or eaten.  There is a lot of cartoon blood  and guts.  My 13 yr old daughter wanted this, so all her friends gathered around to watch it.  Most of them liked it, but a few didn't.  Smaller children probably shouldn't watch it; in fact, there is a warning on the cover "Not recommended for small children or big babies".  If you like cartoons with a twist similar to South Park (but without the language) then you'll probably like this.  The theme song really got on my nerves because they play it at the beginning and end of every short episode, and there are about 15 of them on a DVD.
