 I haven't had this for very long, but so far it has worked pretty good.  It comes with a memory card which is put into slot B on the gamecube, and a disc.  To use it, you turn on the gamecube with the memory card and the disc in it.  It comes up with a menu, one option being to load codes for the game you want to play.  We've tried it with Burnout and Driven and worked fine.  I tried to use it with Super Mario Sunshine to access all levels and worlds - the 1st time the game locked up and the 2nd time I still couldn't access unopened areas. Oh well.  To update codes, we have to input them manually.  Maybe with the optional modem for gamecube, you'll be able to download the codes at some point ...
