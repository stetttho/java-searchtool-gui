 Well, I bought Krazy Racers first, then I got Mario Kart because everyone raved about it.  Personally, I like Krazy Racers better.  I won my cups in easy mode, and raced a few tracks in normal mode.  Overall, it wasn't too hard - except for the License Tests.  I have gotten all the cups but can't master 2 of the tests for the last license.  In Mario Kart, it didn't take me long to get the special cup in the 50cc category using either Peach or Toad.  I spent a lot more time playing Krazy Racers than I did Mario Kart.  Both have good graphics and good control.
