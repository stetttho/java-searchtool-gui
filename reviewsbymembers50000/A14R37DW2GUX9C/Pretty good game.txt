 I like this game as much, maybe better, than Road Rage.  Being able to get out of the car and explore (which is how you find stuff) is great.  We've been through all the levels and there are only a few missions I'm having a hard time completing.  The races are pretty easy at first, but they get harder.  Sure you can hit stuff and run over people but if you do it too much, you're charged with "hit & run" and the cops come after you.  If you can evade them, great, otherwise you get money taken away from you.  I like the graphics, and the controls are pretty easy to master.  My only complaint about this game is the camera view.  You can control it to some extent with the C stick when you are outside of the car, but not while you're driving.  It got aggravating sometimes because I couldn't always see where I was going at first.
