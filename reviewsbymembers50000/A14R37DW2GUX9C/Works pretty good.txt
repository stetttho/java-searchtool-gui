 We got a G-Pak mainly to take the Gamecube on trips. It holds quite a bit of stuff. Our only problem was that with a portable screen added to the cube we couldn't use the inside slots for game disks, because there wasn't enough room - the velcro straps just barely fit over the cube/screen. We were able to put the cables and one controller around the cube, and the disks (stored inside jewel cases) + memory cards + a small controller in the outer pocket.  The case has an opening in the back so you can run a power cord to the car's cigarette lighter,leave the cube in the G-Pak and play in the car.  In the hotel room we just switched the DC cord for the AC adaptor and left it in the G-Pak. For travelling, it's great.
