 I must admit that when I read the other reviews I was somewhat skeptical of how well it would work.  I have tried many diets and they all worked for a few weeks, then I got nowhere.  I have been on this diet for 3 months and have lost close to 27 lbs.  It was difficult at first to stay away from pasta, bread, pizza!!, etc. but as time went by it got easier.  It is true -you really aren't hungry all the time, and you don't have to exercise a lot to see results!  The weight scales and the way my clothes fit have kept me going.  I know when I get to goal weight I'll be able to bring back some of the things I miss (within reason).  I highly recommend this book, even if your not diabetic.
