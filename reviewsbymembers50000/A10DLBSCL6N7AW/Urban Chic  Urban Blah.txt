 Based on the buzz from many internet knitting groups, I purchased this book thinking I would finally have a reference for knitting things that I would want to knit.  Alas, this is just another book that jumped on the band wagon of knitting is hip. Not that there's anything wrong with that.  Knitting is a way to pass time, produce quick gifts, relieve stress, and quit smoking, but this book seemed to be such a squeak after all of the hype. Let's look at the facts: Lily Chin is known for being outrageous in what she designs, but with the exception of the knitted bra, there was nothing that couldn't have been found for free after a search on the net. However, if a knitter is looking to expand their knitting library, then this is a great book to do so.  Each design tells of the person who chose to knit it and the inspiration behind the design. Not great as a pattern book, but as a knitter's reference perhaps.
