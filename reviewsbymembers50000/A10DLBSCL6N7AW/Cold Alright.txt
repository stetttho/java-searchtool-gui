 Like most books written for African American women, I found this one to lack substance.  I thought that this book was a good read until Winter met with Sister Souljah.  That was the ultimate act of narcissism.  The book  lost my interest there.  I would recommend that young women who are  fascinated by the easy life read it.  It was scary how easy it was for  Winter to have her whole life turned upside down in an instant.
