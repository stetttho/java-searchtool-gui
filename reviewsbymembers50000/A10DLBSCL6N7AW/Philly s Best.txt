 This album is well worth owning.  Jill Scott's melodious voice gives each cut it's own life, and leaves me wanting more.   I used to think the best song was A Long Walk, in which she tells of meeting her fiance and their first date.  But with each tune thais released on radio, I find another reason to replay the album again.  Not to gush, but each song seems to speak just to me, reminding me of my love for myself and those around me. Each song seems to speak of love, respect and good feelings.  A great buy, I would recommend this to everyone.
