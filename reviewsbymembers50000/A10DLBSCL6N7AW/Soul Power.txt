 It's very hard to raise a child now a days.  At six, despite all of my good intentions, my daughter still thinks that she should look and be something she isn't.  Imagine my delight when I first heard Video.  This song tells people to accept and embrace who they are, love themselves! In an era where every other song speaks of fake this and plastic that it is refreshing to hear a song that tells you to love yourself. Then I heard Brown Skin, and I was hooked.  This song is an expression of love for brown skin brothers.  It also reminded me of the times I used to chase my husband down the street when he would leave to go home, wanting just a few more minutes to gaze at him. India.Arie has an awesome album that should be included in every music lover's collection.
