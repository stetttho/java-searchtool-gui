 The three star rating is only because I am horrible with hair and I thought I would get more in depth instruction.  However, this is a great book for the basics of hair care for children.  Instead of hair washing time being a chore, it has become something of a treat to my daughter. I have learned to take my time and respect SOME of her decisions about styles, and I have also learned to trust myself when it comes to her hair.
