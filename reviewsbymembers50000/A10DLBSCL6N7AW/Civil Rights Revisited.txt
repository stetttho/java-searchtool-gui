 I bought this book after reading Uncle Tom's Cabin, because I wanted to see a man's point of view on the treatment of Blacks. This was very informative, and gave a view of a white man's life as a Black.  However, as an African American, I could not help but feel sad by reading this book.  This man had the opportunity to go back and forth as a Black, but many that he came in contact with did not.  I wish that there was more written about how this affected the author's home life, and also how the author felt about the experience once time had passed. This is a highly suggested book for one who would like to know about the race relations of the 1950's.
