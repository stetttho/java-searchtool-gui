 What can I say about this pillow except it is just great!   This pillow can be used during nursing, so you nor baby has to strain.  This pillow can be used when you need to scoot out of the room really quick and your baby is sitting up.  It helps him not fall.  It can also be used for the important "tummy time" when your baby needs to get used to be on his stomach. Add this to your registry or just get it for yourself.  You and your baby deserve this product.
