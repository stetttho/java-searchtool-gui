 I received a copy of the book and immediately read four chapters while waiting for the bus.  This is the type of story that grabs you because it speaks so true for some women. This is the story of a young girl who has to stay with the mother who seemingly abandoned her at the age of three by allowing Niara to live with her paternal grandparents.  After her grandmother's death. Niara must now forge a relationship with a woman she hates. Readers who are looking for a book that will make them go through an array of emotions should choose this one.
