 My reason for reading this book was to understand why some Blacks today are called 'Uncle Toms'.  Once I began the book, I realized that I would have to stop looking at the book frrom the perspective of a Black woman in the year 2001.  That the author was not a slave or a Black is very obvious, and her own misconceptions about Blacks are very disturbing.  But she is, after all, writing from her the only point of view she knew.  I found the book to be very engrossing, easy to read and also interesting enough to keep me from flipping to the end.
