 I was blown away by this book.  Dasha Kelly has written a novel about friends, relationships, and the power of lies.  I don't want to give away the plot, but readers will be pleased with this emerging voice. The story of Emorie, her friend Denise, and Emorie's husband James is explored in the novel.  It has just the right amount of flow and action, one to make you sink your teeth and not let go until the conclusion. Looking for a quick, yet thorough read, look no further than this title.
