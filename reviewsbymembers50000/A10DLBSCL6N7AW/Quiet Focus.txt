 I like this tape!  I find this to be a soothing.  Rodney Yee guides you through five different sessions that can be done together or alone.  For someone who hates to work out, this was an excellent way to gear my mind and body for a more vigorous practice. I found that after doing this tape for two weeks, the little things didn't bother me as much.  I am able to deal with stress and I can think more clearly when others around me panic. The tape is beautiful even if it is for the view.
