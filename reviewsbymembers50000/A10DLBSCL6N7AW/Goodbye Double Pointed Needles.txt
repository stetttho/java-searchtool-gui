 I eschew all double pointed needles!  Cat Bordi has written a book that has changed the way I knit and will sure to change the way you knit also. This book includes patterns ranging from easy to hard and also instructions on how to convert your existing patterns to this (in my opinion) quicker method. I love this method, and you will too.
