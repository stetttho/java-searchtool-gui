 As a self taught knitter, it was great to finally get instruction from a more experienced knitter.  However, Bev Dillon, while extremely knowledgeable, is very, very boring.   There seemed to be just one camera filming this, so when there are techniques that should be closely watched, the focus is blurry and the camera angle is funky.   I must say that this was a helpful guide in techniques such as color knitting and reading charts.  The copy I had did not come with a guide booklet but I was still able to make notes as I watched and I have seen a great improvement in my knitting.
