 I bought this book so that I could make the toe glove socks.  It turned out to be a pretty good purchase. I found many designs to drool over and also patterns that were not to intimidating.  I only wish that there was some type of VERY basic instructions.  I am a self taught knitter and I need all the help I can get.  But, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to build there library.
