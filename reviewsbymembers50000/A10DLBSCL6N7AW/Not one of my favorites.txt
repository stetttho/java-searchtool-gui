 I had heard so much about EZ that I rushed out to buy this book.  I was really disappointed by this book.  I expected to find information as a beginning knitter, but this book seemed to be geared towards knitters who are more experienced. I do like the homey style and the fact that Elizabeth Zimmermann was a knitting enthusiast, but this is a book that should be added to the knitter's library later on, once technique and method has been established.
