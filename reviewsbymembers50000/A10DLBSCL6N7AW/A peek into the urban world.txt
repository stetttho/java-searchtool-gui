 Reading 'The Corner', you are transported into West Baltimore and the life of the denizens of Monroe and Fayette.  David Simons and Ed Burns attempts to put a face to the addicts that are normally ignored in people's everyday life. I was saddened by the hoplelessness and despair that most of the people felt, and also by the fact that these were real people, not characters that could be filed away for a later time.  To use a worn cliche, this book is indeed an eye opener, telling the tale of people who fell and have no reason to hope for anything beyond the next blast from a pipe. This is not a book for the faint.  The scenes are graphic and the writing allows for the reader to be there in real time as an observer.  The writers chronicle a year in the life of residents who have their shares of ups and downs, positive and negative experiences.  This is a book to be read with an open mind and open heart.
