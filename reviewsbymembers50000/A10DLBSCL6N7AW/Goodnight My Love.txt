 ...Ten, Nine, Eight is perfect in all aspects:  the African American characters can help my children relate to the book because the characters look like them; the father who puts his daughter to bed speak volumes for those who want to see an Afican American MALE in a positive role; and the short, simple story encourage children to read even if it is only from memory. In my family, my son is the third child to enjoy this book.  This book is one to be treasured and passed down.
