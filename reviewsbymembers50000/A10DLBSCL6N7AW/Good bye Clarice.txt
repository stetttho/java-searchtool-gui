 Oh what a horrible movie!  I fell asleep twice during the movie, very disappointed that number one, it did not follow the book AT ALL and number two it was just that awful!   No wonder Jodie Foster passed on this movie.  It was a stinker!  There were so many plot holes that it was frustrating to keep up with this movie. The whole idea that Hannibal Lecter was in love with Clarice Starling was something new to me.  The man is a manipulative person who likes to toy with people.  He has no love for anyone.  Julianne Moore did her best but she seemed to be going through the motions in the elaborate DARK *ss movie. What a waste.  I wish I could give this a minus three star rating.
