 This is definitely not for the yoga neophyte.  And you should definitely view the tape at least twice before beginning practice.  However, I must say that this tape was all that it promised to be and much more.   Rodney Yee guides you through five seesions designed to give you more energy and help you get more in tune with the elements.  I like that there isn't a whole lot of talking in the tape and you can focus on your poses and breathing.  As someone who was looking to round out my yoga practice, I found the tape to be challenging without being frustrating and to actually deliver on the promise of renewed energy. I would suggest this tape for anyone who is ready to move beyond basic poses.
