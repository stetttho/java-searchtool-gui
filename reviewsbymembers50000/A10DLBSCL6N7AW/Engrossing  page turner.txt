 It's very rare that I call a book a page turner, but this was one of those books that was impossible to put down.  From the very first chapter where the ghost of Hosanna Clark begins her narrative and the vivid images Ms Campbell draws with each character, I am sorry that the book had to end. This is the story of two women, (one black, one white) who meet when they are working as maids in a hotel.  The black woman, Hosanna, who is transplanted from Texas befriends Gilda, a Holocaust survivor and together the two of them feed off each other's strength and draw the best out of each other .  They soon use that strength to begin a cosmetic company marketing to black women. But Gilda skips out on Hosanna and all Hosanna can do is funnel her anger and hate for Gilda into her own company and pass on her grudge to her daughter Matriece. What follows is a book that forces all of the characters to confront their choices in life, and makes everyone examine what a grudge can do to the soul, how secrets can devour your life, and how the act of forgiveness can be cleansing. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to laugh, cry, and feel inspired all at the same time.
