 I bought this toy because the toy I really wanted was not in stock.  My baby is only five weeks and he just looks at the designs and the toys that hang down.  However, others seem to like this toy more than he does: My cats are always batting at the hanging objects, and my 18 month old niece likes to crawl under the arches.  As far as durability, my niece gave this toy a good working-over and all I had to do after she left was to adjust the two poles. I gave educational value a low score because, come on, how much does a five week old need to learn?
