 Having just finished (on March 27, 2003) BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON by Dean Koontz, which dealt with a more fanciful, but equally enjoyable, depiction of nanotechnology, I was pleased to be swept up again into this pseudo-scientific world via Michael Crichton's novel, PREY. Invariably, I find Crichton's novels to be both educational and entertaining, since he explains every technical nuance with remarkable precision without boring the reader.  Consistent with his trademark attention to detail, excellent character and plot development, and absorbing method of storytelling, Crichton has achieved another literary success with PREY. The ending was especially thought provoking, albeit somewhat unnerving, causing me to view computer science with a tad more appreciation-AND suspicion.
