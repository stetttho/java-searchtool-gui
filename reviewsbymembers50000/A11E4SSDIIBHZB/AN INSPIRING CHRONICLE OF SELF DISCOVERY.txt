 Before reading the novel, many people saw the movie that was inspired by the life story of Antwone Fisher. Both are fascinating character studies that chronicle the hard life of a disadvantaged young man who lived to tell the tale.  I am always amazed by the number of children who become "throwaways" after being tossed into a flawed foster care system. Antwone's story, however, shows that childhood adversities CAN be overcome through hard work, diligence, and a desire to succeed. Achieving an appreciation for his own dignity and worth, however, was the goal that dominated Antwone's search for self-discovery and, ultimately, allowed him to thrive, while his less confident peers were swallowed whole by an uncaring system. More than our sympathy, Antwone deserves our congratulations for conquering such a formidable adversary.
