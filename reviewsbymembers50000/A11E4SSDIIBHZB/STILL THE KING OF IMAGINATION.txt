 I have read every published novel by Dean Koontz and continue to marvel at the depth of his imagination. BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON is no exception, although, initially, it was burdened by labored and esoteric prose--so much so that, for a while, I thought I had ventured into a Toni Morrison novel. As usual, however, this author's wit and remarkable imagination prevailed, and allowed me to connect with the characters, and wonder at their amazing, albeit involuntarily induced, capabilities. The concept of "folding" will never mean the same to me again, and I am "much improved" by this wild experience. (Read and reviewed March 21, 2003)
