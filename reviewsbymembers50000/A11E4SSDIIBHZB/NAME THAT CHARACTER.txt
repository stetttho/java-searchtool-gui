 Even though he chose not to give his central character a name, Eric Jerome Dickey has spun a fascinating tale with BETWEEN LOVERS.  This novel is funny, poignant, creative, and thought provoking.  It also explores a new level of sexual identity that is not examined even in the works of E. Lynn Harris.      If you're a fan of this author, then you should add BETWEEN LOVERS to your collection. If you're not a fan, then you'll soon become one after reading this enjoyable romp through the lives of its often confused and always candid characters.
