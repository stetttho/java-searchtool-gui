 In a plot surrounding another nameless character (reminiscent of his THIEVES' PARADISE), Eric Jerome Dickey (EJD) reminds us that marriage can be beautiful IF the participants are loving, considerate, and FAITHFUL--with an emphasis on the latter. Written throughout from a female perspective, this novel exhibits EJD's uncanny knack for believably depicting the feelings, frustrations, and sensuality of his sister friends. As usual, the dialogue is crisp, up-to-date, and so credible that you are THERE as the words are spoken--nodding to their cadence and 'signifying' with each uttered truth. Despite EJD's irritating refusal to name the main character, he has created a story so compelling that even that flaw can be overlooked. Also, his debut venture into describing heterosexual erotica is surpassed only by Beverly Jenkins--the queen of tastefully creating ... images capable of arousing saint and sinner alike. Its wit, humor, poignancy, realism, and suspense make THE OTHER WOMAN EJD's best novel yet.
