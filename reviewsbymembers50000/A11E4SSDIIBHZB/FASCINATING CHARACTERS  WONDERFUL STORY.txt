 Pearl Cleage is an author in a class by herself, and her books define their own special genre. As with her previous writings, Pearl Cleage's latest literary venture, SOME THINGS I NEVER THOUGHT I'D DO, is a delightful tale that captures the imagination of the reader and the spirit of each of its central characters. The main character, Regina Burns, is an "everywoman", whose name suggests the negative aspects of her past, as well as the bright and searing prospects for her future. It is only fitting, therefore, that she becomes entangled with the handsome and mysterious Blue Hamilton, who is linked with her past and future selves in more ways than one. Imaginative plots, vivid characterization, and lyrical prose are standard trademarks of a Pearl Cleage novel-and this one definitely does not disappoint.
