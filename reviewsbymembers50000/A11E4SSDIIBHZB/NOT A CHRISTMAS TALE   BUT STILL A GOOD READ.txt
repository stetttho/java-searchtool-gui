 I always look forward to a new novel by Eric Jerome Dickey, having read all of his previous published works, and found NAUGHTY OR NICE to be up to his expected standards. Although the novel was not really a Christmas story as promoted (despite its occasional reference to the holiday season), it was a fascinating relationship tale nevertheless--from the candid exploration of step-sister interactions, to the less revealing glimpse into the trials experienced between friends, lovers, parents, and spouses. As usual, the dialogue was crisp, the characters realistic, and the plot absorbing.  The novel's single flaw was the ending--not because it was too "rushed", as expressed by other readers, but because it was incongruous with the tone and temperament of the rest of the novel.  For example, "Panther" devolved from an exciting young woman into a caricature, and the tarnish splashed on "Carpe's" true nature served only to render "Livvy" a fool--at least in regard to her people-reading skills. If EJD had ended this novel at the point just three sentences shy of the second to the last chapter (the chapters weren't numbered after all) and omitted the last chapter altogether, then the book would have been a much better read.  No one is perfect, though, and NAUGHTY OR NICE is definitely a keeper.
