 Having just finished reading, and been remarkably disappointed by, James Patterson's latest work, THE LAKE HOUSE, I was relieved that my other old standby, Dean Koontz, is just as imaginative, witty, thrilling, thought-provoking, and inspiring as ever.  In his latest achievement, THE FACE, each character--from the most villainous to the most benign--is so thoroughly described that the reader can actually feel the character's emotions and lock into the character's thoughts.  10-year-old Fric is especially delightful, and incites empathy and compassion as he travels through his lonely world, intact with a juvenile, yet oddly mature, sense of humor, tempered by shaky confidence and wandering self-esteem.  Although Fric is neither the title nor central character, his fate is inextricably bound with those of a former homicide detective, the detective's best friend and fellow crime-fighter, as well as an unlikely and mysterious "guardian", who appears in many guises and whose motives are questionable as his true identity and mission unfold.  The primary villain in this tale is also fully developed and the reader becomes so attuned to his psyche that his evil nature is completely revealed, leaving no doubt that his own fate belongs forever and irretrievably in hell. As usual, the author's prose is intelligent, smooth, and artfully composed.  The dialogue is realistic, crisp, and provides wonderful insight into the characters, just as the vivid scene descriptions give the reader unfettered glimpses into this fanciful world.  Even though the novel contains over 550 pages, it is just long enough, and can be devoured in a single, chilling sitting. With THE FACE, Dean Koontz proves that he is still the master of the nail-biting, breath-holding, page-turning thriller, which manages to zoom to an uplifting and satisfying conclusion.
