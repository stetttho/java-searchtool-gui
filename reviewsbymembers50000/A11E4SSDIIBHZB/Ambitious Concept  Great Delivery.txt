 Without giving away any element of the book's suspense, I must say that the denouement of THE TAKING was truly thought-provoking. Only Koontz could give such an imaginative, yet philosophical, spin to the concepts of heaven and hell and their relationships to the space/time continuum. Those readers who feel that Koontz is a Stephen King mimic give too much credit to the latter author. Koontz is, always has been, and always will be in a class by himself. THE TAKING gets another thumbs up for this prolific storyteller.
