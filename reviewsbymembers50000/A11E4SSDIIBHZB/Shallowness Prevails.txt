 Ordinarily, I am a die-hard Connie Briscoe fan. I loved all of her previous novels and found her to be a wonderful storyteller who educates as much as she entertains. I was somewhat disappointed in this latest work, however--not because the plot was not intriguing, but because the depth and focus of the primary characters were not in keeping with what I have come to expect from this author. With possibly two exceptions, the principal characters were shallow, self-absorbed, and possessed few redeeming qualities. The fact that they were supposed to be illustrative of the more elite, intelligent, and prosperous elements of African-American society made their antics all the more disturbing and embarrassing. The climax was particularly outrageous for its lack of believability, and detracted from the more credible aspects of the story--including the promising genealogy angle. To its credit, though, the book is a quick read and, in all likelihood, will hold the interest and attention of most readers who have experienced Ms. Briscoe's past literary successes.
