 This prequel to SUGAR AND SPICE, which was released in 2003, is another fast-paced murder mystery that centers on FBI agent and martial arts expert Phoenix Perry.  Reminiscent of the writing style of James Patterson, Keith Lee Johnson writes short chapters that are packed with excitement and intrigue.  The characters are fully developed and sharply focused, the dialogue is crisp and believable, and the plot is projected with such lightning speed that it is difficult to close the book until the last page is turned.  In PRETENSES, the author also reveals an infrequently explored aspect of African-American history that adds an unexpected element to the villain's evil motivation for setting loose a mysterious and powerful serial killer, who challenges Phoenix to the core of her intellect and fighting spirit, causing the agent to suspect a mole in the fabric of her law enforcement organization.  The final showdown between Phoenix and her nemesis is chilling and thrill-packed, in spite of the advance knowledge of the outcome provided by a prior reading of SUGAR AND SPICE.  In fact, the reading of both novels would have been enhanced if the author had released PRETENSES first, and it would be interesting to learn his rationale for releasing the thrillers in reverse order.
