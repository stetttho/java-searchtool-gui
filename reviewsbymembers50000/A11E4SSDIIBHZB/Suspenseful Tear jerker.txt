 These co-authors (Virginia Deberry and Donna Grant) of TRYIN' TO SLEEP IN THE BED YOU MADE have created another fine work of fiction in their latest effort BETTER THAN I KNOW MYSELF.  Even though the novel is actually a "coming-of-age" story centering on the lives of three young women who meet during their matriculation at Barnard College, the element of suspense is provided by the tone set at the novel's beginning.  Frequently augmented by revealing flashbacks, the story opens with a cemetery scene, during which two of the friends gather to commemorate the passing of their third comrade.  As a result of this early exposition, the reader becomes embroiled in a guessing game as the novel unfolds, concerning which one of the three friends will meet an untimely end.  The suspense becomes even more agonizing as each character is increasingly developed, making it more and more difficult for the reader to part with any of them, and rendering the conclusion all the more heart-wrenching.  Complete with an engaging plot, sprinkled with insightful sub-plots, well-defined characters, and believable dialogue, BETTER THAN I KNOW MYSELF is an inspiring glimpse into the interlocking experiences of three women from disparate backgrounds, who discover an unexpected unity and a lasting friendship that could be interrupted only by death.
