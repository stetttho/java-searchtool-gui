 Bebe Moore Campbell takes her time in weaving a story--which results in well-developed characters, vivid and intricate plots, realistic dialogue, and lyrical prose. Her previous works, written over the past decade, were all spell-binding and fast-paced. Her most recent work is no exception. Consisting of 533 pages, WHAT YOU OWE ME is captivating from start to finish, beginning in 1948 and ending in 2001 with the narratives of long-deceased Hosanna Clarke, a budding entrepreneur whose dreams for a lucrative cosmetics venture were aborted during her lifetime, but passed on to one of her daughters. The daughter, Matriece Carter, ends up fulfilling her mother's ambitions, following an often painful, but life-strengthening journey of self-discovery. Sandwiched between the dates surrounding Hosanna's narration, blooms a tale featuring her own exploits, as well as those of her contemporaries and descendants, revolving around complex human/racial relationships. From intense loyalty to unspeakable betrayal, the overt actions and inner feelings of ALL of the principal characters are portrayed with such depth and imagery that the reader cannot help but become intimately acquainted with them. In creating this effect, the author shows a remarkable sense of empathy and knowledge of human psychology. This novel is a treasure and, in spite of its length, will be enjoyed repeatedly for years to come.
