 James Patterson is one of my favorite authors and this departure from his usual genre certainly did not disappoint.  I read THE JESTER on March 21, 2003 in one sitting, because I simply could not put it down. Reminiscent of Michael Crichton's TIMELINE, this novel is set in medieval times, and is flavored with anachronistic (but very believable) dialogue. Hugh is a wonderful character, who incites both sympathy and admiration, and the novel's villains give a whole new meaning to the word "monsters"--particularly the so-called noblemen, who seemed to harbor not a shred of humanity. Readers who enjoy a thrilling roller-coaster ride, complete with vivid imagery, heart-pounding plot twists, and semi-historical storytelling, will LOVE this book!  Incidentally, the Mystery Guild's reviewer not only misstated part of the novel's exposition, but also spoiled a significant element of suspense by disclosing the identity of the relic--making me glad that I had read the book before seeing the review.
