 If you liked IT LOOKS LIKE CRAZY ON AN ORDINARY DAY, you will LOVE Pearl Cleage's second novel, I WISH I HAD A RED DRESS! This novel re-introduces Joyce Mitchell, one of the characters from Cleage's previous novel, as well as some of the members of her "free" women's community group, affectionately known as "The Circus". All of the characters come alive through Cleage's wonderful story-telling style--so much so that the reader wants to know what happens to them long after the last page is turned. The characters also relate such memorable messages as: "Confession, without closure, is just whining"; "Anybody can learn anything, once they quit pretending that they already know it"; "If you can't admit it, you probably ought to quit it"; and "If you want to make God laugh, make plans". In addition to running "The Circus" and helping its all-female membership deal with issues such as motherhood, education, abusive relationships, and career choices, Joyce must examine her own feelings regarding the blossoming of a romantic relationship with the newest member of her small Idlewild, Michigan community, after surviving five years of widowhood. I WISH I HAD A RED DRESS has all of the wit, humor, and excellent plot development that can be expected from a Pearl Cleage novel, and it will hold the reader's attention from the first page to the last.
