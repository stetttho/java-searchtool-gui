 Kimberla Lawson Roby has embarked upon challenging concepts in her latest novel A TASTE OF REALITY, which explores modern-day discrimination in the workplace, as well as interracial and marital relationships, but its delivery is disappointingly mediocre. Flaws that dominated and diminished her previous novels are prevalent in this work as well. For example, characterization and plot are thinly developed, the dialogue is often trite and unbelievable, and the author's attempts at describing sexual encounters are so inept as to be laughable instead of erotic. (She definitely is no Beverly Jenkins in that regard.) Notwithstanding the mediocrity of her writing style, the author tells a good story--making this effort a surprisingly quick read and not an entire waste of time.
