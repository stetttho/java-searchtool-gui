 I always look forward to a new novel by John Grisham, having read all of his previous published works. Although his last four novels did not exhibit quite the intrigue, character development, and spell-binding plots, typical of his earlier works, they were interesting nevertheless. For some reason, however, I was expecting more from THE KING OF TORTS, and hoped that it would capture some of the qualities of THE FIRM, THE CLIENT, et al. In keeping with Grisham's trend of declining creativity, though, THE KING OF TORTS was enjoyable, but not outstanding. The ending was particularly disappointing, as Clay's (the main character) avarice had been self-condemned and, as such, should not have cost him EVERYTHING.
