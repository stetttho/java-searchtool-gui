 This earlier (1989) effort by Sandra Brown is far from being in synch with her later works.  In fact, it is difficult to believe that BEST KEPT SECRETS came from the pen of a novelist who has come to be a favorite over the years.  The novel's protagonist is a young prosecutor, who, in searching for the killer of her mother--murdered over a quarter of a century ago--ends up confronting her own inner demons, while facing off with three powerful men who also happen to be her primary suspects.  Amazingly, the prosecutor falls in love with one of her suspects and begins to admire and respect the other two, even as she ineptly attempts to ferret out evidence against all three.  The plot is nonsensical, the characters are shallow and marginally depicted, and the conclusion is so predictable that it is almost surprising--as in: so many clues point to the identity of the killer that, surely, they must be cleverly planted red herrings.  Alas, they are not; and the disclosure of the killer's identity at the novel's climax falls right in step with the unremarkable aspects of the rest of the story.  Fortunately, Sandra Brown has improved with experience, and the aberration of BEST KEPT SECRETS can be buried among the secrets of her own literary past.
