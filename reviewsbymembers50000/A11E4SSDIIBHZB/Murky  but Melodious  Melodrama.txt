 Ever since BELOVED, and particularly exemplified in PARADISE,  reading a Toni Morrison novel can be likened to swimming upstream in a deep pool of rich, sticky chocolate pudding-sometimes sweet, sometimes suffocating, and always tiring.  Her latest novel LOVE does not depart from the author's esoteric, albeit often haunting, and even beautiful, writing style.  With occasional lucid moments-usually triggered by the too infrequent dialogue between vaguely-drawn characters-LOVE's plot is spun slowly, teasingly, peppered with lyrical prose, and leading the reader to hope for a finish that bursts in a crescendo of enlightenment, answering all of the questions that have been sprinkled so melodramatically throughout the storytelling.  Unfortunately, the finish fizzles, leaving the reader not only humming, but harrumphing, as in:  "Is that IT?!"  After wading through 201 pages that read like 525, there should be a little more satisfaction when the last page is turned; but then, that would have been antithetical to what her readers have come to expect from a true Toni Morrison experience.
