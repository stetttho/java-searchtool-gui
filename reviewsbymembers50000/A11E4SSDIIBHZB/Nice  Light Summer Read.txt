 Although there is nothing extraordinary about this novel, it is fast-paced, interesting, and SWEET. The characters are well-developed and likeable, despite the momentary gender confusion established in the prologue. Also, because there is no extraneous matter contained in the plot, the book can be savored in just a few hours.  Even though I prefer Patterson's Alex Cross mysteries and Women's Murder Club series, SAM'S LETTERS TO JENNIFER was a pleasant departure from the murder and mayhem, and as soul-satisfying as his other love story SUZANNE'S DIARY FOR NICHOLAS.
