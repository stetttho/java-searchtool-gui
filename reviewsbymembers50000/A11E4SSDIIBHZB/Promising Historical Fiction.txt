 THIS SIDE OF ETERNITY is a fictionalized account of the civil rights era and beyond, and centers on the lives of two African-American women--an aunt and her niece. The novel covers the period from the 1960's to the present, and the setting is located basically in Memphis, Tennessee.  Although Rosalyn McMillan generally tells a good story (I liked her other four novels as well), her inadequate knowledge and sometimes awkward use of grammar and sentence structure can be annoying. Ironically, this weakness has not improved over time because her earlier novels were not quite as flawed. If readers can overlook this minor distraction, however, they will enjoy THIS SIDE OF ETERNITY for its fine characterization, interesting plot, and unique perspective on a turbulent period in America's history.
