 After almost a month, I finally was able to finish this novel. Except for occasional moments of intrigue, interspersed with episodes that evoked outrage, the plot just plodded along, and none of the characters, other than the institution of slavery itself, ever came to life.   Moreover, the writing style was stilted and archaic, and the ending, which was supposed to pull everything together, did not fulfill its advertised promise. In fact, the conclusion was particularly disappointing, except that it brought an end to my mind-numbing boredom.
