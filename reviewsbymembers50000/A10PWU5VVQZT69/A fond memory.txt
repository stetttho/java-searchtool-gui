 Never have I consciously pruchased a disc that I knew I would rarely listen to, at least until I spotted the Lonesome Organist.  I saw him perform live and had to have a copy of this disc just to pop into my player  and relive the more amazing performance I had ever witnessed.  The man  combines street-performer energy, organ, drums, harmonic, John Spencer-ish  growls, guitar, steel drum, tap dancing and jingling bells into the most  intoxicating mash of sound I have ever experienced.  His pure emotion and  energy are enough to give one the chills and his tunes are dammed catchy to  boot.  If you don't own this disc, buy it and makes sure you see the  Lonseome O live.  If you see him live, you will buy this disc just to  cuddle up with while reflecting fondly upon the greatest show you have ever  seen.
