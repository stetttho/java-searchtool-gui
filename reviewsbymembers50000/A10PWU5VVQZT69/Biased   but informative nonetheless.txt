 Kathleen Christison does a good job of explaining, and showing, how Israel-centered the United States' foreign policy has been ever since 1948 (and pro-Zionist during the decades leading up to Israel's formation.)   Despite this strength, she seems to almost intentionally ignore anything that might undermine her position.  Her explanations of why Arafat, the PLO, and other Arab leaders have rejected various peace proposals over the decades are informative - but her explanation of why the United States or Israel has behaved in certain ways or made certain decision are simply chalked up to pro-Israel/pro-Zionist outlooks.   There is also very little discussion of the decades of terrorist attacks perpetrated by Palestinians, and how such attacks have influenced the course of any and all potential peace talks.   Given the way the information in this book is presented, it appears as if Christison believes that anyone who is not singly pro-Palestinian/pro-Arab in their views regarding the conflict in the Middle East is failing to be unbiased.  Even those presidents like Jimmy Carter, who was far more open to Arab leaders than most other US presidents, is criticized for not be pro-Arab enough.  In the end, this book offers a good insight into how much of our foreign and domestic policy is influenced by Israel and pro-Israel lobbying, and how difficult it is for an elected official to break free of these constraints.  But if you are looking for an objective discussion of American foreign policy and how it relates to the Middle East, you are advised to look elsewhere.
