 I finished reading this book a few weeks ago, and have since totally forgotten about it, which I dare say is probably not a good thing. I did not find "Dunces" funny, nor even amusing and barely entertaining. I read it at the urging of a friend whose opinion I respect - I no longer respect his opinion (at least about what books to read.) I will nonetheless give credit to Mr. Toole for the flawless structure of his book. His ability to make seeingly unrelated events interact to eventually produce a coherent picture is truly remarkable. But, other than the well-planned narrative, I found this book wholly uninteresting.
