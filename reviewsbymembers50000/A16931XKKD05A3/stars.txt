 This book really made me think about its rating so I gave it 3 1/2 stars based on the story. On one hand the story was excellent but on the other hand it didn't really keep me that interested and I can't even explain why. It should have kept me engrossed. Don't get me wrong this was a very good book, however, I think it just wasn't my "cup of tea." It was too smooth; I didn't feel any emotions (hate, anger, love, etc.) while reading it. Sorry.
