 Boy this book was so long winded.  It took forever to get into it. And Kootz's writing style ... way, way too much description and detail on everyday things that were boring and redundant.  I did, however, enjoy it once I got into it (more than half way through it).  Even then, I had to skip the descriptions and details.  This book is nothing like "The Door To December" (which was excellent!).  I don't know if I will be reading anymore of Kootz's books.
