 What can I say? I still haven't read a Linda Howard book that I didn't love.  This book was no exception.   Dee is a very, very strong character, yet she's feminine. Lucas is the alpha male that Linda Howard (and me) loves so much.  These two actually cause so many sparks I thought the pages in my book were going to catch fire!   Anyhoot, I highly recommend this book (all Linda Howard books for that matter).
