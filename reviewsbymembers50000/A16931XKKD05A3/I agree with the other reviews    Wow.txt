 How do you explain this book?  It's sooooooo touching, moving, sad, happy, funny, you name it, this book has it.  I loved every character in this book.  I can't wait to read Dallas and Austin's books.  Even though this is the first book from Lorraine Heath I have read, I am an instant fan!  FYI: My 13-year-old daughter loves to read historical romance books but I have to read them first to determine whether or not she can read them (because of their sexual content), well I handed this book to her without ANY WORRY WHATSOEVER. (And I still rate it a 5:)
