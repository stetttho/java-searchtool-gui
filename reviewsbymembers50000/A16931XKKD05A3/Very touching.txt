 When I read the back of this book I knew I had to read it.  Well, am I glad I did.  This book is so different from other books I have read.  Karyn Monk is such a good writer, she really helped me understand how sad it is to be ostracized for being different and how mean children can be. But on a lighter note, the constant bickering between the elders of the clan was very amusing. And McDunn's way with words is outstanding. The plot is very original.   This is the first book from Karyn Monk I have read and it won't be my last.
