 This book was one of the best books I have ever read.  When I first started reading this book I thought Kassia was going to be one of those "weak heroines." I was wrong. Kassia is very strong, and stayed strong throughout the book without being stupid. You know what I mean: those women who disobey and put their husband in danger and thereafter are considered intelligent and free spirited (please). Well, Kassia is not one of those . . . free spirited women. She is intelligent and caring without being weak.  Graelam believes that a woman is only good for breeding and pleasing her husband. Well, how many books have we read with a hero like this? I agree. However, Graelam is somehow different. It takes him a long time to come around and during this time he does do cruel things to Kassia: sleeping with the servants and raping Kassia. Still, somehow you've got to feel sorry for a guy whose wife refuses to sleep with him.  You have to remember that it's a book and what other way for a book to be a page-turner other than to have every emotion imaginable? Emotion is what this book has plenty of. How boring a book when it's all roses.
