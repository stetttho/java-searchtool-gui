 The beginning was GREAT, then something happened and it kind of idled through the middle, then toward the end it picked up and became okay (maybe a little too fantastical--but nonetheless, okay). Madeline was not so much an innocent as she was dumb.  The hero was wonderful!  I did, however, notice many similarities to other books of hers I've read.
