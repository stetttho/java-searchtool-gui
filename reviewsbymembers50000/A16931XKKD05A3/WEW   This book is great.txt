 One of the best books I have ever read.  I rarely sway from romance, and I NEVER read thrillers (I'm a chicken....) I don't even watch them on TV, but boy am I glad I read this book.    When I first read what this book was about, I almost didn't read it.  I don't like reading about battered women.  I usually have no sympathy for them (I was one for years).  I have always been a strong believer that if she's there it's because she wants to be there.  But this book really had nothing to do with battered women. It was about a women fighting back and taking back her life.
