 This book touched me in a way no other book has touched me.  I can't even begin to tell you the plot of this book. I would have to type the entire book. The only thing I can say about the plot is that she began as a battered wife (meek as a mouse, scared to express her feelings, etc.) then through trust, she became a woman. This book is an excellent read. It covers every aspect of a true romance novel. Johanna and Gabriel are wonderful.
