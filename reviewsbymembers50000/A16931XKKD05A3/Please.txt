 I really like HGTV, but this book is not at all what I expected.  First, flowers and stripes? No thank you.  Second, where's the instructions?  I thought this book was going to explain the why's and where's.  Third, everything in it reminded me of the '70s.  I am very upset that I actually paid full price for this book :(
