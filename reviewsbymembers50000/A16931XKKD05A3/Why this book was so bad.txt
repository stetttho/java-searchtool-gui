 I am a huge fan of Rosemary Rogers but I have to admit when I read this book I was in shock.  I couldn't believe that Rosemary Rogers wrote it.  Well, guess what? She didn't. Rosemary Rogers had a mental break down in the middle of the first draft of this book and a member of her family finished it. I hope this explains a lot to her fans.
