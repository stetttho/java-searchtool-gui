 If I gave this book one star it's because the option of NEGATIVE STARS is not available.  This is the first Susan Johnson book I have read and if they are all like this one...it will be the last.  There is no romance, no love and no "HARD TO GET."  This book was HORRIBLE!  Zena has no pride, no self esteem and no...NOTHING.  She is madly in love with a JERK who shows no feelings except for sexual desire. If it helps you, I am a HUGE Johanna Lindsey, Connie Mason and Judith McNaught fan and this book is NOTHING like those authors.
