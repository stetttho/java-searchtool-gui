 ...I know I'm in the minority here but I didn't enjoy this book at all. Half way through it I was angry. My husband asked me what was wrong. When I told him I felt like I was in school studying a Shakespeare book rather than reading a romance novel he begged me to stop reading it and read Johanna Lindsey, Connie Mason, Judith McNaught... ANYTHING! The only reason I finished it was because I kept going back and reading the reviews and asking myself, why? Well, I guess that's what's so great about us all, we all have our own taste.
