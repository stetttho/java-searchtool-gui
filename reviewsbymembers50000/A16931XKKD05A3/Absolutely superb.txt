 There is nothing I can say about this book that has not already been said, (considering the stars this book received) other than Johanna Lindsey DID IT AGAIN.  Our hero, James, is a notorious rake who "will never marry."  However, when he meets Georgina . . . that all changes (after a while.) This book is not "just like all the other books" it is a real MOVER. I very strongly recommend it.
