 Okay, when I first read what this book was about (galaxies, aliens, etc.) this book sat on my bookshelf. Then I started reading the reviews, and this is the 3rd book in a series, it sat some more. Then I ran out of books . . . Well, I picked it up and didn't put it down. WOW!!!  This book is HOT! Needless to say, I am on my way to the store to buy the other books (I can't wait for Amazon.com --sorry.) [PS you don't need to read the other books to get it but believe me you will want to.]
