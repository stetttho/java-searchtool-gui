 I have only read two books by Kinley MacGregor, this one and "Master of Desire" and I enjoyed them both. The only thing that I didn't like is that in both books the heroine realizes she loves him too soon. There's not enough "what's wrong with me? Why does he get to me so easy?" for it to be believable or even suspenseful.  Lorelei Dupree is engaged to her lifelong friend, Jason, with whom she grew up. She naturally believes she's in love with him. But when Black Jack Rhys abducts her, while posing as a barmaid to trap him, she starts to see her life through his eyes and becomes confused.  Black Jack Rhys is a notorious rake who can't understand why he is so attracted to this not-so-beautiful looking young woman when he can have any woman he wants. Nevertheless, when he gets to know her he realizes why.  I would say this is a good book and recommend it to Johanna Lindsey, Connie Mason and Sandra Hill fans. You know who you are, the one who doesn't like the weak heroine who falls in love on the first page and puts up with any and all the abuse dished out to her by the hero.
