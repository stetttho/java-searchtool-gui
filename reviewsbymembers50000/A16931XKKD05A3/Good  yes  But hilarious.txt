 I agree that this book is very entertaining.  However, I don't agree that it is hilarious. The idea is great.  Selene was a beautiful model in 1996 but when she gets voodooed back 150 years she's too skinny, her hair is too puffy from a perm and the mosquito bites . . .  Well, you get the picture, "beauty is in the eye of the beholder." All and all I would recommend this book.
