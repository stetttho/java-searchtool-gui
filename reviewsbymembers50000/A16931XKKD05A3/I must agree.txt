 This book was excellent.  The characters were wonderful. The plot was good.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the mother committed an unspeakable act (I can't say what she did, it would give the book away) and when she finally confessed nothing more was said about it.  But this was not enough to hurt the book.  I just felt as if Brenda Joyce forgot about the mother.  Anyhow, this was a great book.  I highly recommend it.
