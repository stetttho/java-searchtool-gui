 I truly hope this book marks a new beginning for all of JL's fans.  I was starting to get worried that we had lost her.    Both Jeremy and Danny were fabulous.  I believe that one of the reasons that I love the Malory series so much is because JL has a way of bringing in all her characters without drowning out the two main characters.  (Ahhhh, but I do love James.  I can read Gentle Rogue every day.)
