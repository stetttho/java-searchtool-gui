 I loved this book.  Everything about it.  I generally like the alpha male and head strong girl but sometimes the plot is so used it gets to be boring. But there was nothing boring about these two.  (WEW!) I think I actually fell in love with Liam. He was the heart of this book.  He never took no for an answer but he never hurt Katherine.  GREAT BOOK!!
