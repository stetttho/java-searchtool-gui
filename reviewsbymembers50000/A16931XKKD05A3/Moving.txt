 Cold Mountain is a very good movie.  The only problems I have with the movie is it takes so long to get into (but once you do it's so worth it) and the fact that they barely met and were already madley in love!  As a previous reviewer mentioned there is a very explicit love scene.  It is my opinion that the love scene is so very important to the movie.  You almost feel the love between the two.  The movie would not have made such an impact on me without this scene.
