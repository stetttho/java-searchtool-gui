 Well, I admit it, I'm a couch-potato and proud of it ... until two weeks ago, I was changing my clothes and my 4-year-old niece walked in the room (looked at my stomach), and asked "does it hurt?"  Well, that's all folks, I ordered Walk the Walk.  I LOVE IT!  Leslie is inspiring and funny.  The most important part is that YOU CAN DO IT.  I mean she understands that we're just beginning.  She doesn't expect us to learn the routine by watching for one minute and then plunge right in like an experts.  She explains every move.  Although I've only been doing it for a few days now I am hooked.
