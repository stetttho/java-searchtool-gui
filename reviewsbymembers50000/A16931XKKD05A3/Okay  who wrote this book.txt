 Maybe JL reviewed it and made some changes, but I doubt that she wrote it.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not "JL good." If this was any other author I probably would have given it 5 stars, but I have read all JL's book and know what she is capable of writing.   A few of the reasons I didn't give it 5 stars is as follows:   1) The stable scene -- what happened?  I'm still not sure.  It was so abrupt.  Absolutely no sexual tension to lead up to such an interlude; 2) When Chad and Marian admitted they loved each other, I was actually in shock.  When did it happen?  I actually flipped back through the pages to see what I had missed; 3) Where's the dialogue?  We actually got to know them through their thoughts!!  The end was very, very good.  That's why I gave it 4 stars. Overall, I would recommend this book (in paperback). It was good.
