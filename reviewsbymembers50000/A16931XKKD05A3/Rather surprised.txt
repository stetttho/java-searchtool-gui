 I actually enjoyed this book very much.  I was in a romance slump and needed something different.  Well, I got it.    There is no need to give a synopsis of the story -- my predecessors have done an excellent job.  The only thing I really want to say is that I really, really liked Muriel and Edward, the dog.
