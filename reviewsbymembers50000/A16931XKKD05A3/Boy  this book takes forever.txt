 I must agree with the other reviewers -- this book is good, however, it moves so slow.  Like another reviewer, the only reason I finished it was to see what happened with the ghost.   Also, another problem I had was when Mereli lost her virginity. (If she did! Ms. Coffman doesn't really say yay or nay.) There was nothing to lead up to such an interlude.  Also, we didn't get to know Meleri's thoughts on losing her virginity.   I will say though the book got better after the first 225 pages. But even though, I was yawning throughout the book.
