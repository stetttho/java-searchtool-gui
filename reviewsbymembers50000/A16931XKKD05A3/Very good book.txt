 My first Linda Howard book.  I really liked it.  (Even if it did remind me of a Nora Roberts book, but better.)  Ms. Howard really knows how to pull on your heart strings, I almost cried when I read what happend on the "Night."  Ms. Howard really lets us get to know the characters without going on and on. When I finished this book I felt as if I had really met Faith and Gray.
