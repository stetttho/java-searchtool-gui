 My first experience with Kristin Hannah was On Mystic Lake (20-star book!!)  I can't say that this book was as good, but it is definitely a 5 star book.  I have been looking for an author that will engross me in the lives and plot of a book -- I found her.  I found myself thinking about these people all day.  This was a great book. (I would tell you about the plot but others have done so better than I could.)  Enjoy.
