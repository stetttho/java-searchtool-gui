 I have to admit when I read what this book was about I thought it sounded too fairytaleish. But it was very warm, charming and funny.  Jourdian, who is determined to lead a very noneventful life and find a noneventful wife, meets Splendor. She is the essence of innocence. Even to the point that she doesn't know that she's supposed to wear clothing and not discuss "pleasing her grace in the bedroom" with his enemy... And doesn't realize that when she hugs him it's not his leg giving her that "wonderful feeling in her belly".  This book is a must read!
