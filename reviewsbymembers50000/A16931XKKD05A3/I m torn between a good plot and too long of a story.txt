 This book was good but it was too long.  It dragged in parts. There were so many subplots that had nothing to do with the book.  I mean there was page after page, after page of the prince and his mistress.  Not only was it unnecessary, it was BORING, and SICKENING.  They were so lovydovy it was gross.  I found myself (at times) reluctant to pick it back up. I couldn't even skip the pages and pages of the prince and his mistress because I kept telling myself that of course if had something to do with the plot.  WRONG!!   On the good side, it had a very good plot (the reason for 3 stars).  But come on even after Tony slept with Adam and talked to him all night, he still couldn't figure out who she was?  Okay, she had a mask painted on but don't you think her voice would give her away?  Again, this was a good book but very fantastical. Some of the things Tony did, i.e., the duel, the race, etc. were too unbelievable.  Isn't the whole reason for reading to be brought into the plot and not keep telling yourself "yeah, right."
