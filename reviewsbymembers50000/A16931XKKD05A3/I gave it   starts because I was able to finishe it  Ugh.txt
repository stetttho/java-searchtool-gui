 Our heroine (I forgot her name) is running away from her fame and from her over barring mother who made her a famous model.  She wants to live a quite life so she disappears and becomes a "spinster."  Of course, she is beyond BEAUTIFUL (which you read about 20 times).  In the hopes of hiding she puts on blue glasses and becomes "ugly." Anyway!   Our hero (forgot his name also) is a famous football star who has an injured shoulder.  He moves in with his aunt (where our heroine rents a room) so that he can stay away from partying and heal his shoulder.  Of course, he is instantly attracted to our heroine.  To sum up the rest of the book: Day 1, they meet; day 2, they mentally drool over each other; day 3, more mental drooling; day 4, they fall in love!!  That's it folks.    P.S. This review (other than the names and professions) is the same as Demon Rumm.  Ridiculous!
