 This is my first Karen Robards book, but it won't be my last.  Sebastian was a great hero.  He was strict (not abusive) but caring.  Julia was innocent yet mature, not the "smart and witty heroine because she does what she pleases and doesn't care about anyone else, so therefore she is strong."  I truly loved this book.  The only problem I had with this book is that it seemed to have finished too quick.
