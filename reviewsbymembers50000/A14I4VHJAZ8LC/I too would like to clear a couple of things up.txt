 This movie is about an American in the Pacific War. This American has a special history or relationship with the Japanese, and his adoption by a good Japanese-American family, the effect of Pearl Harbor on himself and that family, and his experience of the Japanese he has both lived-with and had to fight against on Saipan Island battle are what make this above-average Pacific-war saga based on US Marine Guy Gabaldons personal story and war experience a little different from the run of the mill genre. Good supporting-cast with David Jansen, his gambling and broads loving buddy whose luck runs out finally on Saipan, sadly. This man Guy Gabaldon would proudly agree with my description of him as an American, Im pretty-confidant.This movie is about Americans and Japanese,  its not about Germans, or Polish people,  or Swedes, or Russians,  or Italians,  or British or Irish or even, would you believe,and this may be more than you can handle, but its not about wonderful  Spanish or Mexican people, or modern race-politics in the US and trivial PC touchiness,   its about an American Marine and the Japanese. I tell you this as a non-American myself, if I can see it, so should practically anybody else.
