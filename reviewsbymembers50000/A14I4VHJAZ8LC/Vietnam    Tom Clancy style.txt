 More than mere paperbacks novels, reliving of a painful though now fabulously nostalgic era.  A tale of good men in a bad war, I think i saw someplace,or on the review comments on back jacket, to be honest I didnt expect as fine a read as I ended up with from both 'Rolling Thunder' and 'Steel Tiger, having bought the second at a Sunday market 2nd hand for a song, I soon realized I had 'discovered' Mr Berent, who is a decorated USAF Vietnam pilot, someone who flew F4 MiG CAP over Hanoi, for those who know what that means. Mr Berent weaves fictional characters like gifted pilots but troubled souls Bannister and Parker, Special Forces rough-n-tough 'Wolf Lochert', who calls people 'ScheissKoph' for those with high-school German, but will punch your lights out for taking the Lords name in vain, and senior Pentagon AF-command types like 'Whitey' Whisenand, into the fabric and knit of a tale and an atmosphere with real characters such as Lyndon Johnson, Robert Strange McNamara ( an auto company civilian president who was placed in charge of Americas forces and war, echos of Mr Rumsfeld) and real-life Vietnam Airforce ace Robin Olds.Many chapters begin with a tom Clancy style geo-political or techical background preface, and like Mr Clancys chapters  this really works, the depth of research, as well as the reminisce.  The tale rollocks along, through triumph and tragedy, with a Vietnamese double-agent among Locherts special forces cadre, and Berent is able to take you in  wind-whistling ride through Bannister and Parkers air combat missions, with loads but not too much  technical explanation of jet-fighters, weapons and dogfights, and why not, Mr Berent went there and did it himself, with a silver-star and DFC in recognition. I am a fan of Mr Berents Vietnam air-war series, his characters  and his writing of this Hendrix/Animals/Byrds war and era, I wound-up sending to Amazons 'Fiction Addiction' bookshop  in SC to get 'Phantom Leader' and 'Storm Flight', the remainder of a 5-part trilogy? and which were hard to obtain in Australia. I commend that store and what I bought.If you like a comparable writing style with Clancy, you like credible though exciting fictional characters combining with a historical President Johnson deciding war strategy as he sits on bathroom ceramic furniture, and if you are fascinated by the halcyon events and atmosphere of Americas most divisive and lamented war, youll like Berents long punctuated saga.
