 This movie could be harmful to your health if you are fascinated by bad women, there have been other femme-fatales,Davis, ,  Stanwyck,Turner,  Stone, Theresa Russell, Barrymore,  but Fiorentino defeats them all as ruthlessly as Kroy  defeats her opponents in 'last seduction': it wasnt termed  a filme-noir legend for nothing, Fiorentino is ably supported by Berg, Pullman and others, but no taking credit from her, they couldnt have done it without her....but for the HBO telemovie release,Fiorentino would have gotten Oscar or Golden globe and be a household-name top-rung star.....tantalisingly,  some of Bridgets attitudes in certain areas are shared by Fiorentino, apparently....
