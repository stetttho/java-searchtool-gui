   This screened here last night, and i enjoyed it, even though it never really took off in terms of capturing the atmosphere, you were pretty aware you were watching 200# people pretending they were in the 70s.But, not terrible.  Anyway the soundtrack I found sensational almost,  so when I did an Amazon search, how pleased i was to find there is one, given that the show was a telemovie, and as such, the morons included no music credits as happens with proper cinema movies,  like this.  But great, there is a sound-track CD! and its cheap! And it....includes only a fraction of the great unidentified songs! So  though cheap, i maybe wont bother! It needed a 2-cd set, and include the less-played songs.  anyway, who can at least identify them for us, someone should list the actual sound-track here, I challenge them. im particularly interested in one that had the words 'Big Brother' in the chorus, if anyone knows, as someone will, please email me, ill be grateful.   pfarnell@optusnet.com.au
