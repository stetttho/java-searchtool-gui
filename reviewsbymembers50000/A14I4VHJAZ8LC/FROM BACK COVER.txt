 KYLIE MINOGUE IS A PHENOMENOM, AN INTERNATIONAL STAR RECOGNIZED AROUND THE WORLD, WITHB MORE HITS IN THE CHARTS DURING THE LAST DECADE THAN ANYONE SINCE THE BEATLES AND ELVIS PRESLEY. BUT ONLY TEN YEARS AGO SHE WAS A SHY TEENAGER GROWING UP IN AUSTRALIA. HOW HAS SHE BECOME THE SOPHISTICATED AND SUCCESSFUL CELEBRITY SHE IS TODAY? WHAT LIES BEHIND THE BEAUTIFUL FACE THAT FRONTS THE CDs AND GLOSSY MAGAZINES? AND WHAT IS HER ROLE IN THE INDUSTRY THAT HAS GROWN UP AROUND HER?   DINO SCATENA IS A ROCK JOURNALIST WHO IS FASCINATED BY THE WAY KYLIE MINOGUE HAS A SPECIAL PLACE IN THE AFFECTIONS OF THE PUBLIC. HE HAS WRITTEN THE DEFINITIVE STORY OF HER LIFE: FROM HER BEGINNINGS IN THE COMFORTABLE  EASTERN SUBURBS OF MELBOURNE, TO HER YEARS ACTING AS 'CHARLENE' IN NEIGHBOURS, AND ON TO SINGING STARDOM. HE TELLS OF THE ENORMOUS CHANGES SHE HAS WEATHERED, THE WELL-PUBLICISED  RELATIONSHIPS WITH JASON DONOVAN  AND MICHAEL HUTCHENCE, AND THE PERSONAL CHANGES THAT HAVE ACCOMPANIED THEM: FROM INNOCENT  GIRL-NEXT-DOOR TO A YOUNG WOMAN IN CHARGE OF HER OWN DESTINY AND WITH THE WORLD AT HER FEET.
