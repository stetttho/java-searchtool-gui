 I can understand on reflection the criticisms of the flat tone of the book, perhaps vaguely justified, but look, you know who the man is,is credentialied and one of the most decorated men of the WW2 RAF, a genuine hero,  and he relates his story and memories with a no-frills stark truth, and, you enjoy it.  You know its all true, you know who the man is, leading surviving RAF ace, whos 38 kills were unusual and unique in all being on Luftwaffe single-engined fighters, from memory, the most dangerous and skilled aggressive opponents: learning to fly from sometimes jaded bloody-minded or incompetent instructors, first hair-raising night-solo,  from Battle of France, where he has some sad reflections of pilots killed, through the summer-autumn glory of the Battle of Britain,  through the difficult tactical times of the 1941-42 Fighter and Light bomber offensive over occupied France, when the appearance of the FW190 only further emphasised the defensive superiority of the few in number veteran Luftwaffe fighter groups, through the outright defeat on land and sea of Dieppe, as Johnsons admits, 'they outfought us and got more of us then we did them, end of story' , no excuses cop-outs or consolation-prizes offered,as in some RAF and American memoirs,  through the period of attainment of real victory of 1944, and the fascinating  and too brief description perhaps of the last violent lashouts of the dying Luftwaffe, of New Years 1945 Bodenplatte, and later, the token but sometimes bloody raids by fighter-bomber Luftwaffe 262 jets on allied airfields. An encounter with the strange Malta Lone-wolf Canadian 'Screwball' Beurling is described, pity there was no background or follow-up info on this prospective ALlied WW2 Richtofen-like  eccentric Canadian. Johnson was in it start to finish.  Its not my outright fave WW2 RAF memoir, which i admit I generally enjoy more than more popular Luftwaffe memoirs,( to me, they are still Jerries, still the then-enemy, fascinating curiosities,especially their equipment,  but not anti-heroes as some make them, just Jerries, just the enemy)ie but 'Wing Leader' is a must-have. My outright fave is the lesser-known but lively-atmospheric and language writing real 'get some in' RAF 'type'  Sir Hugh Dundas 'Flying Start', Dundas was a comrade of both Johnson and Bader, and is mentioned more than once in this Johnson Book. 'FLYING START'  THAT is a cracker, i have it, each person I lend it to returns it with rave-reviews how come its so good, but relatively unknown.You cant put 'Flying Start' down, once you start, and there is a lot in it,  perhaps find an amazon dealer with both, to split freight, as well as perhaps 'Eagle Day' Battle of Britain collage, another beauty, and you'll have bought well and be reading well.
