  IN MAY 1979 RON SMITH, A FORMER LEEDS POLICEMAN, RECEIVED A PHONE-CALL TO SAY HIS 23YO DAUGHTER HELEN, A NURSE WORKING IN SAUDI ARABIA, WAS DEAD. SHE HAD FALLEN BY ACCIDENT, THE BRITISH FOREIGN OFFICE TOLD HIM, FROM A SIXTH-FLOOR BALCONY DURING A PARTY GIVEN BY A BRITISH COUPLE, THE ARNOTS.   BUT ON TWO TRIPS TO JEDDAH, AND AFTER THREE POST-MORTEMS  ON HIS DAUGHTER'S BODY, MUCH MORE EXPLANATION THAN SUSTAINED IT. AS TIME WENT ON, RON SMITH BECAME MORE AND MORE CERTAIN THAT HELEN HAD BEEN MURDERED.   THIS IS THE STORY OF RON SMITH'S SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER, ABOUT HIS PERSISTANT FIGHT WITH OFFICIALDOM BOTH IN UK AND SAUDI ARABIA. IT SHOWS HOW THE SIMPLE PRIORITIES OF HIS SEARCH BECAME EMBROILED IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS, AND WERE DEFLECTED BY THEM.
