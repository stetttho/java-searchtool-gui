 Shocker of a movie, but I just bought a new copy from the US, lol..  most of the existing comments here are spot-on, I just watched a new copy of it, and the martial-arts which I don't even really care about, seemed very, err, underwhelming compared to some movies, but hey, maybe it was actually more realistic, more that you could actually expect, than a whirl of perfect stylish moves. Also, the blond chick seemed possibly a better fighter, more co-ordinated, than main-star Cat Sassoon.  the comments about Sassoons boobs are I'm sure, correct, but hey, you looked, and didn't stop looking, right?  anyway, this unusual even strange-looking but magnetically attractive woman, that Id seen in Bloodfist 4, which i also own, was the reason I bought the vid.  Its one tragedy of our time that she lost her life 2 or 3 years ago, in what sounded like a very LA/Hollywood type of death: and another that her presence and look, , especially as a villainess as on BF4, was not even a little better filmed and scripted,even to an average standard, to make better use of what she offered, Bf4 was a mess in many ways, and this one, probably even worse. But its all about her. Hilarious perhaps that Don Wilson, whos a pretty-good martial-arts star, remade B-F 4, under a different name, because he wasn't happy with it, fair enough, but apparently it was far worse, not better.It lacked Sassoon, even , anyway.    Sassoon maybe should have been Tomb Raider over the  over-rated diva-ish  Angelina Jolie, but of course Jolie was that mainly because already established big-name with an Oscar or something from that mental-hospital movie, anyway, Sassoon should have become the #1 femme-fatale action villainess, on the strength of her sheer presence in BF 4 and this movie...was wasted and made cult-obscure by her presence in films with d-grade scripts, budgets and directors like Sziller and Santiago...no matter how much of a presence and potential she had, was never going to get much  propulsion  from vehicles like this and BF-4...
