 Havent seen the DVD, but seen the movie on TV several times in the 70s, wasnt overly impressed then, so would be less so now. If youve seen 633 Squadron, then watch this, yes, youve seen most of the aerial action in THAT better movie. This time is a hybrid mission involving rockets or rocket-fuel like '633, but with a potentially thrilling resistance-fighter jailbreak facilitated by the Mosquitoes blowing-down the walls with dambuster-style Upkeep/Highball bouncing-bombs as a bonus target: might seem they are borrowing from here and there of previous movies, but there really was an epic RAF operation against Amiens Prison housing French Resistance fighters during the war, known aptly as Operation Jericho, ( the walls came tumbling down)so its ok to overlap other movies when it also reflects fact, of course. Anyway, its too low-budgety to do much, saves heaps with using the 633 Squadron sequences, much as movies like 'Midway' used the wonderful combat sequences from 'Tora Tora Tora', and has a melodrama that the dreadful 'Pearl Harbor' probably ripped off, the pilot disappears in combat, certainly KIA, brave late pilots buddy hooks-up late pilots foxy squeeze,they both feel bad about it, but they do it anyway, then dead-hero inconveniently has not been killed, is alive, shaken but not stirred,POW,  but now  pilot  feeling bad about being busy with not-so-dead buddies lady, also has to fly-off and probably off the presumed-dead buddy for real this time himself  as inevitable collateral damage with the Nazi target he has to drop bombs on to win the ruddy war. If you like 633 Squadron, this is definately inferior but with many melodramatic similiarities,Cliff Robertson in '633 also had to grease one of the friendlies thanks to those horrid Germans,  it lacks 633s stratosperic atmospheric soaring Ron Goodwin theme-music, and really, I wouldnt drop the dough unless you just cant get enough of the admittedly exciting and beautiful Mosquito bomber in any vehicle.
