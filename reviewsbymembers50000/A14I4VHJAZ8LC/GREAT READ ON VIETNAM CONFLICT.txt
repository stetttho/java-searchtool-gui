 Hubert, Kentucky, your loony-left rhetoric rant is at least as political partisan paranoid as the one you are attacking, and a hell of a lot less substantiated.  Where would one start with you,  feral radicalism and intellectual laziness for starters..I'm actually in a way cheered that there are so many retro 60s throw-backs appearing suddenly since Invasion Iraq,  I LOVED the 60s, especially the flower-power and psychadelic music...the downer  is when some idiots make it through to the 21st century with all the drawbacks and none of the great music and love of all kinds.   I like the book, btw, I admit I didnt even pick up on the issues in the negative review below, but I read it in the 80s, I think, I had different views. I probably sounded something like Hubert, especially after some Scotch and Coke.  Which is scary. I didnt pick up on all these negatives such as the stuff about Ho, but that reviewer sounds like he has some idea of what he speaks. You could do worse than this book, I especially liked the anecdotes by Green Beret Mr Christian.
