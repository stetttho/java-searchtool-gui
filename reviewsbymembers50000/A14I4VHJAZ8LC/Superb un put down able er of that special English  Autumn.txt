 Superb account of the battle from initial stages through the height and climax of the battle, I loved the countless anecdotes, some funny, some sad, some grim, some victory, some defeat, some life, some death, one  German fighter pilot in deep trouble in his twin-engined Messerschmitt belly-lands at an English farm, but ploughs into the farmhouse killing most of the family, including children, the pilot is in tears and inconsolable, and comforted by surrounding residents who race to the scene. At an RAF fighter-field, a Dornier bomber bellies in shot-up by British fighters, grinds to a metallic halt. An RAF ground officer cautious but intrigued approaches the eerily still wreck, looks up to find himself staring from metres away at the wrong end of one of the bombers machine-guns in the cockpit,  and a German rear-gunners face  squinting through the cross-hairs gunsight at him. The RAF man freezes, believing this is his final moment, but nothing happens- the gunner has been hit and killed instantly during the fight above, and is still manning his gun defending his aircraft, frozen in his final living pose. A Polish RAF pilot shoots down another Dornier  bomber filled with the hated Nazi occupiers and torturers of his homeland, follows it closely as it makes a skilful crash landing, and sees survivors inside the bomber scrambling  to exit and safety. The Polish pilot sees no reason there should be any escape  from his victim, and puts a long carefully-aimed burst into the wrecked bombers cockpit- there will be no live Luftwaffe prisoners for the Home Guard and British Army to round up this time. Another German bomber ploughs in stricken elsewhere and its men receives  different treatment from the defenders- RAF pilots and ground-crew leap from cover on the still under-attack airfield and prize  their way into the aircraft to rescue the  trapped German airmen inside struggling to escape the burning wreck- at this moment, with these men they have minutes ago fought and tried to kill,  there are no Germans, no   British,  no enemies, just fellow pilots  and the universal horror  of  airmen trapped burning  in aeroplanes.   An Me109 with with Luftwaffe 'Experten' aboard  comes upon a frantically-climbing Hurricane squadron from the 5## Auxiliary Air Force units, unaware of the Germans presence, the Hurricanes climb serenely in line astern, the German begins with the rearmost man, picks off 4 of the Hurricanes and sends them flaming, while the rest of the squadron continue climbing oblivious to the rape of the squadron  behind them..... New Zealand RAF legend and daredevil Al Deere's Spitfire is bombed by a Stuka while taking off,the Spitfire flips upside down, fuselage snapped in two, Deere dangles inverted from his straps, unable to free himself,  almost unharmed but soaked in spurting gasoline from the Spitfires ruptured full tanks, as fires begin to crackle in the shocked amputated Spitfires wreck.   If you only buy one book of the many on the legendary Battle of Britain, you could do much worse than choose this one, or the more technical and analytical but splendid 'Fighter' by Len Deighton.
