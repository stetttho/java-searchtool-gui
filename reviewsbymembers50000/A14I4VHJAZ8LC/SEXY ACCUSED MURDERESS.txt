   On 19 April 1985 Christopher Kevin Hatfield was murdered in the lounge room of his Sydney home. He was shot four times in the temple and once in the chest with a silenced .22 calibre weapon, while his wife Irena and her two daughters slept upstairs.  Fifteen years later, Irena's estranged lover went to the police with the allegation that she had confessed her guilt to him. Irena Hatfield was charged with first-degree murder. After a high-profile trial that saw her vilified by the media, a jury of Irena's peers declared her innocent.  The identity of the murderer and the reasons behind the crime remain a mystery.  From the moment she discovered her murdered husband's body to the revelation that someone she had loved was determined to destroy her; to the indignities of prison and the humiliation of notoriety, Irena Hatfield has clung to her sanity.  Irena has spent her whole life battling the scars of a damaged childhood while yearning for the solace of true love. Her story is filled with lust, betrayal, injustice and an inclination for choosing the wrong men.  A riveting tale of human survival, Irena shows how just wanting to be loved can get you into serious trouble.  Who is Irena Hatfield? Sex kitten? Self-made woman? A victim, or a survivor? Irena tells all.       AS ONE REVIEWER PUTS IT, IS LURID, GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY OF MURDER, IRENA WAS PRETTY  "VORACIOUS" THE BOOK GIVES AS MUCH ABOUT HER PROWESS AND TASTES IN MEN, AS THE CRIME AND JUSTICE SYSTEM.    SUBJECT OF A 60 MINUTES RICHARD CARLETON STORY A FEW YEARS BACK, SHE VERY QUICKLY CAME ACROSS TO ME IN THE SAME WAY IN THAT STORY.IE,  VERY "HOT PANTS"   IN THAT STORY, SHE ALSO CAME ACROSS TO ME AS GUILTY AS HELL. OF KNOCKING HUBBY, AS WELL..BUT, SHE SAYS SHE DIDNT DO THAT,  AND SO DID HER JURY...  THE BOOK IS ENTERTAINING...:)   THANKS.
