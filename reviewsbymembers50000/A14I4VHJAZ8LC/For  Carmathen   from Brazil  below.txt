 'I'm not sure how good your review is,perhaps this is just another battle of Britain book, and not the best,  Carmathen, ........but Peter Townsend is associated with no 85 Squadron RAF, the famous Hexagons, rather than 43 squadron. He is in most RAF 'order of battle' as CO of 85. 85 is a very famous unit, perhaps one of the 2 most famous RAF fighter squadrons, the Hexagon emblem is seen in WW1 in lineups of SE5a's in pictures, and Hurricanes in Battle of France and Battle of Britain pics.   I think most RAF historians will back me up on that. All the best.
