 Havent seen it for years, sadly, although 'Hell to Eternity' with Jeffrey Hunter is a fairly-frequent TV re-run, 'No man is an Island' seems forgotten. Seen it at a drive-in as a child, scenes which stick in memory were the early part of the movie the shock of the first Japanese attack on Guam, some of his friends killed in Japanese strafing, his remaining friends being killed off one by one as they flee the victorious Japanese, one shot by a Japanese in a million-to-one shot while hiding in a straw-covered cart, another stung  by a scorpion, till just the main Jeffrey Hunter character(Tweed , I gather from the other reviews) remains, to stay at large and harass the Japanese as well: the printing-press spreading encouraging-news of the US fighting back with the Dooloittle-raid, the Japanese smelling the news-pamphletts and declaring "ether-Hospital!"(ooops, they are onto them!)  the sword-wielding officer he and the brave Filipinos poison and cover-up, his body dumped on a beach and eaten by crabs,lol,  and the final rescue by the US destroyer he warns and saves from the Japanese gun-emplacement on the island.( and the destroyer's sailors  racial epithets which dont sit well with this man who has lived and fought for 2 or 3 years with these America-loyal people) Pacific-war fans dont get the run of films that were made about the German war, but this is one Id put in any selection of top-5 faves. Has 'atmosphere' and good moments, is just entertaining yarn.As an Australian, I always was particularly interested in the WW2 Japanese and these Pacific campaigns, to this day. Good story, and Hunter did a few Pacific-war movies.Classical genre, and above-average.
