 From back cover: Surprised there is no editorial review on Amazon for this book, with Islam as in the news as it has been last 3 years in particular, and last decade before THAT milestone event, Everyone  or a lot of people 'seeking to undertand' the religion/politic of the Islamic world and the dynamics and problems of the high-visability Islamic communities within the USA and Western Europe and places like Australia,  I really am surprised arent more reviews, but here's the spiel on back-cover at least.  "" Muslim women, symbols of honour for their men, speak out in this timely and provocative book that takes us into the volatile heartland of Islam, the worlds fastest-growing religion. With a wide-range of telling, often horrific stories about the ways in which Muslim women are abused and oppressed by their menfolk, PRICE of HONOUR shows how restrictions on women act as a barometer for measuring both the growth of fundamentalism and the Muslim regimes' willingness to appease extremists. Informed, candid and honest, PRICE OF HONOUR is a controversial look inside Muslim society today, and a powerful wake-up call to the world. ""
