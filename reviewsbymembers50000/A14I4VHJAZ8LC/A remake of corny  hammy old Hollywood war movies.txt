 We do need an updated Pacific-war film as a companion to 'Private Ryan', perhaps, 'Beach Red', 'None but the Brave', 'Sands of Iwo Jima' or even Jeffrey Hunter's entertaining 60s duo 'Hell to Eternity' and 'No Mans an Island' updated to current production values: Well, a movie about a very obscure and specialised aspect of the Pacific War was probably never likely to be it, it subsequently failed to teach us much about the role of Navajo code-talkers in the war, and failed to be much of a regular war-film to be taken seriously either. Opening close quarters Marines vs Japanese battle-scene on Guadalcanal was actually promising and rather graphically impressive, this seems to be a pattern with mediocre war-efforts lately, an impressive staged opening battle-scene, then its all downhill from there. 'Harts War' did the same thing. After that, cliches abound, accuracy to any typical Pacific-Island tactical war situation that Im familiar with eludes  me, and consists of Japanese soldiers repeatedly springing -out individually or in small group, charging yelling down little hills and being over and over again put away with Chicago choppers.  (Like a Japanese imitation of the old 'Combat'TV-show Germans) Caje doesnt really work even in casting, doesnt really know how to go about portraying the cliched stressed-out traumatised veteran, to be fair he probably gets about as far as expected with a 50s pedestrian script and a director who by the sound of his name cut his teeth on Hong-Kong chop-sockey movies, and if it had Kung-Fu instead of rifles artillery and bayonette charges, this would actually be an above-average contribution to that genre. He must have been instinctively- tempted to make greater use of the sword-wielding Japanese-officers.The two Native-Americans and their knife-fights hand-to-hand with the Japanese troops are actually well-done and a highlight in a low dark landscape, , theres that martial-arts film experience shining again.( Was this revenge for the Japanese Samurai that messed up all those native-American warriors  in the cornfield in that cool Charles Bronson-Toshiro Mifune western  years ago?) Sets and costumes are ok, credit where its due, the Japanese strong-points with a camouflaged period field-gun look about right. Like 'U-571' and  'Harts War', ok for keeping the kids out of your hair for a couple of hours. Other than that, Native-americans would be the only other target-audience.Even so, Im not aware that Native-American Code-talkers  actually made possible the Allied victory over Japan, I'd need more convincing than this sensationalising, misleading melodrama.
