 I have this book in a little paperback, and refuse to sell it on ebay as I have many of my private collection, so that tells you somehting, even though I got it almost for nothing at a Sunday trash market. Traces the Soviet airforce from WW1 through to the modern era, includes obscure chapters like the Western expedition into North Russia in the white vs Red Bolsheviks/Mensheviks power struggle in 1919-1920, and a chapter on the attack on Finland, including much info from the Finnish point of view of that David/Goliath struggle, but the main game is the Great Patriotic War as USSR called their part of ww2, and there are many stories of white-knuckle combats Soviets vs Luftwaffe, in Yak and La-5 fighters for example, and the stories of great Russian aces like Kojedub, who at 60 kills was far higher scoring than any western Allied ace, and perhaps all of it against strong-quality Luftwaffe opposition.  I have it in paperback, would recommend as a compact addition to any ww2 or combat-plane enthusiast library.
