 Reviewer "Dave", for one thing, the author-narrator is a female prison officer, not male. I'm not really sure we are talking about the same book,there may be some confusion on your part,  this one is Australian.  From Back-cover:  from back-cover:Screw....is the story of a woman who spent over a decade in uniform behind the bluestone walls of the Victorian penal system. She worked with male and female prisoners, of whom she tells stories of comedy and tragedy, hope and despair,life and death.  She also tells of her own expectations, achievements, and disappointments.  the book has no easy answers to the problems of the prisons, but contains experiences and observations which no serious proponent of of penal reform can ignore.  It also gives glimpses of the problem which eventually led  to her resignation- her 10-year losing battle with the Prison Investigations Unit, who defied her attempts to  get a false accusation removed from her record. Ultimately, her case was investigated, but the investigation was conducted  by the very officer against whom she was complaining. Sadly, this weakness in the system-one which could easily be put right-is now further from solution than ever, the remaining flimsy safeguards against victimisation of officers having been dismantled.  Pat Merlo  was born in Carlton in 1951, one of four sisters. she worked for Telecom for thirteen years, and then left to start a family. Two years later she entered the prison service, rising to rank of Senior Prison Officer. She is currently employed as a Court Officer in the privatised Prison Service.
