 Ive already wriiten an appropriately disdainful appraisal of this trainwreck 'warfilm',and thats not meaning to say its of the stature of 'Von Ryans Express' or 'the Train' either.But  reading some of the other  reviews,  I retained two comments I realy liked so will bring forward.  This Malick is apparently an arthouse(s-house) director, well, as somebody said, this was an arthouse director turned-loose with a big-house budget, so you get a 50-million dollar serving of pretentious boredom instead of half a million dollars worth . I respected arthouse directors more before this film, because up till this, they hadnt gotten me into their showroom. This ripped me off for whatever the ticket cost me as well, it wont be forgotten. At least I went alone, I didnt recommend and entice anyone else along to be ripped-off. And the next review I saw that contained something far more profound than 'Line itself was actually a glowing review,5-stars,  where among other things the reviewer compared it to 'Empires of the Sun', among one or two others.  Baby, aint that the truth, thats the ideal companion  to it. Unfortunately, with THAT, I didnt see it alone, I was responsible for wasting a friends money and evening as well as my own.   Memorable line  'Hey, P-51, Cadillac of the Skies!' (from a kid whod been in Japanese internment since the fall of Hongkong, obviously the extensive Japanese  concentration-camp   library contained detailed information about the P51 Mustang fighter that hadnt even been heard of by the outside world at the time of HongKong') Yep yep yep.   You wont find any finer expensive turkeys last 20 years.Amazon should offer them as one of their discount sets.  'Thin Red Line' and 'Empires of the Sun'
