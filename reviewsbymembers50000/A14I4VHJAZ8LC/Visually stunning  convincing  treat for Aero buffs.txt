 Reading the other reviews, several of which were very impressive, wouldnt find much to disagree in MrGalatis comments, I was taken back to my own last viewing of this movie, a VHS, havent seen the DVD. I also had read the book, though after my first view of the film in my childhood. Its a thick book, and several sordid sub-plots including the blackmail attempt on Stachel by a member of groundcrew and a pilot which Stachel deals with murderously would have made the movie overlong, but the fatal low-level buzzing of the bridge seen in the movie resemble that bookplot in part. I wasnt surprised to read right here that the aircraft were specially constructed for this big-budget epic, let me point out there are no deHavilland Tiger Moths with Maltese crosses on them to appall the buff-viewer here, a convincing-looking legendary 'Richtofen' even puts in a brief 'cameo-appearance' in an impressive looking triplane, in what must have been chronologically Richtofens final days before death.Most of the British planes are SE5a's.   The movie captures the WW1 atmosphere from the early gloomy morning scenes at the airfield and the German pilots ordering pink champagne at the mess-bar. This film is from the German viewpoint, and several sequences depicting the destruction of Allied troops or airmen may disturb some somewhat, there are a couple of graphic and convincing sequences depicting grim hand to hand between the ground forces that our characters soar above.  The sequence where Stachel 'captures' a British two-seater and escorts it back to his base and what occurs there is grim and war-authentically brutal and insightful into wars moralities, to me, Peppard is accused of cold-bloodedness maybe even a  war-crime for his handling of  a situation which changes suddenly to foil his chivalrous attempt to capture rather than destroy a British two-seater,  alas the situation looks like one thing to the witnesses on the ground who cannot see crucial events  unfolding 20 metres ahead of Stachel high in the air, the real situation that only Stachel can see is quite different.Of course, Stachels reasons for attempting to spare the helpless British plane and its occupants are  not entirely selfless either. Peppards eventual engineered fate is a further comment on war and the people who run it, as well as what can happen to you if you assume to fool around with other peoples women, even if they dont seem to mind up front.I think the concept and background of this final scene is based on the story  of a late-war German type, the Fokker D-viii monoplane and the problems encountered with that.More for the aero-history -buffs. For the kids whove seen rubbish like 'Top Gun', or worse still 'pearl harbor', come see a movie with real aeroplanes doing real flying probably also actual life and death in the stunts themselves, no foxy ladies in leather jackets telling you how to handle Russian MiGs here, and no  American fighter-pilots flying B-25 bombers  to China and taking on Japanese infantry hand-to-hand either, or P-40s and Zero fighters that move like F-16s either.No CGI,no boy-band looking cast, just grim ambitious though courageous anti-heroes,with some conniving,      breathtaking real aeroplanes and grim real-looking aerial killing. Top 60s-movie Vid or DVD, really, if your an aeroplane or war-movie  person and havent seen it, chances are youll be blown away, or rather shot-down!
