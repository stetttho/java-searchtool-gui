 Need I say more? I had no idea till today this was  Spielberg movie, so this didnt influence me to waste my money on an overnight hire of it.I dont know how that happned. 'P51-Cadillac of the skies'?   Sheesh. This kid has been in  a Japanese concentration-camp( and lets not break PC-code presenting Japanese internment-camps as harsh uncomfortable places, or next-door Airbase Japanese fighter-pilots as not being inclined to befriend and help father young English boys in WW2)anyway, hes been in this friendly Japanese prisoner -camp since the Fall of Hongkong in 1941, and yet knows all about the P51 Mustang fighter, obviously from the well-equiped extensive Japanese internment-camp library, with all the necessary data and tales of derring-do about state of the art American enemy fighter aircraft in 1944 or so. How Spielberg went on to Private Ryan from 'Empire of the Sun' might make  a startling movie in itself.
