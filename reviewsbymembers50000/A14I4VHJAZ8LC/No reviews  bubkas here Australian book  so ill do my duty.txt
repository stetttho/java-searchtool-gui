   no editorial or reader reviews, so being an Australian book, I btter be a patriot and at least insert the back-cover spiel, so folks can see what the hell its about...  this is the story of Madame Joy...She represents the human desire for the kind of pleasures only drugs can induce.......History  presents us with many truths about our relationship with Madame Joy:that we've always used drugs, and probably always will, that regulation is a matter of survival, that drugs induce pleasure, but not happines.Our truth the first casualty of the drug-war, is a global nightmare in which we flounder: too battered to stay the same, too scared to change.   Madame Joy seeks to remedy this situation, by presenting the socio-political, emotional and spiritual aspects of drug-use in an intelligent, reasonable  and entertaining format.   In the end, there is only one reason for telling the story of human drug-use, and the politics of its regulation  and that is to find clues for the construction of a wiser future.   The authors, Monique Berkhout and Francesca Robinson , both work in the area of alcohol and other drug treatment. They share a passion for social justice, an interest in politics, and a love and deep respect for the power of narrative to cast new light on tired topics. Madame Joy was written out of their concern for a more vigorous and informed debate on drugs and their use in our society.
