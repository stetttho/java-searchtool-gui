 Czuchlewski has written a novel that has all the ingedients for an entertaining, self-consciously "postmodern" novel, but his prose is unpolished---actually, it's just plain bad (full of cliches and clunky exposition). The plot has some holes, and the ending is not as "shocking" as another reviewer has said, but the novel is full of Borges-like ideas.  Frankly, you're better off just reading Borges. The Muse Asylum reads like a Paul Auster novel ghostwritten by John Grisham.  It contains too much expository dialogue, and too many "clever" touches--Does anyone actually believe for a second that patients and staff at a mental facility for the artistically gifted would refer to the place as "the Muse Asylum"???--David, you're straining your narrative credibility with that one (as well as the totally inconceivable idea that a reclusive author would, after being photographed and confronted at his apartment, not move into a new place---clearly he didn't stay hidden for decades by being that stupid!). I hope Czuchlewski continues to publish novels, because he clearly has some great ideas.  I just hope that his prose improves enough to tell his story with some style next time.
