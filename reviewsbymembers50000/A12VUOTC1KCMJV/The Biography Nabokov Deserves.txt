 In my review of Vladimir Nabokov: The Russian Years, I say that "I am grateful to Boyd for his serious scholarship, his lively prose, and his close analysis of Nabokov's oeuvre."  That comment applies  wholeheartedly to this volume as well. As a professor of literature at  Cornell, Nabokov taught his students to focus on the details of literature.   He taught them that the small details of a fictional world were far more  important than broad generalizations about literary trends.  One infamous  midterm question asked the students to describe the wallpaper in a  character's bedroom--a description that was only provided in a single line  of the novel.  Nabokov believed that good readers paid attention to details  like this, and specific, startling detail was what made reality beautiful.   I think Nabokov would have approved of Boyd's detailed, beautiful  biography. Boyd is a good Nabokovian.  He sees the details of Nabokov's  life and presents them to us vividly.  He also analyzes the details of  Nabokov's work, and provides us with lucid, and often surprising, readings  and interpretations's of Nabokov's novels. In The American Years Boyd  reminds us why Nabokov was once hailed as perhaps the greatest writer of  the latter half of the 20th Century.  And after staying up all night to  finish the enthralling story of Nabokov's life, I would have to say that  Boyd is right.   Nabokov will certainly be remembered as one of the  greats, and Boyd has given Nabokov the biography he deserves.
