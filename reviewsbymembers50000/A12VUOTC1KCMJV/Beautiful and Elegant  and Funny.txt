 When I teach poems to my 9th graders, I always give them a taste of Lawrence Raab's poetry because, as I tell them, "he captures the lyric beauty of our media-saturated culture" (it's fun to say this to  14-year-olds--they just kind of stare blankly at these sort of statements).   And when I read "Attack of the Crab Monsters" aloud to them,  some of them laugh, some of them (figuratively) scratch their heads, and  some of them keep doodling obliviously in their notebooks, but then I read  it aloud again and most of them begin to realize that poetry isn't all  intricate puzzles, or frilly romances, or political statement...poetry is  what you make it. This new collection by Raab reveals a poet who has  mastered his voice, and it's a voice that is poignant, witty, and profound.   Raab's poetry tends to focus on the small, perhaps overlooked, details of  life, like the dreams of his young daughter, the inexplicable joy of a dog,  or the reminiscence of childhood fantasies. Poems like "Great  Art" or "Another Argument About the Impossible" deal with  the artistic process itself.   They comment on the thinking that occurs  between the lines, behind the paint, and in so doing, quietly reveal an  essential truth about life:  we could have done things differently, but the  other choices wouldn't have made things better, just...different. I  highly recommend THE PROBABLE WORLD to anyone who likes to think deeply  about the small things in life.
