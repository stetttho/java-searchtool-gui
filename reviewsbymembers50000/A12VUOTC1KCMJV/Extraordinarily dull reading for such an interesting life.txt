 "A Beautiful Mind" is promoted as the story of a brilliant mathemetician who overcame mental illness to win a Nobel prize in economics.  This is misleading.  He won the prize for work he had done 40  years earlier, in spite of his history of mental illness.   This  biography is no Rocky-of-mathematics comeback story.  It's the dry,  detailed, well-researched, yet ultimately superficial tale of a man who saw  the world a bit differently, and yet the author gives us little sense of  what it was like to be John Nash.  She tells us what happened in his life,  gives us the dates of the important events, and relays anecdotes, but never  truly gives us a sense of what life was like for Nash.   After reading  the biography I feel that I know what he did, but not what he was truly  like, and that is a disappointment.
