 Apparently other reviewers and cover blurbologists have decided that Monahan's cuteness and occasionally (very occasionally) witty sentences make him THE GREATEST COMIC WRITER IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, EVER!  But, he's not.  Oh, so very not. This novel lacks substance and isn't even funny.  It has one good Wasteland reference that made me smile but that's about it.  I found the narrative inordinately superficial and trite, and the other reviewer's references to Nabokov leave me founded with dumbness.  Have they ever read Nabokov? Perhaps I judge this novel harshly because in the same 24-hour period I also read ERASURE by Percival Everett which is a fantastic version of the erudite comical satircal novel.  Everett  succeeds on every level, while Monahan just cracks meaningless jokes at the expense of his own characters. William Monahan, I urge you to take your vast wealth of knowledge and write something that matters.
