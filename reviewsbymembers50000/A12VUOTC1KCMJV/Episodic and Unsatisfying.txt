 After reading the glorious reviews of the 80+ other readers who decided to share their thoughts, I had high expectations for this novel. I was disappointed.  The plot is episodic and baggy, and the ending is corny, but  not in a hip retro-fashion either.  It's certainly not a  "classic" of science fiction.  Read Sturgeon or Asimov before you  waste your time on this.
