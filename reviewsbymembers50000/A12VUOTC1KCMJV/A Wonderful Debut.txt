 I've had a difficult time lately finding contemporary novels that interest me beyond the dust jacket.  Most novels look great, sound great, but lack substance.  Chip Kidd's debut is one of the rare exceptions. Kidd manages, in a relatively clean, simple narrative, to explore the depths of the human need to create.  He does so with wit, vigor, and insight.  I literally could not put the novel down once I started it last night (and I really could have used those extra hours of sleep--but the novel was too engrossing). I have one question though:  Does anyone know why Chip Kidd thanks The Berkshire Mall (of all places)? Overall, a brilliant work of contemporary fiction.  Buy it and enjoy.
