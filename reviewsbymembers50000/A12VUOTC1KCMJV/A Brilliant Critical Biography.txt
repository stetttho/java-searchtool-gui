 Brian Boyd's work on Nabokov has been hailed by scholars around the globe; this biography (and the companion volume on The American Years) proves Boyd's brilliance. When I purchased the two volumes of the biography, I  was a bit intimidated by their sheer size.  The Russian Years alone is  nearly 700 pages, and The American Years even larger.  Yet I soon found  myself enthralled in Boyd's detailed portrait of Nabokov and his work. In  The Russian Years, Boyd, as a good non-Freudian reader of Nabokov (as  Nabokov would have wished), provides intimate details of Nabokov's early  family life and his trials and tribulations as an emigre writer in Europe.   Boyd provides a fascinating account of Nabokov's father, who's  assassination would impact young Nabokov so much (and later, provide  inspiration for the "assassination" in Pale Fire).  But Boyd,  thankfully, does not try to explain Nabokov through the death of his  father; he meticulously lays out the facts and builds a complex portait of  the man, and his fiction. To be honest, I was far more interested in  reading about Nabokov's American years, but after reading this book, I am  grateful to Boyd for his serious scholarship, his lively prose, and his  close analysis of Nabokov's oeuvre.  I'm glad that I didn't pass up the  chance to read this wonderful work.
