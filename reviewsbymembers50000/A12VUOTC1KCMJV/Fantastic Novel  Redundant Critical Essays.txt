 White Noise is one of the greatest postmodern novels ever written, and I will never look at academia (or the supermarket) the same way again.  The critical essays, however, lack variety.  Perhaps too little time has passed to give perspective on DeLillo's work, but the essayists in this volume  continually focus on the same inidents and ideas from similar critical  perspectives.  No doubt this book will endure long enough for a more  multifaceted critical edition to surface.  For now, enjoy the novel itself  as a brilliant social critique done with style and humor.
