 "The Player of Games," while mainly taking place outside of the Culture itself is, in some ways, at the heart of the Culture novels.  It's about how the Culture thinks from the inside out, and about how the Culture  differs from other, more Imperial, systems. Gurgeh is a master of all  games, and when he is coerced into playing the most complex game ever  devised, versus the Empire's players who've literally grown up with the  game, he is unable to resist the challenge.  It's an interesting premise,  and the more you learn, the more you learn that it is more of life  simulation than a game.  All of this, unfortunately, makes the final act of  the story a bit less than unpredictable, yet as in any Banks story, his  intellect shines through his writing.   Iain Banks dazzles the reader  with ideas throughout the story and that's more than enough to make me  recommend this novel.
