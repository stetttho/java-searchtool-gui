 Nostalgia is good.  But as we all know, nothing is as good as we remember it. Whoever decided to select these three episodes to kick off the Twilight Zone DVD collection must have been relying on his memory of these  three stinkers, because they certainly aren't worth seeing  again. "Night of the Meek" is a simplistic morality tale shot  on black and white VIDEO.  Not only is it ugly to watch, it doesn't have  enough of a story to hold the audience's interest.  Art Carney does a  respectable job as a down-and-out department store Santa, but it's tough to  look good on video, even if you are a skilled actor like Carney.    "The Invaders" at least looks decent, on film, since the  Twilight Zone producers thankfully gave up their b/w video experiment after  only a handful of episodes.  David Duchovny has stated that this is one of  his favorite episodes, and it's got a nice twist to it, but you can see it  coming after the first few minutes.  The acting and "special  effects" are so hokey, however, that the one-note irony of the story  is almost unbearable to sit through.  I'm sure it's a fondly remembered  episode, but it's better remembered, where it's compressed into it's best  moments, than viewed, where it just drags for nearly 22 minutes. The  final episode of this DVD, "Nothing in the Dark" is a sweet,  supernatural story about fear.  The most interesting aspect of the episode  isn't the story, however, but the appearance of a young Robert Redford as a  police officer.  This is clearly the best episode of the three, but it's  too melodramatic, too staged, to be anything but a didactic look at death.   And it's certainly not outstanding enough to save this collection. Avoid  this DVD.  These episodes are best left where they belong.  In the past.   In your memory.
