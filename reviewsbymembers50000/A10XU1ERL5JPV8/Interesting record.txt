 'Valerian' is a nice record that includes some nice songs. The instrumental music mostly leaded by Saisse's piano, fretless bass and percussions find some beautiful moments. The opening track is a very nice that makes you feel you're really is 'The Land of Morning Calm'. The elegant piano that drives on the song is a trademark all over the album. 'Ma Muse' is a very emotional tune. The percussion and virtuose piano make this record a very nice example of enjoyment you can get listening to a nice new age album.
