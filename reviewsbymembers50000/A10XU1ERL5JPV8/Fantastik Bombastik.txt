 This is the first album I ever had in my hands from the good Joe. Weel, at first I though... what a noisy guitar guy... now I think... this was the right record to have a first listen from Satriani's work. Now I find the cover interesting, then it seemed for a second class heavy metal band. It holds what I still consider the greatest gem Satchie's ever done up to now: 'Echo'. Closing the album, this song shows all the deep feelings all the other more groovy or heavy songs seem to hide. It is a really moving and emotional tune. Would be nice for you to listen to it before any other song from Joe Satriani 'cos the middle part will really blow your mind. There's a bunch of good quality songs as well in here. Look at that super-hero cross your sight on the first seconds of the opening title, 'Surfing With The Alien'. Surf with him and feel how nice is flying in a multi-coloured dream together with Joe the hero and his guitar... a marvel!!!! Ice#9 (costed me a few seconds just to find the #) is a very melodic and driving heavy-metal rocker!!!! Stuck to the most basic rock band format, the song really rox. Try it and lose your shoes on the run!!! 'Circles' is simply quality. That clean guitar played as sixths and the great surprise at the middle (hear it, not ask for it!!!). By the way, 'Always...' is a classic and a beautiful instrumental ballad that came together with a very nice and angelic video. 'Lords of Karma' is how brutality rhymes with quality in Satch's guitar. The album is a masterpiece of hard rock. Listen to eat and burn your Ricky Martin's CDs with a lighter!!!!!!!!!
