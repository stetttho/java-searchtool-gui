 Although I knew little material from this great contemporary instrumental composer before, this work and 'The Perfect Flaw' are enough to rate him between the highlights of the lot you can find today, for various reasons: the honestity of this unvirtuose and deep kind of music, that seems to compress the most intense feelings and impulses in its apparent tranquility, and the strangeness and originality, among the beauty, of most of the melodies, are only two spare examples. It's the kind of music you need to listen to a few times to let it grow into you. For me the most captivating tracks after a lot of listenings are 'Intemperate', superb in its incredible strangeness and the use of an 'oboe damore' that adds colour with its sharp, air-stinging sound, 'Hum', a gloomy, majestic title that seems to stop literally the flow of time, 'Slippery Hours' and 'Map of the Warm Night'. The thing I like most from this composer is the lack of fear in creating seemingly disonant and contradictory textures of sound in an extremely personal way, disguising them into a simple diagram thats full of colour tinges. Its a challenge to try with such a different kind of music. And youll like it.
