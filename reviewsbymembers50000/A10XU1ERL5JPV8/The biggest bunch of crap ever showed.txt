 This anti-artistic kind of mierda should be forbidden for people older than 3 years old. The belle Chenoa spreads up a huge set of horrendous lyrics with a complete lack of feeling and her way of singing is pompous and inadequately sounding.   Don't buy this disc. **^*^* This work is crap. ^*^*^* Save for the best. *^*^* Keep off this filth. ^*^*^* I said.
