 Apart from been the numer one of viruose bassists in New Age style, this guy has the ability of creating nice atmospheres and textures, as you can tell in the first track, the delicious 'Welcoming' which for me reminds as a highlight of the style.  Another great song is 'Homecoming', an extremely optimistic tune with a nice leading soprano saxophone. 'Sung to Sleep' is sweet and the haunting, strange and really short 'Thunder Tactics part II' adds mystery to the whole. Listen to the album and you'll have proven I am right in everything I said.
