 This is the last Beatles album including only love related lyrics. It's still the last time they won't break their format of just nice songs without any big surprise of originality or psychedelic elements. But still it includes some of the strongest songs ever made by them, like 'Ticket to Ride', You've got to Hide Your Love Away' or 'You're Gonna Lose that Girl'  from Lennon or 'Yesterday' from McCartney. John sings in a very strong and emotional way in 'You're Gonna Lose that Girl' , and the backing vocals create a nice effect, although they seem for a while just some Caribbean chorus. If Lennon's songs are stronger than in 'A Hard Day's Night', McCartney's are a lot poorer, that's what happens to 'Another Girl'. 'The Night Before' shows how good he can rock although. The B side's obviously poorer, but 'It's Only Love' is a good song, and 'Yesterday', the only song in the history of the Beatles featuring only one member of the band, is a beautiful ballad although I feel it's overrated beside better ones like 'And I Love Her' as some reviewer said before. So this is a nice record, and the words from the great song 'Help' were a premonition and spoke about the change to come: "I've changed my mind, I've opened all the doors".
