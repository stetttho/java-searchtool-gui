 For a start, I have to praise Larry L. Looney's review about this album, and I have to say everything I can say about it is said by him already in a no better way.    Nothing to say about immaculate Teresa Salgueiro's voice, as well as the beautiful ensembre of Spanish guitars (tuned in a didderent way), cello and accordion. A very mediterranean but deep result and the perfect album for slow and nostalgic afternoons like this one for me.   The most reathtaking song of the album in my opinion is the amazing 'Cores do Sol' in which a slow synthesised start mixes the traditional acoustic sound with a rather new age, almost pop psychedelic feel. Another very deep and beautiful song is 'O Mar'. The thing that haunts me from 'Ven' is the lyrics as well as the soaring cello, emotional and strong, being the heartbeat of the song in itself.     The rest of the themes vary from fado's sadness and melancholy to joyful and peaceful natural evocations, and always the transparent voice of eresa Salgueiro and the simpleness but deepness of the lyrics lead you into a place full of time that goes slow, into your feelings and into perfect peace.
