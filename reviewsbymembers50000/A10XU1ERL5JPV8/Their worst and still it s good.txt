 Well, between the 10 or 11 (depends on your own opinion) Project albums it is maybe the weakest, but it still brings some nice fresh new things to the whole. Mainly, a pop-oriented turn of the ban which creates this short (only eight songs) but very easy listening album. The opening is maybe the most successful song from them apart from 'Eye in the Sky'. A nice, quick song with a lot of energy and bassist David Paton's nice vocals as well. 'Sooner or Later' is a very hummable tune, and 'Days are Numbers' is one of the most memorable Project's ballads. But the most interesting for me is the last three songs: 'Hawkeye', the album's only instrumental, in a highly pop format but still works. The next one, a highly beatle-styled tune sung by Colin Blunstone, 'Somebody Out There', a good quality composition with a nice two-part electric guitar solo. And the closing, 'The Same Old Sun', a very overlooked ballad, my favourite of the album, with simple but beautiful words and beautiful chorus as well. This album is maybe the one for starters. Go for it!!!!
