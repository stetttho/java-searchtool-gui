 Maybe the best Nightnoise work along with 'Parting Tide' and 'At the End of the Evening', this is a highly evocative collection of moody and reflective Celtic, instrumental themes full of subtleness, technical quality and high spiritual pretentions, resulting in the sweetest and most magical soft music you've ever heard. The opener 'Timewinds' is a very uplifting tune in the very mood of Mike Oldfield, if leaded by superb fiddle by Billy Oskay, sadly out of the band now. 'Perchance to Dream' is one of the softest and purest melodies you'll ever hear and grey and misty 'Hourglass' recalls the passing of time in a little Irish country village, with a sense of joy and hope at the end. 'Tundra Summer' sounds ominous and transcendental and 'I Still Remember' sounds adventurous and full of feeling.  'Something of Time' is maybe second to 'The Parting Tide' in bringing subtle and extremely beautiful sounds to your ears. Still a very deep work but not as much as 'At the End of The Evening'. Maybe that's its good thing, the balance between deepness and objective quality. It is a piece of art indicated for romantics and smooth instrumental likers.
