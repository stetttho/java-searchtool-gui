 This is a very good quality album from the interesting Argentinian keyboardist Lito Vitale. Still, too much of the quality in this album relies on two themes, the opening one and the incredible, outstandingly beautiful long track that gives the name to the album. 'Historias de la Cruz del Sur' is a wonderful theme full of Latin American moods and top class quality smooth jazz. The rest of the album is quite average except for the beauty of some other themes. But it's a worthwhile album if you like quality jazzy-new age.
