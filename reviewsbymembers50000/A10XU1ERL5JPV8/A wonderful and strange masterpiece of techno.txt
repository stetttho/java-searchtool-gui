 Anthony Phillips shows here his polivalency as he started as a guitarist in Genesis and now makes this conceptual record as a brilliant synthesist. The record is a caleidoscope of sounds and rythms and the exquisite complexity of it doesn't mean it's not uplifting and entertaining to hear. The originality of some melodies and the way some rythms follow others make this record unique and different to any other one.
