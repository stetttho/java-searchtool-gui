 Oboist Russell Walder and pianist Ira Stein appear as the perfect couple as they sound together just like one musical soul. The opening melody of the first song gives you an idea of the wonder hidden in this album. Adventurous tracks like `First Light' (the best song of the album), beauties like the first song or `Neutral Angel', a perfect combination of oboe's feeling, piano's elegance and drum's pulse and a marvellous sound travel, emotional songs like the last one, `Flying in Red Square'... the album is full of sensitiveness and the captivating sound of Walder's oboe make this duo second to none.
