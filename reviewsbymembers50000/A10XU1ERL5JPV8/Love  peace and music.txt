   The most beautiful and subtle feelings about Christmas lie in this album. A great combination of artist with a lot of coherence between each one's inspirations create this saga which is a masterpiece in itself. Every Christmas time I hear my tape with this and the 2nd part... it's completely magical and gets you into the real feeling and the innocence and magic of Christmas. I'll briefly comment each song:     1. Little Drummer Boy - beautiful version 2. Hopeful - Michael Manring - big hearted piano 3. Christmas Song - Steve Erquiaga - nice and peaceful guitar 4. Veni Emmanuel - Turtle Island String Quartet - wonderful chamber music 5. Christmas Bells - John Gorka - a folkie song 6. Lullay, Lully - Barbara Higbie - stunning ballad; magic 7. Trepak - The Modern Mandolin Quartet - funny song 8. Of the Father's Love Begotten - Tim Story - very religious 9. Coventry Carol - Paul McCandless - ooh... perfect harmony 10. Sleepers, Awake - Andy Narell - nice steel drums 11. Snow Is Lightly Falling - Nightnoise - absolute magic 12. Pavane - Liz Story - just nice 13. In the Bleak Midwiner - Pierce Pettis -- beautiful voice  The last two songs I don't have in my tape. This is one of the most beautiful and heartful albums I've ever heard. I never will forget it.
