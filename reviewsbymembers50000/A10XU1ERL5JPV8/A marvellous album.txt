 The keyboardist Wayne Gratz gets in this album a great level of quality with beautiful and evocative songs. There are good tracks like the strange and almost psychedelic 'Dream Tower', the very adventurous and medieval-sounding 'East to West' and the cheerful and optimistic 'Allegheny', another masterpiece, a song full of joy in which the serene piano from Wayne plays a very enthusiastic melody line. 'Sunshadow' is a very nice tune and 'Quiet Turning' is a very fresh and romantic, joyful song with two different melodies that follow one another for several times. The last one, 'Meadows' is a very mystic, quiet and appropiate close. Panorama will be one of your new age favourites, specially if you like some from Wayne Gratz or Michael Gettel.
