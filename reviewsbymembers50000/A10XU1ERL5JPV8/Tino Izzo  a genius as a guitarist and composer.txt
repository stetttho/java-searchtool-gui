 Well, this is a masterpiece of the guitar and this Canadian guy is not only a brilliant guitarist, but also a very inspired composer. There are three or four songs into this record that can get as better as any other you've ever heard from any other guitarist. 'Worlds Away' is an incredible in-crescendo tune that has a good adventurous feel, and the climax at the end is sublime. The strong-sounding guitars of 'A New Order', highly compressed and sharp sounding, are haunting, and the almost club dance feel of the rythm suits them so much.  The most beautiful song is 'Rage', a very soft acoustic guitar melody with a lot of feeling, and a more upbeat, jazzy closing with stunning acoustic tapping. The technique in this man never eclipses the truthfulness of his compositions.  A very sentimental closing is 'Beyond Those Walls', a very spiritual and idealistic end to the album.
