 In the vein of other Eastern authors, like say Kitaro, Hiroshima, Azuma, Ryuichi Sakamoto and many others, Naoyuki tries to build a link between the modern jazz/pop/rock from the West and the traditional Eastern sources. The result is a very romantic and sensitive collection of smooth songs, from the monotony and predictability of some tracks to the sublime beauty of some like 'Heartland' or 'Dreams'. In general its an enjoyable recording and has a couple of unforgettable tracks for the romantics. 'The Night Sky' is an unfortunate seeking of a  smooth jazz/Eastern traditional mix. But the two titles mentioned above are brilliant and extremely beautiful, and 'Distant Vista' is a very honest and intense tune. A fine record to give it a try.
