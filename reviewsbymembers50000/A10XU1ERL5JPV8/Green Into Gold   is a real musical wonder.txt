 I bought this record as an L.P. on 1989 and still have heard few instrumental songs as beautiful as the third cut 'Green Into Gold'. Surrounded by a very mysterious atmosphere of percussions and other sounds, a piano plays a very repetitive riff while the mean melody on the right hand developes to a beautiful chorus. This is a very in crescendo song and in some minutes you get into a glorious musical environment full of beauty and feeling... the song lasts up to more than ten minutes until the song fades away.  The rest of the work is impressive as a very fine new age work. The opening track is a tribute to Bartolomeo Cristofori, the man that's considered as the inventor of the piano. The second track is a beautiful and highly romantic track called 'Spiral Dance'. The second side is less significative although there are still nice tracks on it. 'Wings to Altair' holds a very ceremonial feel. 'Summer's Child' is nice and 'Free Fall' reminds me to some songs from Wayne Gratz's 'Reminiscence'. The last song is a fine tribute of Procol Harum's 60's hit 'A Whiter Shade of Pale', with the same organ player playing again. I don't know the last track, 'Madre de la Tierra' because I have the original release. But might be a very beautiful song, according to the title in Spanish (Mother of the Earth).
