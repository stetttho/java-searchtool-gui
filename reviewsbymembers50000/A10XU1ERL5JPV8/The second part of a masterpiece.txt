 After Grammy awarded 'In The Wake of the Wind', this follow up to it adds variety of moods and a new element to the trilogy, vocal sung themes by David Arkenstone. Impossible to state a quality order for the three albums 'cos they're all perfect. David Arkenstone reaches his top when has to addapt his music to a story. That's why he's a genious and a very good soundtrack maker. There's a few highlights on this great work. The mysterious and sublte sounds from 'Rythms of Vision', the great atmospheres of 'Magic Forest' and the incredible crescendo and climax of 'Wings of the Sahadow', reprising the melody from the 'In the Wake of the Wind' opener, 'Papillon'. If you like David Arkenstone this album is very likely to become your favourite.
