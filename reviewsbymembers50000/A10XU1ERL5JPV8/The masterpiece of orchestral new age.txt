 A Grammy winner in '91 as best instrumental album, this is a very special work.In fact it's the first of the unforgettable trilogy with inner sleeve tales. The first half is more related to the genius' previous work, with predominant synthesisers, and the second part is a delicious and full of fantasy musical journey full of orchestral sounds and acoustic quality instrumentations. The finale, with 'Through the Gates' is glorious. This is the best new age album ever made in my own opinion, along with Andreas Vollenweider's 'Down to the Moon'.
