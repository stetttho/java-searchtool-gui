 This is a very nice collection of tunes from one of the greatest pop Spanish bands. Specially 'Msico Loco', 'Cuando el Mar te Tenga', and 'Canta Por M', the last one being a big hit and a great song with Flamenco-sounding vocals and Police-Andy Summers-sounding guitars, are great songs which combine clever composition, lyric richness and interesting instrumentations. The rest of the album is very good as well although the instrumentals are just some strange gathering of odd sounds.   This is maybe not the best album to start knowing 'El ltimo de la Fila', but yet maybe the one with the best material.
