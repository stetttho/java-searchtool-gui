 This is one of the most representative works from the genious of the guitar, Mr Joe Satriani. The first track, 'Friends' is as positive and true as the title and opens your heart for such a shower of good songs. 'The Extremist' is much more for pure heavy metal lovers. 'Crying' is, for me, maybe the best ballad he ever wrote, even better that 'Always...' or 'Love Thing'. 'Rubina's Happy Blue Sky' is nice but weaker in its intention of some country/folk although the song works. 'Motorcycle Driver' is another gift for heavy maniacs... and crazy motorcycle drivers!!!!! 'Why' is a well worked, overdubbed lead guitar melody, expressing the desperation and angriness of the title. And, ladies and gentlemen... listen to this one... 'New Blues' starts from nothing, sounds like a band rehearsaling at the beginning, and in some seconds you are into an incredibly well crafted song in the feel of 'Echo' with a very similar sustained guitar lament in the middle part. The song also has a great part in which elegance turns to rage where a full heavy metal sound shower imitates and follows some innocent notes from the bass... WHHHAAAAAAA...!!!!!! He did the same in circles!!! Great for rock lovers and for electric distorted guitar maniacs.
