 This album follows 'Wish' in the fact of leaving behind the gloomyness they were into in the marvellous 'Disintegration'. So now they explore many different kinds of musical 'moods' which makes this album unpopular because it's irregular and loose, but in a way it also brings a lot of hidden feelings we couldn't find before in the band. The incredible variety of this album makes me put it in the place of the 'odd' album almost every band has. And although some songs are weak, like 'Club America' and the dreadful last song, the worst I've ever heard from The Cure, there are some gems here.  The first song, 'Want' is very consistent and even the title seems to want to carry on with the 'Wish' album's concept. 'Trap' is a great rocker with outstanding guitar and drums work, and trademark desperate lyrics about an almost broken relationship. 'Jupiter Crash' is a very poetic song, 'Mint Car' gets to sound funny and happy, and has a strange magic based in the fact of how strange is hearing The Cure sound so happy. 'the 13th' is not a fav but its really exotic, a strange step into latin by a very European band. 'Drug' sounds exotic also because of the sitar and has the same beautiful sadness of 'To Wish Impossible Things' from the previous album.The rest of the songs is interesting and varied. It is so an interesting album full of different tracks, in which you will find your favourite depending on your own taste.
