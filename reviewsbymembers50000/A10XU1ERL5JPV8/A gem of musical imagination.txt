 Nacho Cano, well known as the composer and brain of 'Mecano', a great Spanish pop/techno band born in 1980, created in the mid 90s his first solo album, which was entirely instrumental, somethig never done before by a famous pop Spanish musician. The result is a high quality collection of songs with a very Spanish and Flamenco style, but very much influenced as well from instrumental musicians as Mike Oldfield and a lot of New Age composers. From the beginning to the end the quality and variety of instruments and compositions is optimal, and the strongest song, 'La Batalla' (the battle) lasts more than 10 minutes. There are other remarkable tracks, like 'El Pas de los Cementos' and 'El Piano, El Violn y la Guitarra', with a beautiful combination of classical arrangements and Spanish guitar, 'El Patio' which haunts the listener at the first time and gets you right into the album, or Vaikuntha, a very spacey and mystical tune very much influenced by the buddhism Nacho adopted at that time, or the dramatic 'Waltz de los Locos' recorded in a psychiatric center and 'El Dolor del Agua', about the lament of a whale because of the the hunting of its little child.  If you like New Age-classical oriented instrumental music, this is your record. Sadly, the Spanish audience wasn't prepared for an entirely instrumental record at that time, and the following recordings from Nacho Cano have been just pop vocal ones, and although they are good, in no way the have the same musical quality as this.  A little notice: the album titles should appear in Spanish as this is a Spanish album ;)
