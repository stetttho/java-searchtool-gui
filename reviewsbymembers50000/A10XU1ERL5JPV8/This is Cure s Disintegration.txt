 I'm listening to the album right now, not for the first time but yes if a little closer. It is terrible. Sounds angry, uninspired and really like nothing left to say... 'Anniversary' is amazingly different from the rest of the songs, but it is plain to see that this is a commercially aimed release... and even fails in hooking with nice melodies. The 'art', the 'lushness' of previous records give way to a very common rock band everyday's life sound, nothing to do with the originality and distinctiveness The Cure had in the past. I'm starting to think as well that maybe Robert Smith is starting to use the band to release his own personal demons in the way Roger Waters did with Pink Floyd before they split up. A pity.
