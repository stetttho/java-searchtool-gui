 Two different talents work together for this little gem of early 80's pop that include some quiet and nice atmospheres from Vangelis's keyboards and the emotional voice of Jon Anderson, a very prolific man in collaborations. The first song, 'Italian Song' is almost a lullaby and has a haunting feeling that makes you feel really moved. he child in you will appear. 'When The Night Comes' is a very quiet and sexy song and the lyrics approach the theme of sex in a very proper and gentle way. 'Deborah' is kind of another lullaby, sung as from a letter to a little girl, it's deeply moving and tender as well. Polonaise is a slow song but finishes with a beautiful climax of drums, piano and the always expressive voice of Anderson. And so, the best track in the album, 'He is Sailing'. It brings very mysterious and religious motives to the words and the driving rythm really has energy. It seems a chant of hoping for the newcoming of Jesus, although I'm not completely sure about it. It is a greatly original and powerful theme. The very long 'Horizon' seems to be a wish of peace from war time, feels really apocaliptic and combines almost silent parts with some glorious and big ones. The album works as a whole, and the tenderness and beauty of all the tracks get added to the meaningful and transcendental condition of the lyrics written by Anderson.
