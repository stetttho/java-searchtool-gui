 I would never say this is one of the best albums from Joe Satriani, but it's plain to see the influence of Eric Cadieux, producer for Jean Michel Jarre for years, gave another way of inspirations and resources to this veteran rock guitarist. Although in some tracks the electronic stuff gets a little bit too much, there's a long range of styles in it, from pure heavy metal to soft melodic ballads. The jewel you find in every record ('Echoes' from 'Surfing with the Alien', 'New Blues' from 'The Extremist', 'Baroque' from 'Time Machine' or 'Love Thing' from 'Crystal Planet' is in this case 'Until We Say Goodbye', a beautiful ballad with claever guitar, and an outstanding middle part with awesome free guitar soloing. Only for this track it's worthwhile to have the record, although 'Champagne', Flavour Crystal 7' or the meditative 'Clouds Race Across the Sky' are good as well.
