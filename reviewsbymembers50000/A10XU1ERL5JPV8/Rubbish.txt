 I gut to say as a Spanish that all this related to operation triunfo is a crappy stinkey burden for those who like true music and honest compositions, whaterever style they belong to. We are really fed up of all this 'pop idol' miseria that only help us living in a less creative and spontaneous world, slaving us just for consumism and stupid fashions that are forgotten in a short time's lapse. As a lover of music I'll never feel any respect for this sad panthomima, this stupid circus into where they involve us all from the mass media. I invite you to never listen to this record and to save the money for a little more cultural and interesting thing. Why not next Mike Oldfield's record? Could be... ;)
