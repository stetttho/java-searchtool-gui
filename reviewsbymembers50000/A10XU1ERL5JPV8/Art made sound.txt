 The most beauty-oriented album from awesome swiss harpist, multi-instrumental magician Andreas Vollenweider was made in 1984. The impeccable sounds and ambiences of this record transport you directly to a clean, healing atmosphere of wonder with a lot of world music references and a light-hearted feeling that spreads throughout the album. Sometimes optimistic, sometimes dramatic, but always really touching, the varied sounds and colours of this record are a complete help for the balance of the mind. The electro-acoustic harp always sounds clever, accurate and inspired and gives a personal touch to the maremagnum of different sounds that floats all over.   Specially touching are the rhythmic and cheerful `The Glass Hall', the romantic and delicate `Phases of Three Moons' and the light-hearted, happy `Flight Feet & Root Hands', in which you almost can picture the musicians performing together with a smile on their face, for the nice and spontaneous feeling that flows throughout the song.   Every song in this album is danceable, probably because Andreas Vollenweider's albums are very art-oriented, which means there's a lot of references about dancing, painting, performing all over his music. His music, thematic and titles are full of images and atmospheres.   This album is the closing of a trilogy which comprehends it and his two first albums. In fact, the last title of it is a musical and nominal reference to the three of these albums with melodies from both three. The other great part of this trilogy is `Caverna Magica'. That one, along with `White Winds', the masterpiece `Down to the Moon' and `Dancing With the Lion' are the most recommended for beginners.
