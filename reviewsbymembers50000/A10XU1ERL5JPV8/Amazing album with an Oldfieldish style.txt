 I'm sorry to say this album is incorrectly credited by Amazon as it was recorded by Giles Reaves and Jon Goin. The first, drummer and keyboardist and the second guitarist. The album is awesome as explores a lot of different rock moods, all instrumentally, but really entretaining in every single minute of it. If you like Mike Oldfield, specially the QE2 - Five Miles Out time this album will amaze you. Jon Goin's guitar, although played with plectrum, has an unarguable similarity with the classic overdrive sound by Mike Oldfield.   The best songs are: the opening one, 'New Beginnings' is a highly enthusiastic, 8 minute long tour-de-force with a lot of electric guitar, rather in the vein of Joe Satriani. Also, the best one, 'Journey to the Highlands', an awesome theme with electric guitar, full of energy and an added Celtic feel with the intense drumming all over the song.   The other remarkable song is the closing, highly romantic and evocative, but with intense drum beating, 'Night After Night'. The song has a very emotional and romantic feel, with a wonderful string section that takes you to another place. The strange thing is here appears another title after that one. Must be the CD version. I have the LP edition.
