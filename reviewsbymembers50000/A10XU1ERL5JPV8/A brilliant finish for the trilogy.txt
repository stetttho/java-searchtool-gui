 What can you expect from David Arkenstone to finish the trilogy he opened with his all-time masterpiece but a great ending...? This CD incorporates elements enough to take it as seriously as any other of his works. Although in the beginning I thought this record wasn't better than only trying following up the synthesiser style of the first half of 'In The Wake of the Wind', I ended up very soon thinking it was almost as good as its predecessor. Grey, misty sounding and superb, 'The Forgotten Lands' is surprisingly original and beautiful in the use of the piano and so much other instruments. It's one of his best tunes ever, poetic and very distant from anything else not only Arkenstone, but every other composer I know has made. 'Two Hearts' is weaker and predictable as a romantic track. 'The Mask' is great in its bass line, enigmatic and dark. 'The Chosen Voices' sounds very powerful and mistic, showing the grandness this composer knows how to create. 'Winds of Change' is very joyful and refreshing, but when it keeps on it gets to be one of the serious best tracks of the album.  The closing track, 'Reunion', is cheerful and optimistic again, but the best one of the album, undoubtedly, is the terrificly huge and changing, divided in two 'Water of Life'. Here, David shows how far he can get in expressing a radical inner change, with all the energy, passion and impulse of a new beginning. Not to miss this track, for it's rarely overcome by other Arkenstone's tracks. It's wonderful, and even more in the part where the choir and drums explode. Anyway, although not as much orchestral and easy listening as 'In The Wake of The Wind', this record steps near it for the keeping of the inspiration with which it was made.
