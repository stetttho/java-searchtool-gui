 Funny and well crafted album althugh not a highlight from Jarre. It is a predecessor of all the altered voice albums. The main songs are really funny to listen and the titles say it all. 'Zoolook????', 'Zoolooklogie'?????   'Wooloomoooloooo????????'   Ein??   The first track, 'Ethnicolor' is strong and interesnting. The second one, 'Diva', although a bit boring it's strange and interesting; as Laurie Anderson speaks a lot of silly noises and some voices say some things. Jarre paints kind of a human jungle with voices for all over the world which is something nobody thought of before.    The closing 'Ethnicolor II' is for me a highlight in spite of it's short duration, as it closes the album with a great, strange atmosphere and that cello evoking a lot of different emotions. A nice album, very original and a classic of instrumental synth music already.
