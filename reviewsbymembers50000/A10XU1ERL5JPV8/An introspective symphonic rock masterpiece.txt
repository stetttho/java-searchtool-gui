 Being one of the best "seven classic" called masterpiece albums from the Moody Blues, this is maybe the most introspective and melancholic of them. Nonetheless, it still brings some cheery songs like 'Floating' and the bursting opener, 'Higher and Higher'. One of the best songs bassist John Lodge ever wrote, 'Eyes of a Child' two part song is a magnificent ballad with meaningful lyrics about childhood (part 1) and a very upbeat and short reprise full of voices and rythm guitars (part 2). The very cosmic instrumental 'Beyond' is a very good effort by the "fab five", in a way being a very archaic New Age pioneer. 'Out and In' is a greatly ominous and deep songs with lyrics about the Universe (the central concept of the album, made in 1969, the year man got to the moon). Co-written by John Lodge and Mike Pinder and sung by the las one, this is one of the best songs ever the Moody Blues made, even being an obscure one.   But the most interest lays on the second side of the album. Monothematically subjected about the concept of solitude, starts with a great rocker called 'Gypsy' by Justin Hayward. The following is a highly inspired and elegant tune by Ray Thomas, 'Eternity Road', perfectly sung and with a great guitar work by Hayward at the same time as Ray's singing. 'Candle of light' follows up the solitude concept, with a very dramatic and full of feeling melody sung together by John Lodge and Justin Hayward. The album ends with the extremely beautiful and sad ballad by Justin Hayward, 'Watching and Waiting'. This is one of the song that would eclipse the beauty and the fame of 'Nights in White Satin' if it had had a bit more airplay. Only an extremely honest guy like Hayward can sing and compose in such a delicate and subtle way, and write such honest lyrics. The album is a complete masterpiece and every lover of progressive music as Supertramp, Pink Floyd or Genesis should own it. I do.
