 Disgusting paranoia we find in this terrorific gang of headless weirdos who destry every furniture in the room and attack every sense of art into the earthly globe. I can telya if ya buy this bunch of pornographic miserablia you will be fenced to the top of a wire which is right into the bottom. Try betta Andreas Vollenweider, Mike Oldfield, Wayne Gratz, Joe Satriani, Stephen Caldwell, Roy Orbison, Torrebruno, David Hasselhof, Demis Roussos, Nana Moskouri, Frank Sinatra, Frank Zappa, Hank Marvin, Jakob Dylan or even Sting. Get all the Operational Tronfo to the bin and see it all burning, 'cos that fire brings freedom and choice for the nice people: we all.
