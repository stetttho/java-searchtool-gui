 I bought this CD on Amazon after hearing it in a bar nearby the sea. I was amazed of the perfection and good taste of this music. The low and deep voice from this singer takes you to quiet and silent places full of relax and peace.    The first song, 'King of the Beach', is a perfect opener breaking the silence with a mellow, new agey melody that turns to swinging blues. Speaks about the central theme of the album: the beach as a place for resting and self-discovering.    The next one, 'All Summer Long' is probably the most commercial tune in the album and has a haunting rythm with female chantings, and the deep voice of Rea drawing a lot of summery images. The next song, Sail Away, is an exquisite ballad full of tenderness, told to a woman that has to leave. But for me the probable spotlight in the album is the sixth song, 'Guitar Street', a very bluesy song about a guy that decides to be a guitarist and leaves it all behind. The style and consistency of the song are unique, with a lot of elegance and emotion, this is a song that really uplifts you and I would count it amongst the best I've heard with a Dire Straits / Bruce Springsteen rocky style.   Another gem is the penultimate, 'Tamatave', with a part of the song sung in French. It's not exactly a ballad but a very slow song with loads of atmospheric sounds, a very strange and mysterious song. 'Who do you Love' is elegant and deep, with a very gentle piano driving melody, and the last one, 'Waiting for a Blue Sky' is bluesy again and really optimistic, a nice ending to the album (I don't have the bonus track).    This album is a masterpiece in its genre. Although I don't have anymore from Chris Rea I'll stick to this for a while as I heard it's the best in ten years. The best the smooth rock/blues can get, cleverly composed and with exquisite genuine guitar playing.
