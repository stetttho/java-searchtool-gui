 I've had this album recorded in a tape for a long time but I had to grow a bit older to really enjoy it in its whole dimension. Anyway I keep on thinking since then the best tracks are the two magic 'Lullaby', a very elegant and beautiful guitar ballad full of feeling and inspiration, and the best one, undoubtedly, the last track, 'Deborah Lea'. I don't know if Deborah is Hadley's wife or whatever but has to be a really important person for him, as this song is as beautiful and magic as a song can be. At the start there's an atmosphere of perfect serenity and peace, in which a strange 'horn' keyboard sound appears drawing loosely some melodies. The song is haunting and recalls a really intimate and happy moment full of peace and serenity. This track is class and so is the rest of the album, ranging between soft jazz and just new age guitar music. Very recommendable for people who like soft jazz but not the cold one but with a bit of heart in it.
