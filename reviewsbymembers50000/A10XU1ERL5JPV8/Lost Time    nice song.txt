 The comparison between this terrific duo's work, 'Under the Eye', and this work, is a bit of a disappointment for the listener. All the originality and rich instrumentation from the other work is here a much simpler ensemble with acceptable result but not as much brilliantness.   The first track, 'The Underground', starts in a very interesting way, but a synth loop gets a bit repetitive.   'Engravings' sounds beautiful although it needs some listens.   'Marseille' sounds a bit poorly instrumentated and maybe should have more instruments in order to be more evocative.  The best track undoubtedly is Walder's composition, 'Lost Time', a great and imaginative song where the piano and the oboe intertwine together perfectly and the melodies are spontaneous and very inspired.  The title track 'Transit' is nice although a bit too commercial.   There's another highlight, 'The Calling'. It's a really uplifting song with a lot of emotion and the beautiful oboe sounds here best than ever.  This album is a part of the progress that led to stunning 'Under the Eye'. Look for that album. It will staunt you.
