 This album could be considered one of the best from Mecano, as although the most well known tracks ('Hawaii Bombay' or 'Aire') are really weak and even a bit silly, there are gems in it and there's kind of a common concept in all the songs, about travelling and looking for a better place. The first song, 'No Pintamos Nada' is a techno-pop protest song about the threat of nuclear war and how we common people don't have anything to do with what leaders do. The third song, 'La Estacin' is really emotional and intense, with a lot of references to travelling and childhood.   The weirdest song in the album is the only composition from lead singer Ana Torroja, a strange rap by a high-pitched voice with a crazy techno instrumentation, and a wonderful, melodic final section with a brilliant instrumental part.   'Busco Algo Barato' is interesting for its complex synth arrangements, catchy melody and haunting voice and vocals describing the atmosphere of a full cheap-selling supermarket. 'Me Rio de Janeiro' is silly and 'Aire' has a nice classic flavour but a little too sweet and predictable, although it's been really successful amongst youngest (female?) Spanish fans.   The two closing songs are very different but superb. 'Japn' is a very accurate description of Japan as a highly technified and organized country where everything fits tight, even time. The atmosphere gets really claustrophobic with an overdose of synthesisers and other sounds and leads to the clean, delicious atmosphere of the sensitive ballad that closes the album, 'El Mapa de tu Corazn'. This represents a more than worthy closing to the album and insists on the concept of travelling.   For both Spanish-speakers or not, the melodies of this album and the nice synthesiser arrangements, as well as the beauty of Ana's voice (more here than in other works from the band) assure a lovely listening to melodic pop lovers who like some instrumental sophistication as well.
