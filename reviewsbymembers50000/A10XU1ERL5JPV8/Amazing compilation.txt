 I borrowed the compilation and recorded most of the tunes in a tape. It's a special tape for me as I don't have a lot of chill out so it's very original in my collection. I guess few people would dislike the music in here. From the exotic spirituality of 'Temple of the Rising Dawn' to the perfectly synthesised 'H.E.L.P.' or the great, rythmic hipnotic loops of Chicane's 'Offshore', the album is a great journey across new musical frontiers. I recommend this to everybody who likes instrumental music, modern music, or both.    Probably the most beautiful song is the simple, acoustic 'Plaid' by Nova Nova, featuring a lovely female voice. That song is a gem.
