 The best album in the history of pop / rock music is now much better than before. The sublime ouvre british composer Mike Oldfield made only being 18 years old is now perfectioned in every bit, and the most important thing is it's not only a technical work, 'cos he has felt the music once again and given it a different touch in so many ways. This is not plagiarism, but the payment of a debt Oldfield had always with himself, because he always felt uncomfortable with the hurry and old technical resources the original album was made with in 1973. This is the most grand, beautiful, sublime, deep piece of music I think has ever been done. The experience for the musiciand making it again, and for listeners to listen the new work, is in a way almost taking over the first time, because this masterpiece deserved the treat it has received to last for the future.
