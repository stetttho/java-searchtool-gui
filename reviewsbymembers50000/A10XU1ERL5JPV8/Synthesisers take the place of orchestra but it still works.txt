 Balance of Power is for me the least ELO album since Eldorado, but still it deserves a place among the good works of my favourite bands. The starting Heaven Only Knows is a cracking and enthusiastic pop song with a strong rythm and loads of backing vocals. 'So Serious' adds a fresh and new mood in the yet varied repertoire from ELO. 'Getting to the Point' is a very predictable ballad but still gets a beautiful feel and goes in crescendo to a climax. 'Secret Lives' is a curious reggae-caribbean like, insolit song into the history of the band and if silly, it's still funny. 'Is It Alright', for me the best song of the album, is a very strange song but filled with inspiration and originality. The B side starts with a good song, 'Sorrow About to Fall'. Then, another highlight appears in the form of a great ballad called 'Without Someone', I think maybe the one song in the album closest to the band's past style. 'Calling America' is a very light-hearted and upbeat song, sounds really funny and modern. 'Endless Lies' is a masterpiece in itself, really one of the most original ELO has ever done, a very strange song like it was made of a lot of little song because the mood changes constantly. It is sang by a very eloquent Jeff Lynne that addoptes a lot of different attitudes speaking to a woman that lied and cheated him. The last track, 'Send It', is one of the worst songs ELO have ever done, it's a try of something like a synthesised rock and roll song, but it makes you feel as if what the lyrics say was real, that "the dream has gone". But the overall feel of this album, if not a masterpiece as other earlier works, is a very fresh, joyful and funny record full of variety and with a couple of highlights from this outstanding band.
