 The sequel to the first work by French sythesisist Jarre is in my opinion better than the original on. Taking all the style and the structure from 'Oxygene', '7-13' gets further in sounds, composition and everything else.      Although the main sounds and rythms are very similar to the first one, it is a sign of being a good artist to create something similar to a previous work, but taking it further. The highlight is 'Oxygene 10' which builds itself in a few seconds and feautres a very simple melody with a very simple synth sound, but surrounded by extremely complex sounds and rythms. The last one is nice as well, though very much similar to the last from 'Oxygene'. The rest of h album is average Jean Michel Jarre material, but in a way a great closer to a time in his work before the beginning of a new one. I bet he took the idea of a second part from Mike Oldfield making 'Tubular Bells II'. A great idea in both cases tho.
