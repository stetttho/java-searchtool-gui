 They say this is the first `techno' album ever... who knows. It sounds really weird even now, and it was made in the seventies. Personally my favourite is `The Model'... it's almost... commercial... They say these guys used to compose the same number of notes everyday... It's interesting. `Spacelab' is a cute and nice song. If you listen to this you will feel catatonic-elektronik-psykodelik-grooveytronik-... This is the stone age of techno.
