 Mike was about to leave Virgin where hed had stopped being free to create his music. They only wanted him to make pop hits and this record is as a whole a big parody of all that. The title of the tracks says everything about it knowing it was the last record of the deal. He must have had a lot of fun making it, and the long instrumental 'Music From the Balcony' is as chaotic and loose it can be, which had to be really liberating and therapeutic for him. Although the quality of the album is very affected by all the tiredness Mike had at the time, I love 'Music from the Balcony' and 'Heaven's Open' reminds one of his best vocal songs to the date. Another interesting thing is Mike's the lead singer for the 5 vocal tracks for the only time. A funny album to listen, and with a very clear concept: the liberation from the meanness and materialism of this world.
