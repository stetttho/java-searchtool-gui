 Maybe the deepest effort for Nightnoise, 'At the End of the Evening' shows how intense and emotional soft melodies and moods can be. The first song, 'Windell', is a very interesting cycling melody with a lot of Celtic taste and very nature-evocating. 'Hugh' is a very emotional and warm piano melody, that brings you a lot of memories when you hear it again times after, and the best song of the album for me is clearly 'Her Kansas Sun'. The American fiddlist Billy Oskay is the one of the band who steps further from Celtic styles and dares to bring other jazzy or maybe new agey flavours. This song is strangely and beautifully composed and played just like everything from the guy and reaches the top of my expectations for music... By the way, I agree to another writer in saying that Triona's voice sometimes sounds a little annoying and forced... also don't like so much the song that gives the title to the album. The last song is another magic artwork, and it's called 'The Swan'. After one almost ordinary and common acoustic guitar riff it comes an ethereal flute and sweet fiddle that construct a dreamy tune that repeats like a merry-go-round and gives a very sentimental and special end to the album. This is music poetry, mostly if you play it "at the end of the evening" :)
