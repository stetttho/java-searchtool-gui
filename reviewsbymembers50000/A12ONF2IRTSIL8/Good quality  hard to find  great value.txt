 I love these pages because they let me expand my existing CD storage binder instead of replacing it and refiling everything. CaseLogic makes great cases, and the refill pages mean that you can stretch the case you have further, and not have to shell out for a new binder. Plus they make it much easier to rearrange and insert CDs. A lot of CD holders don't let you move pages or insert pages, so when you add a CD in the middle, you have to move all the others. OK, so, I'm a freak for keeping my CDs in order, but this makes it practical. I've bought these pages in the past, but had a lot of trouble finding them recently-- one place even told me they were no longer manufactured. So I'm pretty pleased to see them here.
