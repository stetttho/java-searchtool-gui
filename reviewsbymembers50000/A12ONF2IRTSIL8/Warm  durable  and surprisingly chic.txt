 Carhartt anything is the work-wear of choice for a lot of the construction workers around town in Boston, so you know it's durable and practical. The sweatshirts are practically a uniform in early spring and in the fall, especially in odd colors like blaze orange. I got mine from a friend of a friend who forgot his at my house, and it's the most wonderful, cozy piece of clothing I own. I live in it every weekend. My mother borrowed it while I was home visiting, and now I've had to get one for her, as well. These really are the perfect thing to wear on a rainy day when you're curled up on the couch, or when it's raw and windy but not quite freezing outside. The Carhartt label seems to be gathering the cachet that Dickies had a few years ago, and you'll see it worn by a lot of semi-ironic post-collegiate hipsters, but don't let that deter you from buying something that's well-made, warm, and comfortable. It's quite good whether you plan to wear it for serious work or serious vegetating.
