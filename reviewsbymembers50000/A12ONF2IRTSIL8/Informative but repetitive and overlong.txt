 KRJ could have used the services of a good savage editor to cut out about 20-40 percent of this book. I don't know how many times she repeated the fact that suicide almost always comes with depression rather than non-mental illnesses, or that there are some forms of mental illness that do not incur suicide. Her descriptions, although often evocative, also do not bear so much repeating-- suicides by hanging are described variously as "throwing a rope over a beam," "throwing a rope over a pipe"  and "throwing a rope over a branch." In many places she contradicts herself as well-- first saying that heavy news coverage, especially that which praises the dead for their achievements in life, encourages suicide imitations, then suggesting that news reporters emphasise positive aspects of the suicide's life to help the survivors cope. Both may be true, but she completely fails to address this tension. The book is ultimately informative and helps to provide a background on suicide, those who seek it, and the ways that survivors have responded in the past and do so now. However, I felt that I could have been equally well informed in a significantly shorter book.
