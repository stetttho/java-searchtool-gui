 I'd thought it would work with OSX at least as a mini-hard-drive you could just drag files to, but no luck. Love the appearance. Looks really well done. I ended up going with the Rio Sport S30S, which is about the same size, costs a little less, and although it has less memory, does have an upgrade slot that for about the cost of the nike one will put you at 192MB instead of the 128 from the Nike...  Tossup really.
