 I know a lot of people thought this was a lighthearted romp, but watching it made me so upset and angry I was had trouble getting to sleep for days afterwards.  When I see Ben Stiller sell himself short in such a cliched, self-hating-jew stereotype, it makes me cringe, but that's not the real reason I disliked the movie (and the entire genre it represents so well). When someone in an awkward situation lies to try to make it better, then lies to cover up the lie, then continues in greater and greater contortions to try to preserve their illusion of social conformity, it's presented as funny.  But to me, it isn't.  It's a tragedy, and it's a tragedy reflected in our daily lives as a society.   This movie reminds me of everything I dislike about shallow social convention, and about people who subscribe to it and who desperately crave the approval of others. No laugh track, no acrobatically awkward pratfall, could make me find that funny.
