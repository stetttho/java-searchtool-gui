 People certainly seem to love or hate this band.  The vocals sound like the cries of a small child at the bottom of a deep well, and large portions of the music are indeed melodramatic, depressing, and in many cases jarringly dissonant. I'm particularly fond of the mournful, almost bluesy slide guitar on "Beautiful Friend." However, this isn't just a disc for mopey goth kids.  It's got some beautiful moments of pop sensibility mixed in with its dark tones, and that mixture, along with the disturbingly childlike voice, bring me back to this band again and again. I enjoyed this album a great deal more than other Cranes albums-- the later ones were a little too bright and poppy, and the earlier ones a little too dismal and repetitive.  This album, however, can go on repeat play for hours or days filled with both sunshine and sadness.
