 I read a pre-release copy of this book and found both positive and negative. On the plus side, it's easy to read, and his life story is in fact engaging. His advice about testing blood sugars-- even if you aren't diagnosed with diabetes-- makes sense. Also he explains that there are way too many factors that affect blood sugar for the "glycemic index" or other rules to be easy: he advocates blood testing and personal experience, keeping a journal, and knowing your body, to keep blood sugar in the right range, thereby reducing the amount of insulin you use, thereby reducing the energy stored in your body, thereby making you lose weight.  On the minus side, he's the Taliban of low-carb diet gurus: No multi-stage diet. No grain of any kind, even whole grain. No fruit, not even tomatoes. No peas. No exceptions. No end. Ever. He outlaws balsamic vinegar, tomatoes, wild rice, quinoa... even Splenda, because they use dextrose as a filler. Basically unless you go into a low-blood-sugar coma, you'll never see another carbohydrate again. Plus unless you have a prescription, blood sugar testing is not cheap-- and even if you do, it does literally involve poking yourself with sharp objects two to four times a day. Eating right isn't always fun, but with this diet, it's *never* fun!  So, although it may be informative, it's not likely to be useful, unless you really, really love having very strict rules to follow. Always. Forever.
