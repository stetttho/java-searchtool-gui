 As even the negative reviewers of this book point out, the intellectual left of the US has become stagnant, overly theoretical, and is stuck ruminating on the mistakes of the past (whether those are mistakes of the Left, like the willful ignorance of repression in the USSR, or mistakes of the right, like McCarthyism, hardly matters). Rorty argues, and I don't see many people disagreeing, that from the relevance and good works of the civil rights movement, the war on poverty, and voter registration campaigns, the left has retreated to the ivory towery, deconstructivist literary theory, and apathy towards the actual day-to-day lives of the world. His examples of his own personal conflicts growing up as a "red daiper baby" (see the review "Red Daiper Baby Still in the Dark") serve to illustrate this growing irrelevance, and he admits that issues like these, which he once championed, have grown stale. Rorty's lectures in this book are aimed at finding a way out of the dead end of abstract theory and "cultural politics," and into an applied social justice campaign.  Let's drop the whole "leftism is dead" and "theory of culture" prattle, and move on to doing things about people starving in our streets, he says.   Now, this is where the negative reviewers really begin to skewer him-- he suggests that the answer lies in pragmatism and a sort of 'secular religion.' I'm not convinced that he's correct, however, and I think that although he's right about the need to preserve our government as a secular one, I think that he really ignores the benefits of religion in civil society.  Regardless of whether you agree with his prescription, however, his history of American leftism, and his analysis of its problems today, are  insightful.
