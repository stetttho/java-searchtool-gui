 I'm one of the authors on this book and I figured I should point out what's new in the 5th edition, and how we improved it over the 4th one.  My favorite improvement is that in the reference section, we put in lots more examples, so it's easier to see the most common uses of commands. Also, we got kernel developer Robert Love to write a lot of the developer and kernel-related sections, so you know that they're applicable to real-life developer tasks.  Changes to content for the 5th edition: power management now covers ACPI, printing covers CUPS, and the kernel section now focuses on kernel 2.6. The subversion version control tool and the GRUB bootloader get a lot more coverage, too.  In my humble opinion, this is an indispensable reference, and in addition to being an update, it's an improvement in style and substance over the previous edition.  This book is a good choice if you've ever asked questions like: What's a shell script and how do I write one? How do I use a version control system? How do I select an arbitrary rectangle in Emacs? How do I write a makefile? How do you build an RPM, anyway? This can also be good to have as a reference for new users-- read the introduction, read up on the tools you're using, then keep it there by your side, and you'll grow into this book as you learn to do more with Linux.  (You may also want to consider "Running Linux," which is an overview and introduction, with more focus on GUI applications and end-user tools).
