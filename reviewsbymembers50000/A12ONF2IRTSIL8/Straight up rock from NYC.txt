 I saw these guys in NYC awhile ago, and then again in Boston at O'Brien's, and I've had the album on repeat for several weeks. "The Occasion" in particular is really catchy. They are dedicated, talented musicians with a real feeling for loud rock-n-roll with intelligence and heart. If you want to hear more than a short clip they have a couple full-length mp3s up on their myspace.com page.
