 This is quite a good map, and as someone who's lived in Boston for nearly three years, I find myself glad to have it more than I'd care to admit. However, purchasers should note that there are significant portions of metro Boston that are not covered by this map, (Cambridge, Allston, Brighton, Brookline, East Boston, for starters) and that to have a guide to most of the city you will need more maps or a larger one.  This is a great map of Downtown, though, and provides plenty of detail for those walking the Freedom Trail, trying to find anything in the Copley maze of hotels, etc.
