 [...] In "The City and the Pillar" Vidal makes every symbol a bludgeon and beats his readers over the head with it. (Hint: the pillar is a phallic symbol!)The structure of the novel is practically outlined in bullet-points before each chapter. When, at the climactic moment he tells us that the circle is complete (actual phrase!) and that this is the climax of the novel, I threw the book at the wall. The book might be appropriate as a Young Adult novel for a struggling gay teenager reading years below his or her grade level, but I'd hesitate there too. It's got all the nuance and subtelty of a YA novel, but it really does try to be an actual piece of literary fiction. Shame, because it could almost be a decent after-school special.
