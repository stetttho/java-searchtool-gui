 KRJ has the credentials, the knowledge, and the skill to produce an excellent book about mental health issues, and she has done so in the past. "Night Falls Fast" is not quite as good as previous efforts, but still worthwhile. It is informative, and offers the average person a real understanding of the phenomenon of suicide-- who's most likely to attempt and who to succeed, what their motivations are, how to prevent them, etc. The book is not without flaws, however: she repeats herself in a few places, and the organization isn't really good. In one or two places she actually contradicts herself, or fails to resolve conflicts between advocacy for the bereaved and the prevention waves of suicide. Overall, a reasonably good book that could have used a better editor.
