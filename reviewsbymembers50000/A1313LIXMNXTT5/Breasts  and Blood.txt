 I have always liked this film and saw it many years ago on cassette, but seeing the widescreen version is even better. This is a cheesy film starring sexy Bobbi Bresee as an actress who takes an aging drug and turns into an insect monster. Goofy as hell but VERY VERY enjoyable. Has some interesting things on the disc such as trailers, behind the scenes shots and another episode of Nite Owl Theater with Fred Olen Ray and Miss Kim. A highly recommended DVD that does not disappoint.
