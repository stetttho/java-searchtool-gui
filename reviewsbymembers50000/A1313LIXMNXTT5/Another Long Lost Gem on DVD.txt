 Shriek Show Video has come up with a real rare flick this time. It is Barry Mahon's long lost gem "Blood Of The Zombie" aka "The Dead One." A very interesting story about a woman who brings back to life a rotting zombie to do her bidding. The print quality is very good and the color is vibrant in spots. It also co-stars Linda Ormand, wife of filmmaker Ron Ormond who gave the world such treats as Mesa Of Lost Women and Monster & The Stripper. Nice DVD release and I hope Shriek Show finds more rare gems like this. Highly Recommended for horror fans!!
