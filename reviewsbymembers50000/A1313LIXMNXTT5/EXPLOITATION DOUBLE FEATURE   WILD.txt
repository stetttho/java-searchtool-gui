 Something weird has put two really strange films together here. The first is Hitch Hike To Hell in which a deranged man in a dry cleaning delivery van kidnaps women who are hitchhiking and then proceeds to rape and kill them. There is a shocking murder of a child (it isn't seen on screen) that really has an impact. Russell Johnson (Professor on Gilligan's Island) is a policeman assigned to the case. Very odd, but well made film. The second film is Kidnapped Coed, and this is a film about a kidnapped girl who falls in love with her captor, and he with her. They go on a crime spree together. A great twist ending to this one. The extras are good on this disc, but the highlight is a tour thru Harry Novac's Boxoffice International studios. That is a great 30 minutes. All in all a great disc well worth the money.
