 I bought this dvd and was very pleased to see to very odd features from the swamps. The first feature is Swamp Girl starring Ferlin Husky and Claude King, both of whom were country music singers of the 60's. Ferlin sings a song about a swamp girl and Claude stars as the sheriff. Claude King had a hit country song with the tune Wolverton Mountain. As the swamp girl you have sexy Simone Griffeth. She is very good in the role and most people probably remember her as David Carradine's assistant in Death Race 2000. Two convicts force our swamp girl to take them out of the swamp and needless to say they meet horrible deaths. Things get even more complicated with the arrival of the female convicts parents. The second feature is Swamp Country and the title tune is sung by Baker Knight and isn't too bad at all. The story involves a sexy woman murdered at a motel and the innocent man persued into the swamps. Rex Allen plays the sheriff here, you might remember him as the narrator for some classic Disney films. As his deputy is none other then Lyle Waggoner from the Wonder Woman show. Great entertainment here as well with over 3 hours of good movies and extras. The extras include trailers, and a bonus featurette called Swamp Virgin. Recommended viewing.
