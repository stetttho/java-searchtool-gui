 I have always been very fond of this film. A giant Spanish Conquistador comes back to life and goes on a rampage in this Richard Cunha sci-fi gem. I love everyone in the cast especially Morris Ankrum and the always lovely Sally Forest. The small town setting adds a wonderful charm to this picture. 5 stars all the way!!!
