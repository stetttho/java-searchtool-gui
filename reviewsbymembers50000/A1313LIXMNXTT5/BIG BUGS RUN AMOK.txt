 Director Bill Rebane strikes again with this wonderful trashy film about rural rednecks and giant spiders. A meteor crashes on a ranch and bugs emerge from the crater. A giant spider eventually emerges and goes on the rampage thru Gleason Wisconsin. Alan Hale plays the sheriff. He even calls the hero "Little Buddy". I enjoyed this film the first time I ever saw it and I still enjoy it. This dvd is hosted by Son Of Ghoul and comes with color comic book repro. A good little item here.
