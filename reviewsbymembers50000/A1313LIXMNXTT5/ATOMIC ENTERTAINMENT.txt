 Mike Vraney has turned out this wonderful double bill of Atomic terror. The first film is Atomic war Bride from 1960 Yugoslavia, and it is a well made little film about atomic war and the devastating effects it has on people. A shocking ending as well. The second filmis a gem called This Is Not A Test. I had seen this on late night television and never forgot it. A gritty, well acted film about several people waiting for the end of the world at a roadblock set up by a local policeman. Great film, great ending!! The extras are good here as well. I highly recommend this dvd is you like 50's and 60's sci-fi.
