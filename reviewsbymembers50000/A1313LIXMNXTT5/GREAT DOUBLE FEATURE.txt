 Mike Vraney and Something Weird Video have turned out a set that has been sooooo neglected over the years. Jerry Warren took Terror In the Midnight Sun and re-edited it into a feature called Invasion Of The Animal People, which in itself isn;t a really bad flick. The high point of this disc is that you get to see the Original version Terror in The Midnight Sun. I enjoyed this a lot and the extras are something else again!! Check em out!! I fell in love with this double bill and I hope you will to.
