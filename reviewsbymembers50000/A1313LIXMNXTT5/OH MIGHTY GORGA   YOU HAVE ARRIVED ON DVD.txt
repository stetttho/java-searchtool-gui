 I am very happy to finally see this movie on DVD!!! If there was ever a movie to laugh at and have fun with it is this one. The gorilla suit is a plastic as can be and is never shown from the waist down!! Also, this is the ONLY movie in which plastic toy dinosaurs terrorize the hero. Tony Eisley stars as a circus owner on the verge of bankruptcy who seeks out a giant gorilla living in Africa. He travels there (actually Simi Valley, CA) and meets April, the owner of an animal farm there. After a fire is set by our villian (Scitt Brady) she has no choice but to accompany Tony on his expidition. Fun for all with plastic dinos and more flubbed lines than I have ever seen in a film before. The second feature is One Million AC/DC written by Ed Wood!! Another pitiful movie that makes Gorga look like a classic well made film!! Wall to wall nudity and inane dialogue. My opinion on this is not good. I didn't really like this film and cannot understand why Something Weird Video put this R rated film on with the G rated Gorga. Loaded with trailers and lots of extras, check this out if you want to see a couple of movies that will make your jaw drop. Highly Recommended!!
