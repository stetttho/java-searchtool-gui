 An absolutely wonderful disc dedicated to the memory of one of the greatest actors of all time. I have always been a Vincent Price fan, and was overjoyed to see this come out on DVD. If you love Price this is highly recommended for you. The interviews are wonderful and very informative, the extras are just as good. My favorite extra on here was the Shindig special of The Wild Weird World Of Dr. Goldfoot. Get this DVD right away!!
