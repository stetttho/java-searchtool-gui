 Howard Vernon stars in this classic Jess Franco film about a man who inherits his family's sadistic habits. This disc contains the often missing dungeon/torture sequence that is a real eye opener. The widescreen transfer is perfect and this is in french with english subtitles. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for Franco fans and horror fans in general.
