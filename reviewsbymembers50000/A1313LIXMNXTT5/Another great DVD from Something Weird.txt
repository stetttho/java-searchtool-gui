 Two great flicks here especially if you like regional made horror films. The first if Larry Buchanan's first film Naked Witch about a college student who brings a beautiful dead witch back to life. Filmed for $8000.00 in Texas, Buchanan does his best to bring a very interesting story to life. I really enjoyed this film and it was nice to see a color print. Contains a little nudity, but nothing special. The second feature is Crypt Of The Living Dead and it was shot in Louisiana. A mysterious woman on an island brings a man back from the dead and they seek revenge of those who killed him. Thick with voodoo and murky swamp vengeance, this is another rare treat for horror fans. Great extras and trailers as only Something Weird can do. Check it out!
