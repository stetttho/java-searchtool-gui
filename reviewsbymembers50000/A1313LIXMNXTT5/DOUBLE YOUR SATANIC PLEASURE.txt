 This is the best disc Something Weird has put out so far. The first movie is Asylum Of Satan by director William Girdler. This is the tale of a mysterious hospital run by a sinister man who keeps a beautiful woman there against her will. Of course she is going to be given to Satan during a black mass. Leading Lady Carla Borelli is very pleasant on the eyes and does a very good job as the damsel in distress. Charles Kissinger as the menacing Dr. Spector is top notch. Good shocks in this movie. The second feature is very twisted, but a lot of fun. It's Satan's Children and it's about a young man who is raped by four gay men and dumped on the side of the road and left for dead. A gropu od satanists find him and the female leader falls in love with him. She takes over the coven while the leader is away and proceeds to torture a lesbian member of the sect simply because she is a lesbian. Bobby, the young man who was raped is told he cannot be a satanist because he was raped and it proves he's weak!! He then hunts down his attackers and.....well I won't spoil it. Just ger this disc and see for yourself. You won't be disappointed. Lots of cool extras as well.
