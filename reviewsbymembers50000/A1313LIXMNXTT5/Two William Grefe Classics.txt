 This DVD release is a LONG awaited one for many film buffs. Many are familiar with Death Curse Of Tartu. This is the story of an Indian Witch Doctor who comes to life to kill those who have invaded his swampland burial ground. This is a very fine example of B movie making, and it has a great little musical number entitled "JoJoann." The acting is good and the lush color photography is very nice. The second Feature is the long awaited, little seen gem called Sting Of Death about a scientist who turns himself into a jellyfish monster and goes on a killing spree. The monster is certainly one of the most bizarre ever created. Doug Hobart plays the monster in both films. Neil Sedaka shows up and sings a little tune and this DVD features the lyrics so you can sing along!! No monster movie fan would want to miss this DVD. A big hand to Mike Vraney at Something Weird Video for turning this one out. Quality is VERY GOOD!! Highly recommended viewing!!
