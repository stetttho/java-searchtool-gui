 MGM has finally released what is perhaps the greatest television show ever made on DVD. This volume contains the entire first season of the Outer Limits. 32 episodes that all look brilliant and sharp!! My god, this is a collectors dream! Of course everyone will have their faves mine are Architects Of Fear, Zanti Misfits and ZZZZZ. This is a set not to be missed and MGM is to be commended for finally bringing this out. I can hardly wait for Vol. 2 season 2. Thank you MGM!
