 Pat Boyette, former comicbook artist for Charlton comics made this wonderful piece of cimematic horror. A man and his ship's captain find themselves stranded on an island inhabited by Count DeSade, an insane man if there ever was one. He spends most of the movie torturing the ships captain and making everyone else's life miserable as well. It's hard to believe it, but this film is about as creepy as they come. I first saw it in the early 80's and I am very glad it has been brought to DVD by Alpha. Check it out!!!
