 After having plunked down 20 bucks for this dvd, I have to say that I am disappointed with part of it. The first feature is one of the most bizarre I have ever seen. Two guys kidnap three women and scare them before having sex with them. A very odd and unusual concept. I liked the third girl a lot, she is very attractive, but cannot act worth beans. This feature called Scare Their Pants Off was ok. The second feature Satan's Bed is simply awful. The acting sucks, the dialog is wretched and Yoko Ono adds nothing but freak value to an already awful freak show. All I could make out was that two guys and a woman go on a crime spree attacking woman and raping them. If you like this kind of stuff then this is for you, but I felt cheated.
