 Great old fashioned creature feature about a monster that grows from a fossil and wrecks havoc in Copenhagen Denmark. Sure the effects are not very good, but this film has a special place in my heart as I saw it as a child and loved it. That magic hasn't gone away. Print quality is very good, and this DVD brings back the memories.
