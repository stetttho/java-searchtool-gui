 Finally, I got my hands on one of these precious books... A captivating compilation of scenes and sins of the Moulin Rouge. Flamboyantly laid out in foldout pages and glossy paper, making the book look even more exuberant and bursting with excitement. Contains little pieces on the real Moulin Rouge, Bohemian Revolution and of course, the infamous Elephant that Nicole Kidman lived in. The book largely comprises photographs not of the movie, including 3 chapters of pictures by 3 distinguishable phtographers/impressionists, with captions annexed on a separate page for each chapter so that the picture remains unobscured. A must buy, and I can't believe that Amazon is selling this at less than...
