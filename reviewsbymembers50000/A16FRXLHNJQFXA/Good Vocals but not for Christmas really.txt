 Christina Aguilera has a very good voice, I must say. POWERFUL, STRONG, DISTINCT and wide-ranging. I am not against Christina Aguilera, for I love her hits like I Turn To You and Come On Over. However, this album lacks some basic but important elements for Christmas! I haven't heard the whole CD yet, but I was very disappointed with These Are Special Times when I heard it, thinking it would be a remarkable remake of Celine Dion's title song for her 1998 Christmas CD. The first portion was ok, until at the end of the song when the notes began to soar (like all Diane Warren songs always do LOL), she seems to lose all emotions and all is but a show-off of her voice. I cannot really appreciate her constant changing of chords and keys, which appears to be unnecessary when one hears Celine's version of that song. This album, well, could have been hastily made since Christina recently cut a Spanish album. I still prefer her to seem pop to her remaking traditional Christmas music like O Holy Night etc. I can only say that this album can be much better in terms of emotions.  If you are looking for some Christmas music, try these titles: 1) Mariah Carey Merry Christmas 2) Cline Dion These Are Special Times 3) 98 deg. This Christmas
