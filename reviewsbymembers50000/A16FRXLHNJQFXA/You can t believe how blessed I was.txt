 This is the first Max Lucado book (well, book) I've ever read and no words in my venacular can praise his work enough. It has so inspired and blessed me!   Traveling Light is based on the old (and one of the most famous Psalms) Psalm (23) by David the King. Lucado guides the reader with such tenderness, light-heartedness (and I mean it... You won't believe how quirky and witty he can get *Grin*) and insight into the very heart of the Psalm and God, eventually.  I enjoy thoroughly the way Lucado writes about his personal encounters as well as draws experience from others (from his wife to Moses) to illustrate each topical aspect of the Psalm. And it really helps you to see the big picture about vital life lessons such as pride, want and fear.  Apart from that, each topic is supported by reading references and questions that challenge you to probe further until you get a satisfactory answer for yourself! His intuition to human needs is amazing: Lucado is able to ask questions which I have long wanted to ask, and gives answers in his writing. It's a brilliant book. What more can you ask for if a Psalm barely filling up a third of a page in a typical Bible is turned into sort of a guidebook comprising 220 pages? Truly, God must be in this writing. And if Max ever gets to read this book review, I'd like to thank him... For his modest sharing :o)
