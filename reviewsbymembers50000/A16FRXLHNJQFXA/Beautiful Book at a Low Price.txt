 2 friends bought me this book this year and I pored through the pages with a renewed fetish for volcanoes. As the cover page would tell, the pictures in there are really spectacular, making one wonder how they were even captured on paper! The variety is also varied enough to keep you interested - rather than yawning at the 203rd crater. From hellish looking magma swirling in a dark pitless crater, to crater lakes surrounded by uncountable flamingoes, to mystical colored sulphur pools and to "oogly" mud volcanoes, one HAS to stop and ponder the awesomeness of the Creator of these. I particularly like the accounts about real historical eruptions, though there are other really curious stories about how various cultures respond to the volcanic world. The only shortcoming is that the book is too heavy! Frankly, the pictures could have been a teeny weeny bit sharper, but they really ain't "that" bad.
