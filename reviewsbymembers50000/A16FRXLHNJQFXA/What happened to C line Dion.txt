 Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of Cline Dion's! And I still think she deserves that respect of mine for her phenomenal accomplishments in these short years. I think, however, I miss those days before All The Way... A Decade of Song, when she was really consummate in all her works. She did also admit that she was very disciplined in training her vocals as a professional. After her hiatus - and the baby - she began to sound all so nasal (she was in the first place, but she's getting more so!). This album totally proves that fact. Rather than the really majestic soaring voice she once had, she has been barely gratifying her fans now with very nasal thin vocals. What happened? Her rendition of What A Wonderful World in this album is one of the worst I've heard by a professional artist. Not forgetting the lackadaisical effort to please her fans with just 2 (2??) new songs. "I Ain't Gonna Look The Other Way" is good (but nasal still), but "You And I" was a disappointment, more suited for the new fans since A New Day Has Come. Bring back David Foster, Diane Warren... Bring back Cline Dion PLEASE.
