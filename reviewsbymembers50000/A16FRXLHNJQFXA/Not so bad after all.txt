 I used to think this CD would be a total flop, after witnessing the steady decline of the quality of Mariah's music since Butterfly was released. I hated the interludes because they were so short you can't count them as songs! I decided to acquire this CD after hearing Never Too Far, one of the songs I would not doubt at all, to hit #1 soon, if it hasn't been so. This song, albeit rather depressing, demands so much (in fact, too much) vocal power and flexibility that I doubt any other artist can really perform as well as Mariah Carey. Other songs including Lead The Way, Reflections (Care Enough) and Don't Stop are classic Mariah Carey- style ballads and R&B numbers that never fail to mesmerise me.  I thought few songs rather dull, and not worth listening to: If We, All My Life and Want You. Pretty much monotonous and over-emphasised with intricately, or should I say compicatingly, woven layers and "lazy" whines. A good buy still, I would say... If you are doubting this CD and Mariah's real musical talent, trust her again.
