 I only just bought this CD today, and can't have enough of listening to it. I remember I was watching the live telecast of this cherished telethon for our heroes on a Saturday morning, and fell in love with each and every contribution that the artists have made.  The recording is superb and it's difficult to decide whether this is a live recording or a studio recording! The sound is crisp and clear, no applause, no distraction. The organization even corrects some of the not-so-well-done parts of some songs (e.g. Mariah Carey's Hero where there was a part her 'inside' was not clearly sung).  It's guaranteed to suit every one, every type of music lover, with a collection of songs for a good cause. Inspiring, strengthening and loving the songs may be, but let's keep them to our hearts. Makes a great Christmas gift or New Year's Gift. Never too late for resolutions.
