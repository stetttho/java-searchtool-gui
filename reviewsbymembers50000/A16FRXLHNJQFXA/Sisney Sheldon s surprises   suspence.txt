 Really, this is the best book I've ever read after "The Best Laid Plans" again by Sidney Sheldon. If you are reading other reviews on this book, try to avoid ones telling you the synopsis, or else there will  be no point, really, to read this book. I'm not going to tell you what it  is about but I could possibly tell you that be prepared that the climax is  not reached until the third book. Be sure to read till the end, or you'll  regret! Now about Sheldon: He has the ability to frame an innocent person  to look like the tyrant of the century and conceal so meticulously the  deepest secret of an ordinary person. I guess that's what makes Sheldon's  books so special and luridly intriguing!
