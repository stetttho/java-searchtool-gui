 You can get what's worth of this CD, believe me. The lyrics are beautiful and meaningful. Especially "Oh How The Years Go By" (that's my favorite), it is soothing and it really lifts your spirits! "Happiness" is another great hit! Though it's a bit cheeky at the beginning, but it fully depicts what real happiness is. If you haven't been able to get your hands on a good CD for a long time, this is the one for you!
