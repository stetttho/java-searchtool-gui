 My sister bought me Charmbracelet for Christmas last year, after months of complaining of my economic plight that deterred me from buying this CD. But in retrospect, if I had known how the contents of this album, I would have bought it anyway with the paltry little I had. Let me first clarify that I have been disappointed with Mariah Carey's Glitter (her last release) which is little more than tracks of weird noises and gasps, drowned by incessant repertoire of raps. Unsurprisingly, the last album released quite a bit of thrashing and I would have given it 2.5 stars. However, we see a distinct departure from the heavy accent of R&B that is characteristic of Glitter in this album. Mariah Carey belted out a number of powerful ballads including Through The Rain (need I say more about this song?) and I Only Wanted, alternating sensationally between her soaring voice and remarkable vocal acrobatics. Other genres featured in the album include the catchy R&B tune of The One, whose storytelling lyrics laced with an inquisitive note resemble that of Breakdown in the album Butterfly (1997), the Gospel-Christian My Saving Grace, and soft rock number Bringin' On A Heartbreak, which as far as I can remember, is Mariah's first attempt, rather successfully, at soft rock. The strength of the album lies in the heartfelt language and its I'm-crying-out-for-understanding attitude. Mariah's ability to string the later part of her life story in a series of 17 songs is completely a delight. I wouldn't say it's her best album because I believe Mariah has adopted a humbler stance to performing, but suffice to say, has brought her back to the golden stage again. Good work Mariah! (Ps: Through The Rain's MTV has been praised by many)
