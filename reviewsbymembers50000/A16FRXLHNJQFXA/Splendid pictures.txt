 Be sure to buy this book! The pictures are well scanned and there are footnotes to tell you about the history of Cunard Line. The book also mentions about the Queens of the Atlantic, the Mary, Elizabeth and QE2. The layout is nice and the organization of information is discreet and orderly. It's quite a good read!
