 I am so proud of one of the few local exports that Singapore produces authentically. Corrinne May may appear a far cry from sensational pop divas like Mariah Carey, Barbra Streisand and Cline Dion, but is, nonetheless, equally aesthetic and even quipped by renowned figures, such as singer-songwriter Carole King, as a true artist. Her debut album compiles many of her excellent work of emotionally rich songs. One of my favorites is Fly Away, which talks about the painful separation(s) between a mother and daughter. Beautifully written by a young lady, who used to read Literature in the National University of Singapore, and sung with the heart that I can only listen in awe. (My friend listened to one song for 1 hour - What more can I say?)
