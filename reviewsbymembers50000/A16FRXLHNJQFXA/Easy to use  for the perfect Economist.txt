 I just love this travel guide to New York City. Written with a spirit of discovery and frank commentaries, one can't find a better budget guide book than this. The book is categorically divided into different segments representing different activities from dining to places-of-interest. The range of choices in food, accommodation and travel hot spots will tickle your desire to go on a trip to NYC but immediately. It offers a wide array of prices and quality of products to expect in NYC: from posh Plaza Hotel that "looks like a cake sitting opposite Central Park" to the economical Sweet Hill Intl Hostel in North Mahattan; from cheap F&B to the mouth watering French cuisines; from free Staten Ferry rides to the elite class' pastime of scaling the Empire State Building - Frommer's got it all there. It's a all-in-one book with a free map and subway notes. BUY IT!
