 This novel talks about a rich lawyer in a big firm, becoming a street lawyer for the homeless, having held a hostage by a homeless man. I would say that this title is not as good as the Rainmaker, though the research is just as good. This is one thing I like about Grisham. His novels are practical at least. Of the 290+ reviews, many criticize a hell out of this book, but I think that it is not so bad, that's why I gave it a 4 star.  However, I must say the settlement of the eviction case in the story is not very arousing and exciting, moreover, the ending is not very appropriate (rather abrupt). Personally, I feel that the end could be brushed on upon more.
