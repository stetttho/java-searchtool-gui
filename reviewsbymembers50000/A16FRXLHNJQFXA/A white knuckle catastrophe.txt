 This story talks @ a ship named A. Gail being lost at sea, and some other peripherals of this Mother of the Storms. It brings you into the story and you get to experience the 100-foot waves and the 70 kt winds. The story is well paced and I think that works, it makes the story an exciting one. It shows you the theme of dangers at sea and a slight glimpse on the human reaction. Pretty good read, I must say.
