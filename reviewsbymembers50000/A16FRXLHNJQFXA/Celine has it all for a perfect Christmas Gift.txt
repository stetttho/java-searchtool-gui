 The album has a mix of catchy and lovely tunes for Christmas. It  opens with the traditional and majestic O Holy Night, featuring a combination of her gentle voice and the choir. The apt mix of carols, love songs, traditional Christmas music and warmth are all strong reasons why this album is a gem for Christmas. I especially like "Don't Save It All For Christmas Day" (one of the 2 rare songs Celine co-wrote, ever) because the lyrics are so true, topped with Celine's powerful voice at the end of the song. The album also contains 2 beautiful duets: I'm Your Angel and The Prayer which you will surely hold to your heart the moment you hear them. the last 2 tracks are especially lovely, when Celine sang with her whole family of 16, joining their voices in unison wishing us all Feliz Navidad. I can tuly say, every time I listen to this CD, well, These Are Special Times... God bless, and MERRY CHRISTMAS
