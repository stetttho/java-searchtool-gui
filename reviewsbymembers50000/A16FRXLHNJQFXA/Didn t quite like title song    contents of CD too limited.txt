 Like A Rose is not really a legendary hit like I'll Be The One (BSB), Same Old Brand New You (A1, 2000 release). I thought that Ben Adams (lead singer), sounded a bit nasal on this song, and the title and lyrics didn't make much sense. In a way, it is awkward for a boyband to sing phrases like "Treat me like a rose..." Coupled with Ben's voice, it somehow is not a really perfect song to listen to when you are feeling bored or need to relax. However, a good try by A1, and still quite presentable, otherwise this song wouldn't have earned a place in the TOP 10. The CD does not have much -- only the title track, an instrumental song and a remix (I don't really like remixes for I think originals are always gems). Quite an expensive single considering there are only 2 tracks with lyrics...
