 I love the music/soundtrack as much as I love the movie! The score of this movie is basically a collection of old tunes juxtaposed with more catchy modern pieces like What A Girl Wants by teen-popstar Christina Aguilera. The highlight though, of this soundtrack, is the numerous beautifully arranged jazz songs ranging from the great Frank Sinatra's cheeky I Won't Dnce and Davis Jr's soulful Something's Gotta Give. It's a beautiful collection of tunes you will never forget, almost ethereal and heavenly. But I do believe there are a few tracks left out which are found originally in the movie.  Ps: Watch the movie too. It's a hit!
