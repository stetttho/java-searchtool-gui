 Reflections is one of the 4 songs I like from Mariah's new album. And very much the best of all. Still with very typical Mariah-poetic lyrics and super high notes.. CD comes with an exclusive cover art design and a Japanese OBI strip lining the spine.The CD is a little pricy for 2 songs and besides the second track is just an instrumental of the song. Buy it only if you are a Collector without the album.
