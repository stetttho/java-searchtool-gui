 Take On Me, I must say, is pretty well done... and is a note-for-note remake of AHA's version. I can't say that A1 has done a better job than AHA, but it is still a good try. However, I found the bridge of that song quite awkwardly sung. It could haven been better. I was disappointed to discover that this CD does not have the video of the title, but merely a few video clips of interviews. If you are an A1 fan, of course this is a good buy for you.  I've Got Sunshine is a truly refreshing song. It does not have all those themes of a typical boyband like loneliness, heartbreaks etc etc... A peculiar band A1 is, and I am impressed. I believe the video of Take On Me can be found on the UK release of this single (also found in Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk)
