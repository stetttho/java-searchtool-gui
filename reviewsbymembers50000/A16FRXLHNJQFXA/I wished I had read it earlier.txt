 I finished this book in less than 3 hours while commuting, and I thought to myself, did I have a deprived childhood or something to only read it when I am 18! I never knew that this book was so much fun which I thought looked a little daunting when I was little. Indeed, the English was stupendous and maybe a little deep for a 10 year old. 13-15 would be much more a right age. The story is very much a fairy tale, and yet at the same time blended with wit, adventure and mystery wrapped together in a very much believable context. Although it's a little grimly to read about the violence of the Trunchbull. Watch the movie, starring Mara Wilson, you will love it. Makes a great Birthday or Christmas gift. It's not too early to shop for the holidays, is it?
