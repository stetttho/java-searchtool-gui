 This CD contains 3 of Mariah's most beautiful song. There For Me (An unreleased track) is featured here and even though it's not widely publicised like Never Too Far and Hero (weaved into an impeccable medley), it is one of the most consummately sung song I have ever seen. Buy it for a Christmas present, and indulgence in a golden voice is "never too far". :o)
