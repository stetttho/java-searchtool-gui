 Most people who relish songs like My Heart Will Go On and Because You Loved Me, might have put this CD out of the spotlight. In one of C?line's first English albums, we hear her burgeoning career crafted by writers of her more recent hit songs like Diane Warren (Love Can Move Mountains, If You Asked Me To, Nothing Broken But My Heart) and David Foster. One interesting song is by Prince, who having discovered C?line's talent had especially wrote it for her. C?line never fails to use every bit of her soul to sing these songs, and millions can attest to her insuperable dedication in singing, singing well. However, expect to hear quite a different voice from how she sings now... She can be a little loud and explosive sometimes in this CD. A well worth CD. Recommended.
