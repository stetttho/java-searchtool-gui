 I Turn To You is a song I cannot get tired of. Christina Aguilera has displayed a wide vocal range in this song and put enough emotions to put her on par with singers like Celine Dion and Michael Bolton. Indeed, it is  amazing to expect such a high quality from a teenage singer. The lyrics and  music of the song is beautifully and powerfully written by the legendary  Diane Warren, and watching the video, I reckon it is a song written as a  tribute to mothers. Easily it can move one to tears. Por Siempre Tu is  the Spanish version of I Turn To You and it further demonstrates  Christina's capability and talent in able to sing well in another  language. The video is a bonus because enhanced CD's and videos are not  very easily available, especially with Sony artists. Very well arranged,  and makes this whole CD a definite must buy. US$4 ++ is not really a  problem to many.
