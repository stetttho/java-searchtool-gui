 This is a great album. Although I don't understand what's she singing, but  I can sense the beauty of the world by listening to it. Be sure to buy it!  And especially listen to tracks 4,7,8,12! S'il Suffisait D'aimer would now  be my favorite album in the whole world.  Ps: Buy the coming-soon Christmas  Album too!
