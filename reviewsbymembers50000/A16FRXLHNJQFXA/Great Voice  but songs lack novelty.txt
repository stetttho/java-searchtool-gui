 When I first heard For A Moment on the radio, I thought it was Mariah Carey's new number - for a while. Kelly Clarkson's voice resembles more than remotely Mariah's volume and, to a lesser extent, range (She didn't do Star Spangled Banner too well). A few friends kept insisting that it was Mariah, nevertheless, when we heard the song on radio, and I felt the voice lacked a quality somewhat.  Being in Singapore, I didn't have the privilege to catch the first season of A.I. but am very pleased with the caliber of singers that the show produced. Kelly Clarkson is definitely a superb singer, but the material that was given her is nothing out of the ordinary. The lyrics are the usual I-can't-live-without-yous. Besides, I still insist that you need a full-fledged singer to sing such emotional songs. (Compare Kelly's Natural Woman and Cline Dion's) A fair attempt, a great voice, a promising future! Way to go, Kelly.
