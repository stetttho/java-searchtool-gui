 Come What May has been one of the chart toppers that almost instantly relates itself voluntarily to Moulin Rouge and its amateurish performers that created it - Ewan McGregor (Star Wars) and Nicole Kidman (Ex Mrs Cruise).     Penned by legendary David Foster who also wrote for renowned songsters, including Cline Dion, Mariah Carey and Chicago (It's Hard To Say I'm Sorry), the song is surround with surrealism and is clearly evident of Foster's visit. Sung by actor and actress of Moulin Rouge!, the song is just a breeze of fresh air, with new voices.    The remixes are however not up to my expectation and the tempo is exactly the same with distracting techno beats in the background that almost annihilate the magic of the song. However, one may find the Film version compellingly emotional and much more intense, albeit shorter (3 min+).    The elephant medley (instrumental) is congruent to the one you find in the soundtrack, only without voices. You may like to sing along with it. :o)    Cover art designed well, showing Ewan and Nicole caressing. A good buy if you do not want the soundtrack but only Come What may. Not a good buy if you wanna listen to remixes.
