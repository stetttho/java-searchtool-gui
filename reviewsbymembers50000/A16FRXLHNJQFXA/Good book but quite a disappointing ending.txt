 Highly complicated plot, yet easy to understand. Grisham is starting to be like Jeffrey Archer and all the other masterful story-tellers. I must say that I personally love the plot a lot, because it is not so much about the  boring law stuff which he usually writes about. The ending was a bit  disappointing because I would expect Alan Lake to go bust, butb he didn't  and the resolution of his downfall was somewhat simplistic. Other than  that, I would encourage all thriller-lovers to read this, I finished it in  only 2.5 hours.
