 Even if you are not a Celine Dion fan, you will love this album. I was very surprised to discover that Sony actually released the Japanese version of Be The Man on this album! However, I do have to comment that Celine is not really capable of singing in Japanese for it doesn't sound like Japanese. I am saying that because being in Asia, I have a certain amount of exposure to Japanese music, but she did try hard enough to pronounce properly... Perhaps Be The Man (in English) would suit the majority in the western world... This compilation, according to Sony, contains the semi-rare songs of Celine, though they are not hits. Well, I can't really say that's true for each songs sounds like hits! The songs show different facets of Celine, and this "feeling machine" has done each and every of her songs so very well, in terms of emotions, vocal presentation etc. Songs like Falling Into You, Seduces Me, Sola Otra Vez (Spanish All By Myself), Us and With This Tear are a but on the sadder tempo, but generally, still good enough to give you goosebumps. I especially like The Prayer, and The Power of the Dream, 2 of the most majestic songs on this album. I can tell you Celine sings it with such high profession and skill that few artists are able to do that.  The only disappointment with the CD is that the liner notes are simple (no pictures) and without the lyrics too... It is not really typical of sony to do that. The lyrics are beautiful, the music is soothing, if you haven't found a good album for a very long time, this is the one for you. Truly a Collector's Item... though it isn't limited, really.
