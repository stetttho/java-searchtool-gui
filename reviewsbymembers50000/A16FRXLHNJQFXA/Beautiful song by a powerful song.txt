 Very beautiful song written by Diane Warren, sung by C?line Dion, whose voice seems comparable in this song. The remixes are not bad, though I think they are not as good as the album version of I Want You To Need Me.  CD has beautiful cover art, with nice design. Rare and is truly a treasure  to all Diane's fans or Celine's fans!
