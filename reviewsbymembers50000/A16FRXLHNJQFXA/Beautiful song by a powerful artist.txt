 This CD contains remixes of Celine Dion's latest That's The Way It Is and  I Want You To Need Me. She has shown much concentration and emotions in her  singing that causes much meaning to these 2 songs. The remixes are notn  bad, though I would say that the original versions are much better,  especially for I Want You To Need Me. Contains tracks like Thunderpuss Club  Mix of IWYTNM not available on Italian CD Single. Overall, it is worth the  buying.
