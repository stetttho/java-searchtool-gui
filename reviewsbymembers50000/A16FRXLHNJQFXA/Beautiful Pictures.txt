 This is a very beautiful book, with pictures from the interior designs of memoriabilia in Normandie to the whaling over of Normandie. The book has a very detailed description or caption for every picture (all 190!), and they give much insight to this grandest ship in the world. I particularly like  the pictures showing Normandie lying on one side, even though gloomy,  Normandie must have looked really majestic! Braynard has done an obvious  research about all this, you will not be disappointed!
