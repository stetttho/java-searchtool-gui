 I very much wanted to watch this movie when it was screened in Singapore in 1998/9, but was prevented from doing so by my busy schedule. However, recently I had the privilege to watch this video on CD.  Beyond the simple and easily-understood plot, I find a disturbingly strong and genuine message in the story. It was in a conformist world that the 2 children Bud and Mary Sue found /helped find true "liberty". Ironically, the liberty the citizens of PLEASANTVILLE was but a hoax conjured by social beliefs and refusal to accept changes. And it was easy to capture the message as the ignorant ones are still in B&W (Notice when Mary Sue turned to technicolor, for those who are against the sex part of the movie...) It seems natural and indeed it is, that every human being has a potential to discover their gifts to the fullest, yet may be conditioned to choose to bury them by lies which appear rosy. Under the faade? Only something less desirable.  Another aspect touched on which I felt was worthy of mentioning was the unsettling discontentment of people, because of the difficulties they face in an imperfect world, and try all they can to look for the long-anticipated UTOPIA, thinking that human effort would be more than sufficient to establish something long lasting and perfect. Well, no. The movie with its succinct message: People are stifled as a result.  The movie provokes interesting questions about life, yet at the same time highlights the impossibilty of utopias on Earth. In fact utopia-seekers are pretentiously denying their attitude of escapism. So to all looking for PLEASANTVILLE, stop looking, and learn to accept change.
