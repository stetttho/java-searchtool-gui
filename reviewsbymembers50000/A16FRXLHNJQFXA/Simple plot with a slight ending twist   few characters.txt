 The story seemed promising to me initially when Grisham introduced the Judge's summons (for the "appropriation of his estates" immediately in the first chapter. No wishy washy background painting through laborious description, but artfully done as the pages turn, in between events. I thought that Grisham has made a deliberate effort to create this atmosphere of suspense when the Judge died suddenly and US$3 million was uncovered almost simultaneously in the study (I thought it was a little unrealistically easy to uncover US$3 m). Though it sets you in the mood in anticipation of some great story, this later evolved into a lazy elimination game of who was threatening the safety of Ray (The Judge's first son) because he took the money, in which game the reader has to keep guessing among the few characters with the help of weak clues and unexciting links - e.g. the arson of a private jet, a series of photographs of Chaney's where the money was hidden. The perpetrator was however surprisingly unpredicted (at first, I may say), but even that, the chagrin is quite mild, if not insignificant. The open ended conclusion was a further let down. A simple read, and briefly compiled for the enjoyment of a summer holidays' vacationer. Not a typical thriller.
