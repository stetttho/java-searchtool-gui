 I watched the movie only to discover how much more creative and delightful Moulin Rouge! can get when juxtaposed with the 1954 version (I am not saying that the old one is lousy, in fact it's more poignant). And I must say music has played a critical role in the movie's soaring success. Being a great fan of David Foster, I just love the soundtrack that he has co-produced, with stupendously ingenious writers and coordinators. The movie just came alive with each and every single note that Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman (!!!), "Harry Zidler" and more sing! All these showcased in a gem --> The soundtrack of course. My personal favorites are Lady Marmalade, Your Song, Elephant Medley (u should hear how each song flows into another), Come What May (Buy the single which has the Film Version! U can find it in Amazon too!) and Sparkling Diamonds. The only 2 setbacks of this soundtrack are it doesn't sound as majestic as the movie's play and the producers forgot to include the better songs like Spectacular Spectacular and Like A Virgin (Hilarious, tomfoolery!). Other than that, it's quite a good buy... MR/ is my favorite movie after aeons of stagnation at Titanic and Meet The Parents... Phew* Thanks Baz and David for such a wonderful combustion of ideas. BUY IT NOW!
