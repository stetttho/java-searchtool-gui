 I bought this soundtrack on impulse. Wanted so much to wait until all the frenzy ceases. But found that perhaps my feelings and legitimate "lust" for the music for Baz's latest epic remake of French social revolution at the Moulin Rouge are beyond the control of me. Heard songs (hits, rather) like Come What May, Your Song (Elton John) and (of course) LADY MARMALADE on the radio and all over Singapore, and I thought I really should make these gems part of my music collection. It's interesting how little effort the crew and music team put in to come out with a soundtrack that far exceeds previous mammoth successes like Titanic, Pearl Habor and even The Land Before Time. Insuperable collaborations with music masters and think tanks of remake-wizards: The MOULIN ROUGE! soundtrack has relived every scene of the movie and of course the original essence of the notorious French nightclub of the 1900s. El Tango De Roxanne came as quite a nice surprise for its distinctively Spanish touch despite Moulin Rouge's French-English (and oh yes, Bohemian) setting. The performers are also blowing, Ewan has a shockingly powerful and choral voice (should have made a better solo artist!), while Kidman appalled me with her wide range (Hindi Sad Diamonds). The only regret is that the soundtrack does not have lyrics included, and that's quite a fair bit of injustice done to a musical-soundtrack. If you are looking for crazy remakes of cute songs like Like A Virgin, Spectacular Spectacular (Can Can Dance) and The Show Must Go On, you might be disappointed as they are not included in the CD.
