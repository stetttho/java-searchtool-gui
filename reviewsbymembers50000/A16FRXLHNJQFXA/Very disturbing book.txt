 This book is generally an average book. It talks about a rural girl moving to the Appalachians, away from her usual lifestyle back with her mum. I was quite disturbed that 3 people died in the first 5 chapters, later 1 or 2  more died including the character's child. That was appalling, and I think  the author is trying to say, by using comparison between Julie and her  husband, to survive one must help oneself and through supplication to God.  But it was so obscure that it looks as if the whole story talks about how  fate plays with their lives. They lost money, houses, everything, and then  the story ended off with both of them walking back to I-forgot-where to  start afresh. It is no typical book of Oprah, even though if you want to  have a read on the bus or so, this is just about average for all -- easy to  read, and simple.
