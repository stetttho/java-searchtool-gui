 Philip Yancey offers a very different, yet deeply provocative dimension to the problem of pain. It isn't the kind of book that one would expect give a direct answer to the question the title of the book poses: Where is God when it most hurt? When the world seems to be crashing down? When loneliness creeps in like a sinister fiend? Yancey doesn't dispute the notion of a good God, but he used painful examples of admirable and make-you-take-your-hats-off real life figures, from Olympic star to Holocaust victim, to dispel the notion that God is absent in times of fear and despondency. It is quite apparent in such times God tends to change and mould a person.  Though many do not like the message of pain, but Yancey has given a very honest, real and undismissive acknowledgement of the sufferings of this world. It is easy to wish away all pain, and look to God for a convenient escape, but pain seems to persist stubbornly. Pain that can change if we allow it, pain that has value and created for the purpose of alarming the body, mind and spirit of danger.  In conclusion, I feel this book has answered the first question in a very oblique and ambiguous manner. Where is God when it hurts? Well, He's in it, but it really matters what you choose to allow Him to do/to do yourself.  (I feel especially touched about examples of thankfulness, of praise, of resolve in times of pain. I thought you might also complement this with C. S. Lewis's A Grief Observed & The Problem of Pain - He debates about God's goodness and God's ability to use pain as an instrument of revelation)
