 Very short biography on Cline Dion, succinct and concisely put. Suitable for a person interested on the brief history of one great singer, but not so for a fan. I would recommend the Official Biogaphy or My Story, My Dream for someone who wants to learn more about Cline Dion. There are a few pictures printed on glossy paper, but I feel are too small. The quality of the paper is mediocre and ages have yellowed my book. It is not quite pleasant. But generally, quite a smooth and memorable read.
