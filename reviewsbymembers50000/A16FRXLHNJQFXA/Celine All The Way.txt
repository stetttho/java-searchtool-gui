 This is a very nice compilation of all her old songs. A must buy for any fan of hers. I live in Singapore therefore I manage to get the Asian version of this CD (which I can get for you at a nominal fee of US$3).  Quite worth the money, considering Singapore gives away shopping bags with  Celine printed on it, while Esprit is crazily selling this set for US$47  when I get it for less than a third this price! Well, I just hope that  Cline has a good rest in her semi-break now, and may God bless her and  those whom she cares for. :o)
