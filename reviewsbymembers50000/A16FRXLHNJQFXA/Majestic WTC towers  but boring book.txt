 This book, albeit with a rather promising cover, is barely 30 pages thick... I think 25 pages would be an overstatement! It is too thin for one to truely grasp the beauty of those 2 towers. The many pictures, I found, are so similar, taken from the sea from different distances and at different angles. It's too boring for one would have familiarised with the New York skyline within the first 6 pages. However, the pictures are clear and taken on days suitable for postcard-pictures, if you know what I mean. A mediocre book, buy it only if you want to vaguely remind yourself of the 2 towers and their pre-eminence in Lower Mahattan or if you have never seen the towers before.
