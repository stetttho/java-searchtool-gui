 This book is allegedly written by Celine Dion herself, but it is not true, as it is actually penned by Germain (offical writer of her first official biography) himself. The book is amazingly beautiful, with all the pictures and hard cover layout. If you are looking for a book that gives the details of Celine's recent life, this one has the answer for you. You even know more about her pregnancy!
