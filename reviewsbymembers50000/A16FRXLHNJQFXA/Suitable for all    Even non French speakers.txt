 Some people get really touchy when they ponder whether to buy one of Cline Dion's product for fear of some nasal art produced by a mediocre artist. Well, this album might be it that will change your point of view in spite of her amateurish try with French rock star Jean Jacques Goldman.  The first track is a soulful French ballad that showcases Cline Dion's deeply felt emotions together with the innovative arrangements of Jean Jacques Goldman's catchy beats. Later Cline's music evolves into a variety of genres including the impishly jazzy Le Ballet (which is a feature song for her D'eux concerts), the rock Cherchez Encore and J'iras Ou Tu Iras and more soulful Le Memoire D'Abraham and Vole. Not to forget the uptempo Destin for the pop-goers.  Would strongly recommend this to everyone, who hasn't heard good music for a long time. This is timeless and one of Cline's best albums in my opinion. If you like this, probably you will like S'il Suffisait D'aimer and A New Day Has Come as well.
