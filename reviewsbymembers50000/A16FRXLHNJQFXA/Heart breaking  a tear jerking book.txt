 This story about a woman absconding with her son from her husband who was ever so brutal and would cruelly beat her until she was battered and mentally broken, portrayed a sense of family life of a different kind,  something that we not see every day. Especially till the end, you would  find the pain of her living without her son, Robert, who was later unfairly  taken away from her for the first time, when she had just finally settled a  new life, really shattering and devastating to a woman's life. The story  ended off with a rhetorical "I don't know", that was ever so  distant and you could hear the echoes and reverberations in your heart,  haunting you.. A must read for all, a credible Oprah book!
