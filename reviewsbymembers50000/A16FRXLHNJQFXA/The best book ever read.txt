 As a student in Singapore, I haven't had much time for reading storybooks due to the long school hours and tight schedule for exams and tests. But I make it a point to read at least 50 pages a day to nourish my mind. But  when I picked up The Best Laid Plans, I had a feeling that it would be  good. (Partly because I like the cover also) This is also my first Sidney  Sheldon book, and I must say I was astounded by the shift flow of events  and double meanings used in this book. It also shows how people think in  their mind, which is absent in most books and we cannot truly develope a  clear understanding of the characters. Apart from the errotic moments in  this book that most people are interested in, the plot is superb and  unpredictable. It moves you in circles, but at the same time, well paced  and can be easily followed. The number of characters is also ample to draw  out the plot, but Sidney doesn't overdo it. For example, when a story  includes and draws in too many characters, it confuses people. I couldn't  stop, I broke my plan and finished it in 2 days. I am so happy to have  bought this book and wish that Sidney will continue to produce novels of  such high qualities. And that also mean that I will buy a bulk of his past  15 or so novels!
