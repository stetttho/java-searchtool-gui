 I have previously reviewed this CD and I gave it 5 stars. Now that the hype has almost subsided and I am a little more clear headed, I hope to offer a more honest review, especially when I have listened to this CD intently a few more times. Cline Dion has indisputably one of the best voices in the modern and contemporary music scene, not to mention the highly distinctive specialty in her voice. She has displayed that majesty and elegance in this album more than the others, I feel, through remarkable dexterity and maturity. In this album includes a diverse range of genres, and it is a further testimony to Cline's adept ability to perform well in every field of music. Highlights include her unprecedented techno-dance music featured in the songs Sorry For Love and When The Wrong One Loves You Right. The catchy beats are indubitably an attractive allure for the younger listeners. But Cline is not quick to shed her adult-contemporary style and disposition, for she eagerly pursues meaning in songs such as Have You Ever Been In Love (towards the end, you can feel her utmost disbelief for the magic of love in her voice), A New Day Has Come (Album Version) and The Greatest Reward. The Greatest Reward is a personal favorite and I thought the lyrics were very well written.  Then Cline topped it all up with other genres like jazz (At Last), Soft Rock (Ten Days), Pop (Right In Front Of You & I'm Alive, a little reminiscent of That's The Way It Is in her last album) and power musical-appropriate songs such as Nature Boy, made popular by the movie Moulin Rouge!. The only regret is this album is quite lacklustre in terms of ballads. Because You Loved Me and My Heart Will Go On cannot be overtaken by any of the few ballads found on this album. I thought Cline was most agile in expressing in these previous ballads which are not only award winning, but are her signatures practically. A good buy, though I believe you would love it as a compilation with her previous hits.
