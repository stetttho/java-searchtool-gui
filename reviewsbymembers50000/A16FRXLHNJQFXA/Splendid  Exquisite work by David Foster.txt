 David Foster has always been one of my personal favorite songwriters (and singers?)... This album is an archetype of David's lifting and inspiring climate in his songs. This album includes beautifully composed numbers like The Colour Of My Love (Cline Dion hit?) and, Jebbas which is more up tempo. The last track, Love Lights The World, sung by 3 glorious voices -- Peabo Bryson, Cline Dion and Color Me Badd, holds a very special place in my heart. For those who haven't heard a good CD for a long time, buy this one. My favorite of Foster's works.
