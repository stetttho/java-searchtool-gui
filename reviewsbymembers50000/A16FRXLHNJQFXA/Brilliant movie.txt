 Roald Dahl's Matilda in literary sense is already a masterpiece deserving more than any award you can think of; The movie is a notch higher than the book where every detail in the book comes to life. Apart from the infamously cheeky Mara Wilson (I love her!), we have Danny DeVito too, whose quirky and phony mannerism only can wipe that frown from your face after a hard day's work.  The content is a little disturbing, if not offensive though, especially to a young kid. There's a scene when a girl is swung about by Miss Trunchbull by her pigtails like a person would a hammer. It was scandalous, and I was quite surprised that the directors and producers are so faithful to Roald Dahl's imaginations.  A perfect children's video, for children who think no one loves them, for children who are too often misunderstood, for children who are ignored, for children who are bullied in school... hey, little friend, big is not always right :o) (parental guidance and maternal+paternal love needed)
