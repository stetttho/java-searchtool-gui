 Never Too Far is one of the best songs in Glitter. I particularly like it to have amply displayed Mariah's flexible vocal capabilities and her wide range (it's scary, the range). Lyrics are pretty morose but she sang it with consummate skill and emotions, making it really moving. A beautiful ballade. However, Loverboy Remix and Don't Stop appear lousy beside Never Too Far. Don't Stop has been frequently derided for its minimal Mariah-touch. She merely sings no more than 5 lines (I think) which I can't hear clearly. Loverboy is, well, not as good as Heartbreaker. More than 10 bucks for this single... Recommend you buy the album.
