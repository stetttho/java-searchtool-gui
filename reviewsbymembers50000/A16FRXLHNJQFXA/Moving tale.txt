 Well, this book is not really a tale cos Sparks revealed it was a true story at the prologue. I never fail to be surprised by Sparks' obvious talent in taking everyday life of other people into a reader's heart. The story talks about the wrestle guilt is fighting with fear. Very compelling and powerfully portrayed, I thought. If you think this book is just another silly romance story, you can't be more wrong. Sparks masterfully weaves in a little bit of irksome suspense that pushes you on to finish the book, though I thought it was overdone in the first half of the book... The suspense was excruciating, that's why I take off a star. Very recommendable read, though I believe Sparks' fans prefer The Rescue.
