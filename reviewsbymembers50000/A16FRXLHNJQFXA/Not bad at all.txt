 I have been hearing bad reviews about Mariah's latest CD, Glitter. I listen to quite a number of the tracks, they are actually not bad. Not so terrible that you have to shut your ears. Loverboy is fun and though I thought she didn't appear composed on her video. Lead the Way and (YES!!!) Never Too Far are beautiful ballades sung with vocal dexterity insuperable by many many artists. Perhaps buy this from Amazon.com/auctions if you are never a listener of MC, but sure buy it if you like R&B!
