 It's a heart wrenching personal account on the enigmatic Mt. Everest. With so many lives loss, the story is made interesting and lucid. I'm not being callous about the losses of lives, but this is the way the story captures you. It's a terrific page turner and you just can't put the book down. From my own experience, I find that I read this book exceptionally fast. I like the ending, especially. Jon depicts the theme of unpredictability of the mountain, and weaves tales of Gods and Goddesses. But there is one flaw about this book, the story is not in chronological order sometimes, and Jon keeps changing the names from the first to last. However, it is still a must-read!
