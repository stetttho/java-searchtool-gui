 Ella Fitzgerald had it all as a singer  gorgeous tone, perfect diction, great phrasing, a striking sense of rhythm and, best of all, a sense of play and humor that made her joy to listen to every time. Her jazz Christmas album, Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas, has been one of my favorites for years, so I immediately grabbed this one, made up of religious Christmas music, when I saw it in the store last year.  To be honest, I was a little disappointed. Its not a bad album. Her voice is, as always, lovely. But because of the nature of the material, the things that made Fitzgerald such a joy to hear are missing. How much can you play with O Holy Night? How much heart and soul can even a singer as fine as Fitzgerald find in God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen? The songs, obviously, are timelessly beautiful, and Fitzgerald sings them in elegant and lovely style. But, ironically, youll find more of the joyous spirit of Christmas in the secular and jazzy Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas than here.
