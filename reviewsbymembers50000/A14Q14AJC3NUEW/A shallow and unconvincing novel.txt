 This is one of the most shallow and unconvincing books I*ve ever read. It focuses on an extremely conservative religious cult which emphasizes medieval punishments for every small "sin." That could have been interesting. Barbara Kingsolver dealt with the psychological and political effects of such narrow and mean-spirited religious ideas in The Poisonwood Bible and produced a fascinating and challenging novel. But in The Rapture of Canaan, Sheri Reynolds never probes below the surface. She just piles up bizarre details about the cult, trying to show us that it*s bad to envision God as nothing more than a mean old man who punishes people. Well, okay. I agree. But more and more details about how really, really bad this view of religion is doesn*t make for compelling reading. And because Reynolds offers no insight into what draws people to this kind of religion, the characters who are caught up in this church come across as either idiots or sheep. Reynolds had one potentially interesting character ï¿½ the grandmother of the narrator, who is married to the church*s cold and angry patriarch, and yet has some doubts about the religion. The only thing that kept me reading to the end was the hope that at some point Reynolds would develop this character and offer some insight into the contradiction, and that I might understand a little more about what holds people in a church that seems to offer them so little. It never happened. This book was simply a waste of my time.
