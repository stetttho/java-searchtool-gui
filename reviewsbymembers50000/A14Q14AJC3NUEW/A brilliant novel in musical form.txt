 What a shame the production of The Capeman failed, because that failure will probably mean that not very many people will ever hear this album, which is not only one of the best things Paul Simon has ever done, but one of the best albums I have ever heard. If Bob Dylan was the poet of the rock era, Paul Simon has always been its finest storyteller. Think of Old Friends. Me and Julio. 50 Ways To Leave Your Lover. They all tell perfectly crafted little three minute short stories. This album has the overall framing story of Salvador Agron, a teenage murderer in the 50s, who spent 20 years in prison, becoming educated, writing poetry, rehabilitating himself and never again committing any violent act. Some of the songs are from Agrons point of view, the rest are from the point of view of various people in his life. As the different points of view layer and overlap, and the various stories come together, this album begins to seem like a great novel that just happens to be set to music. It is beautiful and challenging, sometimes crude and sometimes poetic (and often both at the same time). It makes you think hard about prejudice, justice, redemption and a lot of other issues that dont find a place in popular music very often.  And the music is fabulous. Simon has been working in many musical styles and genres for decades and that preparation really comes to fruition here. The basic styles are 50s streetcorner doo-wop and Latin, but Simon knows both of those styles so well that he finds great variety where another composer would recycle the cliches.  After the failure of The Capeman, its unlikely Paul Simon will be tempted to try another Broadway musical. But I hope he doesnt give up on concept albums like this one. This is the kind of work he was born to write. Nobody else could have done it so brilliantly.
