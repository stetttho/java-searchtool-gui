 Ive had a cassette of this album in my car for more than a decade, and Im sure Ive played it more than any of the dozens of other cassettes in the car. Its one of the few I never get tired of hearing. Since the songs are all in Xhosa, I had no idea what Miriam Makeba was singing about, but there was something so warm and uplifting, so healing, about her voice, and the lilting rhythms of the songs, that meaning didnt seem to matter. Only recently I glanced at the liner notes and realized that most of the songs are essentially prayers. They call on the spirits of ancestors for help or strength, or praise them for the help theyve given. Its transcendent, spiritual music  which I guess at some level I knew all along, even without understanding the words. That the sense of the songs is clear even if you dont understand the language tells you a lot about the power of Miriam Makebas singing. My six-year-old daughter also loves this album, and often asks me to play it. (She says her favorite singers are Raffi, Ella Fitzgerald and Miriam Makeba  an interesting trio.) I suspect Makebas warmth comes through to any listener, no matter what their age. This is some of the most moving music Ive ever heard.
