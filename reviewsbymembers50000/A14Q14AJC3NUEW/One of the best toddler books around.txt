 Rosemary Wells is, without a doubt, the best writer for small children who ever lived, and the Max books are her masterpieces. This one is a perfect example of why she's so good. The story is so simple and so true to life a 1-year-old can easily follow it: Max's bossy big sister Ruby wants him to eat an egg. But Max doesn't want the egg, he wants strawberries. (And what toddler isn't going to identify with a picky eater?) Max keeps hiding the egg until an exasperated Ruby takes a bite herself, to show him how delicious it is, then another bite, and another. The final page shows Max with a triumphant look on his face saying "All gone."  Children love Max. Adults laugh out loud when they read the Max books. He's just a charmer and a scamp and you can't help but love him. There are several nice, pleasant books for toddler's available, but very few really entertaining ones. Max's Breakfast (and all of the Max books, for that matter) is one of the best.
