 This is one of the most charming and funny modern rewrites of a fairy tale Ive ever read. In this version, the poor over-worked kid with the wicked stepsiblings  is a boy, Prince Cinders. Just like Cinderella, he does all the dirty work around the house, while his three big, handsome (well, they think they are anyway) brothers go out dancing and carousing. Also like Cinderella, Cinders has a fairy godmother. Unfortunately, his fairy seems to lack any qualifications  for the job, and in trying to turn him into a big, hairy, hypermasculine hunk like his brothers, she messes up and turns him into ape. I wont go into all the details, but after he loses his pants (no glass slipper here), a clever and beautiful princess chooses him over the big, hairy hunks.  The gender switch is clever, and food for thought. But this book works because its just a terrific story with a central character whos a real charmer, and the illustrations are laugh-out-loud funny. My daughter and I both love this book.
