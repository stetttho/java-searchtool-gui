 The title of this book made me a little wary, and the subtitle made me downright uncomfortable. First problem: Ive found that when people toss around terms like "moral values," theyre often talking about some narrow, even mean-spirited "values" that I dont think are the least bit moral. Second, I have a passion for childrens books, but detest books that preach to children. I dont care whether theyre preaching obey your parents and do your homework or take care of Mother Earth and respect human diversity  I hate preachy books. Fortunately, this is a much richer book than its title led me to expect. The authors dislike didacticism in childrens books as much as I do, and they make a strong case that well-chosen books give children good role models, increase their empathy for others, and dont just hand children simplistic moral precepts, but give them the opportunity to think about and discuss moral choices. And that, of course, is exactly what all of us need to grow into ethical human beings. Most of the book consists of a list of recommended books, divided by age group. The recommendations are, for the most part, excellent, as are the comments on the books. Im pretty knowledgeable about childrens literature, but Ive discovered quite a few unknown gems through this book, and have found the comments on books I know well to be insightful and interesting. Along with Jim Treleases "The Read-Aloud Handbook," I think this is one of the best guides to childrens books that Ive come across.
