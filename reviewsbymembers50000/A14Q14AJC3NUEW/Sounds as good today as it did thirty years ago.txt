 When I was in college in the seventies, I don't think I knew a single woman who didn't own this album. Joni Mitchell put into gorgeous words exactly what it felt like to be a young wooman at that time. A couple of years ago, I dug out my old vinyl copy, remembering little more than a few lyrics like "we don't need a piece of paper from the city hall," and expecting some really dated hippie stuff. Something embarassingly sweet from the old days. I was stunned at how well the songs hold up. There's not a bit of sixties' sappiness in it. The songs are simply timeless and wonderful. This is one of only a handful of vinyl albums that I've replaced with CDs because I want to be able to listen to it over and over again.
