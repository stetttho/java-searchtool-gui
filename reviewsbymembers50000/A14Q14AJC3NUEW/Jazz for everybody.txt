 Except for Billie Holiday, I've never been a big jazz fan. In fact, I got interested in this album after hearing Cassandra Wilson's amazing reading of Holiday's "Strange Fruit" (There's no way to describe it. But hearing her sing it makes you extremely uncomfortable, as a song about a lynching ought to make you feel.) But what made me fall in love with this record is it's diversity. I've never heard a singer cover so many genres so well. She'll start with a old blues song like "Death Letter," and turn it into something totally unique - not really jazz, not really blues, just some wonderful new genre that only Cassandra Wilson could do. And the beauty she finds in a little throwaway pop song like "Last Train to Clarksville" blows me away. I plan to buy a lot more of her CDs. And if you're more into rock and blues, but would like to explore jazz, this is a great album to start with.
