 This is one of the Max board book series that also includes Max's Birthday, Max's Toys, and	Max's Bedtime. They are supposedly intended for children from birth to age 2 or so. There are also several non-board books about  Max  (Max's Chocolate Chicken, and Bunny Money are my favorites) with longer stories designed for slightly older children. Forget the designated ages. I told my teenage son I had written a couple of reviews of children's books for Amazon and he said, "Don't forget to review Max." He STILL loves them, and wants everyone to know how good they are. When he was 10, he loved reading them to his baby sister, and I understood how he felt. When he was a toddler, the Max books were the only children's books I read that REALLY made me laugh. Max and Ruby are brother and sister bunnies. Ruby's a little bossy. Max always gets around her in the end. But their relationship remains a genuinely sweet and loving one. Small children, I think, just love the clean-lined, simple pictures, and the striking expressions on Max and Ruby's faces. But any adult or older child who reads the books will see Max as one of the great trickster characters of all times, and Rosemary Wells as one of the most insightful writers around on sibling rivalry. Do NOT let any child - yours or anyone else's you know - get through being a toddler without meeting Max.
