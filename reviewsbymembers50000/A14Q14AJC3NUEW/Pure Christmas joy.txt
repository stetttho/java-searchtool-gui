 This comes close to being a perfect Christmas album. Admittedly, the orchestra is a little bland, and a few songs have a background chorus that brings to mind chirpy sixties commercials (the album was recorded in 1960). But  who cares? It also has Ella Fitzgerald at her best (but then, to be fair, Ella was almost always at her best). She had the most gorgeous tone of any singer I know of, along with astonishing phrasing, flawless diction, and, best of all, a sense of playfulness that makes it impossible not to smile when you hear her sing.  I think Ella Fitzgerald was incapable of singing any song in an ordinary, expected way. Her scatting on Jingle Bells is joyous. Her version of Count Basies Good Morning Blues is the some of the earthiest Christmas music Ive heard this side of Etta James. On every song, the way she plays with rhythm and melody is delightful. At one point she manages to turn Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer into Hang Down Your Head Tom Dooley  weird, but a kick. Everything thats fun about Christmas is in this album. Of the dozens of Christmas albums I own, this is one of a handful that gets played the entire season.
