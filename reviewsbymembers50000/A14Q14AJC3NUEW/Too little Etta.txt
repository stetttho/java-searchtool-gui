 The selection of songs on this CD is terrific. Etta James can sing anything from ballads to rock better than anyone alive, and these songs show off her range (besides being some of her best stuff). But I'd suggest  going straight for The Essential Etta James. It costs more, but it's got  twice as many songs, and every one is a gem. (Besides, you just can't call  it Etta's "best" without including her brilliant, gospel-tinged  "God's Song.") Once you hear Etta James sing, you'll wish you had  the larger collection.
