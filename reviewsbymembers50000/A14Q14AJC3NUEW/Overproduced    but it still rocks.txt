 This isn't quite the greatest Christmas album ever that rock fans make it out to be. Whoever Bob B. Soxx and The Blue Jeans were (they have two undistinguished cuts on the album), they've gone on to well-deserved obscurity. And Phil Spector's little speech on the last track is an egocentric embarrassment. The whole album is horribly over-produced. Nevertheless, this is an essential purchase for old-time rock fans. Darlene Love and Ronnie Spector have two of the most glorious voices in the history of rock, and every one of their songs on this album is a joy. Love's Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) is almost worth the cost of the CD all by itself. The songs by The Crystals, unfortunately, are a little muddy. Lala Brooks, The Crystals' lead singer, is terrific, but her voice is overwhelmed by Spector's "wall of sound." What it all adds up to is that about half of this album is made up of some of the best rock and roll Christmas music ever. The rest runs from good but flawed to downright embarrassing. It's definitely worth owning  but be prepared to hit the skip track button quite a bit.
