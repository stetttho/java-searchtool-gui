 Rosemary Wells' Max and Ruby books are the best books for small children of all time, and Max's Christmas is the best of the best. The focus of the book is Max asking his older sister Ruby a thousand questions about Santa Claus that she can not answer (until, an exasperated Ruby finally screams BECAUSE! and refuses to answer any more questions). If you've dealt with any 2 to 4 year old at Christmas time, this will seem so real you won't be able to keep a straight face. It's just a pure delight. The illustrations are more detailed, and the colors more interesting than in the Max board books. It's done in a way that the pictures all look bathed in candlelight, which creates a perfect atmosphere for the book. That's one of the things that makes this book even better than the other books in the series. The recommendations for this book say it is for toddlers to pre-school children, but my kids continued to love it and want to hear it every year until they were about eight. My son loved it so much that I have him on tape reciting it by heart at age three.  If you have little ones to read to at Christmas, this is a must-have!
