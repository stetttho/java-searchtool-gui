 This album is a guilty pleasure. Im embarrassed to admit how much I like it. I know that, musically, its not very good, but somehow it works. The lead singer is mediocre at best. His voice is strong and blandly pleasant, and he can carry a tune, but its an utterly soulless voice, without any distinguishing traits. His limitations really show up on the albums one cover song. "Come Back To Me" was a pretty cheesy song to begin with, but this version is pure Velveeta  imitation cheese. The musicians are competent, but Ive heard several high school jazz bands that could leave them in the dust. The definitely wont make you forget Count Basie, or even Louis Jordan. The lyrics of their songs are crude and punky. So why do I keep listening to this album? Maybe because as much as I love Basie and Ellington, I also love The Kinks, The Stones, and The Ramones, and The Cherry Poppin Daddies are sort of mixed-up descendents of all of them. Combining those two musical roots shouldnt work. Punk and crude rock are supposed to be angry and deliberately shocking. Swing is supposed to be innocent and joyous. How can you squeeze anger and joy into the same song? But of course, the main reason The Ramones are so great to listen to is that they always seemed to be having so much fun. Joy just poured out of those one-chord wonders.  And swing was probably never all that innocent. My mother, who was a teenager in the forties, once told me that swing dancing was considered lewd at the time, and zoot suiters were dangerous  the gangbangers of their era. So maybe there isnt really much of a contradiction between the albums in-your-face lyrics and danceable rhythm. There's something weirdly infectious about The Cherry Poppin' Daddies swing rhythms and punk souls. Im surprised this album was as popular as it was, because its not for everybody. But if your musical taste ranges across a lot of genres, and youre not easily offended, youll probably like it.
