 Nat King Cole is terrific, but sometime around the middle of December, after Ive heard his version of The Christmas Song for the 5 billionth time, I start to feel like I never want to hear another traditional carol crooned again, and thats usually when I get out this album, and go straight to Carmen McRaes sultry, bluesy version of the same song  and suddenly that old chestnut (roasting on an open fire) sounds great again. Not every song on this album is that great, by any means. The standouts, for me, besides McRaes track, are Duke Ellingtons amazingly inventive Jingle Bells, Ella Fitzgeralds earthy Good Morning Blues, and the Modern Jazz Quartets lovely Englands Carol #1. Charlie Parkers White Christmas is also breathtaking, probably the best thing on the album, although unfortunately the sound quality is poor. Besides those, there are a half-dozen more excellent tracks that break through the usually dull holiday music. The rest are so-so  listenable, but nothing to get excited about. But I like the album a lot better than that last sentence might lead you to expect, because it has such a fine mix of styles. Theres swing, modern jazz, blues, and even a little r&b. This is one of the few Christmas albums I own (and, honestly, Im a Christmas music addict) that I can listen to straight through without feeling like Im hearing the same song over and over again. Its not perfect, but this is one classy and enjoyable Christmas CD.
