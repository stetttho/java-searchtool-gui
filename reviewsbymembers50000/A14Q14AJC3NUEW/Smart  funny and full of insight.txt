 Any reviewer who says Molly Ivins has an ax to grind against George Bush either hasn't read this book, or doesn't know how to read very well. During the election fiasco, I heard a reporter ask her what mistakes people make most often in evaluating Bush and she said, "He's not stupid and he's not mean," and she admitted that although she disagreed with his politics, she found him, personally, a pretty nice guy. She's about as far from a political hatchet wielder as a writer can get. The truth is, Molly Ivins has been covering Texas politics all her professional life and probably understands it better than any human being. She approaches the topic with a little bit of pride in the state's quirky individuality, a little embarassment  at its occasional insanity and meanness, and with her low-key, off the wall sense of humor always in tact. She knows the world that made George Bush better than anyone around, and her insights into his character and philosophy are always interesting. And how can you not love a political writer who makes you laugh? This book was written during the election, and so there's nothing in it about either the election itself, or Bush's tenure so far as president. I hope Ivins will be covering those topics in a future book, and will bring as much humor and insight there as she does here
