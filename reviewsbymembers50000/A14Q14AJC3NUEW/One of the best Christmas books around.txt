 For some odd reason, children's books based on the Bible often bring out the worst in illustrators. I've seen more bad drawing, syrupy expressions and cloying colors in illustrated Bible stories than in any other kind of children's book. That's why this book is literally a God send. The lovely King James text might normally be a little over the heads of the 4 to 8 year olds this book is aimed at, but Julie Vivas' illustrations bring it to life and make it something any child will want to hear again and again and again. I've read it for years to both of my children, as well as in classrooms, and it is always a huge hit. From angels with rainbow colored wings and army boots (a few of them riding the shepherds' sheep) to the crowds in Bethlehem literally dripping from the trees, this book is a delight. It's hilarious, but also very moving. One of my favorite pictures in the book is of the enormously pregnant Mary gazing at her belly in delight. And my six-year-old daughter adores the wide-eyed baby Jesus. If you only buy one Christmas picture book, this is the one to get.
