 This is the type of album you're hesitant to recommend to someone else, because its beauty is so harrowing that you think your love for it must be unusual. And yet, I noticed that no one so far has given it less than a five-star review. Yes, in some ways it's a painful record to listen to, but the greatest art IS difficult. In the end, the pain in Billie Holiday's voice is not so much harrowing as human. Everyone has felt what she expresses here, and that makes this record universal.
