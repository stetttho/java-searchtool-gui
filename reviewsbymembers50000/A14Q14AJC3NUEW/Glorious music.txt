 Ive only recently gotten interested in jazz, and I dont know much about it, but Ive been listening to this album since January, and Im absolutely passionate about it. Its one of my favorite albums of all time. It started when I heard a little bit of Diminuendo in Blue and Crescendo in Blue on Ken Burns Jazz program. Intrigued, I downloaded the whole song, and when I heard it, I just sat, mesmerized, in front of the computer. Even with my computers crummy sound, it was one of the most soaring, amazing piece of music Id ever heard. I ran out to buy the album the next day, figuring that, first, I needed to hear it on a decent sound system, and second, any album that had music this glorious on it probably had a lot more to offer. It did. Id heard studio versions of a lot of the songs, and liked them, but the live versions here are much better. "Black and Tan Fantasy" is especially  good. I listen to it over and over. If, like me, youre interested in jazz, but dont know a lot about it, start with this album. I cant imagine anyone who likes music  ANY kind of music  not being able to appreciate this one. It just hits you right in the heart.
