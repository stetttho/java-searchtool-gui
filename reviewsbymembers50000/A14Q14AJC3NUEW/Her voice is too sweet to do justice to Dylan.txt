 In the sixties, Baez and Dylan seemed like the perfect match: angelic voice and brilliant lyrics. What more could you ask for? In retrospect, the best interpreter of Dylan turned out to be Dylan himself. His eccentric voice perfectly suited (and continues to suit) his quirky lyrics. There have been a few great covers. Nina Simone's "I Shall Be Released," and certainly Hendrix's "All Along the Watchtower." Baez has contributed a few very good versions, especially of Dylan's folkier, more traditional songs. I love the way she does "Farewell, Angelina," "Daddy, You've Been On My Mind," and "Don't Think Twice." But the truth is, her voice is so lovely, it prettifies angry songs like "It Ain't Me Babe" and "Love Is Just A Four-Letter-Word." Worse, in the seventies, she got on a country kick where she was totally out of her element, and the music overwhelms both Dylan's lyrics and her ethereal voice. What a waste of talent. If you want to hear Dylan, buy Dylan. If you want to hear Joan Baez, buy some of her early albums, particularly the first one, "Joan Baez," where she covers the traditional ballads she was born to sing and there's nothing but her accoustic guitar to come between you and her breathtaking voice.
