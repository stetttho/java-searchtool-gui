 This is definitely not the best album Paul Simon has ever made, but it is well worth listening to. Simons songs are unique. If you listen back to his earliest songs, his Simon and Garfunkel material, he tended to be a little sappy, a little too sentimental. But as a solo artist hes consistently found a perfect blend of sentiment and cynicism, seriousness and humor, lyricism and a conversational tone. His best songs are works of pure genius. Even his second rate stuff is better than many artists best. On this album, "Old" and "Pigs, Sheep and Wolves" are both hilarious and wise, full of Simons trademark wit. The title song is full of great pop hooks, and seems like glorious fun the first time you listen to it, but when you come back to it, you realize its a much deeper song than you realized at first. And "Darling Lorraine" is one of the best things Simon has ever done (and that is a pretty high standard!). The story of a rocky relationship over the decades, its as deep as a fine novel. A precious, old-age love song, its so sweet that a few times it almost becomes too sentimental, but Simon cuts through any sappiness with great cutting lines ("What? You dont like the way I chew?"). The rest of the songs are pretty average Paul Simon songs, which means theyre not bad, although you feel a little like youve heard them all before. Still, its nice to see Simon still producing interesting work at a time when most of his contemporaries are just recycling their old stuff. Heading into his sixties, hes still got something to say to say to the generation that grew up on his music.
