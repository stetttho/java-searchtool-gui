 Both of my children adored this book and Im kind of fond of it myself. Its just a cute little story about a friendship between a mouse who lives in an old, run-down hotel and a boy who stays at the hotel over a long weekend. The mouse learns to ride the boys toy motorcycle, which thrills them both (and also thrilled my kids), but gets the mouse into a number of scrapes, including losing the motorcycle. Eventually the mouse learns to be more responsible and to care more about others, and earns back his precious motorcycle. I like the books message  that the more responsible you are, the more privileges you get. Thats something Im always trying to teach my kids, and I appreciate the help this book offers in getting the message across. But even more, I love Beverly Clearys light touch, her sense of humor, and her obvious respect for children. She teaches important lessons in a nice way. Its no surprise that she one of most childrens favorite writers.
