 This album rivals B.B. King Live At The Regal for best live blues album ever. Etta James sings so tough, so ballsy, I cannot think of another singer to compare her to. She almost makes even Wilson Pickett and James Brown sound like wimps.  On a couple of songs, she does some scatting you have to hear to believe. Takes my breath away everytime. Besides the incredible singing, the other thing that makes this album a joy is the audience. Their excitement is palpable. On a couple of songs, Etta gets a thrilling call and response going with them, and their energy seems to feed her. The album is the next best thing to Etta James in person.
