 Listening to this album, I find it almost impossible to believe that it was recorded in 1966, when Laura Nyro was only eighteen years old. Where in the world did a young woman barely out of high school acquire the wisdom reflected in the lyrics of many of these songs? Who taught her to sing from the bottom of her heart this way, at a time when no woman in pop music sang with that kind of soul? And how did she have the time, in eighteen years of life, to gain the depth and breadth of musical knowledge she demonstrates? Pop, blues, folk, jazz, r&b, gospel - Nyro doesn't just play with all of those genres, she knows each one of them as deeply as if she'd been performing in them for decades. It's just breathtaking. This is Nyro's most accessible album, I think. She's not stretching herself musically as much as she would on her next album, Eli and the Thirteenth Confession, and that means that people who like pop music might prefer it to the more adventurous Eli, and certainly to her later work. But the truth is this album, Eli, and the later New York Tendaberry are all essential albums.  Most artists' early albums you buy just out of curiosity - to hear the beginnings they would develop in later work. Who would buy The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan if he hadn't later recorded Blonde on Blonde? Would anyone be interested in Meet the Beatles if they hadn't moved on to Rubber Soul and Sgt. Pepper? In First Songs you hear a lot of the strengths that would make Laura Nyro an even greater singer and composer in years to come. But even if Nyro had never recorded another note, this would be a great album. The variey of music here is astounding and there's not one song on it that is less than gorgeous.
