 Let's be honest. Over the years, Dusty Springfield has recorded some really bad songs. Nevertheless she rarely made a bad record. Her voice was so beautiful and expressive that, like Billie Holiday before her, she repeatedly spun dross into gold. Listen to what she does, on this CD, with lightweight, bouncy pop songs like "I Only Want To Be With You," "All Cried Out," and "Little by Little." The songs are forgettable trifles, but once you listen to Dusty Springfield sing them, you won't be able to get them out of your head. And while you're listening, they just sound like classic 60s soul.  This album is an excellent introduction to the wide range of her work. What other singer could go from big Italianate ballads like "You Don't Have To Say You Love Me" and "The Look of Love," to the deep soul of "Son of a Preacher Man,"  "In The Middle of Nowhere," "I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself," and "Some of Your Lovin"? Only a few of those songs were really hits, but all of them should have been. The last song on the album is a real find. "Goin' Back" is wonderful, wise, Goffin-King ballad - it could easily have fit on on Carole King's Tapestry - about growing older and looking back on your life. Never having heard it before, I assumed it was one of Springfield's final songs. I was surprised to discover she recorded it in 1966. The depth she sang with while only in her mid-twenties is astonishing.
