 Every child deserves to be read to from the moment his or her eyes can focus on a page. The problem is that most of the books that appeal to children under two, with simple, uncluttered pictures and only a few words per page ( and usually no story to speak of) are not exactly fun to read if you're any older than two. You read them because you feel obligated to, not because you want to. Rosemary Wells' Max books are different. They have great appeal to small children (I had to buy two sets of the books for my two children, because my son wore his out by hugging them so much. They were in shreds by the time his sister came along.) But adults can read them over and over again and never get tired of them.  The stories and the illustrations are hilarious, and priceless.  In this one, Max can't sleep without his red rubber elephant, so his older sister Ruby tries to give him substitutes, including a snake. The wide-eyed look on Max's face when he has a stuffed snake wrapped around him is, all by itself, worth the price of the book. In the end, Max finds his elephant, and tucks in Ruby, who has fallen asleep. The role reversal - the younger brother taking care of his older sister - is really sweet.  But mostly the book is just clever and funny and wonderful. If you have a new baby, you are going to have to read a lot of truly boring books in the next couple of years. Do yourself a favor and buy at least a few of the Max books. You might even make it through the terrible twos with your sanity intact.
