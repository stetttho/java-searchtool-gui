 The first time someone tried to play this album for me, I was really reluctant to listen. It was the early seventies, a few years after the album came out, and the Van Morrison song that was getting the most radio play at the time was TB Sheets. Brilliant song, but harrowing  certainly not something you want to listen to every day. So when my friend said he was going to put on a Van Morrison album, I said, "This is going to be painful, isnt it?" Before the first song (Domino) was over, I knew I was wrong. This has got to be the most joyous album ever made. That great old Biblical phrase "a joyful noise" is the only way to describe it. Its not a sappy, moon-June kind of happiness. I keep thinking of a line from Blue Money. He sings, "Youre so glad to be alive, honey." Thats the spirit that courses through this album. It sounds like a man who has been deep down in the blues (the man who sang about TB sheets, I guess) and came up laughing and smiling and singing his heart out.  If youve listened to any later Morrison albums, you know that joy didnt remain in much of his music. But at least weve got this album. Even the most pensive song on the CD  Ill Be Your Lover Too  is warm and contented, full of quiet joy. Most of the songs on here really do make you glad to be alive. Ive heard His Band and The Street Choir described as a "minor" Moondance  the same rich and soulful horns, the same jazz feel, but without the lyrical depth. Maybe. Its true theres not a song here with the poetry of  Into the Mystic or And It Stoned Me (both from Moondance), but pure, unadulterated happiness is nothing to turn up your nose at. Owning this album really is like owning a little chunk of joy.
