 Motown used to have "Shotgun" and "Roadrunner" - two of Jr. Walker's best albums - available on a single disc. I wish they'd reissue that one. Still, this is one of the best albums of the sixties available at an astonishing price. Grab it! There's not a bad cut on it. Every song is rich and soulful and funky. Great party music, and great for just sitting down and listening to (okay, sitting down while you're listening to this album might be tough, what I mean is, you don't need a party to enjoy it.). Just a perfect record.
