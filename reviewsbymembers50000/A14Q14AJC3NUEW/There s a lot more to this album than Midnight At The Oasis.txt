 If I could get my money back for every lousy album I bought in the seventies, I'd be rich. But somehow I missed this one. My mistake. The only song I'd ever heard Maria Muldaur sing was Midnight At The Oasis, which is, let's face it, a silly song, but a catchy one - and Muldaur's voice on it is unique and wonderful. But the song was so quirky that I wrote Muldaur off as one more lucky one hit wonder.  Wrong! This is an absolutely wonderful album from beginning to end. Her versions of Dolly Parton's "My Tennessee Mountain Home" and Kate McGarrigle's "Work Song" come across in an honest, downhome voice that reminds me of Iris Dement. On both "Don't You Make Me High (Don't You Feel My Leg)" and "Three Dollar Bill," Muldaur is sly, sexy and bluesy, and Dr. John's New Orleans style piano and the horn arrangements play off her voice pefectly. Great songs, great voice, great arrangements - what more could you ask for?  Those are my favorite songs on the album, but the rest are almost as good. If you have fond memories of "Midnight At The Oasis," buy this album immediately. This is one of those rare, rare albums where the rest of the songs are even better than the big hit.
