 This book is basically a twist on the story of King Midas and the Golden Touch. In this case, though, it isn*t gold that the main character, John Midas, loves, but chocolate. When John receives a "gift" of the ability to turn everything he touches to chocolate, it turns out to be more of a curse than a gift. Having his breakfast bacon and eggs turn into chocolate seems wonderful, but when he gets thirsty and can*t get a simple (non-chocolate flavored) drink of water, he begins to understand the need for variety.  I don*t know many children who have an overpowering love of gold, but just about every child can identify with a boy whose desire for chocolate knows no bounds, and so this story is just a natural grabber for elementary school-age children. You might expect a book with a message (eat a variety of healthy foods) to be moralistic, even a little dull, but this book is nothing like that. The plot is absorbing, much of it is laugh-out-loud funny, and the characters are all well-drawn and interesting.  The Chocolate Touch is a real charmer.
