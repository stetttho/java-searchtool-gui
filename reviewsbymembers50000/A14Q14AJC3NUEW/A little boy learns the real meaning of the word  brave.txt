 This was the first in a series of books about Obadiah Starbuck, a charming little six-year-old Quaker boy in colonial-era Nantucket. In this story, Obadiah dreams of being a "fearless" pirate who has exciting adventures on the high seas. His dream ends when his older siblings play such a rough and frightening game of pirate with him that he realizes he is not as fearless as he would like to be. His father saves the day by telling him about his grandfather, the captain of a sailing ship, who was braver than any pirate, because he sailed the seas and had adventures without ever hurting anyone, the way pirates do. And so Obadiah begins to refashion his old dream in a more positive, peaceful direction. This is a wonderful book about what it really means to be a brave man. What I especially like about it is the character of Obadiahs father. When Obadiah first announces that he wants to be a pirate, his father, a gentle Quaker man who surely must have been shocked, says only that he hopes Obadiah will be a good one. Later, when he speaks of Obadiahs grandfather, you hear in his voice both family pride and love for his son. I think this is the best portrait of a patient and caring father Ive seen in childrens literature. The book doesnt just lecture about what it means to be a good man, the father embodies it. That alone makes this book priceless. If youre as charmed by Obadiah as I am, there are three more books about him  Thy Friend Obadiah, Rachel and Obadiah, and The Adventures of Obadiah. All of them are superb.
