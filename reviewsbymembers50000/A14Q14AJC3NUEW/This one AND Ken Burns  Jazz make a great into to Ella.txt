 It's difficult to choose between this collection of Ella Fitzgerald's work and the collection Ken Burns issued along with Jazz.  While there's some overlap between the two, the Burns' CD covers a wider sweep of her career - from her mid-thirties version of A-Tisket A-Tasket (the version here was recorded live in 1961) to the late sixties. Everything on here was recorded sometime between the late fifties and early sixties - prime Ella Fitzgerald, but it's a shame to miss out on the early stuff. Still, if I really HAD to limit myself to only one Ella Fitzgerald CD, it would have to be this one. Burns doesn't include her duets with Louis Armstrong on "They Can't Take That Away From Me,"  and "Summertime," and there isn't any music ever made that is more breathtaking than Fitzgerald and Armstrong together. Their honey and sandpaper voices play off each other in a way that defies description. And I'd nominate their version of "Summertime" as the best single recording ever made. I can't hear it too many times. If you don't own a copy of it, there's a big hole in your record collection - no, make that a big hole in your LIFE -that you must repair immediately. Also, while the Burns' CD shows off Ella's gorgeous voice and glorious scatting (Ella's scatting is a cure for anything that ails you), I think he shortchanges her ballad work. "Misty" and "My Funny Valentine" ought to be on any intro to Ella Fitzgerald. The thing to remember about any introduction to Ella Fitzgerald, though, is that it's just an appetizer - something to hold you until you save up enough money for the complete works. Until you do, this is a really fine collection.
