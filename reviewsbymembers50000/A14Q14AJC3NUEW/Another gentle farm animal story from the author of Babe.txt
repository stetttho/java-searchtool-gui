 Dick King Smith, the author of Martins Mice, is best known for Babe the Gallant Pig, which of course was turned into a movie that is a lot better known than any of his books. The movie is one of the best childrens films ever, and the book is even better. But it does have one disadvantage. The British dialect in Babe, while charming, is so thick it is difficult for many American parents and teachers to read aloud, and for American children to follow. Dont get me wrong. I love Babe and have read it aloud several times. But it is not easy. What I like about Martins Mice is that it has many of the same qualities that made Babe such a joy, including the gentleness, the emphasis on kindness, and the quirky, understated humor, but without the heavy dialect. There are Britishisms sprinkled throughout the book, but they are manageable with an American tongue. In terms of plot and character, Martins Mice is not quite up to the standards of Babe. But then how many books are? Like Babe, Martin is a farm animal who marches to a different drummer. Hes a cat who loves mice. But he loves them as pets, not as meals. The novel focuses on how he learns to love them more as friends and equals than as pets. Martin is a sweet, gentle character, but there is no denying he does not have the charm of Babe. And the novels plot seems a little disjointed. The ending felt like it sprang on us out of nowhere. Still, my six-year-old daughter and I both enjoyed the book. If you are looking for a childrens book full of nice, gentle humor and kind characters, this is a good choice.
