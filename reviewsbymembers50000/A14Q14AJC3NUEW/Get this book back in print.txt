 This is just a simple little fable about a mouse who discovers music. Geraldine nibbles at a big piece of cheese until the remaining shape looks like a flute-playing mouse. Magically, the cheese mouse begins to play a tune, and Geraldine is so enchanted that later, when she and her friends are hungry, she can't bring herself to eat the cheese for fear of losing its music. Both my children love music and they both loved this story. I think that even at a young age they understood how difficult it would be to have to make a choice between what you need and what you love. And as for me, well, every time I read it to them, I got more out of it. It's a rich, wise, deep story, but one simple enough for many four or five year olds. What a shame it's out of print. Thank God for libraries.
