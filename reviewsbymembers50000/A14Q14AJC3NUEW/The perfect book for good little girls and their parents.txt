 My six-year-old daughter fell madly in love with this book the first time she heard it, so much so that she wanted me to read it to her several times a day. At first I was a lot less enchanted with it than she was. Its about a nice little girl who gets tired of being pushed around and lets the monster inside her come out. Literally. The monster is a green creature with bulging red eyes and black fingernails. The pictures of her are truly ugly. The monster gets more and more demanding and out of control until finally the nice little girl cant take it any more and comes back out. Its got a good ending, but for me the monster-girl was a little disturbing. I guess I just usually  like gentler childrens books. But the more Ive read this book (and Ive read it a LOT!), the more Ive realized how psychologically  acute it is. My daughter is a lot like the "good little girl"  most of the time shes neat and polite, and tries very hard to please adults. Those are wonderful qualities, but they can get in our way, too. Less polite kids shove you aside. Adults may overlook your needs because youre not loud or insistent enough. Life can be tough for "good" girls. The need to learn to be assertive without letting "the monster" get out of control. And I think the reason my daughter loves this book is that its helping her to do that. In the end, when the good little girl comes back, shes not a pushover anymore. Shes still nice, but she tells her parents very clearly and firmly what she wants. Im still not wild about the illustrations in this book (although I must admit theyre growing on me), but I now think that for a nice, quiet little girl, this is a perfect book.
