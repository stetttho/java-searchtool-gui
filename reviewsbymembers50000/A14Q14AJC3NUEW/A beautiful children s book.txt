 This is one of the best books my five year old daughter and I have ever read. We first got it out of the library, but I just ordered it because it's a book I know we'll re-read hundreds of times. Everybody knows the  Grimm's story: twelve princesses escape every night to go dancing. Their  father, the king, doesn't know where they go, only that that in the morning  their dancing shoes are in tatters. He offers the hand of one of his  daughers in marriage to any suitor who can discover their secrets.Many try,  and finally one succeeds. There are two wonderful things about this  version. One is that it's clear at the end of the book that the daughter  who is chosen doesn't marry the man who figured out their secret. She  chooses him  and plans to keep right on dancing after she gets married!  The second great thing about this book is the illustrations, which are so  beautiful, you just want to look at them again and again. More important,  the princesses are all beautiful, but in exotic and interesting ways. No  one size fits all Disneyesque beauties here. Each face is unique. One even  wears glasses! Terrific book.
