 This is a charming little folktale about two sisters  one mean and greedy, the other generous and kind  and their encounter with a strange, magical old woman. In the end, the good sister is rewarded and the bad one punished. A nice story with a good message. But this isnt just a nice book, it is an extraordinary one. One thing that makes it special is the way the author uses language. Robert San Souci draws on an African American storytelling tradition and a southern rural dialect that just makes the language sing! The book is full of wonderful, poetic lines and great rhythmic language. Its a joy to read aloud. The words feel good in your mouth. And any parent or teacher who reads aloud a lot knows what a rare quality that is. Even when Im tired, I feel like I cant read this book badly. The words just flow. And the illustrations are gorgeous. Jerry Pinkney is one of the best illustrators around and this is one of my favorites of all his work. The composition, the subtle colors, the intricate detail  you rarely come across art this fine in childrens books. I bought this book for my daughter a couple of years ago, and were still reading it over and over again. Its so good, I hope in a generation shell still be reading it to my grandchildren.
