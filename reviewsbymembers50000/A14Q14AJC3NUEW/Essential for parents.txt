 Along with Jim Trelease's Read-Aloud Handbook, this is a book no parent should be without. It contains short, to the point versions of every story you half-remember hearing when you were a kid (sure, the ugly duckling turns out to be a swan at the end, but do you remember what happens in between?), nursery rhymes and the lyrics to children's songs, and Aesop's fables  all essential for parents to share with children. When it comes time to tell a bedtime story, I'd be lost without this book.
