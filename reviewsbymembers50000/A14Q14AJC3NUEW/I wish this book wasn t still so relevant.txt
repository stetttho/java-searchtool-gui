 Elizabeth Drew wrote this book about campaign finance reform in 1999, but unfortunately its still relevant. For years, Drew has been one of the most level headed and non-partisan political writers around. Theres not a bit of "spin" in her work. So when someone as calm and reasonable as this writer says that the politicians we have to day are less intelligent, less thoughtful and less ethical than the politicians of a generation ago, I take her very seriously. We all love to complain about politicians, but Drew obviously has a lot of respect for government and the people who once served in it. She doesnt engage in idle rhetoric. Drew argues that we have lousy people representing us because the need to constantly raise money has driven out of politics all but a handful of the best people, leaving us nothing but the dregs. Both houses of Congress are now stuffed with men (and a handful of women) who know more about money grubbing than they do about history, economics or public policy. And money influences not only the quality of the legislators, but the kind of issues that come before congress. Like John McCain, she insists that we cant use government to help solve any of our problems until we get control of the power money has over politicians. Right now "our" government simply doesnt belong to us. I wish there were more solutions offered here. Drew ends by reminding the reader of the importance of voting and writing to representatives. That doesnt seem to me nearly strong enough. There must be more we can do. But as a chronicle of the influence of money in contemporary politics, this book cant be beat.
