 Brinton Turkles Obadiah Starbuck books (including Obadiah the Bold, Rachel and Obadiah, and Thy Friend Obadiah) all deal with a little Quaker boy in colonial-era Nantucket. The others are all more serious in tone. This one is just a funny little charmer.  Like the boy who cried wolf, Obadiah cant stop himself from spinning elaborate and absurd tales of his adventures, until no one in town believes a word he says. Lectures and punishment do nothing to quell his imagination. Then one day his family goes to a fair and he has a real adventure that makes his invented ones pale by comparison. But of course no one believes him. Unlike the story of the boy who cried wolf, however, which usually ends with the boy being eaten by a wolf, in punishment, I suppose, for his lies (Ive never liked that story), in this version, Obadiah is eventually able to prove that what he said was true, and he goes home a hero.  This isnt my favorite Obadiah book. If youve never read any of them, start with Thy Friend Obadiah, which is a pure masterpiece. But after that, by all means check this one out. Theres nothing deep about it, but its a lot of fun to read, and Obadiah Starbuck is, as always, one of the most charming little boys in childrens literature.
