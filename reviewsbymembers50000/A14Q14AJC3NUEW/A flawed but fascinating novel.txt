 Bee Season is far from a flawless novel, and certainly not for every reader. I came very close to abandoning it several times in the middle, and if I had reviewed it without reading the final third, I would have given it no more than two stars. But in the end it comes together so beautifully that it*s impossible not to forgive the author for some clumsiness along the way. The novel is about family dysfunction and the search for spiritual transcendence, and if that makes it sound like an Oprah Winfrey book, nothing could be further off the mark. What*s fascinating is the way Goldberg weaves the two themes together. Each of the four members of the Naumann family is on a spiritual quest. The father, Saul, tries to reach God by reading ancient Kabbalistic texts. At first, his teenage son, Aaron, shares his father*s spiritual path, but when the father begins paying more attention to his sister than to him, he veers off into studying Eastern religions, finally joining  a cult. The mother, Miriam, who lost her parents in a car accident as a child, finds a strange spiritual fulfillment in stealing valueless objects that she feels she has lost  (just as she lost her family), and arranging them in what seem to her perfect and beautiful patterns. Finally, the daughter, Eliza, discovers a gift for spelling that takes her to the national spelling bee. But spelling becomes, for her, a form of meditation that leads, finally, to an encounter with God. The family dysfunction comes about because, while each Naumann searches for God, none of them recognize that they are all longing for the same thing. Ironically, and tragically, their search for God pulls them farther and farther from one another. And in almost every case, that spiritual search leads them close to madness, or completely over the edge. Only Eliza, in the end, finds a balance. In a breathtaking conclusion, she finds God, and rejects her family*s obsession with spiritual perfection. The flaws in this novel mostly have to do with how Goldberg describes the religious obsessions of Aaron and Saul. When Aaron talks to members of the Krishna cult he joins, the dialog is as dull as you would expect a conversation between a nerdy teenager and someone in an orange robe to be. Saul*s attempts to explain the Kabbalah to Eliza suffer from the same soporific writing (and the 10-year-old Eliza*s instant understanding of it is utterly unbelievable). Unfortunately, those bits of conversation take up quite a bit of the middle third of the novel ï¿½ the place where I almost stopped reading. But in the end, it works. This isn*t an easy, feel-good book, but I think anyone interested in spiritual themes (and willing to hang in there through the awkward parts) would find it fascinating. I*m much more aware of the mystic tradition in Catholicism than in either Judaism or Eastern religions, but the tension between the desire to transcend the world and the need to be part of it is a universal spiritual dilemma that has challenged people of all faiths, I think. And Myla Goldberg has dealt with that dilemma in a very soul-satisfying way.
