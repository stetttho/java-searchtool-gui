 Barbara Robinsons The Best Christmas Pageant Ever is one of my top ten favorite childrens novels of all time. Its one of the funniest and at the same time most moving books ever written.  Unfortunately, the magic that was in the first book just doesnt carry over to this sequel. The same characters are here. The Herdmans are still the kind of uncivilized kids that make parents and teachers (and even less rowdy kids) squirm. Beth, the narrator, is still the kind of sweet, observant girl who fits in with others but is open enough to find the good in those who dont fit in. But it just doesnt come together here. The Herdmans antics arent as funny as they were in the first book (a few, in fact, are simply recycled from the first book). And if youve read The Best Christmas Pageant Ever, where Beth comes to see the good in the seemingly irredeemable Imogene Herdman, it seems odd that in the new book shes back to viewing Imogene as a monster. What happened to the insight she gained at the end of the last book? The book has a few funny moments. Its not dreadful. But after The Best Christmas Pageant Ever, it is certainly a disappointment.
