 Memoirs of a Geisha is a page-turner, and it has a lot of interesting information about Japan and geishas, but I could have gotten the same information and the same level of insight from a half decent magazine  article on the subject. I expect more from a novel. An understanding of the   human heart (no sign of it here, just a lot of  cliches). Writing that  goes beyond the pedestrian  (I know the author spent many years writing  this  book, but the prose is barely competent). If I  had read this book  without reading any of the  reviews beforehand, I probably would have said  it  was pretty good. An interesting, though  unchallenging, novel.  Entertaining, as long as  you're willing to put up with it's  superficiality.  But the reviews made me expect this to be   one of the  best books I would read this year. Not even close. I guess I learned a  lesson: when you hear too many superlatives, be wary. It's probably hype.
