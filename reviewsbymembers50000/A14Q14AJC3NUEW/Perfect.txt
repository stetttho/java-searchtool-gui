 If I had to choose only one Van Morrison album (perish the thought), it would have to be Moondance. I dont know if its Morrisons best (there are just too many riches to choose from), but I know it is an absolutely flawless album, made up of ten perfectly crafted songs, not one of them less than stellar. Its also the only one of his albums I know of  the only album by anyone, for that matter  that is rewarding to listen to no matter what kind of music youre in the mood for. Unlike Astral Weeks, or Veedon Fleece, which you wont appreciate unless youre willing to sit down and listen carefully, Moondance can work as high-energy background music while youre doing something else. The horns, the rhythm, that soothing, but never bland voice  it has a soulful, jazzy groove that wont quit and is fun to listen to over and over. But it has another side. When youre ready, sit down and pay attention and youll find lyrics as deep and poetic as anything on Astral Weeks, and fine, subtle, soulful singing that youll miss when youre just focusing on the big, brassy sound. Its not just that Van Morrison has a gorgeous, soul-shaking voice, and brilliant phrasing, although he certainly does. He sings with so much genuine passion that he makes you see the world in a whole new way. And It Stoned Me, for instance, is about nothing more than water  fishing, swimming, rain and drinking  but the way he sings "oh, the water" makes the experience shine like great poetry.  I dont know any other album that has it all the way Moondance does. No matter how many times you listen to it, you can never exhaust its possibilities. I have hundreds of CDs, but, hands down, this is the one I play the most.
