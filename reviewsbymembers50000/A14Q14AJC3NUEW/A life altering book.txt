 John Lewis is one of my few living heroes, and I have a great urge to press this book into the hands of anyone who needs someone to look up to. I read it more than a year ago, and I haven*t shaken off its influence yet. I doubt I ever will.  Basically,  Lewis*s autobiography tells the story of a man*s struggle to live his life being true to the tenets of his faith. For him, the core message of Christianity is that we can*t fight evil with evil, but can only overcome it with the power of love. Expressed in words, that may sound simplistic, even sappy. But once John Lewis shows you that philosophy in action, you*ll never be able to think of Christian pacifists as starry-eyed or weak again. Lewis shows readers young civil rights volunteers being kicked, beaten, spit upon and cursed, and forcing themselves not to get angry, forcing themselves to see their oppressors as decent, if misguided, human beings, until, miraculously, some of them began to see themselves in the same way, and to behave like decent human beings. Reading this part of the book, I kept thinking that Lewis has written the greatest, most inspiring war story ever told. The courage of these young people, going into battle with no weapons but faith and love, surpasses that of any soldier who ever lived. The book falters a little at the end, I think. The battles Lewis fights today as a Congressman may be just as important as those he fought in the sixties, but they lack the inherent drama of the early civil rights movement. Nevertheless, it*s inspiring to realize there is at least one man in Congress today with undeniable courage and moral authority. If only there were more like him.
