 Most of the songs on this album are the same old Christmas carols youve heard a million times, but I promise you have never heard them sound quite like this. Etta James has always been a tough, earthy belter with as much soul as Aretha Franklin or Otis Redding. And a brave singer too, willing to let her voice range off into all kinds of moans and groans and astonishing scatting. But as shes gotten older (shes in her sixties now  although youd never guess it from the strength of her voice), shes developed a depth and subtlety, a jazz singers phrasing, that makes her unbeatable. Cross Billie Holiday with Janis Joplin and you end up somewhere in the neighborhood of the mature Etta James. She brings all those gifts to this Christmas album. She sings every song as if it is coming from the depths of her soul. Her Silent Night brings tears to my eyes. Jingle Bells is one of the happiest and most playful versions Ive ever heard. And she sings Santa Claus Is Coming To Town in such a sly, sexy way, youll never be able to hear the song the same way again ( What DID Santa Claus bring you, girl?). And as if Etta James at her best were not enough, she brings along a perfect band, including Cedar Walton, who also accompanied her on Mystery Lady, her Billie Holiday tribute album. Christmas music doesnt get much better than this
