 This arent the Christmas songs youll hear in the malls or at the parades. No Santa Claus. No reindeer. No snow. But for me it would not be Christmas without this glorious album. (Although, to be honest, the music is so beautiful, Ive put it on many times in mid-summer, and it doesnt seem out of place. This is the only Christmas album I own that I could say that about). This is the essence of Christmas  simple, unadorned songs about a poor baby king and his struggling mother, songs of hope, joy, and redemption. This is my antidote to exhausting Christmas shopping. Food for the heart and soul. And no one can sing these exquisite songs better than Odetta. Her voice is a great mixture of warm humanity and righteousness that makes these songs belong to her. She renews the meaning of Christmas. Even in July.
