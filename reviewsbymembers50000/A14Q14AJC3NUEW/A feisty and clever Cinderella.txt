 There are more than five hundred variations on the Cinderella story. This one has the most interesting "Cinderella" character that I know of. There's no fairy godmother, although there is an old nurse who teaches her all she needs to know "to be strong and capable and clever, besides being beautiful." Using her wits and skills, she escapes an arranged marriage to an ogre, and wins the love of a handsome prince. I think it's a much better message for little girls than some of the baggage that comes from the French version of Cinderella that most of us grew up on. And Anita Lobel's illustrations are unusual and charming.
