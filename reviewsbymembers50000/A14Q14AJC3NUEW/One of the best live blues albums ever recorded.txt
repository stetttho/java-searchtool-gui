 This album rivals B.B. Kings Live At The Regal for best live blues album ever. (Although, ironically, I think the weakest cut on the album is Sweet Little Angel, which nobody, not even Etta James can sing with the passion of B.B. King)  The high points are Baby What You Want Me To Do and Woke Up This Morning. Her singing is so tough, so ballsy on these songs, I cant think of another singer to compare her to. She could make even Wilson Pickett and James Brown sound like wimps.  She finishes both songs off with some scatting you have to hear to believe. She just takes my breath away. And several more songs on this album are almost as good. Besides the incredible singing, the other thing that makes this album a joy is the audience. The excitement is palpable. On a couple of songs, she gets a thrilling call and response going with them, and their excitement seems to feed her. You can actually hear her getting energy from the audience. The album is the next best thing to Etta James in person.
