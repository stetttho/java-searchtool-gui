 As much as I love the blues, Ive rarely liked contemporary versions of early blues, from the 20s and 30s. They usually sound fake to me, and worse than that, just about sacrilegious. Why cover Robert Johnson or Bessie Smith or Mississippi John Hurt when those artists themselves created perfection that can never be equaled let alone surpassed? I thought long and hard before buying Richland Women Blues which consists of nothing but covers of 20s and 30s blues songs. I wouldnt even have considered it except that I love Maria Muldaurs voice, and Taj Mahal, who is a guest on here, is one of the very few contemporary musicians who really can do old blues convincingly. Thank God I took a chance, because this is a great album. The best blues are always less about bad times than about the ability to survive them, and Muldaurs earthy, dont-mess-with-me voice is perfect for getting that across. There are four songs originally recorded by Bessie Smith on this album and every one is great. I cant believe Im saying that because I have NEVER heard a Bessie Smith cover that I thought was any good, but while Muldaur misses Bessie Smiths vulnerability, shes got the same toughness in her voice, and its so fine, so rare. It rings true, and any singer who can do a Bessie Smith song justice is the real deal. There is not a single bad track on Richland Woman Blues, and every time I listen to it, I have a different favorite song, but the gospel-tinged blues of Soul of A Man (with Taj Mahal), I Belong To That Band, and especially Its a Blessing (with Bonnie Raitt) make the hair stand up on the back of my neck. It will be a long, long wait before you hear another duet as good as Muldaur and Raitts. Beginning to end, this is a terrific album.
