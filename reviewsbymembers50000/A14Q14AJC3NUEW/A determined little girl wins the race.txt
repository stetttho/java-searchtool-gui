 Rachel and Obadiah is one of the best of Brinton Turkles Obadiah Starbuck stories (the others in the series are Thy Friend Obadiah, The Adventures of Obadiah and Obadiah the Bold), all of which deal with a little Quaker boy in colonial-era Nantucket. The plot of Rachel and Obadiah is basically a variation on the story of the tortoise and the hare. Little Rachel cant run as fast as her big brother Obadiah, so when they race to see who will get to bring to town the news of a ship returning to the harbor, her chances of winning do not look good. But Obadiah gets distracted by some blackberry bushes (and the belief that he is so fast that he can always catch up later) and so, by sheer determination, by never giving up for a second, Rachel wins.  I have a six-year-old daughter who has an older brother, so you probably wont be surprised to learn that she thinks this is the very best of the Obadiah books. Besides being a wonderful story, the book also has superb illustrations. The clothing, the clapboard houses with their widows walks, the windmills, and the old sailing ships coming into port are all great introductory history lessons for young children. But even better is the variety and expressiveness of all the characters faces. The joy and expectation on the faces of the crowd waiting for the ship to come in. The pride on Rachels tiny face when she wins the race. Especially good is the final picture of Obadiah slumping home while Rachel looks at him with a mixture of new-found pride in herself and compassion for her brother. Brinton Turkle is a master at capturing the complexity of human emotions, and this book is one of the best examples of his work.
