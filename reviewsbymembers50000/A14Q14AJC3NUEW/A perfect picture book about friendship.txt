 Thy Friend Obadiah is a simple but beautiful story about a six-year-old Quaker boy on Nantucket Island who is followed around by a seagull. At first the bird annoys him, especially when his brothers and sisters tease him about his "friend." But when the bird disappears for a time, Obadiah begins to realize how much he misses its company, and when it returns, injured, he takes car of it, and appreciates the friendship it has given him. Ive always thought of this as a deeply religious book, although looking it over now I realize there is only one religious reference in the whole book  when Obadiahs mother tells him, "I think it is very nice that one of Gods creatures favors thee." But the tone of the book is deeply spiritual. It is about love, friendship, and respect for creation. I especially like the fact that Obadiahs parents both seem wise, patient and kind. Old-fashioned, maybe, but its a nice contrast to a lot of more current childrens books Ive looked at. Although this is the most popular of the series, there are three more books about Obadiah: The Adventures of Obadiah, Rachel and Obadiah, and Obadiah the Bold. All of them are excellent.
