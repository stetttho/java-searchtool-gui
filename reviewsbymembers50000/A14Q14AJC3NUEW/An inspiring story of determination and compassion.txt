 As the mother of a 6-year-old girl, I*m always on the lookout for picture books with strong, intelligent and interesting female characters. This is one of the best. Mirette wants to learn to walk a tightrope. She falls over and over again, but never gives up trying, and finally becomes an expert. She is a great model of determination for young girls. But she*s more than that. The story is also about a once great tightrope walker, the man who first inspired Mirette, who has developed a fear of the wire. Mirette uses her own developing talent to help her teacher overcome his fear. The final illustration of the two of them reaching out to each other across the wire brings tears to my eyes every time. Mirette*s determination, ambition, and compassion are inspiring. My daughter and I both adore this book.
