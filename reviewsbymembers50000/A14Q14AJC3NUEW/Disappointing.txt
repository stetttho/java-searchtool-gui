 I was a little disappointed in this book. Family Math and Peggy Kaye's Games for Math cover similar territory in a much better way. The activities in those books are more fun and the authors do a better job of explaining  what skills kids will learn from doing the activities. There are a half  dozen or so projects I will try, but most of them don't seem worth the  effort.
