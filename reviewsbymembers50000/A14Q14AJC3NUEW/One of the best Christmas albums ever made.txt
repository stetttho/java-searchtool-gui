 There is just no way to get tired of this album. It is so diverse in musical styles that each track takes you into new territory. You settle into the very traditional opening and the next thing you know, you find yourself laughing at Elvis Costello's hilarious (and definitely not traditional) St. Stephen's Day Murders. Jackson Browne contributes a kind of agnostic's hymn (but it works just find for a liberationist Christian like me, too). There are many unfamiliar but beautiful European carols, and some of the more traditional carols are done in not very traditional ways. I especially like the way Rickie Lee Jones does O Holy Night, which is usually performed by singers with big, multi-octave voices, and always seems to have more to do with showing off than with reverence. Jones' quiet version is hesitant and awe-inspired, and seems to me closer to the spirit of Christmas than the showier versions. Threading through the whole album are the Chieftains' wonderful jigs and reels, which make you want to get up and dance (at least it has that effect on me, but I'm Irish, so maybe it's genetic). I bought two copies of this album, one on cassette for my car and one on CD for home because it is such a priceless and unique treasure. Right after Thanksgiving, it is always the first album I get out.
