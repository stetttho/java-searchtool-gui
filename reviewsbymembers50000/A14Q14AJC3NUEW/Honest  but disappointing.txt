 I read the first few pages of this book with a sense of relief that finally somenone was saying what needed to be said: the Supreme Court's decision to hand the election to George Bush without  bothering to count the votes in Florida was one of the most outrageous and  unconscionable things that has been done in American history. The fact that the court cited the equal protection clause - designed to protect minorities against the tyranny of the majority - when a large percentage of the votes being thrown out were those of minority voters was sickening. And the fact that they said their decision could not be used as a precedent demonstrated that even they didn't believe what they were saying.  But outrage has its limits. After reading a few pages where Bugliosi's anger matched my own, I began to tire of  the whole thing. This story needs to be told, but by a better writer than Bugliosi, one who has taken time to sift through all the events and offers details we haven't previously seen, and insights that aren't obvious. There are other books on the subject that I'm hoping are better: the New York Times and Miami Herald reports, Alan Dershowitz's new book, Jake Tapper's Down and Dirty, and Jeff Greenfield's Oh, Waiter, One Order of Crow, about the media's role in the affair. I plan to read at least a couple of those. This is a book for people whose anger over the election is so great that they can sit still while someone says over and over for more than a hundred pages that the Supreme Court committed a crime. It needs to be said, but I think most readers want more.
