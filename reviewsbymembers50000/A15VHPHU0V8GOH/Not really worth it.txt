 This is a book in which the main character, Jake Geissmar, is so unsympathetic that one wishes he would get killed. There is a great sense of time and place -- the only worthwhile part of the book -- but you can get this from any good history book. The characters are wooden and unappealing, and the actions of Jake are really not believable. The drama is created by the time and the place, not the plot which is weak and drawn out excessively. This is more the stuff for a short story but I doubt if Kannon could write a good short story. Give this one a miss.
