 It is difficult to believe that Tracy Hickman helped create and write the Dragonlance seris. I couldn't put them down. The characters created in that series seemed like real people and the events were descibed so that you were totally immersed in the book.   This book on the other hand has created characters you woudln't want to meet in real life and who are basically unsympathetic. Actually you wish that someone would kill Galen, the "hero" so you didn't have to listen to him whine and complain all the time. He and those chosen as the "elected" are really basically a boring lot and it is hard to care about them and their world. The Dragon religion crafted for that world seems unrealistic -- you hear a lot about the dragon, but he is not really a feature in the book -- more of a trimming to lure the reader in.       As for Mimic and his goblins -- well that part seemed totally unrelated to rest of the book. Again we are talking about unappealing character about whom the reader will not be interested. Actually the entire goblin sequences seem totally unrelated to the rest of the book.     The only appealing character and world in the book is the realm of the faeries with Dwynwyn, the Seeker, as the main character. That was the only world that seemed well fleshed out with appealing characters that the reader could empathize with.   This is an inauspicious start to a fantasy series. I know that I for one will not bother with the sequel and I recommend that others give this book and its sequel a pass.
