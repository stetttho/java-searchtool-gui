 This is one of the worst Lohengrins every recorded. Placido Domingo has a way of spoiling ever Wagner recording he undertakes. His German ix execrable and to me if you can't pronouce the language correctly you shouldn't be singing the opera. Too many reviewers get carried away by the starry names in the cast, and unfortunately in this opera the stars are the negatives. Solti does all he can to compensate but it is hard to compensate for a "bellower" like Domingo and "unsweet" Elsa like Jessye Norman. This was just a badly cast production which aimed at star power and selling to the naive.
