 This is an enormously fun game for a few months and then the boredom sets in. The game really ends at level 60 -- it just simply has no depth to it. I played it for about 3 months and just got so bored with it -- most of the quests were variation of Kill X mobs and bring me back Y. Only a few quests had real stories to tell. The chat channels were the most childish I have ever seen and the community seemed to be made up of 12 years old boys.  It seems very novel when you first start but the novelty wears off quickly -- the quest you get in you first 2 home zones are the most interesting but after that Horde and Alliance can do the same quests in the same zones.  The zones are very small and you can "do" them all in a few days - as they aren't difficult. The crafting system is non-existant -- get 5 items and hit combine. A really primitive system -- plays like it was an afterthought.  I think the worse thing in the game is the PvP -- now I am strictly a PvE player and I did not like having PvP on the same server I played on. There is only ruleset -- so PvE classes are constantly being "nerfed" to balance PvP. Also you can get quests to do which make you turn PvP for about 10 minutes --- no warning about the quest till it happens.  Blizzard does everything possible to force players into PvP -- and much of their new content is constantly PvP oriented -- This makes the game little better than a massive Diablo. They want you go to to battlegrounds and areas which are strictly PvP -- and some of the best rewards are only attainable via PvP. I am sorry I don't care for that mindset on the part of the developer.  Actually I went back to EQ2 and with all the new changes it is a much more solid game than WoW. Better and more quests, bigger game world -- no PvP on PvE servers.
