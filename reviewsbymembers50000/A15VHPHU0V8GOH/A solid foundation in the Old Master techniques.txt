 Johnnie Liliedahl gives a painter a solid and time tested approach to painting oils in the classical tradition. This is a solid work which gets the painter into laying background "turpsy" color washes,  following with glazing and finally the opaque over-painting. This is not  one of these "quicky" paint in 1 hour or 30 minute videos made  popular by TV-Artists but rather a solid process which takes place over  several days. There is a thorough explanation of the correct use of the  palette and the actual brush techniques and the brushes to use at each  stage of the process. I thoroughly recommend this video to any serious  student of the medium. Judy Weller
