 This has to be the worst book on the subject I have ever seen. Yes it is filled with beautiful color illustrations, but it does nothing to discuss actually painting the horse. It is more of history and anthology of equine art than it is a book of art instruction. It is vastly overprices and simply not worth the money. I found this book a huge disappointment and could see nothing of merit in it. The title is totally misleading. If you plan to paint horses, you want to know how to paint a dapple gray, what colors are best for a liver chestnut or a bay. What colors do you need to use to paint a palomino. What colors for the shadows and what colors for the highlights. Nothing like this is discussed in this book. In fact only one demonstration is given and that is a pretty poor one at that - nothing about the colors used etc.  The single demonstration is of  a dapple gray painted in the standard side view with an insipid background. There is absolutely no discussion of the best colors to have on your palette for various breeds and colors. Also there is no information on the pony or the foal in that section where the author fleetingly mentions drawing and the proportions.  All in all if you want to learn to paint and draw horses this is not the book for you. If you want to look at pretty pictures, and quite a few pages on equine anatomy, then buy this book.
