 This is truly one of the greatest Carmen recordings there is. Forget its age -- these are great French singers who truly feel and understand their roles. Andre Cluytens is one of the greatest conducters of this opera - he makes it pulse with life like no other. Raoul Jobin was a Don Jose who feels the role in a way that Domingo is incapable. Better still, despite its age this is the L'Opera Comique version with dialogue not those dreadful recitatives. If you like this opera then you will want this recording. If fact this is the ONLY Carmen to own!!
