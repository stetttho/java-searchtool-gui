 While this is a competent reading of the score -- there are certainly better recordings. Unfortunately the recording industry has allowed Gergiev to dominate the Russian Repetoire and he is not necessarily the best conductor for all operas. There are 2 older recording from the Bolshoi released by Le Chant Du Monde under license from Melodiya which are far superior in conduction and voice. There is a 1952 with the great Alexander Pirogov as Glalinski, Andrei Ivanov as Igor and Mark Reisen as Kontchak. The director is Alexander Melik-Pachaiev -- one of the greatest conductor who ever conducted at the Bolshoi. There is also a 1976 recording from the Bolshoi which has Mark Ermler conducting and has Artur Eisen as Galitski, and Alexander Vedernikov as Kontchak, and Ivan Petrov as Igov. It has a good set of women's voice in the great Tougarinova as Jaroslavna. Frankly I prefer either of these 2 recordings to Gergiev. While they may be digitally remastered there is a sumptuousness and authority in voice and direction which Gergiev can't match. To me Gergiev it must too driven a conductor who wants to dominate the score and this gives a hard edge to his work.
