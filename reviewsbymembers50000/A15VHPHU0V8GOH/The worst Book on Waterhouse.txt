 If you are truly interested in the work of Waterhouse DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. The images are small and poorly reproduced. Check the size of the pages and you will realize what postage stamps the images are. If you are  truly interested in the work of Waternouse get Hobson's book. There is very  little price difference and it has normal pages sizes which beautifully  reproduced photographs of the paintings. The accompanying text is far  more illuminating than the drivel printed in this book. Judy Weller
