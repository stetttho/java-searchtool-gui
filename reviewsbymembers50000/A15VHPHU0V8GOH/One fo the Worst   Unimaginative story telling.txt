 This is one of the worse books I have read. I had all I could do to finish it. Great fantasy should seem real -- this seems like all contrived by an unskilled writer. The heart of the problem is the main character, Tristan, who is weak, spineless and willful. His refusal to obey the Sr. Wizard Wigg is the plot contrivance used by the author to extend the story. Havina a weak central character is simply poor plotting and design. You can foresee every plot incident along the way -- it screams outloud what will happen next. I honestly don't see how any reputable publisher could publish such trash. The only appealing character in the book is Wigg - the rest are boring, uninteresing stereotypes. The fantasy world constructed by the author is as trivial as his writing.
