 I was rather disappointed with this book. I just did not find the characters particularly riveting or memorable. This was certainly not up to the standards of Jerusalem or even her first book The Firedrake. Although she gets off to a good start the book begins to drag when they reach Paris and I had a hard time finishing this book, despite the fact it is a rather short book -- more of a novelette than a novel.
