 This is a terrible book and is definitely NOT worth the money being asked. The author does NOT teach you how to paint or draw horses. She does quite a bit with equine anatomy and a history of the art form and the actual supplies needed to paint or draw in various mediums. On drawing the horses she has about 4 pages of information and there is absolutely nothing on the painting. No discussions of the colors needed for chestnuts, bays, palaminos etc. No discussion of the best way to produce a dapple grey, or the colors needed for the hoof or eye. Walter Foster library has a better book on painting horses which actually contains some painting demonstrations. This book contains only ONE painting demonstration and that is a pretty poor one at that. If you want to learn to draw horses go and get used books by Walter Foster or Sam Savitt -- you will never learn to draw from this book.END
