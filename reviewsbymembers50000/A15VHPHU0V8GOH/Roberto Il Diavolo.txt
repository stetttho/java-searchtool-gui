 The current volume being offered is an old Italian recoding starring Renata Scotto as the female lead and Boris Christoff in the title role. This recording has been around several decades on a variety of labels. It simply isn't worth it. It is heavily cut -- it is the Italian version not the original French. This is a magnificent opera but you would never know it listening to this version. There is a recording of the French version with Samuel Ramey in the title role taped during a live production at the Opera in Paris -- get this one. It is the only one worth owning.
