 Though I'm no authority on guitar music, I do have two recordings of the Villa-Lobos preludes included on this disk. Bream's playing here beats the other recording hands-down. It has a quality of elegance and yet of fun that I've called in this review's title simply "musical." And that's what we listen to music for, isn't it? I truly love those pieces and this CD.
