 Just to let Mac users know: I've been using my DI-604 router for over a year now with absolutely no trouble whatever. I found the manual just informative enough and have never had to look at it or the router again, after intial set-up. It just works, even through several power outages. By now they're no doubt cheap as dirt, too. My wireless access point is also D-Link and the two play together perfectly.
