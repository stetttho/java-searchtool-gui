 I really can't say which version of the Variations I like best. Luckily there is no reason to choose now that I have both, and how appropriate to have two variations of the Variations. Of course the sound of the 1981 version is vastly superior, but the 1955 recording sounds to my ear very good for the era. (Gould was a stickler for recording quality, of course.)  After reading some reviews I was a little disappointed in the long interview that constitutes the majority of the third disk. I don't care for the interviewer's or Gould's bad acting. But let me hasten to add that the content of the analysis of the performance in the interview is really fascinating and deepened my respect for the thought behind Gould's work. The outtakes are also great, as other reviewers have mentioned. I'm very happy this disk was included.  In a nutshell, I just don't see how any classical music fan can live without these CDs.
