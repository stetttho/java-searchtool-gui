 Amazing that they can (or, anyway, did) sell this item for the price. The two I bought were quite sleek and nicely sewn. I've purchase several Fellowes laptop bags and sleeves and have found them to be real bargains. Not only that, but one saved a brand new PowerBook when I went head over heels over a train track in Boston. That bag hit the ground *hard* and the laptop was still perfect. Other bags may look hipper, but Fellowes gets the job done, which is what matters to me.
