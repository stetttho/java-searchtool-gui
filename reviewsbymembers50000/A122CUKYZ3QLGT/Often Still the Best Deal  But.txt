 Update: Wrote the following review before opening the boxes. Now that I have, I realize these diapers are the OLD style, without the stretchy and more comfy back and the much easier to use tabs. I am very dissappointed. The shipment we got from Amazon in February was the new style, so I'm perplexed and annoyed that they should somehow now be selling such old stock. I hope they'll still work okay. If not, we'll have 450 diapers to give away. Grrrr.  Can't seem to change the stars on this review now. If I could, they'd go down to three. Just can't give more than that to this outdated product. On the other hand, you might receive new stock, as I did in February. But it's not worth taking that chance.  =====  I wanted to write this review to balance out the "Spotlight Review" current as of 6/06/05. Our experience is much different.  First, I agree with the spotlight review about Huggies. We love Huggies. Don't know why, but they've always worked better than Pampers for our girl. You mileage may vary.  But now to disagree. Yes, the prices on the small packages are no longer great here, but the prices on the big packages are fine, AND when you factor in no tax, free shipping, and the frequent store credits Amazon offers for large purchases, Amazon is way ahead of any other store. For example, we just bought three boxes of diapers and threw in ten dollars of other stuff to become eligible for a $20 credit. You just can't beat that. Last time, Amazon was offering $30 credit for a $90 purchase of Huggies. Again, unbeatable.  So, keep looking, bide your time, and pounce on the great deals when they happen.  And congratulations on your (I'm sure) wonderful children.
