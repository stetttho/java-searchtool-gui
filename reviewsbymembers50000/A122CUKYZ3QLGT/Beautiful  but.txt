 This speaker system is truly great looking--even down to the blue light that emanates from it at night. But to my wife's and my ears, the midrange just doesn't compete with my incredible bargain Creative Labs T3000 (roughly $40 and often cheaper with rebates). Still, if you've got an iBook or iMac and care about the visuals, or if you use speakers for gaming and don't care about the timbre of vocal harmonies so much, the Creature is still very good and you can't top the look.
