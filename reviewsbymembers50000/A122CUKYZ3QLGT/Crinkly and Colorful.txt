 I've not yet washed the book, so I can't comment on colorfastness. I can only say that Fuzzy Bee (and especially his friends dragonfly and spider) are a huge hit with my five month old. I bought this book as "filler" to make it to twenty-five dollars and get free shipping. Now I don't even remember what the "main" purchase was, but this one gets used every day.  With its variously shaped wings to play with, its crinkly cover, and its pretty good rhymes, this book is already my daughter's favorite and is likely to remain so for some time.
