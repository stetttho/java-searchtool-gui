 I was surprised and immediately put off by the bumpiness of this skillet's surface. I thought it would be detrimental to the sear and add to the pan's stickiness. I was wrong. This performs just as well as my decades old and entirely smooth old 9 inch skillet. This thing is indeed extremely heavy and the helper handle is indeed helpful. But the size is necessary. When it comes to searing steaks or frying up a mess of bacon (or, for you vegetarians, eggplant), there's no replacement for cast iron. A tremendous bargain; just make sure to add something on to qualify for "Super Saver" shipping.
