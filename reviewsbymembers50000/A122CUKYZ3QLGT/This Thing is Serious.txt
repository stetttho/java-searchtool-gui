 Yes, it's just an ice cream scoop, but when you pick this baby up you realize it could be a weapon. On the other hand, future archeologists will surely think it was an object d'art or a religious implement, it's so heavy and yet so sleekly sculptured. But for now, we just use it to scoop ice cream, at which it excels. It cuts through the stuff easily and I'm managing to make roughly spherical scoops, something I've never been able to do before. Ice cream release is fine, as well. Good stuff.
