 This pot is quite beautiful when it comes out of the box. The handles on the sides and lid are particularly elegant. But you buy it for the cooking and it is excellent at that. We've burnt a lot of chile over the years, but not since getting this pot.  One word of advice: I got this thinking it was plenty big for a party's worth of chile. It is not (at least not for a party of 30 or more). Though it might seem crazy, consider getting the 16 quart version if you're going to be entertaining on a large scale.
