 I'm not a huge Nina Simone afficianado, and I think some of the cuts on this disk are almost throwaways (please don't hate me; I'm a philistine). But, that said, the best cuts are simply wonderful. Decide for yourself which they are for you. I'll just say that Simone's interpretation of Leonard Cohen's "Suzanne" might be the best cover of all time. Seriously.
