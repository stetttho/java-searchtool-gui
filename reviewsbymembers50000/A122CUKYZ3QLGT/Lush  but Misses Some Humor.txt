 Please note: I'm no expert in G & S, let alone light opera. Still, I grew up with "The Mikado," as my parents are big fans. The version I recall from childhood (one of the D'Oyly Carte recordings) perhaps influences me too much when I complain of the lack of punch, bite, and general emotion in the singing here. The singing is indeed beautiful, but is that what you really want from "The Mikado"? If it is, this is your recording for sure. If not, go for D'Oyly Carte. If you're on the fence, the quality of this modern recording might again make this right for you. Perhaps we owe it to G & S to buy *several* versions.
