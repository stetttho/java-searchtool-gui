 Christopher Moore is a very sick, disturbed individual. I love that in a writer! If you do too, you'll love this book. Especially if you don't offend easily, don't care much for the religious right, and appreciate anyone who can work the word "slugfest" into the story in an original way. In a N. California tourist town, everyone goes cold turkey on their Prozac simultaneously. That's when the Beast is let loose, literally and figuratively. An aging B movie star tries to tame him-Steve, the literal beast, in some very creative and thankfully not very detailed ways. ("That's all you need to know about that"). I enjoyed this as all of Moore's prior works. He has some common themes throughout all of them but they don't seem all the same, as many writers tend to get. You'll appreciate the details and the research of Moore's writing. Looking forward to his next one.
