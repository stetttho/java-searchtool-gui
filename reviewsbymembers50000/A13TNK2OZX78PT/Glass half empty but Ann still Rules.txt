 I am as hooked on Ann as any of the previous customer reviewers, but this time something was missing. Jami Hegel-beautiful, smart, well-liked, from a loving family with no major pathology or skeletons in its closet-gets involved in a toxic, abusive relationship with a sociopathic loser who controls her for years....what's wrong with this picture??? Usually Rule explains or at least speculates on why the seemingly well adjusted people she chooses to write about get victimized by those they trust and love, but not this time. Steve Sherer was not successful, smart or particularly handsome. His jealous rages were easily understandable especially given his family's tragic past. I was left entertained, but puzzled, at the end of this story.
