 I saw this movie in the theaters, have seen it on cable many times since, and recently rented it for my kids, who are finally old enough to appreciate it. They loved it, and noticed things I hadn't. This movie did not suffer with age, it's not dated at all. If anything I loved watching the now more famous stars in their earlier years i.e. Frances McDormand, Holly Hunter, and John Goodman, not to mention Nick Cage, who should stick with the comedic parts he does so well and forget about ConAir etc. Love this movie!
