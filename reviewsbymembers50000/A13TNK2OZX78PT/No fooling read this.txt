 Richard Russo is known for his flawed but engaging characters, and he brings the theme home in this one. Sully-alcoholic n'er-do-well, divorced, with limited fathering skills to his grown son, has more redeeming qualities than flaws. However, they both keep multiplying throughout the book. Russo manages to inject exrtaordinary realism and humor into his stories so that you can smell the coffee in the diner, see the grit of the dying small towns, and laugh as you recognize a few people you know among the players. I recommend this and all his works for their humor and heart-with the exception of Mohawk, having no humor, but still worthy of praise. Can't wait to read his next one.
