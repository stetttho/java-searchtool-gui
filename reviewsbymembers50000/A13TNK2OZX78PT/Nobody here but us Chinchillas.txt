 Reading this book is like taking a long drive down a lonely road with the main character, Verna at the wheel. On the way, you meet interesting and quirky characters as well as live her memories of the past. As the road stretches out ahead of you, sometimes the rear view mirror image blends in with the present. I was intrigued by an insider's view of Mormons and their customs, as Verna physically and spiritually distances herself from her roots.  I'm glad to know this one is going back into print. It's a winner.
