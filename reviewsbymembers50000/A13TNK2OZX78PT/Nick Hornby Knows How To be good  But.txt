 It starts out great. It gets better. Sure, it's a stretch of a plot, the kids speak like adults, cynical, jaded, world-weary adults at that. Ok, granted. However,I really liked Katie, and wanted to continue reading to know more about her and her angry man-turned do-gooder husband, and to find out how GoodNews would get his-plus chuckle at a bunch of really witty dialogue and observations. The real problem was, the ending. It didn't really end. It was like Hornby just said, OK, enough, let's end it here, closed his eyes and pointed. Or maybe i just didn't get it. I loved and "got" his other two books, though, so I don't think it's just me. I was rating this a 4 star, up to the last paragraph.
