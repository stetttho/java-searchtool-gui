 Christopher Moore can do no wrong in my book. Or should I say in his book(s). Once again he sublimates his psychopathology to create an inventive, funny and thought provoking work of.. science fiction? Hard to categorize what starts off as a scientifically well researched novel of whale nerds on a mission, turns into a fantasy with a parallel universe, religious icons and an explanation of rastafarianism. His usual hero, "a geek in a cool guy's body", Nathan, is an everyman that  we all know and love. Odd characters like Kona and Amy turn into unlikely heroes and heroines. I loved his expressions, like "heinous f***ery most foul"  which I plan to incorporate into my vocabulary at every opportunity.
