 I just finished this tremendous work of literary art and couldn't wait to tell someone how great it is. I've never read a book that moved and enlightened me in quite the same way as Ahab's Wife. It has everything: spirituality, adventure, intellect, social commentary, history, humanity, and even a touch of humor.  In some ways, it's the intelligent woman's counterpart to the famous Melville novel (definitely a guy story). On the other hand, there's so much more to Una than simply being the wife of a whaling captain. Given that she marries Ahab halfway through the 600-plus pager, you realize this is no ordinary 19th century housewife you're dealing with. The first line tips you off, "Ahab was not my first husband nor my last." As that marriage came to its inevitable end, (most of us know what happens to Ahab even if you haven't read Moby Dick) it becomes suspenseful as you wonder which of the fascinating men she has met becomes her 3rd spouse. Isaac Starbuck, the "gaoler"? The Judge? Rodden, the woodcarver? David, the midget bounty hunter turned abolitionist? You won't believe who it is. A surprising and deeply satisfying turn of events ends the story, but not the life, of this remarkable woman.
