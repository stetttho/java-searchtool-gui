 Richard Russo should be much better known than he is, and this story is a testament to his talent. Ned Hall, a bright, sensitive 12 yr. old stuck in a small-minded small town, born into a family that brings new meaning to the term dysfunctional. As the book progresses, Ned tries, and sometimes fails to be something other than the obvious losers that he's surrounded by, including his father. Sam Hall, a parent who never should have been, is a drunk, a gambler, a bad sport, and generally a case of arrested emotional maturity. Ned manages to raise himself with the help of some kind but also flawed people in Mohawk. Believe it ir not there are some real funny moments in this book. I liked this as much or more than his other three....and I really loved them.
