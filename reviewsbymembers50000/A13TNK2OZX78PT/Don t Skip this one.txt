 This first installment of the GroVont trilogy,is a work of art by itself, but don't stop at the end of this one. Capturing teenage angst, first love, family pathology, and small town America, Sandlin weaves a complicated but engaging tale. Sam Callahan, a semi-normal teenager despite his immature and alcolic mother, goes looking for freindship in a new town, far from his native N. Carolina in so many ways, and finds Maurey Pierce, smart, sassy, funny, and beautiful. Together they embark on an adventure including sexual experimentation, heartbreak, humor, and things they never bargained for. These characters are so real you can hear them breathing. I'm hooked on Sandlin, and am glad he kept this tale going for two more books.
