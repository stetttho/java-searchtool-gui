 John Welter is one funny guy. He also has alot of heart, plus a brain. I never laughed so hard in a book one minute, then stopped, took a deep breath and gulped down tears the next. Doyle Coldiron, the protagonist, is a secret serviceman with a sense of humor about catching bullets for insignificant dignitaries. He falls in love with a coworker, plays midnight secret softball, and babysits a drunken diplomat, all the while exchanging the wittiest dialogue with everyone he encounters. Too bad Welter can't turn them out faster-I can't get enough of him.
