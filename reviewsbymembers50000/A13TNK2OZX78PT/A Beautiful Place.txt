 I was attracted to the gorgeous cover art of this book in the children's section. As I read it I felt swept away. The text and illustrations are so beautiful, so moving, and so unique. I'd recommend it for children, parents and adults alike. It's a simple but profound way of explaining death to a child, without seeming scary or overtly religious. Keep this in mind as a gift. As a parent and a child therapist, I know this will be put to good use.
