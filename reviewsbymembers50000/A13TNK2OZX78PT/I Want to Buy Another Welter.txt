 This is a book I'm recommending to everyone. As soon as I tell them "Well it's about this illegal alien who arrives in this country knowing only the line.....from watching Wheel of Fortune" their eyes light up, they chuckle, and say "that sounds GOOD!" Well, it is good. It's witty, it's clever, it's creative, but it's also thought-provoking, and tackles some weighty issues like prejudice, religious hypocracy, and what the one job is that nobody wants. I got hooked on Welter after Begin to Exit Here. Too bad he has written only three books. After finishing this one I went seriously cold turkey. Hope he gives us all our next fix soon.
