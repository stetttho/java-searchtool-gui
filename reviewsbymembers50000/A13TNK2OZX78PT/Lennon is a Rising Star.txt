 I have to say that a book's jacket cover art, when well done, can truly make you consider buying it. That, plus a gripping first line ensured that I left the store with this book in hand. J.R. Lennon hit a homerun with his first swing. The story has tragedy, love, loss, humor, and likable or at least believable characters that you care what happens to. The central incident, a plane crash, happens on the first page. The story then takes you into the separate but sometimes intersecting lives of those affected by it. I really enjoyed this book and was sad to see it come to its very satisfying end.
