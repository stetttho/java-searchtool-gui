 Christopher Moore has a knack for combining humor, horror and heart in varying but always synergistic proportions. In this, what I consider his best book, the humor and heart tend to dominate. You'll learn about modern Native American life, get a peek into the secrets of the insurance industry, and remember what it was like to fall in love for the first time. Sam Hunter, an insurance salesman running away from a horrible but justified crime he committed in his youth, is chased down by Coyote, a common Native American folklore figure. He seems to ruin Sam's life, but the plot twists and turns several times before the big finish. Moore takes a few swipes at bikers, druggies, and Southern California in general before it's all over. You'll laugh out loud, alright, but you may wipe a few tears away too.
