 As a lifelong lover of R&H musicals, especially the film version of SP, I watched this, expecting to hate it. I was pleasantly surprised. Actually, I loved it. First of all, the moral of the story was much more fleshed out and better illustrated. Secondly, the cast was spectacular. Harry Connick, Jr.-Perfect. "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught" was movingly delivered with anger and resolve. Glenn Close too old? Who cares? She sings, she dances, she ACTS, she washes that man right out of her hair. Forget Mitzi Gaynor. The spirit of Mary Martin was on the screen. I may buy this video for myself, and an exrra one or two for gifts. Good job!
