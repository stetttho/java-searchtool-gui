 Thanks to Amazon's You may also like... I picked up this one, and now I think I have a new favorite author. This is a truly creative book with wonderful characters and a convoluted but engaging plot. Man takes in three legged dog. Dog dies but refuses to stay buried or dead. Man talks to aliens, time-travels, changes his life, and sees the Beatles. Tears, surprises, and just the right amout of hilarity thrown in. I'm glad Carroll has written so many, I won't have to wait to read his next one.
