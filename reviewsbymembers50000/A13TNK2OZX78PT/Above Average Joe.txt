 Hilarious and heartfelt, Joe takes us on a trip down his own personal highway to hell. He returns to his hometown, Bush Falls, where the whole town is enfuriated with him. Fists and milkshakes fly. Copies of his bestselling book, a thinly veiled account of his life in Bush Falls, hit his living room window and litter the front yard. Death, love, paintball, redemption and a big Do-over ensue. I loved Plan B, but this really had my attention from the cover picture on. Keep cranking them out!
