 I've had my EyeTv 200 for a couple of weeks now, and I've found that the clarity of the on-screen image is dependant upon your signal.  I only have the regular TV stations that come in through an amplified TV antenna.  The stations with a good signal are clear on the computer screen while those with weak signals are not so clear.  Also, if you have problems with the TV signal for your regular TV then that problem may be amplified and look even worse with the EyeTv.  Cable and satellite customers shouldn't have any problems with image quality or set up.    Set up is straight forward - no problems there, or with the software to make it work when you want.  I had no problems getting it to work the first time through.  The EyeTv box itself does seem to get a little warm when left on, which is easy to do because the Fire-wire cable provides power to it. So, I don't set anything on top of it and give it a little extra space under my desk on a small shelf.  Overall, a little better then I expected.
