 Ira Milligan does a good job of introducing dreams and dream interpretation.  This part of the book is short and easily readable within a few hours.  The larger part of this book tends to dream symbols with biblical interpretations of those symbols.  I think it is a great starter book for Christians looking to learn more about dreams.
