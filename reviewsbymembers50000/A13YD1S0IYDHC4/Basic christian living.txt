 I've read this book and am now going through it out-lining each chapter.  Jeanne Guyon gets back to the basics of Christ Jesus living in us and through us to make a difference for us.  She is very much like Paul in her thinking as in this book she points out again and again that the works of our flesh count for nothing.  But, what does count is Christ Jesus living in us and loving through us.  She is also careful to point out certain points of growth that all christians must go through, such as an initial time of feeling God's presence and dry times.
