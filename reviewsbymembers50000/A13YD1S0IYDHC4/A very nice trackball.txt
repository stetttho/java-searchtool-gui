 I've had this trackball for about 7 years and used it with my Mac.  It has been great, not having to chase the mouse around the desk, lift it up and bring it back, then chase it around again.  It's need for cleaning is the biggest drawback and why I gave it 4 stars. I usually use and exact-o-knife to clean the build-up on the rollers and then some kind of cleaning solution on a cotton swab, like 409). It is also starting to just get old (in my opinion) with optical-wireless ones out there.  If it were wireless (Bluetooth preferred) and optical, I'd buy a new one without hesitation.  I love the placement of the ball and the buttons and being able to program the buttons the way I like.
