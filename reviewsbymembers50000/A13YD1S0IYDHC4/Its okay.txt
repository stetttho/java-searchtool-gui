 It is okay but not impressive.  The clear plastic that covers the screen of my Magellan is kinda cheap, but it does fit fine, meaning that the hole in the plastic for the joystick is in the right place and allows for fine movement.  The case is not water proof by any stretch.  I do like the options on the back of the case for belt loop or clipping it to something else (maybe a backpack?) or however you may want to carry it.
