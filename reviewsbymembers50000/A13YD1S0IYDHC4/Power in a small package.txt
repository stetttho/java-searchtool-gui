 I've had this book for several years and have loaned it to several friends.  One friend said at first she thought it was just another book about prayer, but was really impressed by the depth of it.  This book covers why we pray, and how we should pray.  It is also about entering into God's plans through prayer and how God waits for us to join with him through prayer to see his plans come about.
