 I purchased this combination for a new iMac running OS X.4.  It is very slow (both AntiVirus and Utilities).  AntiVirus brings up an error everytime the computer starts saying it needs to be re-installed which has been tried and did not change the error message.  I hope I never need to start the computer from Utilities, because I did that once and it took 45 min to start up, and 60 min to shut down (actually, I got tired fo waiting and turned the computer off by holding the power button until it shut down.)  I'm tempted to just take these off my computer, but in the past I've had Mac viruses, and found Utilities to be helpful.  I haven't found these two current products useful yet.
