 I've had this synch cable to about a month, and one of the plastic tabs that should help hold the Palm in place for hot synching broke off.  So, now I have to hold my Palm against the cable connection.  I flat surface for synching is highly recommended.  Now, I'm looking for a new cradle that is more durable.  I do like that it is portable, and can charge my Palm in a car or just through the USB cable.
