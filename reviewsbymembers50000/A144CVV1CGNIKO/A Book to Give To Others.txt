 For the past year I have been examining Catholic books that would be appropriate to pass on to Christian friends to introduce basic Church teachings. This is just the book I was hoping to find. It opens up the world of Catholic thinking, with the important emphasis on our spiritual relationship with Jesus.  As a convert to Catholicism, I don't believe it will alienate non-Catholic Christians. It is not a conversion story, but it includes a great deal of personal, anecdotal example which adds warmth. It does use "church language" and so will probably not work for non-Christians. If you like the book, you can also get audio and video cassettes at christlife.org.
