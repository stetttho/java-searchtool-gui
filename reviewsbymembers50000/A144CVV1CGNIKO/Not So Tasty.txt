 I have tried a half dozen recipes from this book so far and I've liked only one of them (Sally Lunn). The pictures are beautiful, the spiral binding is great but the recipes I've tried are mediocre. Maybe it's just me or my machine (Breadman), but recipes from my other cookbooks tend to taste better.
