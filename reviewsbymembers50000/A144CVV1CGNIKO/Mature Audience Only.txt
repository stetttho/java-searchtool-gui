 My daughter (age 9) and I went into the local skate shop and picked up an issue of this mag as recommended by the young clerk. I thought it'd be good to look at since my daughter is showing an interest in the sport and we're thinking about a better board for her.   We thumbed through it together and I found that some of the articles were well-written and interesting, but some were really profane - lots of nasty stuff and promoting an unhealthy lifestyle. There were also no female skaters and nothing good to say about women - bummer.   So I let her look at the pictures and tore out some of the text - probably 10 pages. There was a pretty cool DVD (an extended ad for element skateboards) that came with it that I think she'll enjoy. But parents should be aware that this is not kid-friendly.
