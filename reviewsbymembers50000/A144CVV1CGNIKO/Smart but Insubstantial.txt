 I was considering this magazine subscription for a gift and picked up a copy at the supermarket to check it out. After reading it cover to cover I decided against it.   Pros: Entertaining and downright funny in places, it made me giggle several times. Good variety of information: history, people, geography, arts, etc. Formatted in bits, mostly paragraph length pieces with occasional longer articles. Good for conversation starters or to impress others with your vast knowledge.  Cons: The writing style did not "hook" me. Perhaps it's targeted more at a male audience. Some of the articles were silly expositions of unlike things (e.g. Caesars: Sid Caesar, Cesar Chevez and Caesar salad). I occasionally got the feeling that the authors were awfully proud of themselves for being so clever and above the societal mainstream (though they do it tongue-in-cheek). Finally, although it may make you feel smart, Mental Floss doesn't offer any real wisdom. You may come away knowing a few more facts, but does that make you a better person?  If you want a good magazine for thinking through moral and religious issues, take a look at First Things. But this will probably be fun for your trivia buffs and high school honor student types.
