 This bundle seems like such a great deal.  Problem is the Storybook Weaver program will not work on any Mac system after 7.0. But you can't find this out until you buy it and wonder "Why do I keep getting error messages?" The newer version is available only to schools at $... So if you have a Mac, this program will probably not work. What a disappointment. The math game is great! My seven-year-old homeschooler loves it. It includes a wide variety of math concepts - grouping, time, money, etc. And Kid-Pics is always fun. I guess it's still a good deal. But it would have been good to know that we were only getting two programs when we bought it.
