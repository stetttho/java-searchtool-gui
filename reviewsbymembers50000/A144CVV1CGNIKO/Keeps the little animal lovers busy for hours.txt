 My eight-year-old daughter just loves animals and the Littlest Pet Shop line is her newest favorite. She saved her own money for this playhouse and was not disappointed. It comes with a dalmation, fish and hamster and all kinds of cute little accessories. Seems quite durable. We're planning a Littlest Pet Shop birthday party and wanted to suggets the Usborne book "Making Models" as a creative complement to these cute toys. They hava a mini-garden project that will work beautifully with the pets.
