 My six-year-old home-schooled son is picky when it comes to books. He loves "Where the Wild Things Are" so I checked this out of the library. We read it at least a dozen times before it had to be returned and he keeps talking about it. The words roll off the tongue, though the story has that dark element (like Roald Dahl's stories) that challenges your own comfort . The pictures are a feast. And though the kids don't know it yet, the historical setting has been planted so that when we study WWII later, they might remember the little children with the gold stars. So now I must buy a copy. Hope you and your family will enjoy it too. Thank you, Mr. Sendak.
