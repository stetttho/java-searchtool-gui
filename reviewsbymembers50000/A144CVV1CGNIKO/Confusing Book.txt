 We love Usborne books but skip this one. The layout is terribly busy and it tries to teach too much at once. After showing you the parts of the recorder and how to hold it, it goes right into playing your first note, writing musical notation ("This sign at the beginning of the staff is called a treble clef."), and playing a rhythm, all before you get to page 10! I could not imagine inroducing my seven-year-old to the recorder using this book. I have a hard time making sense of it (and I'm a college graduate). Get a hold of "Recorder Fun" instead which seems like a good starter text for the recorder.
