 I started using Saxon because I had heard many marvelous things about it--the teacher's manuals show the problem being solved step by step and the book reviews very, very often.  True; the teacher manuals are excellent.  They go through the problems step-by-step, really quite useful. Does the book review often?  Yes and no.  It's set up to where you must complete four lessons then take a quiz...a quiz based on the four lessons you did before you did the last four you just did.  (for example, you do lessons 5-8 then take a quiz based on lessons 1-4) So, yes, it does review with it's quizes.  However, it does not review outside of the quizes.  It gives you one lesson to learn something...one lesson, and only one.  If you don't understand it, you must continue to read the lesson over until you understand it.  Which is kind of a, "Well...yeah, of course."  But sometimes it's nice to see what you're trying to learn in another lesson, to see it worded differently. Not only that, but what if you are not a good retainer of information?  If you are not a good retainer of information, then even if you do pick up the material, you immidiently go on to new material.  You are expected to remember the material you just learned, as well as learn the new material.  Forcing you to go back in the book and review what you learned earlier if you were not able to retain it.  Overall, I think this would be a better book if there was two or three lessons to cover the same material, and less teaching new material.  There is a lot that they expect you to learn in only one year.  Four stars, leaning towards 3.5 stars.
