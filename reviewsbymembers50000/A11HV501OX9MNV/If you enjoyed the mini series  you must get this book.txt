 I saw the mini-series first, and as soon as I did, I was instantly obsessed, and I spent about two years looking for this book.  When I found it, I quickly devoured the book, reading it in less than a day.  It is different from the movie, a few character roles are switched around, and a few of the scenes are a little different.  While I didn't enjoy the book as much as the movie, it is still a great book. If you have enjoyed the mini-series, you must get this book!  It is written very nicely, and it is so interesting to see the scenes that are different in the book from the movie!
