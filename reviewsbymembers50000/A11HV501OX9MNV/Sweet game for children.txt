 This is a cute and entertaining game, it features Laura going through the village and helping the different townsfolk along the way.  Laura is a sweet, kind girl providing service unto the different villagers along the way, never asking for anything in return for her good deeds.  This game provides as a good influence for younger children by showing that kindness and service can go a long way. The game also includes no violence, no evil, it's just a sweet little game inspiring young children to do good deeds. In addition to roaming the village, there are also a number of mini-games that Laura can play.  The mini-games are both challenging and fun to play.  This is a good game choice for any child...any child, so long as he or she can read.  They may be able to figure out how to play without reading, but being able to read makes it easier and enhances gameplay.  Very cute game, sweet characters, good moral.
