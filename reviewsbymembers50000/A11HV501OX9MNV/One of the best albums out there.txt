 I own a lot of Billy Joel's CDs, and I must say, this one is by far one of his best!  It only has nine songs, but they are all simply wonderful.  There is not a single song on this CD that I have not enjoyed. When I first bought this CD I, literally, never put it down.  I took it on a trip with me and I kept replaying this CD over and over again.  I love the order of the music.  It starts off nice and up-beat, what a way to get into a music mood!  Then it ends with a song that is a little slower and calming.    Movin' Out--10/10 Stranger--10/10 Just the Way You Are--9/10 Scenes from an Italian Restaurant--10/10 Vienna--10/10 Only the Good Die Young--9/10 She's Always a Woman--9/10 Get it Right the First Time--10/10 Everybody has a Dream--8/10  To sum it up, this is easily one of Billy Joel's best.
