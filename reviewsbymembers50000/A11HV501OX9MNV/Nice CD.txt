 I was very hesitant to buy this CD...seeing as it was new and all, I wasn't sure I would like it because I thought that Elton would try a more "modern" approach...in fact, I was so hesitant, that I didn't even buy it--I received it as a gift. Thankfully, I was wrong about Elton trying a "modern" approach. It was so nice to hear the nice Elton that I was accustomed to.  It's definitely not his best CD, but I still enjoyed it.  I find that the more times I listen to it, the more I like it.  Weight of the World--9/10 Porch Swing in Tupelo--9/10 Answer in the Sky--9/10 Turn the Lights Out When You Leave--10/10 My Elusive Drug--8/10 They Call Her the Cat--9/10 Freaks in Love--9/10 All That I'm Allowed--10/10 I Stop and I Breathe--10/10 Too Many Tears--10/10 It's Getting Dark in Here--9/10 I Can't Keep This from You--10/10  All in all, it's a nice CD.  Nothing that blew me away, there weren't even any songs that really just stood out to me...but, I would recommend the CD.  Especially to the more familiar Elton John fans--it's just nice to hear him on new CDs.
