 This is such a great mini series, I am so glad that it came out on DVD!  It's about a young waitress who never thinks that anything interesting will ever happen in her life...little did she know that her life was about to change as she knew it.  She enters a magical fairy tale world, and she must learn to adapt to it because she and her father are stuck there until they can figure out a way to get home again.  Along the way they meet a friendly half wolf half human friend, lovingly named Wolf.  I have watched this many, many times.  The story is excellent, the action is great, holds you on the edge of your seat, and the acting is just brilliant.  This is one of Scott Cohen's first big acting jobs, but you can't tell!  He plays the part of Wolf and is just wonderful.  This is what got his career kicked up, and you can see why! I loved the characters in this movie, they were all just so great.  And the relationship between Wolf and Virginia is just excellently put together!   It was made as a mini-series, and because of this fact, I thought that the movie quality, the acting, and all in all the entire film would be poor...but boy was I wrong!  I fell in love with it the first time I ever saw it, and have even become a bit obsessed with it!  I must admit, though, that the first few minutes of the film are kind of slow.  It doesn't start to get really good until around the time that the character "Wolf" is introduced.  But, the rest of the movie completely makes up for this slower beginning.  This is truly one of the greatest fairy tale stories out there.  It's a little more for the adults than the children, but children will love it just as much as the adults!  Better than 5/5!
