 I bought this camera a few years ago, I was looking for a camera that was easy to handle, small in size, and was for beginners...well, I found this camera, and I got what I was looking for--a great, compact camera with excellent handling for beginners. This camera uses a SmartMedia card, which is really convenient since you can find SmartMedia cards just about everywhere for a bargain price.   What was the deciding factor for me to buy this camera, was the amount of batteries it used.  I was surprised to learn that it only uses two AA batteries, it has so many features for a beginner that you would think it would use more batteries.  The life of the battery is fairly long, about 100 minutes, which is always nice.  Some people may complain that it uses AA batteries, and that they would prefer to use a lithium battery, but I always find myself asking--why?  It is so much more convenient to use AA batteries because you can pick them up anywhere.  The only thing about this camera that I can complain about is that there is no way to attach any additional lenses or filters, you can't even attach an adapter to add on any thing to the lens.  For a beginner photographer, though, that is probably okay since beginners are not really using the lens or filters yet.   Also, this camera is a little bulkier than I had originally thought.  It is small in length and height, but it is surprisingly thick.  Other than that, though, I thoroughly enjoyed this camera during the time I had it, and the only reason I sold it was because I was ready for an upgrade.  But I loved this camera to bits while I had it--it really prepared me for the more advanced cameras, and it taught me all of my basic photography skills.  Excellent, excellent camera for beginners.
