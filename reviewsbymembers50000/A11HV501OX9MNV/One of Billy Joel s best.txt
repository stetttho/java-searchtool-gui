 Some very memorable songs on this CD!  Turnstiles is one of my favorite Billy Joel CDs, I've read a lot of complaints about this CD, but I don't see why.  I always enjoyed this CD.  When I was younger, and my parents listened to Billy Joel a lot, I remember the song "Summer, Highland Falls" and "I've Loved These Days" always standing out in my mind.  Then I didn't hear these songs for a few years straight, but they were so good that I could still remember them!  Say Goodbye to Hollywood--10/10 Summer, Highland Falls--10/10 All You Wanna Do Is Dance--10/10 New York State of Mind--9/10 James--10/10 Prelude/Angry Young Man--9/10  I've Loved These Days--10/10 Miami 2107--9/10  Great songs are on this CD, I have no complaints about this CD.  5/5 stars!
