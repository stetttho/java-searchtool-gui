 I looked at the Princeton Review and Kaplan books, but ended up using this one instead. It doesn't appear any larger on the outside, in terms of book size and paper weight, but there's about three times as much material here as in the Kaplan book. With more practice tests, more extensive discussion and review of math concepts and more vocabulary words and flashcards, this book gives you far and away the most value for your money. After taking the practice tests in this book, and in 10 Real SATs, I got a 1520 on the actual test (V: 800, M: 720). I'm taking the test again this fall, and I'm going to try for that 800 on the math section. This book will certainly be the cornerstone of my continued studies for the test. The only circumstance under which I would recommend primarily using the Kaplan book instead is if you are scoring below 1100 on your initial practice tests... In this case, the Kaplan book will probably help you more, as it covers some general strategies that will help you get your score up into the 1300 range, strategies which this book neglects in favor of more sophisticated material. As always, you'll only get as much out of it as you put in: so use the book regularly, supplement it with outside reading if you have trouble with the verbal section and with extensive problem solving if you have trouble with the math section. But that said, this book provides an excellent foundation for your studies and I highly recommend it.
