 Rich Dad's Guide to Investing is the third installment in Robert                                           Kiyosaki's best-selling series of financial advice books. The first in                                           the series, Rich Dad, Poor Dad was structured around the story of                                           how Kiyosaki grew up in a family with a father who was a                                           highly-paid official in the Hawai'i school system but who, no matter                                           how much money he made, never seemed to be able to get ahead in                                           his financial life. His advice to Kiyosaki was "Go to school, get good                                           grades, get a good, secure job." Then when Kiyosaki was nine, he                                           adopted a second dad, the now infamous "Rich Dad", the father of his                                           best friend Mike. Rich Dad (who's name is never given in the books)                                           came from a background that was very financially poor, but went on                                           to become one of the wealthiest men in Hawai'i, building business                                           after business and retaining his wealth through his own philosophy of                                           money management. Rich Dad, Poor Dad chronicled and expounded                                           on Rich Dad's advice to Kiyosaki, which could be summarized as:                                           "Don't ever work for money. Make the money work for you. Only hold                                           a job to gain skills, not to make a living. There is a surfeit of                                           opportunity in the world- but you have to go to it, because it won't                                           come to you. Create wealth." Kiyosaki took Rich Dad's advice to                                           heart and went on to make several fortunes of his own.                                           The second Rich Dad book, The Cashflow Quadrant, was a discussion                                           of the four different approaches to making money- as an employee,                                           as a self-employed professional, as a business-owner and as an                                           investor. Poor Dad valued security, and encouraged Kiyosaki to                                           become a high-paid employee, like himself. But Rich Dad argued that                                           the road to wealth and security lead away from the                                           employee/self-employed half of the "Cashflow Quadrant" and into                                           the business-owner/investor side, where a person can control his                                           own future and financial destiny. Whereas Rich Dad, Poor Dad gave                                           an overview of Rich Dad's financial philosophy, The Cashflow                                           Quadrant detailed a crucial part of it- the argument that only through                                           financial literacy and an understanding of the flow of wealth in the                                           world can a person become wealth himself.                                           Now comes Rich Dad's Guide to Investing. Although the title might                                           lead some readers to believe that it's a guide to the world of                                           IPOs-and-technology-stocks, it's really an even more in depth look                                           at the world of the businessman and long-term investor, a more                                           hands-on continuation of Cashflow Quadrant. In fact, the whole                                           second half of the book is devoted to strategies for developing and                                           profiting from your own business, which Kiyosaki calls "investing                                           from the inside." IPOs are discussed in the last few chapters- but                                           Kiyosaki is talking about how to do your own IPO.                                           Like it's predecessors in the series, this book suffers from a rambling                                           and folksy pop-finance style that can sometimes detract from the                                           content of the book. But stylistic considerations aside, the series                                           stands head and shoulders above similarly themed books. Rich Dad's                                           Guide to Investing is no get rich quick guide. Rather, it's a practical                                           blueprint for building wealth even in you are starting out with very                                           little free cash. But that's not to say that it's "no money down". In                                           fact, the strategies outlined here require more than just money- they                                           also require sizable amounts of time. But the Kiyosaki makes the                                           tradeoff in time seem worth it, considering that the alternative he                                           presents is a lifetime of financial constraint.                                           I especially like Kiyosaki's suggestions for planning and executing                                           three separate tracks of investment: investment for security,                                           investment for comfort and investment for wealth. His pyramid                                           approach to business management was also very interesting. Overall,                                           this book isn't as inspiring as Rich Dad, Poor Dad, but it has much                                           more how-to-do-it nitty-gritty type information, which I appreciated                                           a lot. Highly recommended.
