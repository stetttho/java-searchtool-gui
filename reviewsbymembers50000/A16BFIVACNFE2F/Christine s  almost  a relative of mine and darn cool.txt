 I can't really claim the ability to impartially review this book. Christine is my mother's step-mother's niece and therefore almost a relative of mine by proxy. Although I've not met her in person yet, she was giving a reading in Portland, Oregon when I was in Salem this April and my grandparents got her book for me. Since then I have been corresponding with her by e-mail and she just recently sent me a box full of litmags... (Yay!) I have to admit that it took me a while to get into her work. It's not easy poetry... it's not e.e. cummings. But I've enjoyed more difficult poetry in the past and I also enjoyed this volume of work very much. Christine has an absolutely fantastic eye and ear for images, as witnessed by almost every piece in this collection. This is her first book, but since it's a Barnard New Women Poets prize-winner and an absolutely stunning debut I'm sure I'll be seeing a lot more of her stuff in the future- and I'll look forward to reading it.
