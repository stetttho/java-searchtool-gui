 I don't usually read books that qualify for the publishing category of "self-help" as blatantly as this one does. In fact, the only other real self-help book I can remember reading cover to cover is Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, which I hated. So I really picked up this book more because I like Harry Browne and am familiar with him through his association with the Libertarian party, then because I needed advice on how to run my life. Let me say this: I knew he was a nut. However, I did not know he was this much of a nut. I really do like his ideas about gaining control of your life and regaining freedom by changing your own behavior patterns and not the behavior of those around you. And he has some sound practical advice in this area. But when he gets into discussing personal relationships. I mean... open marriages? Yes, actually advocates, with a straight face, that travesty known as the "open marriage". It's true this book was written during the early '70s. I guess even the best free-thinkers still remain products of their time. But open marriages... Enough said.
