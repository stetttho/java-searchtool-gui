 This beautiful picturebook is the story of an old Dutch artist's young apprentice, a boy who is so talented at such a young age that the king himself commissions him to come to court to paint a portrait of all the nobles. Adrian, the apprentice, has learned the art of capturing true likenesses on canvas, and it is for this that the king admires him so. But people don't often like to see their real faces, and when Adrian finishes the portrait the nobles and ladies of the court, they all gather to abuse him for "misrepresenting" them in image and they try to force him to change the portrait to be more flattering- and untruthful. The Young Artist is a wonderful story about artistic integrity and the meaning of success. It is accompanied by truly magical pictures, created by a man who is himself a master artist. I love the story, but Locker's paintings for his story are what make this book an enduring favorite of mine. I highly recommend that anyone interested in children's literature find and read this and anything else by Thomas Locker they can get their hands on!
