 Although not a hard-hitting manifesto like Charles Murray's What It Means To Be A Libertarian (one of my favorite books), Libertarianism: A Primer provides an excellent overview of the intellectual development of libertarianism. It's a much more historically oriented book than Murray's, a study of people as much as a study of ideas, from Adam Smith to Murray Rothbard and Ayn Rand. But the ideas are still here, and they are well presented with strong arguments for all of the typical libertarian core issues- downsizing of government, privitization of services, legalization of drugs, open borders, free-market protection of the environment, etc, etc. I consider myself a libertarian, although I'm still not sure whether I agree with all the mainstays of hardcore libertarianism. This book provides a balanced, moderate approach without coming across as either too conservative or too wild-eyed-and-fringe. Charles Murray's book has more intellectual weight, but I also recommend this book for a deeper understanding of the historical background of truly freedom-oriented politics.
