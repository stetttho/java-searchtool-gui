 I am not a fan of E.J. Dionne's columns by any stretch of the imagination. A friend suggested I read this book, and I have to say I was VERY impressed. Dionne's account of the dynamics of American politics over the past fifty years is nothing short of remarkable. The book combines political theory, history, and biography in a way I've never experienced before. His interpretations of the evolution of liberalism and conservatism in postwar America are amazing - well-balanced between explaining the ideological abstracts of both sides and illustrating his discussions with the people and events that shaped them. It is high-end, dense political writing, and Dionne does it well.  I look forward to reading his other books now... I'm still no fan of his columns though...
