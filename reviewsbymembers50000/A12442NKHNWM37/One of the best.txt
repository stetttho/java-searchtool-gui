 Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" is among the finest literary works of our time. His ultra-dense examination of colonialism and the myriad of sociological questions that it raises is THE most powerful novel I have ever read.  Like many of Conrad's other works, this masterpiece is misleading in that its shortness suggests it can be read in one sitting. In reality, it is a truly monumental novel, each paragraph of which should be savored and meditated upon, as they are all equally amazing - at the same time beautiful and horrible.  It's become a cliche when discussing Conrad, but this novel is truly a journey into the darknesses of the human mind on so many levels.
