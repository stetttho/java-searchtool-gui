 Having read both of Morris' TR works first, I decided to ignore my friends' advice and go for "Dutch." I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised.  Morris CLEARLY knows his subject, having been 'appointed' official biographer by President Reagan himself. His exhaustive scholarly research could only have added to his intimate relationship with the man, and it reflects well in the text. One could argue that Morris took such literary liberties with his writing style BECAUSE he was so confident of his knowledge of Ronald Reagan.  To those who disqualify the entire work on the grounds that Morris inserted himself as a fictional character, I think your criticisms are a bit excessive. Morris makes clear where fact ends and fiction begins (oddly enough with ying-yang symbols). I don't think there is a biographer out there who has told the whole truth - they've either overstressed certain aspects of their subject's life, or left others out entirely. If anything, Morris' "Dutch" is an admission by the author of a biographer's inability to tell the whole truth no matter how hard he tries.  That having been said, I do have criticisms of the biographical work itself. Morris spends hundreds of pages detailing Reagan's rise to fame and power as an actor and president of the SAG. While interesting, this part of his life received excessive attention, especially when one reads the two or three pages that Morris devotes to the period between Reagan's defeat in '76 and victory in '80. I was especially curious as to how Reagan stayed "in the game" during this period, and was consequently rather disappointed.  Overall, a great biography, and an interesting way of delivering it.
