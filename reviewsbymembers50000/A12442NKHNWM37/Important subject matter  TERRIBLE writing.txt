 Having read the Nixon biographical trilogy, which was amazing, I thought I'd explore some of Ambrose's other works. As a lover of American history, I started with "The Wild Blue." I was completely disappointed.  The book reads like it was written in an afternoon. While the research that went into it was exhaustive (extensive interviews with veterans, personal letters and correspondence, etc.), it was very poorly synthesized. The sentences are short, choppy, and annoyingly repetitive.  To be honest, I read this book AFTER Ambrose's plagiarism controversy broke, so perhaps I am a bit biased. Plagiarism or not, the writing was awful, which is shocking because of my own personal experiences with Ambrose's works as well as his reputation for excellent historical writing.  It is a shame that this book was written so poorly, because its subject matter is so important, especially to patriotic Americans like myself who have nothing but the highest respect for our veterans of all our wars.
