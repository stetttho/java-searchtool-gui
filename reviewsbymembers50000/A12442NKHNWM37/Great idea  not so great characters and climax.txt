 "First Counsel" is the first book of Meltzer's that I have read, and my first foray into fiction in a while.  Meltzer's central plot is very unique, albeit somewhat nonbelievable. The central character Michael falls for First Daughter Nora and, on their first date, gets caught up in an initially harmless scandal that immediately spirals out of control, ultimately involving several peripheral characters, none of which are developed adequately.  In the trade-off of an action-packed plot and human characters to whom the reader could relate, Meltzer clearly chose the plot. This isn't necessarily a bad thing - I couldn't put the book down - but it makes the climax all the more important, and here too I think Meltzer's efforts were sub-par.  The ending has all the qualities of a soap opera. While it was definitely a surprise, it had the feel of a cheesy made-for-TV mystery movie. Again, the momentum of the plot, which was great, came to a crashing halt at the climax, rather than a satisfying resolution. All the conspiracies, ins, and outs of the plot prove pointless in the end, which was disappointing, as it was really interesting until the end...  Maybe I just haven't read fiction in a while...
