 This collection of some of Reagan's pre-presidential writing is truly amazing - the man was clearly a visionary who, to a great extent, implemented many of his plans to rebuild America in the eight years he was President. The strength of his ideas, his uncanny ability to pick apart the arguments of the Left, and his fantastic senses of humor and timing made his writings great.  That having been said, I found the book to be a bit disappointing on the part of the editors. I fail to see any reason at all why words, sentences, and occasionally even paragraphs that Reagan crossed out are included in his writings. At best, these cross-outs are annoying; at worst, they greatly disturb the flow of the book as a whole. I suppose if you were using it to scrutinze Reagan's views on a particular issue, these cross-outs may aid in following his thought process and how he wrestled with an issue, but they make the book as a whole choppy.  I also fail to understand why the editors included pages and pages that actually pictured the hand-written radio addresses Reagan used (immediately following those very same writings within the text of the book!). While it would have been interesting to see ONE page of Reagan's actual writing for the sake of seeing his hand-writing, I think it was a gross waste of space and resources to include many pages of it. Again, including these pages only slows down the flow of the book as a whole. Someone interested in savoring each and every word Reagan has written in the original (including cross-outs!) would probably enjoy such inclusions.  Overall, Reagan's work is phenomenal. It's the editors' work that is not so much.
