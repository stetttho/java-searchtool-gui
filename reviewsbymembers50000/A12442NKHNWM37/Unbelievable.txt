 Morris' first installment in the epic life of Teddy Roosevelt is the greatest biography I have ever read. His attention to detail, beautiful writing style, and commitment to his subject are amazing. His finest quality; however, is his ability to weave the countless anecdotes of TR's youth and rise to the Presidency into the larger framework of late 19th and early 20th century American history.  In terms of research, Morris' study of Roosevelt is of monumental proportions. Personal correspondence, diaries, letters, public papers, books by Roosevelt, and books about Roosevelt all form the sea of sources that Morris successfully and impressively navigated.  I'm very happy that, like so many other people, I waited to read 'Rise of TR' after 'Theodore Rex' was published, as I don't think I would have been able to wait to continue reading Morris' account of this amazing man's life and accomplishments.
