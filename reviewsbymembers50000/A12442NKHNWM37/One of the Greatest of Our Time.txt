 James Dickey's "Deliverance" is one of the great works of late twentieth Century American literature. It combines the excitement of the modern novel with the symbolism of the classics. I find Dickey's masterpiece to be strikingly similar to Conrad's "Heart of Darkness," another favorite of mine from a very different time and place. Superficially, the plots of the two are almost identical - a journey down (or up) an uncharted river, a questionable, even unknown destination, confrontation with "natives," a descent into madness, and an escape that changes the main character forever. Both give a frightening insight into the darker sides of the human psyche.  I first read "Deliverance" in high school some years ago, and I recently dusted it off for a long train ride. I can't recommend it enough.
