 This book is my first on the subject of state and local campaigning. I found the advice very well organized and very useful. Beaudry and Schaeffer provide insightful information on organizing a campaign in general, collecting funds, recruiting volunteers, targetting specific voters, and forming an effective staff.  My only criticism of the book is that it seems a bit dated. While it was published in 1998, it literally makes no mention of the Internet and its potential for local campaigning. Perhaps the authors considered it irrelevant, but my little experience with recent local elections suggests otherwise.  As someone who intends to make a first run for local public office in the next few years, I found the book to be a great primer for learning the many intricacies of organizing a campaign. It is a useful tool for pursuing books on the specifics that Beaudry and Schaeffer outline in their work.
