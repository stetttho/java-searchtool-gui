 As a big fan of Begala and Carville as talented, intelligent political insiders (although definitely not of their political persuasions), I read this book knowing that it would be more than the standard "be-confident-never-give-up-learn-how-to-spin" self-help book that the title suggests. I was not disappointed. What makes the book better than the rest are the great anecdotes that Carville and Begala have acquired in their many years of successful campaigning and dealing with the media.  Frankly, I feel bad for anyone who would buy this book hoping to learn the secret to winning elections. The advice itself is the standard stuff you'd hear from any political insider or honest politician. It's the way in which it's told that makes this book an interesting collection of creative one-liners and entertaining stories.  I definitely recommend this book - just don't take it too seriously.
