 This is one of the most amateurish, disappointing books I have ever read. I won't devote more than a few sentences to it because it was a HUGE waste of time to read. How someone can devote an entire book to how anger drives American voters and fail to mention George Wallace (except once, in passing) is beyond me.  This book is essentially a platform for the author to express her own political views. If you're interested in the topic, read E.J. Dionne's "Why Americans Hate Politics." Although Dionne flagrantly displays his own political views throughout, at least it reads like it was written in more than an afternoon.
