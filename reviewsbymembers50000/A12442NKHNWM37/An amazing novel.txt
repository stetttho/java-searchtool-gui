 Golding's "Lord of the Flies" is among the finest literary works of the twentieth century. Comparable to Conrad's "Heart of Darkness," it gives the reader a glimpse into the dark side of human nature. Golding's novel is perhaps even more frightening than Conrad's, in that he uses children characters to accomplish this. No other literary work rouses the same seemingly contradictory feelings as this one - at the same time an animosity towards the snobbish civilization that bred the marooned boys and a yearning for the return of its constrictive, protective norms. An admiration of the instinctive ability of the children to pursue their needs for food, leadership, and rescue and a revulsion at what these needs become.  These and the countless other emotions raised by Golding's novel make it one the most revealing, and consequently chilling, of our time.
