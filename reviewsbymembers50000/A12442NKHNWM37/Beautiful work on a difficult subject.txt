 Having seen the movie and heard that the book is quite different, I read Nasar's biography of John Nash with great curiosity. I think it is among the finest biographies I have ever read, not least because Nash is perhaps one of the most difficult people about whom one could write for so many reasons.  From his humble beginnings in West Virginia, to the controversy and anxiety that surrounded his winning the Nobel Prize, Nasar clearly conducted back-breaking research on her subject, which paid off immensely. Her study of Nash is comprehensive, interesting, and very fair. The background research that she must have conducted in game theory, mental illnesses, mathematics, and academia in general must have been exhausting, as it is reflected beautifully in her work.  While I agree with many of the previous reviewers in their claim that Nash wasn't the nicest guy in the world, I don't see why that's any reason to fault Nasar- who, if anything, deserves even GREATER praise for not being biased by this troubled man's accomplishments. She effectively conveys the many, many sides of Nash's personal life, illness, recovery, and redemption.  I definitely recommend it to anyone, especially to someone who's already seen the movie.
