 This album took 2 years to grow on me! Boy am I happy I gave it a chance. I bought this shortly after hearing the single of  Barely Breathing. I heard that song, and was  sure I would love the album. Didn't happen quite like that.  I took it home, and could only listen to two tracks ("Barely Breathing", and "She runs away"; another single). I  was very disappointed. To me the album isn't like the singles at all; which isn't a bad thing. It took a long time for me to listen to it without saying "Who am I kidding? This is awful!". Now I sit, and listen in admiration.  This album is on my top 50 list of CD's(which is a very good list to be on). I would definitely recommend it. If you don't like it at  first...give it time. ;) fatti.
