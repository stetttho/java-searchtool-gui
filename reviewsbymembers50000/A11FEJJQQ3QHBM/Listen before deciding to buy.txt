 I bought this album after being BLOWN AWAY by Vol. 1. I have to say...I wasn't all that impressed.  This isn't a bad album, but it isn't nearly as good as Vol. 1. All the songs sound the same to me, and I wasn't diggin' most of the lyrics. I felt as if he just put this together because he needed a Vol 2. There wasn't as much detail, and focus like Vol. 1. had.  All in all I'm still happy with my purchase.  I would recommend listening to this album before deciding on the purchase. Thanks fatti
