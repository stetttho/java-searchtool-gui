 I heard a couple of songs off of this album in a friends car (Stupify, Down with the Sickness), and I was lovin it. The songs were repetitive, just like the whole album, but they were very fun to listen to.  I would hardly call this a band with amazing lyrics, inventiveness, innovation, and/or range. They are just another Hard Rock (or any other genre they fit in) band. They are not an awful band at all, but they are nothing too special. Youve heard it all before minus this particular gimmick. They, to me, are most certainly a gimmick band. They have that sickness theme, and it seems to be working really well for them. EVERY song somehow relates to how sick the band is. Here are some excerpts from a few songs: I can see inside you, the sickness is rising. Don't try to deny what you feel(Will you give it to me?) ~Down With The Sickness Someone is gonna die when you listen to me. Let the living die, Let the living die ~Voices Bring the violence. It's significant. To the life. Can you feel it? Oh Ow OW! ~Violence Fetish Fear awaken go with it now and let it overcome you. Fear awaken your mind is racing ~Fear Well fear this, Cause I'm breakin' through the walls of your nightmare. Wake up time to die ~Droppin Plates I dont discourage the purchase, but just dont expect anything monumental. This is just one of those albums you can pop in anytime. This album most likely will not expose you to anything new, or thought provoking.  I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoyed the singles! Thanks. fatti
