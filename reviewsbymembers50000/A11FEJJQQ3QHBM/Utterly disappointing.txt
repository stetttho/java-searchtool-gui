 I didn't buy this album...it was given to me buy a huge fan of music.  I was planning to make the purchase, but my friend saved me from wasting the money! I have never heard such a repetitive album before. Repetitive lyrically. I truly expected a lot more from Mark lyrically. I found this album was just an exaggerated version of whining rock that we hear on the radio everyday.  Every song is referencing his drug and alcohol habits, lack of friends, feelings of constant loneliness, and torment he experienced in high school. All the songs seem to be soiled in feelings of self-loathing, and anger at others. As a huge Korn fan, I can appreciate those raw feelings, but I can't appreciate the commercial effort behind it. It seems the band figured they could make an entire album with the foundation of one Korn song- f*get. If you are familiar with that particular song, you may be able to get a good idea of how Korn Kloned they sound.  The radio release, Giving In, is by far the best song on the album. If you didn't like it there is a great chance this album isn't for you. Instrumentally, I feel the band is very strong. I would buy an instrumental version of the album in a heartbeat. The lyrics are the downfall of this band. The two stars are only there for the bands instrumental efforts; unfortunately, it can't carry the band entirely. If you like a lot of the Nu Metal out there, and rock that seems to be more on the side of unconstructive criticism/self loathing this album wouldn't be a bad selection. If you don't really concern yourself with lyrical content and really enjoy bands that are strong instrumentally, you will probably love this! Thanks. fatti
