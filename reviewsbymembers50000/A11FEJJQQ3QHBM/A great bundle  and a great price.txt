 I recently purchased this HP bundle, and I'm really blown away by wonderful this whole bundle was. I've never been a fan of HP products, but I must admit that they really won me over with this one.  The camera captures such beautiful and clear images. The camera also has many, many options such as several modes (like action, portrait, and landscape), it can record MPEGS, and has up to 15x zoom (3x optical, 5x digital). The zoom is really impressive. The quality of the MPEGS are really great too. You just plug the camera up to the printer or computer, and you are looking at some great stuff!  The printer was really impressive as well. With this printer, I feel like I never need to get my photos developed again (professionally). The 4x6 quality is really great. The printer is quick, quiet, and accurate.  The memory card holds a lot of pics and MPEGs to my surprise. I can't say how many because we haven't filled it up yet, but it's really a great size (especially for a starter).  This is the best and most complete set in digital imaging (in my opinion). When you buy this, you really don't need anything else. You have the memory, paper, batteries, and cables. Nothing else needed really. I've seen other bundles for less money, but none of them had as much as this one has. This one is far superior. The printer and camera are also very user friendly. Just plug and play without the need of any direction. Very, very user friendly. This would be a great buy for anyone, and it would also make the ultimate gift. I'm honestly thinking about getting a second one of these. That's how much I love it! fatti
