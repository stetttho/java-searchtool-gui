 It's something else. This band never ceases to amaze me; never ceases to impress me.  I didn't hear any tracks on this album before yesterday (when I bought it) so I was in for a pleasant surprise. If you haven't gotten it, get it. If you have it, you know what I'm saying. To me, this doesn't sound as 'radio friendly' as some tracks on Aenima were. But who cares really?  Definitely harder. Both vocally and instrumentally. Lyrically, this is exceptional as always.  No other band, in my opinion, pays so much attention to instruments quite like they. 9 and 10 minute songs that keep  your full attention every second of the song I definitely can't call tracks to reference (partly because I can't tell when one track stops, and another begins; I love that!), but it doesn't matter because the whole album is bangin'.  The art design of the album is really awesome as well.  They gain, and maintain my respect over and over again. Well that's my opinion of the new album. later. fatti
