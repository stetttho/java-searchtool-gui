 I didn't feel the thoughts in this book were well organized.  I read it within a few hours, and just felt like I wasted my time. I remember right after reading, I felt like I only got one thing from the book. The worst part is I don't even remember what that thing was now. Obviously, it was anything life changing. I really just thought it was a pointlessly long review on Jung, and his opinions. I didn't feel I understood Jung any better, nor did I feel like I got anything from the book at all. Although I know the writer must have worked hard on it, to me, the book just came across as random words put together. Maybe I was just expecting too much from such a small book. Who knows? I would not necessarily recommend it, nor would I discourage the read. It doesn't take much time at all to finish, so you might just get something out of it.
