 I was really excited about buying this album after I heard some of Black & White. Unfortunately, after purchasing this album, I found that Black & White is the only strong song on this album. I think Sarai is an artist with great potential to come out with an album that has some intriguing and charming lyrics, but this wasn't the one. It seems that from all of the tracks, with the exception of Black & White, she was trying to make sure the music was appealing to the public, appealing to the record label, and somehow fit along the lines of the type of music out there right now or that really gained great popularity. The key to being an "original" or innovative artist is to avoid the blueprint, and display your true colors- not the ones you think people will like. Honestly, from listening to this album that's the feel I got from it. She has an excellent flow and lyrics but the production was poor. The beats and hooks were extremely repetitive (the hooks especially). I was pretty disappointed about that. Sarai's lyrics are strong, and you can see potential for even stronger lyrics given the opportunity for her to search from within for the inspiration instead of the fiction she was clearly spitting about. I feel like I paid my money just to hear the last track, and I kind of feel like it was worth it. If she does come out with another album, I'd still buy it. Just remember other artists who showed their true colors and writing skills after the first album. Not every album will be an Illmatic I'd recommend this album to anyone interested in hearing something new in Hip-Hop, but if you are looking for an album that is strong lyrically and a unique beat this may not be the album for you. fatti
