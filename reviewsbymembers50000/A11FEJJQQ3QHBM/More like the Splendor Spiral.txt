 This album, in my book, officially made Trent Reznor the god of Industrial music. Yes, Industrial has been around, but who else has been so creative with it? One of my favorite qualities of the album is how incredibly hard it is. Even with songs that are piano based, and with a supposed quite tone (compared to the other NIN songs) they prove to be harder than the Metal we hear today. The lyrics are piercing. Trent Reznor is, to me, not often recognized for his amazing lyrical ability. With songs like "Heresy", "Piggy", and "March of Pigs" it's hard to ignore the amount of musical talent and creativity Trent possesses (let alone lyrical ability). "I Do Not Want This" could be considered a "soft" song (mainly because the emphasized piano/keyboard, and the fact the Trent sings more that he screams), but it is one of the hardest tracks on the album. I also enjoy the vivacious use of drums on this song. He really marries the keyboard, and drums on this track. I would recommend this album to anyone that likes Industrial, Metal, or Tool. Or to anyone that is very open minded about music (aka. A true music lover).  Thanks. fatti.
