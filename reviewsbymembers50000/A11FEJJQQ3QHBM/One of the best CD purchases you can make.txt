 Da Bomb Album...to put it simply. This album is somewhat short, but it's a sweet joint. My friend bought this album because they were Shoutweb's  band of the week. I just listened to his copy for a couple of tracks, and I was HOOKED! All I wanted to do was listen to Endo. They are definitely Nu Metal, but with an AWESOME rhythmic spice. Lyrically and instrumentally this band has got it goin' on! I haven't been so happy with a CD purchase in a long time. They are shockingly good for such a new band. I recommend this to everyone! Hip Hop Heads, Metal Heads, Pop  Junkies; if you listen to music you will most likely love it. I have let a lot of people listen to it, and everyone jumped right into it. They were hooked instantly; it's very easy to get into. "Let it go..." fatti
