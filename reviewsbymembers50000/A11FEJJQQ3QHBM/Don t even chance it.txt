 All that glitters isn't always gold!  I purchased this item for 80 bucks at the local Fry's store excited to get such a deal. 80 bucks for 2.2gigs of storage is an awesome deal. Little did I know - I was paying 80 bucks for one time storage, and a trip back to Fry's for the return.  This storage drive "worked" (using that term very loosely) for 5 or 6 days, and I had to return it. The problems began the day after purchase when I started receiving errors when I connected it to my PC. I received errors stating there was a critical error with my USB device or that the USB device couldn't be located. One in every 5 attempts was successfully. I had a flash drive for a year before this with no problems at all so this came as a big shock to me.  When this item went on sale I purchased it along with three other people. All of use had to return in before 7 days. That's no coincidence.  You may purchase the one USB drive out there by Emprex that is functional, but my suggestion is that you don't even chance it.  Stick with flash!  fatti
