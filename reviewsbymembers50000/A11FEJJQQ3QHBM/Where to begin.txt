 This album(just like every other Tool album) is brilliant, amazing, breath taking, beautiful, and all the other ways to describe indescribably beautiful things. This album gets into me big time. Every track calls, and maintains your attention for 9, 10, 15-minute tracks. Most band's longer tracks are like 4-5 minutes. For Tool that would be one of the shorter ones. No band pays attention to instruments like this one.  I would absolutely recommend this album to any and everyone. They just can't be denied.  fatti
