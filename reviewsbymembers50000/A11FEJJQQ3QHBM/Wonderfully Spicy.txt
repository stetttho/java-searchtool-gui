 This is such a fun album. I love all the tid bits they include about individuality, girl power, and believing in yourself. A wonderful album for anyone. I am typically a fan of Tri State Hardcore, Metal, Hip Hop, and Jazz...not your typical Spice Girls fan, but I do think this is a WONDERFUL album.  Thanks. fatti
