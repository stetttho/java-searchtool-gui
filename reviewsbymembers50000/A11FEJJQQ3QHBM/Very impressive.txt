 This album is in my "listenable" albums collection. This is something I can pop in anytime, anywhere. To my own surprise, there are many elements of this album that has me quite impressed.  I think this album is somewhat strong lyrically. There isn't that much mainstream (in this case- accessible) heretical music out there. Manson, Tool, and NIN were what were available for a short while. Even of those artists, they were scrutinized frequently because of their message/statement. Not every song speaks of godlessness and heresy, and those songs too have meaningful purpose.  Another thing about this band that keeps me smiling is their instrumental ability. They are Metal, but they also have this powerful rhythmic zest about them. In Tearing Away particularly you get a wonderful example of this bands capability when it comes to laying down a phat sound. Many bands have wonderful musicians, but they just don't sound well together. Drowning Pool is, to me, a prime example of a band working well collectively. They aren't the best metal band out there, but they do work well together. When they were holding down fort here in Dallas they had a very strong following, and rightfully so.  I would recommend this album to just about anyone. If you enjoyed their singles, enjoy metal, or are in any way into the Nu Metal scene then this album is probably for you! Thanks. fatti
