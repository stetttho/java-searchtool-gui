 I got a one-year subscription to Jane without reading a single page of it. I was reading so much ABOUT the magazine that I went online, and got the subscription before I made it to the newsstands. That was one of the best things I've ever done for my reading material. My Co-Workers always know once Jane came in because they hear me laughing so hard aloud from anywhere in the building.  Jane Pratt is a genius and that's all it comes down to. She has hired the wittiest, sharpest, and most eccentric writers there could ever be.  The stories range from online pedophiles (serious & informative) to rap video girls (the behind the scenes of it all) to reviews on different boxed macaroni dishes to Sex Addicts Anonymous to surveys on the best Fried Chicken joints and toothbrushes. To me, this magazine tries to promote self-acceptance/positive body image quite a bit, and I really respect them for it. They do articles on how to be "free" like men commonly are (teaches how to scratch, spit, and urinate in public), on loving your body, and one of my favorites are the make-unders. The celebrity interviews are great too. They also have a celebrity edition that has all kinds of celebrities writing the magazine. Jane is, by no means, a gender specific magazine. It gives awesome insight for both genders. It's very informative on really awesome topics.  Jane is definitely my favorite magazine. I waste no time when it comes to renewing my two-year subscriptions. When it's my Jane time of the month, I eye mailbox constantly. Jane is read cover to cover the day I get it! Don't waste anytime...get the magazine! Thanks. fatti
