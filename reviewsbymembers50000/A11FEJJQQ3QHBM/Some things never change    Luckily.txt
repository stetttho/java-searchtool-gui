 As a HUGE Korn fan, I thought this album would have no chance against their earlier work. Just as always, this band chose to use this as an opportunity to be more innovative than ever by using their great lyrical and instrumental talent.  Instead of monotony, we got variance. With meaningful songs like "Justin", rhythmically catchy like "Seed, Celtic sounds of "My gift to you", Hardcore/Rapcore dual attack with Ice Cube- "Children of the Korn", Duo with Fred Durst in true battle rap style spawned "All in the Family", and the duet with Hip Hop King Tre "Slimkid" Hardson formerly of The Pharcyde that conceived "Cameltosis" this album just can't go wrong. There was something about the instrumentally quality of the album that I can't get enough of. Heavier riffs, and stronger bass lines reign on this album. Korn fan or not, I would highly suggest this album to everyone.  Thanks. fatti
