 This is the album that made me really enjoy Ice Cube's style. I never liked Ice Cube when Predator & Lethal came out. I didn't like his lyrics, or style. When I heard the joint he did with my boys from Korn I was REALLY impressed. I knew I had to get on this tip! I bought the album, and was like..."I didn't know he could flow like that!" If I could get into it...anyone can! I would recommend this album to EVERYONE. Hip Hop head, Metal head, whatever. Worth every dollar. Thanks fatti
