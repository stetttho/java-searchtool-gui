 I bought this album after seeing Linkin Park was Shoutweb's band of the week. I don't necessarily regret buying it, but it would be better off burned. The band is the SH*T except one for one thing. They have a weak link, and his name is Chester Bennington. The kid has gotta go! Blonde boy sounds like a mix between the dude from Filter, and one dude from Savage Garden. I don't know what's up with these 'dual attack' rapcore bands, but it's not working.  They get one MC, and singer.  I personally don't like the combo. I like the way Shuvel has two MC's; they have a tight  combination(unfortunately they have weak lyrics for the  most part, but that's another review). I would listen to it completely before deciding to spend that scrilla. If you decide not to go for it let me recommend E Town Concrete's Second Coming or Time 2 Shine. Rap Metal at it's finest! later kiddos. fatti
