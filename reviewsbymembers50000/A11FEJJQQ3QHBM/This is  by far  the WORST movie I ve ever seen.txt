 This movie deserves no stars. I just finished watching this movie about five minutes ago, and couldn't feel anymore foolish for renting it. I can't believe I spent my money and time watching this movie. I wish I could go back to the video store and return in. As far as the story goes...there is no story. I mean, I verbally announced every scene of this movie before it happened. It was all so obvious. There was nothing original about this at all. Not only was it not innovative, but it was very predictable. The acting was terrible. I honestly can't tell if it was the acting that was so bad or the script. I think it's a heavy mixture of both. There was no direction at all. It's like they gave the actors this lame script and told them to go with it. It looked like it could have been filmed in one day. Editing and all. It was pathetic and a disservice to all who sat through it. The camera angles were really bad. I mean bad. It was somewhat distracting as well. Overall, this was the worst movie I've ever seen. I can't believe I picked this up. I have no clue what I was thinking. I guess I thought a Nick Stahl and Eddie Kaye Thomas movie couldn't steer me wrong, but I really had that wrong. I'm sure all of the actors that participated in it would rather forget that they did. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone at all. fatti
