 I reviewed this album a few months back, and I gave it four stars. I just wanted to do a follow up review, and explain why I have now changed that rating to five glorious stars! Originally the only complaint I had about this album was the lyrics. I felt they were too weak, and not well thought out. I now feel completely different. There are still weak points in this album, but the sweet lyrics have outweighed the weak ones. This album, as I felt before, is amazing instrumentally. They really have their stuff together (especially for such a new band). Lyrically I now think they are up to par. I realized they have more amazing lyrical moments than I originally thought. This is by far my favorite album to listen to when I get in the car (anytime really). It is incredibly easy to get into.  The dual attack is a VERY necessary component for this band. They have so much to say, and it really does take two sharp emcees to do it! If you really sit and listen to what they are saying you might find that it is VERY easy to relate. I have noticed that most people that like Rap Rock/Rap Core really like Shuvel. I'm not into bands like Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park, but I love this band. Most metal heads, and Pop junkies might not like it, but they are definitely worth listening to. This is definitely a tight joint; check it out! Thanks fatti
