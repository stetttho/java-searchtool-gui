 This album is the most recent album purchase for me. I don't normally buy Pop albums, but I did this time.  When I heard "He loves you not" I fell hard for the song. Then I heard the second single "This is me", and I knew I would like the album. I was still very nervous about buying it (I hate a bad CD buy) simply because of my bad experiences with other Pop albums. My best bud loved the album, and thought I would too. She couldn't have been any more correct! I listened to this album NON-STOP. Surprisingly the two singles aren't even NEARLY their best songs. The songs aren't all like the singles. They have different kinds of songs throughout the album. Soulful, poppie, sentimental, and more. With songs like "When I get there", "What we gonna do about us"(It has a soulful SWV sound to it), and "Mr. Telephone Man" (New Edition cover) you've got a winning album! If you've been thinking about getting this album just go ahead and do it! If you liked the singles you will LOVE the album.  Thanks. fatti
