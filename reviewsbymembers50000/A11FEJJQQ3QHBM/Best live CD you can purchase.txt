 This album is INCREDIBLE. This is coming from a person that can't stand live albums. I was quite impressed by the sound quality, and crowd interaction. My favorite part of this album is the fact that it introduced me to so many different artists. I wasn't into Incubus, Orgy, or Ice Cube; now I have every CD of all those bands. I was really impressed at the live performances. Having missed the tour I DEFINITELY had to get the album. I'm a HUGE Korn fan so that is the reason why I got this, but in all honesty I listen to the other bands more than I do the Korn tracks. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys any of these bands: Korn, Limp Bizkit, Ice Cube, Incubus, or Orgy Ramstein Thanks fatti
