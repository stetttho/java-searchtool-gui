 There is something about them... I got the album a couple of months ago, shortly after seeing the last few seconds of the Set It Off video, and I have to say I really enjoyed it. I was expecting more from the album than what I originally got, but they eventually made up for it. The dual attack on the mic thing is awesome, but they are still kind of weak on the mic. Don't get me wrong...they do have their moments. In the mist of all that ... they will bust out with some [stuff] that'll knock you out of [your] seat. They know how to come correct like that.  Dispite that I still think they are one of the best Rapcore bands I have ever heard.  They are everything instrumentally. This is the best first album I have ever heard(instumentally) since Korn's first gig.  These boys look so young, but the are coming strong with a grown sound. There guitarist, drummer, and bassist are off the hook. Every songs demands attention instrumentally. Unlike bands like Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit...Shuvel has no weak link. They all work together to make a bangin' sound; to represent. A lot of people that like bands like Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit really like shuvel. I'm not a fan of either of those bands, but I still think it's off the hook. If you like Hardcore or Rapcore at all I think you would enjoy this album. It you are a true Metal head this may or may not be for you.  Although I think they have room for improvement I still recommend this album to everyone. ;) Thanks. fatti
