 (...)This book means more to me than any other I've ever read.(...) Judith Hayes, now my favorite author, makes this one of the easiest read due to it's wit, sharpness, and non-repetitiveness. This book can be read in a sitting quite easily, just because it's so hard to put down. I have never read a book that had me going through so many different emotions.

This book, in the most uproarious and effortless way, presents the facts without trying to coerce you into believing on thing or another. All she seems to ask is for you to think about.  I really enjoyed the examples of a humanists reaction to pretty difficult (and joyous) situations that she has in one of the chapters. (...)
