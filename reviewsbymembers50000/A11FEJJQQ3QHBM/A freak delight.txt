 Great album! It has a lot of cool tid bits about being straight edge. This was my favorite album ALL throughout high school. These kids were so young when they made this; it is quite impressive. I would recommend this album to anyone into Rock/Alternative. I don't think Metal heads, or Hardcore kids will enjoy this one too much. I think you really have to enjoy Alternative music to get into this...which I used to. Thanks fatti
