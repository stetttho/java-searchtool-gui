 Most seem to deem Korn a Rapcore/Rap Metal band. Korn/Chino (Deftones) covered a Rap song on their second album (Life is Peachy), and didn't collaborate with any artists of the Hip Hop world until their third album (Follow the Leader). They really aren't a Rapcore band, but they are the band that set off all of the Korn Klones we see today (Papa Roach, Linkin Park, Adema, Disturbed, etc.)  This album was a much-needed change for Rock. This album made it okay to have real emotions, it made it okay to vent, it made it okay to not use the standard blueprint for a rock album. Jonathan Davis cries on the album, and NO ONE is questioning his masculinity. They don't beat around the bush on this album. They get straight to the point, and they come correct.  Lyrically, this album is my favorite. Not only can I relate to many of the songs, but also I can really understand where Jon is coming from on the others. As with most first albums for Rock artists, this album is the most raw lyrically. I quote parts from this album in just casual conversation because they album really targets the extreme and everyday issues.  F*get is one of my favorite songs on this album. It really proved how mutable rock is, and how there is no one-way to rock out. He goes from quiet vocals to heavy rants; it's beautiful.  In Helmet in the Bush, we get a preview at what will later be Jon's trademark...rambling grunt.  Instrumentally, it's quite pleasing to the ears. Although they were a new band, they were still very powerful and should be quite proud of it today. The most memorable tracks (instrumentally) are Blind, F*get, and Clown. If you mention the track Clown or Blind to most Korn fans, they will mimic those unforgettable riffs without cue.  I really think this album raised the bar for Rock. It didn't set new rules; it just broke the old ones. In my eyes, this is one of the best Rock albums out there. I would recommend this album to everyone.  Thanks. fatti
