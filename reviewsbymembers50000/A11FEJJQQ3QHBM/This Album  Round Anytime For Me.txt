 Before buying this CD, I had my very first taste of Ella when I bought The Best of Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong. That album took my breath away, and I couldn't wait to get my paws on more Ella filled albums.   This album was a lovely change of pace for me. It was also an opportunity to get a better feel of Ella's range musically. I loved the slow ballads, serious, and more playful songs.  I think this album is very easy to get into and love, especially if you are already a fan of Jazz.
