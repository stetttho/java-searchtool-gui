 This album gives the best variety of E Town. You get the opportunity to hear Jazz, Metal, Hip Hop, and other genres. Just listen, and they will come! It's hard to believe how young these men are. They have such a grown sound. They definitely hit you hard with their wisdom, and experience. You will see another side to life after listening to them. If you were already exposed to that side it's refreshing to know you have someone to relate to.  I don't have a favorite song, but there is one that hits close to home. A "Father's Marathon" hits me like a brick. So many fatherless children will be able to relate to this song "Keep, Keep, Keep, Keep, Keep runnin' runnin'. I'm supposed to be the sun in your sky. The one that you would die, for lie. Live it, and lay it on the line for." "You're not a man cause men don't run!" "I spent 19 years without you. learned to fight without you, play catch without you." Those kinds of lyrics are breath taking because they are so true.  If there is a true genre such as Rap Metal...E Town is the exact definition of it.  They have an awesome MC/lyricist, Anthony Martini, on the mic with an awesome metal attack in the back. The guitarist, Delux Mondragon, pays so much attention to detail. You feel every chord he hits. They are one of few bands that keep all of their instruments vibrant. You can hear and feel each instrument individually. Their drummer, Teddy P., knows his stuff. He keeps really nice and attention getting beats on each song. Bass player, Eric DeNault, keeps it coming as well. His sound can't be denied. I'm just talking instruments. I haven't even gone into the lyrical geniuses in this band!  I would HIGHLY recommend this album to anyone. If you are looking for something original, eclectic, intelligent, and creative this is it! Together this band is one of the greatest forces the Metal, Hip Hop, and other genres will ever see.  They're taken over...guaranteed. ;) Thanks. fatti
