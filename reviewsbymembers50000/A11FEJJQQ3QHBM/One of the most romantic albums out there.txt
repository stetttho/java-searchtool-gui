 I am so happy I purchased this album.  I have always liked Ella, but was very new to Louis. Talk about a chick being pleased. When I listen to it I'm in my own heaven.  I want some of those songs to be played at my wedding...if that happens. ;) Ella's voice is so comforting and inviting. Louis has such a  reassuring, lovely male voice. Together they are a bangin' combo. In my opinion they are probably the best musical duo in history. I would recommend this album to any, and everyone.  Thanks fatti
