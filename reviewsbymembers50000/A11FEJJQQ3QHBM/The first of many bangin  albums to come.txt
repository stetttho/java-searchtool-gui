 All I can say is I love this band!!! This, among the other two, is just another addition to E Town's non stop force. They are the kind of band that just can't be denied.  This album has heavy lyrics, and I love that. It was has some really sweet guitar parts/solos. I don't think everyone was ready for the sounds they brought...  It's hard for true fans of E Town to select a favorite album let alone song. If there is a true genre such as rap metal...E Town is the exact defintion of it.  They have an awesome MC/lyricist, Anthony Martini, on the mic with an awesome metal attack in the back. The guitarist, Delux Mondragon, pays so much attention to detail. You feel every chord he hits. They are one of few bands that keep all of their instruments vibrant. You can hear and feel each instrument individually. Their drummer, Teddy P., knows his stuff. He keeps really nice and attention getting beats on each song. Bass player, Eric DeNault, keeps it coming as well. His sound can't be denied. I'm just talking instruments. I haven't even gone into the lyrical geniuses in this band! Together this band is one of the greatest forces the Metal, Hip Hop, and other genres will ever see. They're taken over...guaranteed. ;)
