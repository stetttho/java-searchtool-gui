 BOB WELCH-GREATEST HITS: Bob Welch represented the musical bridge betwixt Fleetwood Mac's Peter Green-helmed blues saturated beginnings and the snappy, crackly pop of the Lindsey Buckingham mega-years. Best remembered for the Big Mac groove-happy classic HYPNOTIZED and the aching SENTIMENTAL LADY (covered to great effect here with vocal colorization from Christine McVie), the singer/guitarist scored straight out of the solo chute via the album FRENCH KISS.  That dandy debut  boasted not only the smash FM remake, but subsequent hits EBONY EYES (not the Everly Brothers chestnut) and the infectious HOT LOVE, COLD WORLD as well. Later albums yielded diminishing returns, though the irresistably catchy THREE HEARTS, DON'T RUSH THE GOOD THINGS' funky pulse, and the Top 40 shoe-in PRECIOUS LOVE remain highlights. Welch may be a "Where Are They Now" candidate these days, but this much too breif GREATEST HITS showcases an artist with integrity, charm and pop chops to spare. RATING: THREE HEARTS
