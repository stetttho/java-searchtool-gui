 Few seventies groups scored as many consistently worthy AM radio chestnuts as Three Dog Night.  Fewer still are represented by a "greatest hits" offering this comprehensive and enjoyable. Perhaps this is because no rock era act utilized as many top notch (though often unknown at the time) songwriters as 3DN. Paul Williams (OLD FASHIONED LOVE SONG and two other hits), Leo Sayre (THE SHOW MUST GO ON), Randy Newman (MAMA TOLD ME NOT TO COME), Laura Nyro (ELI'S COMING), John Hiatt (SURE AS I'M SITTIN' HERE), Russ Ballard (LIAR), Nilsson (ONE), Allen Toussaint (PLAY SOMETHING SWEET), Dave Loggins (PIECES OF APRIL), and of course, Hoyt Axton (NEVER BEEN TO SPAIN and JOY TO THE WORLD) all benefitted from being covered. Of course, great songs ain't nothin' without great singers; Danny Hutton and particularly Cory Wells and Chuck Negron all had gospel/soul/rock chops to spare. Much of their music has scarcely aged, let alone stagnated, three decades after the fact. This compilation is twenty tracks long and nary (you should pardon the expression) a "dog" among them. RATING: FIVE GOLDEN BISCUITS
