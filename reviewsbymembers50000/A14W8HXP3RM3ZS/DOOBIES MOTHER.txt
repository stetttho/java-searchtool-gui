 This early career retrospective was mostly Tom Johnston's baby, as was the Doobie Brothers band itself, until blue eyed soul man Michael McDonald took over the reins (he dominates the vastly inferior second "best of" set). Johnston wrote, sang gritty lead, and played guitar on the quintessential "China Grove" and "Listen to the Music", biker anthem "Rockin' Down the Highway", and "Long Train Runnin'" (known to most as something along the lines of "Without Love-Where Would You Be Now"). Toss in a couple of country tunes from Pat Simmons (including "Black Water") and just enough McDonald so that his fans won't feel cheated, and you truly have "The Best of the Doobies". Just the thing for "Rockin' Down the Highway"!
