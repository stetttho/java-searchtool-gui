 EDGAR WINTER-ANTHOLOGY: As a quickie introduction to blooze/jazz/rock albino maestro Edgar Winter, this is servicable, though you will have to endure quickie versions of three of his best loved numbers. Classic rock staples FRANKENSTEIN and FREE RIDE appear in their AM single lengths, and the truly legendary White Trash reconfiguration of TOBACCO ROAD (originally a near twenty minute jam of RNB nirvana) is similarly castrated to radio-ready limits, losing three quarters of its impact and span in the process. On the plus side, two Dan Hartman-sung near hits, RIVER'S RISIN' and HANGIN' AROUND, are decent successors to his better known FREE RIDE, and Edgar keeps the blooze rollin' on the free n' funky EASY STREET and the frenetic CAN'T TURN YOU LOOSE (howled in the best Otis Redding tradition by White Trash's leather-lunged Jerry LaCroix). As another Winter anthem suggests, in lieu of the longer, more comprehensive EDGAR WINTER COLLECTION, this budget ANTHOLOGY ain't a bad way to KEEP PLAYIN' THAT ROCK 'N ROLL. RATING: THREE FUNKY WHITE BOYS
