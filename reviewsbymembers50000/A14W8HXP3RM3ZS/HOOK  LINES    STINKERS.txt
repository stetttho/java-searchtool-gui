 This is not the same Dr. Hook that, after dropping "and the Medicine Show" from their name, did the biggest musical switcheroo since the Doobie Brothers acquired Michael McDonald. If you're lookin' for their disco-fied hits "When You're in Love With a Beautiful Woman" and "Baby Makes Her Blue Jeans Talk" (even those titles make me cringe), then click elsewhere. All ten tracks of trash on "Revisited" come from the demented pen of Shel Silverstein, who, besides composing left-of-center hit songs ("A Boy Named Sue", "The Unicorn", "Tequila Sheila"), also contributed article and cartoons for Playboy AND wrote classic children's books. The tune titles here tell the tawdry tale: "Acapulco Goldie", "Roland the Roadie and Gertrude the Groupie", "Freakin' at the Freaker's Ball" and more demented debauchery. Two numbers are even fondly remembered bona fide hits---the melancholy "Sylvia's Mother" and that odorous ode to fame n' fortune, "Cover of the Rolling Stone" (which actually DID get their ugly mugs on that rag). Sleazy songs, greasy instrumentation, and party-hearty vocals make this early greatest "hits" sound like Dr. Hook had just as much fun making it as I did listening to it. "Revisited" really oughta come with one of those little warning stickers found on other substances that are supposedly bad for you: CAUTION-Listening to this disc is infectious and may be hazardous to your health!  RATING:  FIVE YUKS
