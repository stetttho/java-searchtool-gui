 THE ULTIMATE ISLEY BROTHERS: Few single discs can offer such a credible, or even worthy summation of the Isley Brothers' multi-faceted, incalculably influential career, which is still going strong more than four decades after their first hit, the gospel rock frathouse anthem SHOUT. Nearly every phase pops up: their raw, early RNB successes (TWIST AND SHOUT)...soul/pop smashes (IT'S YOUR THING, WORK TO DO)...smooth interpretations of others' work (LOVE THE ONE YOU'RE WITH, SUMMER BREEZE)...funk-infested chart-stranglers...(THAT LADY, showcasing second generation Isley Brother Ernie's Hendrixian guitar bravado)...and slick, silky ballad work (BETWEEN THE SHEETS). Only their brief stay at Motown is omitted, where THIS OLD HEART OF MINE hit paydirt. Ronald Isley has one of the most intimate voices of anyone in the biz and songwriting chops to spare (just ask Michael Bolton). THE ULTIMATE ISLEY BROTHERS deserves a treasured spot in any serious minded pop, funk, or RNB fanatics' CD rack. RATING: FIVE SHOUTS
