 The BEST of Clapton?...PUH-LEEEEEEEEZE!!! This retch-rospective should be called "Time Feces". Where's "Let It Rain", one of his finest singles ever? What happened to "Bell Bottom Blues", "Tulsa Time" (I'm sure Don Williams put it on HIS greartest hits), "I Can't Stand It", "Blues Power", "Hello Old Friend", etc., etc., etc.??? Am I being picky here, or do any and all of these chestnuts not take precedence over pedestrian covers of "Knockin' On Heaven's Door" and (for cryin' out loud) "Swing Low Sweet Chariot"? To think that the compilers were choosing from one of Slowhand's best periods musically, long before he slid into soundtrack composing unconciousness. A far better compilation choice is the smartly titled "Cream of Clapton", which not only includes everything "Time Pieces" left off, but also everything decent it left on, including the original "Layla" and "After Midnight", his country classics "Lay Down Sally" and "Promises", and his "461 Ocean Boulevard" hit remakes "I Shot the Sheriff" and "Willie and the Hand Jive". It also throws in five Cream classics and one from Blind Faith. Now THAT'S the Cream of Clapton! This tastes more like curdled milk.  RATING:  TWO BAD
