 The Edgar Winter Group was what amounted to a "supergroup", even though nobody knew it at the time. Multi-instrumentalist albino frontman Winter had previously led the horn accentuated R&B outfit White Trash to critical and popular notice, notably on the live blues jamfest ROADWORK. Guitarist Ronnie Montrose---soon to be replaced by producer/axeman/former McCoy Rick Derringer, who'd tenured with both White Trash and Edgar's blues slingin' older bro Johnny---formed the popular hard rock act Montrose. Bassist/co-lead vocalist Dan Hartman went on to fame as a solo artist with charismatic smashes INSTANT REPLAY and I CAN DREAM ABOUT YOU, as well as writing and producing none other than James Brown's big 80s comeback hit LIVING IN AMERICA. Even drummer Chuck Ruff would eventually join up with ex-Montose singer Sammy Hagar. With all that talent in one lineup, small wonder THEY ONLY COME OUT AT NIGHT netted minor success HANGIN' AROUND, bigger hit FREE RIDE, sung and composed by Hartman and heard to this day on countless TV shows, commercials, and movie soundtracks, and the million selling monster instumental hit FRANKENSTEIN, so christened due to its much edited, or "stitched together" construction by Winter. These cats also knew their way around Latin-tinged pop like ALTA MIRA, the straight country of ROUND AND ROUND, and rock and roll boogie woogie blues, naming a song after exactly that. Winter's soulful blues-on-fire wail of a voice, searing sax, and capacity for all manner of keyboard instruments blend smartly with Hartman's pop sensibility and Rick and Ronnie's guitar hero antics, making "Night" nearly impossible to top. And you know what? None of them, alone or together, ever did. RATING: FIVE STIFFS
