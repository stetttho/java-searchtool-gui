 WHAM, BAM, THANK-YOU GLAM!: A nifty title for that rompin' stompin' dumb-fun 70s phenom known as glitter rock, but this disc hardly justifies the era by mostly including acts connected by only the thinnest of threads. Any glam-fest should at least give due to two of its grandest practitioners, Brit bands Slade and Sweet; even sometimes glam-our boy David Bowie (whose SUFFRAGETTE CITY this disc nicks from for its name) is nowhere to be heard here. Gary Glitters' thumper ROCK AND ROLL PART 2, or the "HEY" song to you sports fans, is possibly the only artist here that fits the category well. Iggy Pop and Patti Smith are nothing if not punk rock pioneers, while Kiss and Edgar Winter, while prone to the make-up donning aspects of glam, are basically neo-metal. That leaves Blondie (new wave), David Johansen (former New York Doll), Starz (bubble-rock), David Essex (HUH?????), and Ian Hunter, both solo and with the uncatergorizable Mott the Hoople. So...Wham, Bam, Where's the GLAM? RATING: TWO PLATFORM BOOTS
