 Smooth n' smokey soul crooner Boz Scaggs' first hit compilation is a frugal ten cuts, but touches on enough crucial bases for most casual listeners. You get the biggies ("Lowdown" and "Lido Shuffle" from his mighty breakthrough disc "Silk Degrees", itself almost an acceptable greatest hits substitute), the followup hits ("Jojo", the funky jam "Miss Sun"), and early tracks "Dinah Flo" and "You Make It So Hard to Say No". Unfortunately, there is nothing from his decent 1977 LP "Down Two, Then Left", nor his twelve and a half minute blues excursion with slide guitar maestro Duane Allman, "Loan Me a Dime". For these, and other diamonds, true fans will want to move up to Boz' more recent double disc anthology. The cream of session players, including Dennis Coffey, Pete Carr, Little Feat's Fred Tackett and most of Toto contribute to "Hits", and Boz is no slouch his own self on keys and guitar. Next time you're feelin' Lowdown, take the man for a ride.
