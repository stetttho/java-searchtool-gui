 OZZY OSBOURNE-THE OZZMAN COMETH: Let's forget for a moment (if the media will allow it) Ozzy the surprise TV star of an un-"reality" program in which he sits on his fat keister and collects seven figure paychecks for forgetting things my 88 year old Granddad couldn't, while mumbling in an accent so thick and riddled with bleeped out expletives you need subtitles to follow along. Am I the only idiot out there that doesn't subsribe to the theory that musically "Ozzy is God", and not merely "The Prince of Dorkness"? THE OZZMAN COMETH is a collection of Beezle-Boob's so-called career highs (I'll skip the easy joke), mostly focusing on his post-Sabbath output (only a live PARANOID and alternate takes on two other oldies here). The only truly "scarey" thing about Ozzy is his flat, colorless off-key caterwauling and unconvincing (though obviously lucrative) "The Devil Made Me Do It" schtick. From the Randy Rhoads-propelled early hits CRAZY TRAIN and MR. CROWLEY, admittedly his best work, to later keyboard-intrusive dreck like MAMA I'M COMING HOME (What? No IF I CLOSE MY EYES FOREVER, with Lita Ford's Cher to Ozzy's Sonny?), there is nothing here to convince the discerning listener that horror-meisters Alice Cooper and Roky Erickson haven't done it all better and with at least a grasp on harmony. Ozzy has bitten off some canny career chunks, from small critters' heads to Snoozefest to MTV's OZZY & SHARON-ETTE, but as far as actual MUSIC is concerned, he mostly just bites. RATING: TWO EYELINER PENCILS
