 KOOL & THE GANG-THE VERY BEST OF KOOL & THE GANG: These RNB cats could do it all---raw, urban monster groove funk (JUNGLE BOOGIE, FUNKY STUFF, HOLLYWOOD SWINGING), laid back MOR soul (CHERISH, TOO HOT), and in the designer pocket dance floor shoutalongs (CELEBRATION, GET DOWN ON IT, LET'S GO DANCIN'-OOH LA LA LA). It's all wrapped up right here in one nifty li'l party-hearty package, the most comprehensive of their many anthologies (although a few more of their gritty underground classics wouldn't have hurt). A large, horn propelled unit led by bassist Robert "Kool" Bell, Kool & the Gang's fortunes were made when they dropped their mostly instrumental ways in favor of oh so silky smooth vocalist James "J.T." Taylor, losing a portion of their street cred en route. But "Old School Kool" and "80's Greatest Hits Kool" alike will have even the most dance-impaired listeners practicing their best Julia Louis-Dreyfus moves in front of the nearest mirror. RATING: FIVE FANCY STEPS
