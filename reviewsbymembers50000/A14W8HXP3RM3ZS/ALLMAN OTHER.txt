 THE DEREK TRUCKS BAND-OUT OF THE MADNESS: Why young blooze upstart Derek Trucks (nephew of Allman Brothers drummer Butch Trucks, and no less than the ousted Dicky Betts' replacement in that band, PLUS he's hitched to Susan Tedeschi) isn't constantly mentioned in the same breath as more celebrated guitar prodigies Jonny Lang and Kenny Wayne Shepherd is a major puzzle. Deftly infusing improvisational jazz, RNB, funk and rock (not unlike the Allmans themselves), Trucks doesn't sing...he occasionally leaves that to such guests as Warren Haynes of Gov't. Mule/The Allman Brothers...though his axe does plenty of talking. Whether tackling Son House, Howlin' Wolf, Sonny Boy Williamson, the Meters, or one of his own worthy compositions, he executes like a roadhouse veteran, creating a hypnotic listening experience via searing slide and impassioned jam-band pyrotechnics. Here at last is a kid who's not rapping over a heavy metal beat or dancing and chirping in sync with a bunch of cookie cutter clones---this is REAL music, and Derek Trucks is the real deal. RATING: FIVE BROKEN STRINGS
