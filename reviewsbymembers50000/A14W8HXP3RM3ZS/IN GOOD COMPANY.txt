 BAD COMPANY, THAT MEAT 'N POTATOES 70S ROCK FAVORITE LED BY  POWERHOUSE BELTER PAUL RODGERS, IS FAIRLY REPRESENTED HERE, EVEN THOUGH RODGERS AND ORIGINAL BAD COMPANY DRUMMER SIMON KIRKE (ALSO PAUL'S PARTNER IN EARLIER ACT FREE) ARE THE ONLY FAMILIAR FACES THIS TIME AROUND. NOT THAT IT MATTERS MUCH; FAR BETTER THIS GROUPING THAN THE GENERIC BRIAN HOWE-FRONTED VERSION OF 80S-ERA BAD COMPANY.  NOBODY CAN DO THE BAND JUSTICE LIKE BLUES WAILER/VOCAL FLAILER/SOUL IMPALER RODGERS (FREE'S "ALL RIGHT NOW" AND "WISHING WELL" ARE EVEN THROWN IN FOR GREASY GOOD MEASURE). MOST OF THE VITAL HITS GET THEIR DUE HERE, FROM ROMPER-STOMPERS ("CAN'T GET ENOUGH" AND "GOOD LOVIN' GONE BAD") TO SLOW-DANCERS ("FEEL LIKE MAKIN' LOVE" AND "SEAGULL"), SO FEW FANS OF THE ORIGINAL ACT WILL FEEL CHEATED.  BAD COMPANY WAS ALWAYS FACELESS ANYHOO, HENCE THE NEWER MEMBERS FIT IN WELL ENOUGH.  AS LONG AS THERE IS A LEATHERY BREATH LEFT IN PAUL RODGER'S LUNGS, LONG MAY BAD COMPANY ROCK!
