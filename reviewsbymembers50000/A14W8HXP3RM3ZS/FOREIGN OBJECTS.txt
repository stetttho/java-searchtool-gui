 FOREIGNER-COMPLETE GREATEST HITS: Foreigner was no better or worse than any number of the slick rock outfits clogging the pop charts from the mid seventies through the mid eighties (Boston, Journey, Styx, etc.) and certainly some of their moments outshone others. Like many groups that came out of the gate strong, their momentum and quality ebbed rather quickly, to the point where oldie tours and greatest hits compilations were all they had left. COMPLETE GREATEST HITS is just what the title implies---all the superior stuff from their first anthology RECORDS, plus plenty of less enthralling efforts (read: ballads and schlock) representing their later years. Lou Gramm's vocal wallop and Mick Jones' melodic guitar sense on FEELS LIKE THE FIRST TIME, HOTBLOODED, LONG, LONG WAY FROM HOME, and the sax driven URGENT are equal to any pop singles of their era; even anthem JUKE BOX HERO is decent dumb fun. But with the exception of their choir enhanced mega hit I WANT TO KNOW WHAT LOVE IS, nothing after their fourth LP warrants "hum in your head" status, and certain pieces (SAY YOU WILL, THAT WAS YESTERDAY) are downright anemic. So stick with RECORDS and FOUR and your Foreigner collection will really be complete. RATING: THREE DIRTY WHITE BOYS
