 The King of the Outlaws may be dead and gone, but as they warble in country music circles, his memory lives on, and I ain't talkin' about Jesse James, folks. Waymore, as he was affectionately known, and buddy Willie Nelson spearheaded the so-called "Outlaw Movement" of the seventies, the rowdy  and roots-rich antithesis of the piss-poor "Hat Act" substitute that passes for country these daze. The Lubbock, Texas native (also home of his former boss Buddy Holly), never operated within the confines of Nashville, insisting on using his own musicians on recordings, and "Waylon" about subjects near and dear to him. The titles on this, one of THE truly essential hits collections, country or otherwise, tell much about the man's point of view long before you hear 'em. LONESOME ON'RY AND MEAN, LADIES LOVE OUTLAWS, HONKY TONK HEROES, and I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CRAZY are all wry, tongue in cheek variations on the "outsider" attitude that made the man so endearing and his music so enduring. The definitive cover of Ed Bruce's MAMMAS, DON'T LET YOUR BABIES GROW UP TO BE COWBOYS and the genteel LUCHENBACH, TEXAS, both enhanced by Willie, the funky ONLY DADDY THAT'LL WALK THE LINE, and poignant slow dancer AMANDA also bear up to repeated listenings. Accept no soulless, dimpled, hunky substitutes; Waylon---no last name ever need be utterered---was the real deal and deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Hank, Merle, Buck and any other true country-to-the-core legend that ever lived (or died). RATING: FIVE WAILS
