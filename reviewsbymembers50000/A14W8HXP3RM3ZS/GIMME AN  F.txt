 This military frontier comedy classic never had a chance to wear out its welcome during its pair of seasons, one in glorious black and white, the other in color.  LARRY STORCH, lovable ham that he was, stole every scene he was ever in (except maybe the ones with the HECKOWIS). KEN BERRY was the best "perfect fool" since ED WYNN, MELODY PATTERSON was a rawhide-wrapped sexpot, and FORREST TUCKER held it all together with his rugged charm. Even the second bananas, from inept bugler DOBBS to myopic VANDERBILT to "glory days" ratchet-jaw DUFFY added a lot to the merry mix. That's not even counting  the roster of wonderful guest stars, such as PAT HARRINGTON (as B. WISE, a takeoff on GET SMART), CLIFF ARQUETTE, HARVEY KORMAN, JULIE NEWMAR, PHIL HARRIS, MILTON BERLE, VINCENT PRICE, HENRY GIBSON and many more.  Gimme an "F"!  Gimme a cheer!  F TROOP is finally here!!...
