 DEEP PURPLE-"THE VERY BEST OF DEEP PURPLE": Admit it.  You attempted that dinosaur riff at some point in your misguided youth on a hopelessly beat up axe, and thought you had the makin's of a rock god. You know the one...duh-duh-duh...duh-duh-DUH-duh...duh-duh-duh...duh-duh...THE VERY BEST OF DEEP PURPLE is an ear-grabbin' anthology featuring "that song that need not even be named" and a handful of other air-guitar classics including SPACE TRUCKIN', MY WOMAN FROM TOKYO, and HIGHWAY STAR, making it far superior to the DEEPEST PURPLE or WHEN WE ROCK, WE ROCK, WHEN WE ROLL, WE ROLL collections.  Early Joe South-penned staple HUSH, mid period jam smash BURN, and late Purple entry KNOCKING AT YOUR BACK DOOR (each featuring a different lead vocalist from the group's many lineups) are all here, as well as a tough-as-leather take on Neil Diamond's KENTUCKY WOMAN. Any self respecting "Purple-head" already owns their important albums, but the casual fan could hardly ask for more than THE VERY BEST. RATING: FIVE "DUH"S
