 GREASE-VARIOUS ARTISTS: Is there any man, woman, or child among us who has not surrendered to the charms of this classic dose of nostalgic kitsch?  Admittedly, AMERICAN GRAFFITI was a more accurate portrayal of the era, featuring much better music, but GREASE has more mainstream appeal. Even enjoyed separately from the flick, this soundtrack is a hoot; John Travolta does his best singing ever in tandem with the always capable Olivia Newton-John, and is no mean slouch his own self on the Elvis-inspired (and slightly raunchy) showstopper GREASED LIGHTNING. Liv carries a winsome torch on HOPELESSLY DEVOTED TO YOU, and Frankie Valli perks up the Bee Gees-inspired title tune, while retro-mongers Sha Na Na do near justice to several moldy oldies. Stockard "Rizzo" Channing, Frankie Avalon, and Boston's own Cindy Bullens also excel at their turns at bat, leaving surprisingly little filler for what was originally a double album. More than two decades after the fact, GREASE is STILL the word! RATING: FOUR COMBS
