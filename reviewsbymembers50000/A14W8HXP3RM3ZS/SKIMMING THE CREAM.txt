 STRANGE BREW-THE VERY BEST OF CREAM: Like Eric Clapton's previous group the Yardbirds, power trio Cream introduced millions of rock fans to the blues, in this instance via the most contorted, "jam packed" interpretations of Robert Johnson and Albert King ever channeled through a psychedelic wah-wah pedal. The band boasted Jack Bruce's triple threat bass/harp/vocal prowess, Ginger Baker's jazz-tinged skin stroking, and Clapton's "Guitar God" pyrotechnics, and Cream's originals (WHITE ROOM, SUNSHINE OF YOUR LOVE, BADGE, etc.) were on a par with their mentors' compositions. Not surprisingly, it was far too much talent to contain under one roof and they imploded after two short years. What's left behind is this stunning (albeit crimanlly brief) account of a band that actually lived up to all that "supergroup" hype (and how often does THAT happen?) RATING: FIVE SPOONFULS
