 William Shatner instantly qualified as the Karaoke Kitsch King of the Universe when this kooky collection of actors turned would be rock stars hit the market many years ago. Leave it to retread masters Rhino Records to round up surreal soundbites from over a dozen Hollywood vanity projects ("I act, but what I'd REALLY like to do is sing!") circa that mighty anything goes decade, the sixties. Captain Quirk's hilarious (and...SURPRISE!...wooden) neo-psyhedelic recitation of MR. TAMBOURINE MAN and LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS is very nearly matched in its "so-godawful-it's-terrific"-ness by Leonard "Don't call me Schlock!" Nimoy's renditions of PROUD MARY and IF I HAD A HAMMER, done in a true Vulcan's emotionless style.  Just try to picture Mae West belting out TWIST AND SHOUT, or Eddie Albert tackling BLOWIN' IN THE WIND---naw, forget it---some things have to be heard to be believed. On the other hand, Mayberry icons who actually had singing on their resumes, Andy Griffith and Jim Nabors, acquit themselves reasonably well here, and Sebastion "Mr. French" Cabot narrates a pair of Dylan evergreens in his rich, embracing tones. And Jack Webb, bless him, is Joe Friday, no matter how you present him, so TRY A LITTLE TENDERNESS is the most soulless Oitis Redding cover ever executed, making it an album highlight. GOLDEN THROATS is as much of a mind-blower as running across the odd Telly Savalas LP in your local thrift store bargain bin. RATING: FIVE YOKO ONOS
