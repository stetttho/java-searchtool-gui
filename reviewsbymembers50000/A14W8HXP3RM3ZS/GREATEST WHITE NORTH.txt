 Stupendous Mad magazine charicaturist Jack Davis' hilarious cartoon cover notwithstanding, this is not the BEST Guess Who anthology bucks can buy, but will suffice for the casual fan who won't mind (or possibly notice) a couple of missing classics. The Canadian supergroup's signature biggies, including put-down anthem AMERICAN WOMAN (covered excruciatingly by Lenny Kravitz), melancholy slow dancer THESE EYES, and rollicking rocker NO TIME, all penned by Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings, are the bedrock of the Guess Who's early popularity. After Bachman departed to form the equally successful Bachman-Turner Overdrive, the hits kept on comin' for a while, including campy novelty CLAP FOR THE WOLFMAN, and STAR BABY. A sequel of sorts to the Guess Who's debut smash SHAKIN' ALL OVER wraps up this disc in sceamin' style. If you're wondering what those missing hits are, they're good un's...the No Sugar Tonight/New Mother Nature medley, and hopeful hymn SHARE THE LAND. Even without 'em, THE GREATEST OF THE GUESS WHO comes reasonably close to truth in advertising. RATING: FOUR STARS, BABY
