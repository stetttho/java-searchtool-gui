 Motley WHO???  The title trash track of this boot-stompin' compilation was a number two juvey delinquent call to arms when i was in high school and has been ever since.  If that's all ya know about CUB KODA and his grinnin' gang of Detroit Rock City brats, then fer cryin' out loud, whattya waitin' on???  Slap it on, tune in, and shut up!!!  Ya got yer rocked up reggae tune (LET YOUR YEAH BE YEAH, as JIMMY CLIFF never envisioned it). Ya got yer killer glam-slam (GARY GLITTER's punk anthem I'M THE LEADER OF THE GANG).  Ya even got THE MARTIAN BOOGIE, a spaced out JUNIOR PARKER-meets-THE PURPLE PEOPLE EATER mind-meld that's been a DR. DEMENTO SHOW fave for light years.  Plus, you also get THE great lost killer rockin' roll single of the seventies, LADY PUT THE LIGHT ON ME.  Acclaimed liner note king/music journalist CUB KODA does the honors here, chronicling the band's slow rise and free fall; if only he'd penned an entire book about them before he went to that "great greasy gig in the sky"!  Many, many albums have made the proud claim, "MADE LOUD TO PLAY LOUD!"...only BROWNSVILLE truly meant it.
