 For many years, since no official "best of" from the Detroit soul rocker was forthcoming, his live album NINE TONIGHT served as an excellent summary of his peak performances. You know what? It's STILL a superior sampler, with more smart choices and nary a dud from his post mid-80's output in sight. While many of the vital Seger statistics (that anthem to young lust NIGHT MOVES, that Tom Cruise career starter OLD TIME ROCK & ROLL, that ode to the road TURN THE PAGE) make the cut here, so do several icky-schlocky underwhelmers (that Chevy Truck ad...'nuff said). Nearly forgotten hits in the Silver Bullet Band songbook (the decent Rodney Crowell composition SHAME ON THE MOON, the not so decent disco wannabe SHAKEDOWN) are forsaken for the likes of a pedestrian cover of Chuck Berry's C'EST LA VIE (YOU NEVER CAN TELL).  Bona fide classics from the raw and hungry early days, namely  KATMANDU, RAMBLIN' GAMBLIN' MAN, and the James Brown dead ringer LUCIFER are criminally ignored. A cool cat like SEGER, with a list of hits as long as your Levi's, deserves a damn site better than what's served up here.  Until he gets it, I guess I'll stick with my NIGHT MOVES and STRANGER IN TOWN discs. RATING: THREE O.P.'S
