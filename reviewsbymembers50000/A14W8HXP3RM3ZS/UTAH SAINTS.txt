 This is merely one of many in a series of embarrassingly stingy ten track anthologies put out by Mike Curb, but it's still probably enough Osmonds for most folks. Jay, Merrill, Wayne, Alan, and of course Donny come across like a white version of the Jackson 5, which isn't a particularly bad thing upon re-sampling the energized bubble-soul of ONE BAD APPLE and YO-YO. But it's the bigger beat and grittier RNB vocals on DOWN BY THE LAZY RIVER and especially the hard rock hysteria of CRAZY HORSES that really snatch your breath away. Crank "Horses" at top volume for ANY unitiated music lover you know, and not one in a million will ever guess it's the Osmond Bothers! Overall, this is preferable to any of Donny's (with or without Marie) pop singles, to say nothin' of that creepy little twerp Jimmy's. So keep this CD mixed in with your Stones and Beatles stuff, and slip it on when your buddies ain't around. Only you and I have to know...RATING: FOUR MOLARS
