 ABC's quirky hit about everyone's favorite Buzz Beer swillin' schlub and his common sense-challenged cronies has long incorporated rock & roll for humorous effect (what other show would feature cameos by Motorhead and Joe Walsh?). From elaborately choreographed dance sequences inspired by the Vogues' FIVE O'CLOCK WORLD and Tower of Power's WHAT IS HIP? to the Presidents of the United States of America's channeling of Ian Hunter anthem CLEVELAND ROCKS as its main theme song, DREW CAREY has the most fun with musical interludes this side of THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW. Audio souveniers include classic rock staples Edgar Winter's FREE RIDE and B.T.O.'s YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHIN' YET from the classic FULL MONTY take-off (and I DO mean "take-off"!) episode, a rehearsal from Drew's mercifully short-lived band the Horndogs, and a Joe Walsh/Little Richard tag team on ROCKY MOUNTAIN WAY. You also get make-up dependent Mimi skewing yuletide carols and DREW's original theme song MOON OVER PARMA, warbled by the nearsighted one himself, mixed in with the likes of Iggy Pop and the Reverend Horton Heat. Sound like fun? It's the next best thing to kickin' back with a cold Buzz and watchin' THE DREW CAREY SHOW! RATING: FOUR EYES
