 MAC DAVIS-BABY DON'T GET HOOKED ON ME/STOP AND SMELL THE ROSES: This "two-fer" CD (plus bonus tracks, no less) combines a pair of the Lubbock, Texas songwriter/singer's best known albums, the title tracks of each representing two of his biggest hits. Amounting to a better retrospective than his official "Greatest Hits" (at least, after you separate the wheat from the chaff), the four tacked on cuts alone include the smug novelty singalong IT'S HARD TO BE HUMBLE (a pretty fair summary of Davis' often tongue in cheek composing style), country charter TEXAS IN MY REAR VIEW MIRROR, and the autobiographical ROCK N' ROLL I GAVE YOU ALL THE BEST YEARS OF MY LIFE. All of these fine "Lost 45s" are nearly impossible to find nowadays. Among the twenty other songs here, you get the number one anti-commitment classic BABY DON'T GET HOOKED ON ME, the seductive slices NAUGHTY GIRL and ONE HELL OF A WOMAN, and the gospel-colored STOP AND SMELL THE ROSES. All make for guilty pleasure listening, even if there are sometimes long stretches of audio Nutri Sweet in between. When Davis writes a good'un (Kenny Rogers, Elvis, and Gallery all did fine by his SOMETHIN'S BURNIN', IN THE GHETTO, and I BELIEVE IN MUSIC respectively), everything is right in pop music circles.  I suggest you do what I did---burn your own customized anthology from the dozen or so pop picks here, and leave that other album's worth of pablum for the elevators and dentist offices.
