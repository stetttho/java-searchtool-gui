 Okay, so it ain't Curly, or for that matter, it ain't even Shemp, but this STILL stands (pratfalls?) as the one and only Stooges album out there. The last version of every male's all-time favorite knuckleheads recorded a bunch of kiddie classics, complete with the requisite mayhem that is all things Stooges. Moe, Larry, and Curly Joe, stars of the full length movies, comic books, and cartoon shorts of the 60's blunder their way through such dumb ditties as Looney Tunes theme THE MERRY-GO-ROUND BROKE DOWN, MAIRZY DOATS, ABA DABBA HONEYMOON, even OLD MACDONALD. Youngsters will probably get the most out of it, even as we so-called "grown-ups" pine longingly for a REAL Stooge retrospective, complete with audio clips from their numerous Columbia shorts' musical highlights with Curly and Shemp. What we'd REALLY like is the original SWINGIN' THE ALPHABET ("B-A-BAY, B-E-BEE, B-I-BICKEY-BI, B-O-BO, BICKEY-BI-BO..."), which is reprised here to lesser effect with Curly Joe, OH ELAINE, COME OUT, even something from WOMEN HATERS, their all-sung debut. And howsabout shovin' in that Jump in the Saddle Band hit tribute from the 80's, THE CURLY SHUFFLE, for extra good measure? The title for such an album of amalgomated morons?...THE THREE STOOGES' GREATEST "HITS"! Why, coitenly!!! RATING: THREE N'YUKS
