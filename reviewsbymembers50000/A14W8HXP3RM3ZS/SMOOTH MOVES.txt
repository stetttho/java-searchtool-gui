 This ain't your Dad's Santana. Named for original Fleetwood Mac guitarist Peter Green's breathtaking blues instrumental (he also composed BLACK MAGIC WOMAN), here's the album that rescued the entirely deserving Carlos Santana from endless classic rock tour pergatory. Not since Tina Turner's "I've still got legs" comeback in the 80s has the music world witnessed such an unexpected and satisfying resurrection, thanks to the ingenious pairing of Mexico's guitar guru with a half dozen young disciples, and Eric Clapton tacked on for good measure. SMOOTH, the funky, blistering Rob Thomas collaboration that knocked doldrums-drenched radio on its keister at the turn of the century was the catylist, culminating in the Grammy's most decorated album ever (take THAT, Michael). Since Carlos Santana has always utilized a variety of vocalists (from Journey's Gregg Rolie to Buddy Miles to John Lee Hooker) and musical styles, hearing him play rock, hip-hop and jazz in tandem with everyone from Lauryn (Where'd she go, anyhoo?) Hill to Dave Matthews to Everlast is not such a far fetched notion.  MARIA MARIA even has the Product G&B extolling the virtues of "Carlos Santana" by name in their slniky groove-enriched rap. On the strictly Spanish-speaking side, CORAZON ESPINADO (featuring Mana) sounds infectious in ANY language, and the rest is the vintage Latino rock that this cat was blowin' light years before Ricky Martin was even a Menudo. When the musical history books are written, SUPERNATURAL will remain proof positive that, yes Virginia, there really IS a Santana claus. RATING: FIVE FIESTAS
