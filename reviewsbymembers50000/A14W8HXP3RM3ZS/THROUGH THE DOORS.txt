 THE DOORS-BEST OF THE DOORS: They were eerie. They were sexy. They were unique. Between Jim Morrison's left field poetic spoutings (at times soft, at times maniacal) and Ray Manzarek's otherwordly keyboard swirlings, they could hardly be mistaken for anyone else. Although this double CD clocks in at a miserly 89 minutes (meaning it should be a single disc anthology these days), the quality, originality and execution of its contents and influence on rock music are incalculable. From opening salvo BREAK ON THROUGH to final track (appropriately titled) THE END, the Lizard King and his troubadours tackled sleazy roadhouse blues (ROADHOUSE BLUES, LOVE ME TWO TIMES) quirk and roll (LIGHT MY FIRE, in all its seven minute splendor), the Kinks (HELLO, I LOVE YOU, for which the Doors were sued), and breathtaking balladry (RIDERS ON THE STORM) with maverick aplomb. TOUCH ME fairly implodes with brass-perforated energy, while Morrison's haunted howl rides shotgun over L.A. WOMAN, a masterwork of groove solid rock. They were ballsy. They were bad. They were the Doors. RATING: FIVE PAIRS OF LEATHER PANTS
