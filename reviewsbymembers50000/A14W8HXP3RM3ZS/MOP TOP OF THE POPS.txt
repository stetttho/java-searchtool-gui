 Not much else can be written about the Liverpool lads' impact on that thing called rock n' roll. Better just to listen and marvel at their progress from teen idols singing two minute slices of unabashed pop panache to experimental craftsmen virtually creating the need for FM radio single handedly. All 27 tracks here effortlessly topped the charts, and are available for the very first time on a single, reasonably priced disc. From the psychedelic overtones of Penny Lane to the stark beauty of Something to the childlike charisma of Yellow Submarine, all this reviewer can say is YEAH YEAH YEAH!  RATING:  FIVE BEATS
