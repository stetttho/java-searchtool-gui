 AC/DC-HIGHWAY TO HELL: Down Under's (and America's) answer to heavy metal salvation, AC/DC quite simply rocked and rolled louder, harder, and more humorously than anyone else. Between lead bubble-in-the-throat yowler Bon Scott and schoolboy in disgrace Angus Young's ball-pean-hammer-against-the-skull playing, the fearsome fivesome made all other comers sound about as dangerous as The Archies. Produced by Mutt Lange (when Shania was in Dr. Dentons), tracks of thunderous lust TOUCH TOO MUCH, GIRLS GOT RHYTHM, and LOVE HUNGRY MAN made it safe to be a horny teenager in the late seventies. Title pavement pounder HIGHWAY TO HELL boasts one of the Top Ten riffs in rock 'n roll, hurtling the listener through a frightening junkyard collision course of blood curdling screams, both vocal and instrumental. Unfortunately, Scott took the anthem a bit too literally, succombing to an alcohol-related death shortly after. BUT WHAT A FRIGGIN' SWAN SONG!!! RATING: FIVE SNEERS
