 CHICAGO-THE VERY BEST OF CHICAGO-ONLY THE BEGINNING: In the beginning, Chicago Transit Authority was the best and most popular horn band of the rock era, charting constantly with such peppy RNB-laced fare as 25 OR 6 TO 4, SATURDAY IN THE PARK, FEELIN' STRONGER EVERY DAY and the occasional tasty ballad (COLOUR MY WORLD). Then in the 80s, like their peers ZZ Top, Dr. Hook, and J. Geils, Chicago radically compromised their musical principles and altered their style to suit bland mainstream tastes, sacrificing credibility for mega success. Peter Cetera's easy listening croon was featured on wedding song after wedding song, while Robert Lamm's earthier, more soulful vocals and the mighty brass section took a backseat---a HARD HABIT TO BREAK indeed. In short, disc one of this definitive career spanner will put you in a step-lively mood, and the second disc will put you to sleep. Ah Chicago, how your true fans long for the OLD DAYS!...RATING: THREE TOOTS
