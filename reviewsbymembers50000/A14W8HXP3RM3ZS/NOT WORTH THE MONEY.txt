 EDDIE MONEY-GREATEST HITS-SOUND OF MONEY: Regular Joe raspy voiced rocker Eddie Money (formerly New York cop Eddie Mahoney) is not given his due on this short summary of career songs. Although the basic classics are here, from the early RNB-tinted BABY HOLD ON and TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE to later high water marks TAKE ME HOME TONIGHT (a retro Ronnie Spector tribute featuring the sultry siren herself) and the steamy SHAKIN', too much CD space is given over to pedestrian "new" tracks and non-hits. Why his stellar second album CAN'T HOLD BACK (which featured choice efforts MAYBE I'M A FOOL and GIMME SOME WATER) was ignored in favor of PEACE IN OUR TIME and the misleadingly titled WHERE'S THE PARTY is one for the books. And why are the lovely TRINIDAD and his soulful take on Smokey Robinson's YOU REALLY GOT A HOLD ON ME nowhere to be heard here? If you're a true fan of Money (the man, not the moolah), you already have his best albums anyhoo, so do yourself a favor; fire up your CD burner and create a compilation worthy of his legacy. Just think of all the cute monickers you could apply to it...EDDIE MONEY'S TREASURE CHEST, EDDIE MONEY-GOLD, EDDIE MONEY-COP ROCK, etc., etc., etc. RATING: THREE BILLS
