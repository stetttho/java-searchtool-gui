 Don't know what the compilers of this weak excuse for a career overview were smokin' at the time, but somethin' sure smells (un)funny! Rock n' roll's unofficial counterculture spokesmen of the 70's (and their legions of fans) deserve higher grade stuff than this. A shortened version of the classic DAVE opens the album, then fades out, only to resurface briefly seven cuts later, STILL leaving off the punchline! Hit single EARACHE MY EYE is similarly chopped in half, giving you the Alice Bowie rock tune parody, but omitting the much funnier confrontation between "Daddy" and "Junior". There's far too much PEDRO AND THE MAN (over twenty minutes) spread over three tracks, when one woulda been plenty, leaving room for such missing singles as BLOAT ON, a gluttonous remake of soul hit FLOAT ON, and BORN IN EAST L.A., the duo's final single. At least smart-aleck smashes SISTER MARY ELEPHANT and BASKETBALL JONES survive intact, and blues singer Blind Melon Chitlin' makes a welcome appearance. The same can't be said for quite a few other fondly remembered C&C routines, and, to quote Chong, "That's a drag, Man!" RATING: TWO TOKES
