 THE MOODY BLUES-THE BEST OF THE MOODY BLUES: Even detractors of progressive rock would be hard put to dispel the creamy, dreamy audio ambience that is the Moody Blues. After their Denny Laine-sung RNB debut GO NOW, the Moodys employed Mellotron, Ray Thomas' flute, otherwordly backing vocals, even symphony orchestras to create their trademark sound. Singer/guitarist Justin Hayward provided a mellow, almost surreal ying (NIGHTS IN WHITE SATIN, TUESDAY AFTERNOON) to bassist/vocalist John Lodge's tougher edged yang (RIDE MY SEE-SAW, I'M JUST A SINGER IN A ROCK AND ROLL BAND), ringing up countless FM rock staples in the process. Though their later comeback efforts (YOUR WILDEST DREAMS, the E.L.O. soundalike GEMINI DREAM) were slightly below par, Hayward's solo stab FOREVER AUTUMN ranks right up with the prettiest things he's ever done. After several flawed compilations, this is the one that is ultimately every bit as meticulous as the Moody Blues' legendary craftsmanship. RATING: FIVE LOST CHORDS
