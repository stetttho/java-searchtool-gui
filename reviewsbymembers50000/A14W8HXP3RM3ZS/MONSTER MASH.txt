 Blues rocking Texan Edgar Winter's greatest hits only contains a pair of bona fide Top 40 classics, the chart topping instrumental "Frankenstein" (kids, think Tiger Woods' car ad of a few years back), and the Dan Hartman composed and sung "Free Ride". But that's hardly the point. The well respected keyboardist/saxman dabbles easily in country ("Round and Round"), pure blues ("Tobacco Road"), horn driven rock ("Keep Playin' That Rock and Roll"), funk ("We All Had a Real Good Time"), and other musical genres. After sampling this potpourri of pop styles, new fans are advised to check out "Roadwork", a blistering live outing by Edgar Winter's White Trash (a soul/blues revue with guest blasts from Rick Derringer and brother Johnny Winter) and the seventies milestone "They Only Come Out at Night", featuring "Frankenstein". Any albino that can hold his own against George Hamilton in a beer commercial is worth checking out, in my book.
