 This was the Boston Bad Boys' first "best of" treatment, and while far from perfect, it's still a fairly accurate barometer of their career's first (and best) life. Glaring errors include the unforgivable omission of rockin' blues warhorse TRAIN KEPT A ROLLIN' in all its rip roarin' glory in favor of REMEMBER (WALKIN IN THE SAND), a far less effective remake. Also, the shortened AM single versions of tongue twister WALK THIS WAY and sister single SWEET EMOTION will make you feel you've been gypped if you grew up on the full length FM takes. At least DREAM ON remains intact as the granddaddy of power ballads, a genre which Aerosmith has unfortunately plied to death in the past decade, and the struttin' funk of SAME OLD SONG AND DANCE is anything but what its title implies. Steven Tyler and company would enjoy many more hits in the ensuing years, but even if the band had self destructed after just the first four classic albums (and they very nearly did, of course), their legacy would be preserved well enough right here. RATING: FOUR SCARVES
