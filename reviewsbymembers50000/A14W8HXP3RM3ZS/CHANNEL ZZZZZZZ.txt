 Athens' quirky, jerky B-52's have been stalling for well over a decade now, which is how long it's been since they've released an elpee of new tunes. The last was the optimistically titled GOOD STUFF, which contained, at best, mediocre stuff, due at least partially to the absence of Cindy Wilson. When it stiffed, especially stacked against their '89 comeback smash COSMIC THING, the Bee-Five-Two's retreated to the safe, but uncreative haven of "best of anthologies", scattered solo shots, and two ditties on THE FLINTSTONES soundtrack---guess it takes a cartoon-ish band to sing cartoon anthems. While TIME CAPSULE is the most thorough single disc assessment of their entire career, its highlights come, not at all shockingly, from their first and best pair of albums, THE B-52'S and WILD PLANET. You can party out of bounds to kooky kitsch classics ROCK LOBSTER, PRIVATE IDAHO, STROBELIGHT, and QUICHE LORRAINE in the first half, but beware! Among the eleven remaining offerings, only LOVE SHACK will still make you wanna dance this mess around. SUMMER OF LOVE, IS THAT YOU MO-DEAN?, and new tune DEBBIE ain't bad, but all lack the pure zany pizazz and warped pop pep of the "oldies". Kate Pierson came off better guesting on Iggy Pop's CANDY and REM's SHINY HAPPY PEOPLE, and Fred Schneider's solo single MONSTER IN MY PANTS was as demented as the B-52's early efforts, but this IS a group effort after all, so you won't find them here. If you can live without LOVE SHACK---and if you've been to as many wedding receptions as I have, believe me, you CAN---better to check out DANCE THIS MESS AROUND, a party-mix of their first two albums. It's lean, mean, and far from serene! RATING: THREE BEEHIVES
