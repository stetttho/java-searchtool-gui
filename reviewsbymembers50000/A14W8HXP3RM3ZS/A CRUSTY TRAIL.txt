 GILLIGAN'S ISLAND goes way out west is the best way to describe this alleged "comedy", which is actually several DUSTY'S TRAIL (a deservedly obscure syndicated 70s sitcom) episodes stitched together to approximate a full length feature film. Instead of seven hapless castaways marooned on a tropical isle, you get the same number of folk in a wagon train lost out in the wilderness. Rather than Bob Denver as bumbling, clueless first mate Gilligan, the actor stretches---this time portraying bumbling, clueless trail scout Dusty. Perhaps Alan Hale was too heavy to stay on a horse, but you DO get authentic western actor Forrest Tucker as the exasperated, but protective wagonmaster, a cross between the Skipper and his Sgt. O'Rourke character from F TROOP.  That underrated frontier sitcom and GILLIGAN'S ISLAND are absolute masterstrokes of genious compared to this. Along for the ride are a stuffy rich couple, with ROOM 222 regular Ivor Francis (GENERAL HOSPITAL cutie Genie Francis' pop) putting on his best Thurston Howell III face, not to mention an intelligent guy, and a couple of babes, played by a couple of the PETTICOAT JUNCTION babes. The plots are direct GILLIGAN retreads, the production values laughable (the only thing that is), and the Indians are a far cry from the hilarious scene-stealers that inhabited F TROOP. In spite of it all, the kitsch value here and the truly desperate attempt to re-sell a show that nobody admits watching but that's still in reruns three decades later brings a little smile to my face. The fact that I own THE WACKIEST WAGON TRAIN IN THE WEST on DVD (a double feature with RESCUE FROM GILLIGAN'S ISLAND no less!) says much about my "so bad it's great" outlook on pop culture. RATING: TWO BAD
