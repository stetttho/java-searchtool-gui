 JAMES BROWN-20 ALL TIME GREATEST HITS!: No self respecting lover of modern music would be caught DEAD without a copy of the Black Elvis' funkiest stuff in his or her collection, and here are the goods! Like the album's immensely entertaining liner notes state, only the King himself had more chart hits, but we're talkin' 'bout the REAL king here, natch, the KING OF SOUL! The Mother Like No Other! The Godfather! The Hardest Workin' Man in Sho' Biz! Soul Bro' Numero Uno! The cat with the coolest moves, the tightest band, and the most paint peelin' SCREAM in all of the entertainment world! Among his many other accomplishments, JB was both a funk AND a rap pioneer, and not surprisingly, the latter genre's most sampled artist.  Brown's biggies, from the early slow groover PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE to dance floor-fillers I GOT YOU (I FEEL GOOD) and PAPA'S GOT A BRAND NEW BAG to funk overloaders SEX MACHINE and GET UP OFFA THAT THING, are here in all their cold sweat-soaked splendor. If you make ONE soul purchase, this is THE one---Brown is to RNB what the Fab Four are to rock, Bob Marley is to reggae, and Hank Sr. is to country. Don't mind me if I "SAY IT LOUD"!!! RATING: FIVE YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAHS!!!!!
