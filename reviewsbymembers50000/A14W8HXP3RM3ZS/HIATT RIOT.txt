 The title is a misnomer of sorts, since the only real hits this Hoosier minstrel of mirth and magic's ever had have been those he wrote for other artists (Bonnie Raitt's breakthrough THING CALLED LOVE, Jeff Healey's ANGEL EYES and B.B. King's comeback RIDIN' WITH THE KING among 'em). None of this matters a bit to the legions of fans who idolize his ragged but righteous howl of a voice, and his uncanny ability to pen insightful songs in any genre from rock and country to folk and blues. His slow but sure breakthrough, on undisputed classic albums BRING THE FAMILY and SLOW TURNING, hipped us common folk to what music royalty has known for ages---Hiatt is the "go to guy" for quality music---just ask Three Dog Night, Rosanne Cash, Jewel, or any number of admirers who've scored with his stuff. Speaking of "stuff", GREATEST HITS culls eighteen tracks of wry wit and wistful wisdom; some, like PERFECTLY GOOD GUITAR (seems John's gotta axe to grind 'bout guitar-smashing rock stars), SLOW TURNING (where he namechecks Charlie Watts), and the edgy PAPER THIN, seem to be BEGGING to be covered by some quality-hungry acts somewhere. In addition, you get sandpapery original versions of ANGEL EYES, THING CALLED LOVE, and DRIVE SOUTH, all equal, in a quirky way, to their better known covers. Fans of some of the best songwriting this side of Dylan should start with this retrospective and immediately work their way through John Hiatt's huge catalogue of high caliber work. RATING: FIVE TONGUES IN CHEEK
