 Before Paul Rodgers and Simon Kirke joined the slicker, more rock steady supergroup Bad Company, they pounded out a big bluesy beat in Free, known to most only for the Top 40 warhorse ALL RIGHT NOW. But dig a little deeper, music fans, and you'll be rewarded with a powerful pastiche of rootsy rock, folk, and RNB in the vein of fellow Brits Savoy Brown and the early Peter Green-led Fleetwood Mac. Rodgers' raw-throated howl and unique phrasing coupled with doomed guitarist Paul Kossoff's raw, righteous riffing on FIRE AND WATER, CATCH A TRAIN and THE HUNTER make for an explosive earful here. For contrast, the instrumental MOUTHFUL OF GRASS (ALL RIGHT NOW's flip side) is three and a half minutes of mellow nirvana. They say the best things in life are Free: don't know 'bout life, but musically speaking, that statement holds true.
