 Probably as much, if not more fun, than the John Belushi/Dan Akroyd flick, which had its best moments via its high spirited musical interludes (and legendary guest stars Cab Calloway, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, and Ray Charles), THE BLUES BROTHERS movie soundtrack album contains surprisingly little in the way of actual blues. Not that it matters for a second. You DO get a genre-jumpin' grabbag of jazz (PETER GUNN), rock (GIMME SOME LOVIN' and JAILHOUSE ROCK, wailed out in ragged but right Belushi fashion), gospel (James Brown's sweaty testimonial THE OLD LANDMARK), country (THEME FROM RAWHIDE, which suits Akroyd's limited vocal ability to a tee), swing (Cab Calloway's signature hit MINNIE THE MOOCHER), and pure, unabashed soul (from the "Queen" and the "Genious" of it, Aretha and Ray). The bluesiest thing on here is a joyous eight minute workout of hoary classic SWEET HOME CHICAGO, though it's a pity the infectious EVERYBODY NEEDS SOMEBODY TO LOVE ain't quite up to Wilson Pickett's soul-shredding standards (the enthusiastic spoken word Akroyd intro almost makes up for it). This isn't JUST the soundtrack to a movie, it also works beautifully as the background to a road trip, beer blast, or dance party...in short, if you've got the blues, pop this baby in and watch 'em disappear faster than the Bluesmobile itself! RATING: FIVE PACKS OF SMOKES
