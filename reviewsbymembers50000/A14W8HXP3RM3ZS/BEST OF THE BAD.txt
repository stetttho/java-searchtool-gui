 This double CD of Bad Co.'s greatest was long overdue, particularly given their scanty former offering, "10 From 6". Many years of a Paul Rodgers-less Bad Co. did nothing to enhance their rep either, which is probably why the original foursome reunited for this release and a tour. Unfortunately, the four new cuts recorded for "Anthology" aren't likely to make anyone forget "Shooting Star" or "Can't Get Enough". No biggie. This Bad box is chock full of FM classics, including almost all of their stellar self-titled debut. Former Free frontman Rodgers wails, shouts, and shrieks his way through everything from "Wild Fire Woman" to "Ready For Love" to "Run With the Pack", accompanied by the sure-fire fretting of Mick Ralphs. Sure, a couple of live tracks woulda been nice (Bad Co.'s best known lineup has yet to release a concert LP), disc one out-performs disc two, and "Young Blood", "Gone, Gone, "Gone" and a handful of other gems aren't here, but if you want the best Bad for your buck, listen no further.  RATING:  FOUR BAD MEN
