 Eric Carmen was the great lost chord that connected the Beatles to the Beach Boys. Blessed with a high pop-perfect voice and the ability to write hooks that could catch Moby Dick, the Cleveland native's first group, the Raspberries, sounded too good to be true, let alone to last (they didn't). Their bubblegum meets hard rock efforts bore chart fruit Go All the Way and I Wanna Be With You, school dance ballad Let's Pretend  and the flawless autobiography Overnight Sensation, which kick off this compilation disc in grandiose style. What follows are Carmen's slightly mellower, but equally classy solo career highlights, not the least of which are a pair of biggies he wrote for teen throb Shaun Cassidy (That's Rock & Roll, Hey Deanie), heard to best advantage here in their beat crazy, harder rockin' original versions. The Beach Boys-channeled She Did It, the lovely, yearning All By Myself, and the Dirty Dancing-era guilty pleasures Hungry Eyes and Make Me Lose Control, literal ear candy one and all, round out the fun. Maybe his recorded output has been a tad slight compared to say, Billy Joel or Elton John, but I'd druther hear one TRULY GREAT greatest hits like Eric Carmen's than a bloated box set of almost anyone else. RATING: FIVE RASPBERRIES
