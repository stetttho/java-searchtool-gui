 THE MONKEES-BARRELFUL OF MONKEES/MONKEES SONGS FOR KIDS!: Since the Pre-Fab Four were always wacky, charismatic, and yes, funny on their fast paced TV series, this Kid Rhino (retro-label kings Rhino Records' small fry division) roundup of tunes for tots makes perfect sense. Several choices are delightfully demented, none more so than Mickey and Davy's call and response mad libs on GONNA BUY ME A DOG and the rare Peter Tork lead vocal on YOUR AUNTIE GRIZELDA (alas, PETER PERCIVAL PATTERSON'S PET PIG PORKY is nowhere to be heard here). Bread head David Gates' SATURDAY'S CHILD and Mike Nesmith's countrified PAPA GENE'S BLUES sound considerably straighter, but are nifty pieces of pop craftsmanship nonetheless. Interestingly, the dreamy PORPOISE SONG (heard originally in that semi-legendary failed Monkees movie project HEAD) appears in a solo version from the album MICKEY DOLENZ PUTS YOU TO SLEEP; final cut PILLOW TIME (also sung by the Monkees' talented timekeeper) will also encourage nodding off (in a good "bedtime story" sort of way). Pop this CD in betwixt your youngin's next Britney/Backstreet fix, and you might not be the only one smiling. RATING: FOUR MONKEE FLIPS
