 Bon Jovi has forever amounted to the (very) poor man's Springsteen; in fact, as far as New Jersey rock acts go, they couldn't even carry Southside Johnny's jock strap. Pedestrian lyrics, vocals, and songwriting make for "classic" grooves about as deep as a soapdish, give or take a rare halfway decent attempt like WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE or YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME. In spite of their recent "comeback" (are we desperate for a Britney-less, Backstreet-less, Linkin Park-less fix, or WHAT?), Jon Bon Jovi represents all that is wrong with corporate rock...or for that matter, corporate country...all hair, teeth and dimples, no substance. Don't MAKE me go into any more excrutiating detail.  Instead, sample a few seconds of the truly BAD MEDICINE.  One lame song is worth a thousand typewritten words. RATING: TWO CANS OF MOUSSE
