 When the Fab Four decided to become Wonderful Ones in 1970, few expected their amiable beatkeeper Ringo to accomplish much, let alone score chart topping hits. But score them the "Homely Beatle" with the homely voice did indeed, employing a winning combination of nostalgic instrumental backing and charismatic little ditties, some written with George Harrison. Hoyt Axton's hilarious NO NO SONG, about the foibles of excess, oldie rehash YOU'RE SIXTEEN, and the beautifully rendered PHOTOGRAPH held their own with many of John and Paul's early solo efforts, as if the always ignored child in the Beatle family had finally decided to stand up and be counted. EARLY 1970 is an account of the big breakup, BEAUCOUPS OF BLUES is the best country number any former moptop ever did, and OH MY MY and BACK OFF BOOGALOO are irresistable excursions into Ringo's funhouse. A pity he couldn't sustain the momentum, but nonetheless, BLAST FROM YOUR PAST encapsules Richard Starkey's surprisingly robust solo shot quite handsomely. RATING: FIVE STARRS
