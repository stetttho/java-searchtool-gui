 FEEL THE BUZZ-SPACIN': If you'll pardon the pun, this is a clever "pot-pourri" put out by Polygram (one of several, actually) concerning America's fave pastime, and I don't mean hittin' the horsehide. Such classic psychedelic fare as Donovan's MELLOW YELLOW (and, by way of Vanilla Fudge, his SEASON OF THE WITCH), Love's frenzied freak-out 7 AND 7 IS, the single length edit of Iron Butterfly's IN-A-GADDA-DA-VIDA, and one shot garage band Count Five's PSYCHOTIC REACTION are just some of the "hits" here. You also get to ingest Hoyt Axton's anti-drug anthem THE PUSHER from Steppenwolf, the smokey haze of Commander Cody's SEEDS AND STEMS (AGAIN), and John Prine's tongue (and maybe something else) in cheek ILLEGAL SMILE. This is high grade stuff. Indulge thyself. RATING: FIVE TOKES
