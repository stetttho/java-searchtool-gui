 One of the seventies' quintessential anthologies has been properly updated to cover all phases of the California act's entire career (the Tom Johnston dominated early rock one, Michael McDonald's jazzier middle one, and the McDonald-less reunion). The first half is identical to BEST OF THE DOOBIES, except the early (and excellent) single NOBODY replaces Patrick Simmons' country-inflected SOUTH CITY MIDNIGHT LADY. Part two is mostly Michael McDonald's baby, stocked with his bluesy, shuffling musicianship on mega hits WHAT A FOOL BELEIVES and MINUTE BY MINUTE, plus a subtle take on YOU BELONG TO ME (which Carly Simon did well by). This is not to overlook Simmons' contributions, from the hooky DEPENDIN' ON YOU to shared lead vocal duties with McDonald on ECHOES OF LOVE. GREATEST wraps with the one two muscular punch of Johnston's comeback effort THE DOCTOR (think CHINA GROVE done sideways), and DANGEROUS (from the forgettable Brian Bosworth action flick STONE COLD), which is marred only by intrusive synthesizer. As with any collection of classics, one might quibble with a couple of tunes that made the cut (the weak REAL LOVE for one) over others that didn't (ANOTHER PARK ANOTHER SUNDAY, LITTLE DARLIN' I NEED YOU), but overall, this is the most Brotherly bang for your buck. RATING: FOUR DOOBIE DOOBIE DOO'S
