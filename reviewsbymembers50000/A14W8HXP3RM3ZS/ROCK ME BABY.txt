 This is an extension (by seven tracks) of John Waite's pre-solo, pre-Bad English group's greatest hits, which is a good or a bad thing, depending on how much you like the Babys. Straddling the line between pop and roll and soulful ballads, two of their efforts in the latter department (ISN'T IT TIME and EVERY TIME I THINK OF YOU) are actually quite good, with Waite's slightly gritty voice augmented by gospel-rich female choruses. On the rock side, MIDNIGHT RENDEZVOUS' new wavish strains, the teen angst-filled SWEET 17, and a rousing take on Motown oldie MONEY raise the bar in the Babys' favor, though probably the original ten track ANTHOLOGY told enough of the story in this seventies band's brief career. RATING: THREE DIAPERS
