 THE MONKEES-LIVE-1967: Sure, it's ragged. It's raw. It's even a little wretched in spots. But at least it IS Mike, Mickey, Davy and Peter playing their OWN instruments (okay, Davy's only contributing maracas and tambourine), something they famously never got to do on their early LPs. Apart from a "solo" spotlight on each Monkee (Mike countrifies a blues chestnut, Peter gets down on banjo, etc.) where they are backed by a five piece group called the Sundowners, what you hear is what you get. Voices crack almost as often as the on stage jokes and everything's drowned out by an almost Beatle-esque audience of screeeeeeeeeaming teens. Not even Mike Nesmith and Peter Tork, the band's true musicians, were ever gonna put Glen Campbell outta work, but they make up in enthusiasm what they occasionally lack in ability. Peter gets to do his inevitable AUNTIE GRIZELDA schtick. Surprisingly, Davy DOESN'T get to do DAYDREAM BELIEVER. I'M NOT YOUR STEPPIN' STONE sounds as sloppy and unintentionally hilarious as the Sex Pistols' classic cover version. So what? At least the Pre-Fab Four was in there TRYING, and what have YOU done lately, anyhoo? RATING: THREE MILLI VANILLIS
