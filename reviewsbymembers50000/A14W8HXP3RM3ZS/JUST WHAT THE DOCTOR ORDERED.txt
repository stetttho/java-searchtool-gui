 A too brief dose of mellowed down blooze/jazz/RNB (and practically any other genre you can conjure up) as only New Orlean's own funky maestro can administer it. Like Ray Charles, Joe Cocker, and damned few others, the gravelly, soul-sational Dr. John can literally cover any standard and own it forever. His sly, steamy duet with Rickie Lee Jones on MAKIN' WHOOPEE is the perfect intertwining of two of modern music's most intriguing talents, and the ivory tinkler's breezy rendering of DON'T LET THE SUN CATCH YOU CRYING is pure laid back nirvana. No matter what kind of mood you may find yourself in, the doctor's got your prescription.  RATING: FIVE BLACK KEYS
