 Bubblegum's greatest and most successful practitioners get the gold treatment here, although it would have been a richer strike if it included ALL their cotton candy charters. Second single HONEY HONEY and bigger hit (and bigger mouthful) I DO I DO I DO I DO I DO certainly deserve their place alongside disco era fave DANCING QUEEN and MONEY, MONEY, MONEY (something ABBA knows well enough to chirp about). Frida and Agnetha's pop perfect pleas and Benny and Bjorn's AM radio ready compositions will have all but the most jaded listener humming and tapping along (Guilt-free grin and vacant stare optional). ABBA almost singlehandedly invented the need for Karaoke, but don't hate 'em for it. Just nod your head and sigh, "How Swede it is!" RATING: FOUR VOLVOS
