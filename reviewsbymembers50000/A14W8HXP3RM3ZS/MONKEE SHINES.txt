 THE MONKEES-GREATEST HITS: Just like that other irresistible confectionary treat Sara Lee, nobody, it seems, doesn't like the Monkees. Sure, they were dubbed the "Pre-Fab Four" and granted, they played nary a note on their biggest sellers (I suspect that Davy was even faking the tambourine). Yet they rose above the teen idol/bubblegum tag and churned out some of the best damn 60's singles this side of the Grass Roots and Paul Revere and the Raiders. Neil Diamond, Carole King, and Boyce and Hart were just a few of the top drawer composers and Glen Campbell and Leon Russell examples of the session cream utilized by svengali Don Kirshner to produce AM paydirt. GREATEST HITS ably covers each period of the Monkees' all too brief career, from early singalong classics LAST TRAIN TO CLARKSVILLE and DAYDREAM BELIEVER through their "adult" phase PORPOISE SONG, LISTEN TO THE BAND to their better than average 80's reunion efforts THAT WAS THEN THIS IS NOW and HEART AND SOUL. Hear Peter share a rare lead vocal with Mickey on WORDS! Witness Davy and a punchy brass section kick some serious hiney on VALLERI! Savor a version of I'M A BELIEVER that shreds SHREK's take to ribbons! This anthology is more fun than a barrel full of...Nope! Forget it. Giddy as I feel after spinnin' this delightful disc of pure pop perfection, you can't make me say it! RATING: FIVE BANANAS
