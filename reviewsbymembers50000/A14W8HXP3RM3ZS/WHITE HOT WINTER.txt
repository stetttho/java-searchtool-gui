 Recorded at its liveliest at such legendary venues as the Apollo Theater and the Whiskey a Go-Go, ROADWORK is nothing short of a raw, blistering, white hot collection of rock/R&B/jazz/blues barnburners as only the horn-heavy/soul vaccinated Edgar Winter's White Trash could administer it! With sax/keys maestro Winter trading riffs and screamin' soul shouts with co-vocalist/sax wailer Jerry La Croix (who later served briefly with like minded acts Blood, Sweat and Tears and Rare Earth) and ace axeman Rick Derringer conjuring up riff after righteous riff, can the party get ANY better? Unbelievably, the answer is YES, the moment Edgar utters the immortal line, "People keep askin' me...where's your brother?"), which can only mean the entrance of Johnny Winter, the whitest man to ever play the blues, and a ballsy rip through ROCK AND ROLL HOOCHIE KOO! Other cover highlights include a particularly maniacal BACK IN THE USA, on which Derringer erases umpteen other versions from memory with the flick of a pick, Jerry La Croix durn near out-Otis-ing Otis Redding on a frantic CAN'T TURN YOU LOOSE, and Winter's show-stealing, seventeen minute, twisting, turning, burning, churning, downright YEARNING annihilation of TOBACCO ROAD (notice I didn't say "smoking"?). If this ain't one of the coolest concert LPs ever recorded, Edgar Winter don't wear sunglasses at the beach! RATING: FIVE JIVE, JIVE, JIVES
