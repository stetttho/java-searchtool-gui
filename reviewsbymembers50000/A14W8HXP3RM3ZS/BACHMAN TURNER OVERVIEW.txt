 The cocky title of this rock riffin' Canadian quartet's first greatest hits package was originally THE BEST OF B.T.O.-SO FAR, the worst case of overconfidence since Custer advised against taking prisoners. Their five biggies are here in all their soundalike glory, but unfortunately for the band, the party was soon over after that. C.F. Turner's gravelly, workman-like growl serves the best numbers LET IT RIDE and ROLL ON DOWN THE HIGHWAY well, even tho' Randy Bachman's TAKIN' CARE OF BUSINESS and YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHIN' YET got more airplay. The fifth and inevitably final hit HEY YOU was merely a laughable retread of all the above; at least they switched gears for the jazzy BLUE COLLAR and LOOKIN' OUT FOR NUMBER ONE. Bachman's first group, the Guess Who, displayed more variety and depth on their early classics AMERICAN WOMAN and THESE EYES, but as his second act, B.T.O's short reign is documented decently enough here. Bonus points for the trio of bonus tracks, hence the new, less ironic album monicker. RATING: FOUR GEARS
