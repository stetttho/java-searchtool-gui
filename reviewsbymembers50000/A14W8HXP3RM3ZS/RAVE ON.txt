 Stevie Rave On may have been one of rock n' blues most celebrated guitar slingers, but this is far from a truly "great" greatest hits package. Much fire and smoke is left off in favor of dreck like a flat reading of George Harrison's TAXMAN. Small wonder THE REAL DEAL: GREATEST HITS VOLUMN 2 comes off as a sequel with no equal. Car crash classic WILLIE THE WIMP, turbo-driven surfer standard PIPELINE, and signature Hendrix cover VOODOO CHILE all should have easily made the first GREATEST HITS, but amazingly didn't.  Look for 'em on the second compilation. At least standout Vaughan ripsnorters PRIDE AND JOY, TEXAS FLOOD, and THE HOUSE IS ROCKIN' are present and accounted for on this ultra skimpy, eleven track travesty to SRV's memory. Do yourself a favor: check out the late 90's re-issues of his original four albums, with bonus tracks and rare takes tacked on. This quickie cash-in just gives me the blues. RATING: THREE COLD SHOTS
