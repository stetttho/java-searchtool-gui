 ELECTRIC LIGHT ORCHESTRA PART TWO-E.L.O.'S GREATEST HITS LIVE: As its rather clunky title implies, this is not the Jeff Lynne helmed mega-watt force that ruled the pop charts in the seventies, but a near tribute act featuring several former band members paired (not unreasonably, given their classical rock overtones) with the Moscow Symphomy Orchestra on a live run-through of past glories. That established, this sucker ain't half the travesty it oughta be. Ex-Climax Blues Band vocalist Pete Haycock and E.L.O. mainstay Kelly Groucutt do an admirable job of recreating Lynne's high pitched vocals, and the trademark string section sound remains intact on warhorses LIVIN' THING, EVIL WOMAN, and CAN'T GET IT OUT OF MY HEAD. Always a reluctant live ensemble anyway, the original Orchestra never released a concert document, so perhaps this semi-reunion is excusable, if only to hear the grandiose ROLL OVER BEETHOVEN again in all its Chuck Berry meets high class symphony splendor. Predictably, new effort THOUSAND EYES can hardly compete with the likes of TURN TO STONE and TELEPHONE LINE (even in these stylized renditions), but as an update on one of modern rock's greatest singles practitioners, E.L.O. TWO isn't an uninteresting second chapter. RATING: THREE STRINGS
