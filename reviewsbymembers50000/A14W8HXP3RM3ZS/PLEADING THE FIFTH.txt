 THE VERY BEST OF THE FIFTH DIMENSION: Call them the black Mamas and the Papas if you want; unbelievably, the Fifth Dimension sounded even whiter than the Supremes. Marilyn McCoo's cool flair with a pop number and the group's knack for covering some of the best song craftsmen of their era (Laura Nyro, Jimmy Webb, etc.) resulted in an unbroken string of Top 40 gems from the late sixties through the early seventies. Although McCoo's husband, Billy Davis Jr. succeeded in piercing the gang's RNB  bubblegum with a delicious blast of gospel grit on the second half of AQUARIUS/LET THE SUN SHINE IN (from the smash musical HAIR), for the most part, the 5D were as safe as Three Dog Night and the Grass Roots. The highlights---Up, Up and Away, Sweet Blindness, One Less Bell to Answer, Workin' On a Groovy Thing, Stoned Soul Picnic, Last Night I Didn't Get to Sleep at All---are many here, from five talented performers more than able to take vocal harmony to another dimension. RATING: FIVE  BELLS
