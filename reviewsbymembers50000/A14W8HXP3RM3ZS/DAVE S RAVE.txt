 DAVE EDMUNDS-REPEAT WHEN NECESSARY: Welsh revivalist rocker Dave Edmunds' finest hour rings in on this companion album to partner-in-rhyme Nick Lowe's equally vital LABOUR OF LUST (both were recorded simultaneously, utilizing their goodtime band Rockpile). The rockabilly rebel with the twangy geetar and a voice to match spews forth nothing but charisma, craftsmanship, and class, whether tackling (the definitive version of) Elvis Costello's ultra-clever GIRLS TALK, fellow angry young man Graham Parker's slam-banger CRAWLING FROM THE WRECKAGE, or country bootkicker QUEEN OF HEARTS (stolen, nearly note for note by Juice Newton). But that's only the "hits", folks and fans; monster mash CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, bluesy shuffle BAD IS BAD (Huey Lewis and the WHO?...), and the Wall of Sound melody TAKE ME FOR A LITTLE WHILE are considerably more of a good thing. Edmunds, as well known for his production values (he's twiddled the knobs for everyone from the Fabulous Thunderbirds to the Everly Brothers) as his "where have I heard this great stuff before" musical ability, is a rock 'n roll flame keeper of the highest order, as this slab o' sound makes perfectly obvious. Repeat when necessary: crank this sucker up!...crank this sucker up!...RATING: FIVE FRETS
