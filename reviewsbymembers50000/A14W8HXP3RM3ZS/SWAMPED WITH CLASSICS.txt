 Show me a cat who grew up in the 70's who doesn't own a copy of this anthology (and still plays it), and I'll show you a cat who also doesn't like brewskis, the Three Stooges, and Looney Tunes (in other words, I don't trust 'im). One of the ten GREATEST greatest hits collections ever, John Fogerty's band of rowdys covered all the touchstones of rock and roll, from blues to country to wailin' soul, and did it bigger and better than almost anyone else. Charismatic, gritty, often spooky, occasionally sentimental, CCR effortlessly channeled old timey ditties (DOWN ON THE CORNER, TRAVELIN' BAND), psychedelic swamp (RUN THROUGH THE JUNGLE, GREEN RIVER), take no prisoners rock (UP AROUND THE BEND, SWEET HITCH-HIKER), even tasteful covers (an eleven minute reconfiguration of I HEARD IT THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE) and had hits with nearly everything they touched. Twenty tracks of triumphant twang, and they STILL didn't have enough room for quagmire classic BORN ON A BAYOU or their country-fried take on MIDNIGHT SPECIAL! They hadda save 'em for CHRONICLE, VOL. 2, a nearly as good sequel that concentrates as much on rootsy covers of RNB, blues, and folk chestnuts as on Fogerty's dyed in the wool originals. But start with CHRONICLE/THE 20 GREATEST HITS...and maybe I'll trust you from now on. RATINGS: FIVE PLAID SHIRTS
