 THE BAND-THE BEST OF THE BAND: The Band was composed of five uniquely talented roots-rock musicians (who, among other things, could play everything from traditional rock instruments to mandolin, tuba, accordian and nearly anything else between them) whose legacy can only be scratched by this too brief anthology. Guitarist Robbie Robertson penned most of their output, though sticksman Levon Helm and bass player Rick Danko provided the bulk of the group's earthy, everyman vocals, leaving Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel to round out their instantly identifiable sound with rich keyboard textures. Country, rock, gospel, blooze, RNB, jazz, and more were all part of the Band's basic blend; witness their "hits" THE NIGHT THEY DROVE OLD DIXIE DOWN (AM radio listeners, think Joan Baez' cover), UP ON CRIPPLE CREEK, and THE WEIGHT, some of the most poignant story songs in all of pop. From Danko's quavering vocal on the lovely STAGE FRIGHT and IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE to Helm's funky attitude on THE SHAPE I'M IN and Marvin Gaye oldie DON'T DO IT, this ex backup group for Dylan stood head and shoulders above most of their competition, sounding just as vital today as they did thirty years ago. How many other "bands" can say that? RATING: FIVE EASY PIECES
