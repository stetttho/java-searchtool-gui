 ROKY ERICKSON & THE ALIENS-THE EVIL ONE: As delicious a slab of downright devilish dementia as ANYTHING Alice Cooper ever conjured up, this ex-13th Floor Elevators head case (literally---he fried himself in the psychedelic 60's Syd Barrett style, though at least he still sporadically records) exhumes a real winner here. Produced by former Creedence bassist Stu Cook, the song titles read like an old Saturday afternoon MONSTER FEATURE marathon: CREATURE WITH THE ATOM BRAIN, NIGHT OF THE VAMPIRE, I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, and IF YOU HAVE GHOSTS, to name a smatttering. All are shrieked, shouted, and screeched in Erickson's patented Charles Manson-meets-Frankenstein delivery (Now THAT would be a movie!), convincing even the casual listener that while Ozzy and Rob Zombie may SING about demons, this cat is the truly unhinged one, and actually HAS them. Check out the frantic rock and raunch disemboweling of DON'T SHAKE ME LUCIFER, the haunting ode IT'S A COLD NIGHT FOR ALLIGATORS, or the comparatively serene (but still creepy) CLICK YOUR FINGERS APPLAUDING THE PLAY at you own risk---Roky Erickson is an audio exorcism that will leave you either disgusted or amazed, but never EVER bored! (Unlike a certain bat biting Beezle-boob). RATING: FIVE BLOODY HAMMERS
