 THE ROLLING STONES-FORTY LICKS: Here's the most comprehensive Rolling Stones double disc classics roundup since HOT ROCKS hit the streets all those eons ago. Even disregarding their less than essential nineties (and beyond) output, the cleverly titled FORTY LICKS still contains a rump-load of sassy, brassy, bloozey, ballsy, timeless, raunchy, yes even sexy (seen Keith lately?) rock satisfaction no other band can even come close to. Disco stab MISS YOU, Keith Richards' crackling vocal on HAPPY, psychedelia-soaked SHE'S A RAINBOW, BROWN SUGAR's risque bravado, and more, more, MORE add up to THE only Stones compilation you'll really ever need. And by the way, all you self-respecting rock fans, no matter what your age (seen Keith lately?), you DO need a thorough Stones collection in YOUR collection. It's only rock 'n roll, but you like it. RATING: FIVE SMOKES
