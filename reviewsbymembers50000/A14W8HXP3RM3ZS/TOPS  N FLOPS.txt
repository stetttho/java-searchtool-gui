 Originally "That Li'l Ol Band From Texas" was a greasy power trio steeped deep in gutbucket southern blues rock which served them and their legions of fans admirably. Then, dependin' on how you look at it (or hear it), disaster struck. That infernal curse of rock and roll, the dreaded synthesizer, crept into and began to dominate their sound, starting with the mega-selling ELIMINATOR (the album with the red hotrod logo, that, along with shades, gyrating "Top-ettes", and Rip Van Winkle beards, has become their schtick in trade ever since). If any or all elements of this MTV makeover appalls the RNB purist in you, then pick up a copy of THE BEST OF ZZ TOP, crank up TUSH, LA GRANGE, AND BEER DRINKERS AND HELL RAISERS, and pretend the band called it quits in 1982. Otherwise, read on: GREATEST HITS offers SHARP DRESSED MAN, and GIMME ALL YOUR LOVIN', the best of their musical metamorphesis, while SLEEPING BAG and DOUBLEBACK (the latter sounds like EXACTLY what they did on this cannibalization of their big 80's hits) represents the nadir. Much more of a hoot (read: bluesier/grittier) are the previously mentioned booty ode TUSH, the chug-fest LA GRANGE (John Lee Hooker even sued 'em for rippin' off his riffs on that one), and the funky fashion statement CHEAP SUNGLASSES. Why the threesome's crunchy cover of SAM AND DAVE's soul wailer I THANK YOU is missing from the lineup is a mystery for the ages.  A new version of VIVA LAS VEGAS, complete with Elvis soundbites, is either good or awful, depending on your tolerance for such stuff. In short, if you like your ZZ over the Top, GREATEST HITS is a no-brainer. RATING: THREE BEARDS
