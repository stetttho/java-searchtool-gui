 Art rockers Kansas (whose trademark sound incorporated Robbie Steinhardt's violin, much as Jethro Tull utilized Ian Anderson's flute) will always be mainly recalled for their trio of radio hits: the bombastic CARRY ON WAYWARD SON, the mellow 70s prom staple DUST IN THE WIND, and the sprightly POINT OF KNOW RETURN. Unfortunately, BEST OF rounds up all of those overplayed staples while choosing to ignore Kansas' worthy second-tier "hits" such as PORTRAIT, PEOPLE OF THE SOUTH WIND, and WHAT'S ON MY MIND.  Even worse, those little gems are passed over in favor of slick schtick like PLAY THE GAME TONIGHT and FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE. Kansas sounds far too much like Styx here and not enough like themselves, thanks to fill-in vocalist John Elefante on both and the omission of Steinhardt's strings on the latter.  Three "bonus" tunes tacked onto this remastered roundup add nothing but time to the length of the disc. The wise consumer would be better off checking out vital albums LEFTOVERTURE and POINT OF KNOW RETURN. That's where the REAL best of Kansas, in all their overwrought glory, lies. RATING: TWO FIDDLESTYX
