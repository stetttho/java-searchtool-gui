 In which the band with the hardest name to spell in all of music, releases a compilation with the most unappetizing title, particularly given their grisly fate over a quarter century ago. Southern rock's second best act (sorry, but the Allmans got there first) has put out more greatest hits packages than they ever did original albums (an old Who trick), but this lame roundup was one of the "fyrst" and "wyrst". Sorely lacking in actual "best of" moments, "Innyrds" leaves out bona fide staples too numerous to mention here, instead substituting dogs like SWAMP MUSIC and DOUBLE TROUBLE, plus a pedestrian reading of diner counter warhorse TRUCK DRIVIN' MAN (stick with J. Geils' funky cover, folks). While the grand Neil Young slam SWEET HOME ALABAMA, cautionary classic THAT SMELL, and rowdy roadhouse romp GIMME THREE STEPS all demonstrate how seamlessly Ronnie Van Zant and the boys fused rock, boogie and country, it just ain't enough of a good thing, which is the whole purpose of these retrospectives in the first place. And who in the name of white lightnin' needs an OUTTAKE version of the most overrated, overplayed 70s epic this side of STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, FREE TURD? For a much easier to digest Skynyrd legacy package, check out either GOLD AND PLATINUM, or the spankin' new THYRTY-THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY COLLECTION. Both double discs that cover all the right bases, even if the latter gives over too much space to the inferior Johnny Van Zant-era. Score one of those, and "TURN IT UP!" RATING: TWO LITTLE
