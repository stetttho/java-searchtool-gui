 At last, a little truth in advertising! Here is truly the ultimate career spanning collection from the best and baddest soul group EVER, Motown or otherwise. The temptin' Temptations were blessed with a trio of powerhouse lead singers, from David Ruffin's pleading, sexy growl to Eddie Kendricks' otherwordly falsetto to Dennis Edwards' mighty macho screams; the payoff was the longest list of RNB and pop classics by anyone out there. Motown maestro Smokey Robinson provided them with an embarrassment of musically creamy, lyrically cunning masterpieces such as GET READY, THE WAY YOU DO THE THINGS YOU DO, DON'T LOOK BACK, and of course MY GIRL. Likewise, the incredible composing team of Norman Whitfield and Barrett (MONEY) Strong helped the Tempts score later smashes via earthier, frequently topical material (PAPA WAS A ROLLIN' STONE, BALL OF CONFUSION, and AIN'T TOO PROUD TO BEG). Though their lineup was constantly shaken by personal turmoil (four of the original quintet died tragic deaths), the Temptations were, to quote a hit for which there was apparently not enough room here, SUPERSTAR's of the highest magnitude, leaving behind a wellspring of timeless gems to prove it. RATING: FIVE TEMPTATION WALKS
