 Mountain's Leslie West and Mama Cass aside, rock has produced precious few 300 pound icons, and nary a one like this ex-Ted Nugent vocalist, Motown artist, and ROCKY HORROR SHOW actor who had the good fortune to hook up with musically bombastic, lyrically longwinded composer/pianist Jim Steinman for BAT OUT OF HELL.  Even if you never heard a note, this everything INCLUDING the kitchen sink masterpiece deserves legendary status for its cover art ALONE. Backed by a cast as quirky as Edgar Winter, Ellen (NIGHT COURT) Foley, motormouth baseball legend Phil Rizzuto, and Todd Rundgren and Utopia, Meat's debut was unlike any other (even he couldn't top it, years later, with sequel cash-in BAT OUT OF HELL II). The songs, if you can call 'em that, crammed with ultra-clever wordplay, diabolical twists, and maniacal musical manuevers, are really mini-plays; boy-meets-girl barnburner PARADISE BY THE DASHBOARD LIGHT is divided into three subtitled acts. Guitar/producer guru Rundgren literally lets rip like a Harley in heat on the hopped up title track, while the Loaf sweetly laments lost lust on TWO OUT OF THREE AIN'T BAD; on ALL REVVED UP WITH NO PLACE TO GO you can almost smell the sexual sweat. This LP is every shred as vital to 70s rock history as any by Pink Floyd or Led Zeppelin, and lost more fun to digest, too. He may be thinner now, and sport a better hairstyle, but BAT OUT OF HELL will forever remain Meat Loaf's meal ticket to musical immortality. RATING: FIVE SCARVES
