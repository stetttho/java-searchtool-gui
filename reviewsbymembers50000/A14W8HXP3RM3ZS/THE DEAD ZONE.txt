 GRATEFUL DEAD-SKELETONS FROM THE CLOSET: I don't get it. Perhaps because I have never taken a long strange trip with either the Dead in concert or via some illegal diversion, I've yet to understand what all the hoopla's about. If I were to judge solely from this cleverly titled sampling of "hits" (Jerry and his gang were no more a singles band than Pink Floyd), I'd have to conclude that they were a reasonably talented country/rock/folk ensemble that barely holds my interest beyond FM staples TRUCKIN', FRIEND OF THE DEVIL, and UNCLE JOHN'S BAND. As for TURN ON YOUR LOVE LIGHT, I much prefer the funk-fired Edgar Winter/White Trash concert version, and where oh where is that understated thing of rare beauty, BOX OF RAIN?  This collection isn't for true Deadheads (who'd rather hear jams longer than these eleven tunes combined) any more than is it for converting those of us who scratch our noggins and mutter the folowing joke: What did the Deadhead say when his buzz wore off?..."This is the worst @&#$ music I've ever heard!!!"---RATING: THREE BARE FEET
