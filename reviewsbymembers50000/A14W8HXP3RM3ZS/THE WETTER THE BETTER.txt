 WET WILLIE-GREATEST HITS: One of seventies southern rock's best kept secrets, the funk/blues/rock ensemble from Alabama known as Wet Willie (no, it wasn't just one cat) unfortunately never scaled the heights of their Capricorn label-mates the Allman Brothers or Marshall Tucker. Only one bona fide hit, the pleasurable reggae-tinged romp KEEP ON SMILIN' exists on this ten track anthology, but don't let that phase you. Lead vocal wailer, sax and harp player extraordinaire Jimmy Hall gooses the boys through a savory mix of blues shouters (Otis Redding's frantic SHOUT BAMALAMA and LITTLE MILTON's GRITS AIN'T GROCERIES), plus their own earthy compositions (instrumental workout RED HOT CHICKEN, country capsule DIXIE ROCK, and funk stew EVERYTHING THAT 'CHA DO WILL COME BACK TO YOU). Though they scored a handful of slicker minor hits (STREET CORNER SERENADE, WEEKENDS) a couple years later for another record company, GREATEST HITS is still the best place to start Wettin' your appetite for Willie. RATING: FIVE WET ONES
