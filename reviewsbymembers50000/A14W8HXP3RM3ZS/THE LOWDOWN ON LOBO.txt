 Surprisingly, there are several slightly different anthologies out there of this mellow seventies singer/composer, but this is the best of the bunch. Rhino Records' more comprehensive BEST OF has too many tracks at eighteen, while Curb's GREATEST HITS contains too few choice charters. The ten track sampler I'D LOVE YOU TO WANT ME (named for one of Lobo's biggest successes) is just enough of the good stuff, omitting only his last hit WHERE WERE YOU WHEN I WAS FALLING IN LOVE. His likable novelty debut ME AND YOU AND A DOG NAMED BOO, and melancholy love stories HOW CAN I TELL HER, DON'T EXPECT ME TO BE YOUR FRIEND, and IT SURE TOOK A LONG, LONG TIME will have all but the most jaded listener humming along agreeably. A remake of Cymarron's RINGS and the childlike ditty A SIMPLE MAN also fit in with Lobo's country/pop style. Although little more than a trivia question today, Lobo was one of the classier entries in the era of soft rock. RATING: FOUR EASY LISTENINGS
