 Since nearly all of leather-clad pre-Riot GRRRL Joan Jett's biggest hits were cover versions anyway---even I Love Rock and Roll was originally an English hit for the Arrows---an entire LP of rock classic remakes makes perfect sense. Numerous artists have released all-cover platters of their fave influences, including the Ramones and Rush, but Jett's ripping trip through time is one of the genre's best. The smartly titled Hit List showcases the Blackheart Babe's crunching, glam-punctuated takes on AC/DC's DIRTY DEES DONE DIRT CHEAP, ZZ Top's lusty anthem TUSH, and even PRETTY VACANT, from fellow punk pioneers the Sex Pistols. For contrast, the Kinks' doleful tribute to Hollywood's past, CELLULOID HEROES, and Nazareth's biggest number LOVE HURTS also get the nod. Like Brownsville Station before her, this Suzi Quatro protege can give nearly any oldie, be it TIME HAS COME TODAY or ROADRUNNER, the Gary Glitter treatment and make it seem like her own idea. This SOUNDS like Joan Jett's greatest hits, and you'll have so much fun listening, you won't even care that none of them really are.....RATING: FOUR BLACK HEARTS
