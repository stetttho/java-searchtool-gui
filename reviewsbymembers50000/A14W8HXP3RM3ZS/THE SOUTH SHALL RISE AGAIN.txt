 REBEL ROUSERS-SOUTHERN ROCK CLASSICS: This is only one of many collections out there chronicling that whiskey soaked, good ole boy genre of the 70's called Southern Rock, but at least this one has a decent pedigree...Brownsville Station leader/music historian Cub Koda compiled it and penned the liner notes.  Lynyrd Skynyrd, plus spin-off act the Rossington-Collins Band and current lead vocalist Johnny Van Zant get the nod, as do leading genre label Capricorn Records stablemates the Allman Brothers (irrefutable classic STATESBOROUGH BLUES), Elvin Bishop (FOOLED AROUND AND FELL IN LOVE, more of a pop piece, helmed by Starship singer Mickey Thomas), and the Marshall Tucker Band's homey HEARD IT IN A LOVE SONG. Surprisingly absent here is Texas boogie 'n blues trio ZZ Top, which I suspect has something to do with licensing rights, since they seldom appear on anybody's rebel roundups. Toss in obscure rocker Travis Wammack's take on the James Gang's FUNK #49 and Black Oak Arkansas' raunchy reading of RNB staple JIM DANDY, and ya got yerself a one hour party-hearty package...all that's missin' is a little white lightnin'! RATING: FOUR OVERSIZED BELT BUCKLES
