 A misnomer is what you're getting here. Paul Rodgers put the "Bad" in Bad Co. with his earthbound, grit-rimmed vocals and climactic lyrical ad-libbing, but once replaced (and I use that term VERY loosely) by pedestrian singer Brian Howe, their shooting star fizzled. This concert cash-in on hits old and new is also minus the rock-steady bottom of bassist Boz Burrell, but Rodgers is the key omission. Better to check out the recent live Bad Co. offering MERCHANTS OF FORTUNE,  still featuring only half the original members, but at least one is  ex-Free wailer Rodgers. On WHAT YOU HEAR IS WHAT YOU GET, early Bad Co. classics FEEL LIKE MAKIN' LOVE and ROCK 'N ROLL FANTASY still rule over latter day fluff HOW ABOUT THAT and NO SMOKE WITHOUT FIRE, demonstrating how their songwriting also suffered after Paul's exit. As far as classic rock is concerned, this lifeless concert attempt will put you in pretty bad company. RATING: TWO THUDS
