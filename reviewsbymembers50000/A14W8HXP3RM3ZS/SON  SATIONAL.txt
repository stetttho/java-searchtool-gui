 The so called Alabama Wild Man was a triple threat talent in the seventies, playing hotshot session guitar for everyone from Elvis (who covered both his GUITAR MAN and U.S. MALE) on down, scoring charismatic smashes of his own including the swampy ode AMOS MOSES and the catch-phrase classic WHEN YOU'RE HOT YOU'RE HOT, and serving as Burt Reynolds' motion picture makin' cronie in GATOR and SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT. THE ESSENTIAL JERRY REED is exactly what the title suggests: all the witty, gritty good ole boy antics you could ever ask for, and probably more. From the autobiographical GUITAR MAN to the introspective SMELL THE FLOWERS to the sprightly instrumental THE CLAW, Reed adroitly covers all the bases. Still, it's the novelty numbers he's best known for, and he hardly disappoints in that category. LORD, MR. FORD is one of the wittiest "car-tunes" since Chuck Berry wrote NO MONEY DOWN, while SHE GOT THE GOLDMINE (I GOT THE SHAFT) is as much fun as divorce songs get, and ANOTHER PUFF is the SMOKE, SMOKE, SMOKE THAT CIGARETTE of its era. Toss in SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT trucker favorite EAST BOUND AND DOWN, and THE BIRD, about a biped that imitates George Jones and Willie Nelson, and you've got yourself an album that's both funny AND funky. Make no mistake son, this is the BEST "best of" Jerry Reed that your dollar can buy. RATING: FOUR GUITAR PICKS
