 Ever notice that nearly every single major Looney Tunes star had some sort of a speech impediment or accent issue? Think about it...Elmer Fudd's was vewwwy pwominent. Tweety uttered baby talk, and Sylvester had the thloppietht lithp thith thide of Thindy Brady. The Tazmanian Devil rarely strung more than a couple of intelligible words together, Pepe Le Pew spouted fractured French, and Speedy Gonzales is nowadays considered politically incorrect for his stereotypical south of the border delivery. And i don't even wanna get INTO Porky Pig's problems. Only fast-talking Bugs Bunny his own wascally self seemed to  escape unincumbered in the diction department (he only spoke in brash Brookyln-nese, quite fitting for such a lovable stinker). My point, you ask? Quite simply, Mel Blanc's superhuman (supercritter?) voice characterizations ALONE would easily qualify these as the greatest collection of cartoon clowns, connivers, and crazies ever to grace celluloid. But that's not all, folks! Throw in directors extraordinaire Chuck Jones, Friz Feleng, and Bob McKimson, magical musical maestro Carl Stalling, and the dozens of top-drawer animators and writers who made these 'toons so looney, and you've got 14 cawwot gold!
