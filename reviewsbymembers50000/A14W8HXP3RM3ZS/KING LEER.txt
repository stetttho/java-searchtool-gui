 BILLY IDOL-GREATEST HITS: In which the ex-Generation X (so THAT'S where that term came from) belter finally gets his due with a decent, comprehensive career compilation (1987's VITAL IDOL just didn't cut it). At the dawn of new wave, the bleach blonde belter with the best sneer since King Elvis turned out a pumping fistful of punk-friendly radio classics, not as dangerous as the Sex Pistols nor as wooden as the Cars. Between the club floor thump of DANCING WITH MYSELF and tough Tommy James retread MONY MONY, the slightly creepy (especially if you recall the video) WHITE WEDDING, and the rebel yell of, well, REBEL YELL, Idol had early 80's radio playlists sewed up, and rightly so. Later singles scarcely packed the same kick in the head, although EYES WITHOUT A FACE is a decent ballad.  A cover of the Doors' anthem L.A. WOMAN is soulless and superfluous, as is the obligatory "new" track, a dull regurgitation of Simple Minds' DON'T YOU FORGET ABOUT ME. At least the guy more often than not had the fun-lovin' attitude to back up the sneer, so if Billy's your Idol, then this is your anthology. RATING: FOUR STIFF UPPER LIPS
