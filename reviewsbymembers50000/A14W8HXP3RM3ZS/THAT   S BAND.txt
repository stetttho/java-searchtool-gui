 CHEAP TRICK: AUTHORIZED GREATEST HITS: Cheap Trick successfully mixed a Beatle-esque power pop sensibility with crunchy guitar riffs, its tongue planted a mile in its cheek. Two guys that LOOKED like pin-up boy rock stars, and two that looked more like a Bowery Boy and a used car salesman respectively, the Tricksters managed a handful of radio-ready diehards in SURRENDER (complete with klassic Kiss reference), the LIVE AT BUDOKAN rave-up I WANT YOU TO WANT ME, and, much later, ballad biggie THE FLAME. This overview also trots out slick staples such as a rowdy rendition of Fats Domino's AIN'T THAT A SHAME (though, strangely, not their percussive treatment of Elvis' DON'T BE CRUEL, nor their Fab Four clone cover of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR), bouncy shoulda-been-a-hit SOUTHERN GIRLS, and the theme to THAT 70'S SHOW (THAT 70'S SONG). As with any compilation, certain worthy tracks ('ELLO KIDDIES, VOICES, CALIFORNIA MAN) are missing in action, but this is due more to the boys' wealth of decent material than to careless selection. All in all, a pretty neat trick.  FIVE GUITAR NECKS
