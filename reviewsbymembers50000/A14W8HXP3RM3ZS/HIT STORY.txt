 Sometimes referred to as a poor man's Crosby, Stills and Nash, America actually had much more to offer, and to their fans at least, were ultimately more listenable than the similar, vastly overrated Eagles. Dewey Bunnel's unmistakably forlorn fog of a voice was to Don Henley and Steve Stills what Gerry Beckley's sweet, sensitive delivery was to Glenn Frey and Graham Nash. Probably best known as a singles band, HISTORY (with cover art from the late PHIL HARTMAN, of SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE fame) sums up the bulk of America's chart heyday in an even dozen bites, from the haunting first hit A HORSE WITH NO NAME to grammer teacher's nightmare TIN MAN---as in "Oz never did give nothing to the Tin Man"---to fun folk rocker SISTER GOLDEN HAIR. FM rock jam-fest SANDMAN and a pre-Captain and Tennille MUSKRAT LOVE appear here, as well as semi hits DAISY JANE and WOMAN TONIGHT, so all that's really missing is latter day smash YOU CAN DO MAGIC, really more of a career footnote than an important song. As far as these things go, HISTORY ranks right up there with other 70's compilation classix by James Taylor and the Doobies. Could they be improved upon? Probably. Should they be? Nahhh.
