 One of Southern Rock's last gritty, greasy great gasps, these guys kicked more hiney than a high school football coach, letting fly with a raunchy, raspy ROCK 'N ROLL attitude flecked with country, blues, and bar band boogie. Helmed by bad boy belter/geetar slinger Dan Baird, the Satellites had it all... brontosaurus chops, snotty swagger, AND a sense of humor (which never hurt NOBODY nohow in the music biz). Monster hit KEEP YOUR HANDS TO YOURSELF sets the piledriver pace for this career roundup appropriately named after one of Chuck Berry's most tread upon pieces (Bob Seger's good, but he ain't THIS good!). Crash 'n burn covers (HIPPY HIPPY SHAKE, originally written and performed by Chan Romero, Caesar's son), Ringo's DON'T PASS ME BY (one of but two Beatles tunes he penned), and a party perfect John Fogerty medley of ALMOST SATURDAY NIGHT/ROCKIN' ALL OVER THE WORLD blend seamlessly with Baird's bare bones double entendre OPEN ALL NIGHT and the bloozey ALL OVER BUT THE CRYIN'. Cranked to an especially high thrash threshold is Terry Anderson's BATTLESHIP CHAINS, not quite three minutes of rock so primitive I'm surprised Fred and Barney didn't write it. Love it loud? Need it nasty? Crave it crazy? Trust me. The Georgia Satellites will put you into orbit! RATING: FIVE BEER BLASTS
