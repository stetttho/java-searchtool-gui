 DAVID BOWIE-CHANGESBOWIE: If ever a word aptly described the former David (Don't call me a Monkee) Jones, the title of his early classic CHANGES would be it. From the beautifully eerie SPACE ODDITY and wham-glam of SUFFRAGETTE CITY, to the neo-soul of YOUNG AMERICANS and the calculated club cut LET'S DANCE,  Bowie has seldom repeated himself. A seamless combination of the CHANGESONEBOWIE and CHANGESTWOBOWIE anthologies, here is most everything you could ask for hit-wise, the lone downer being a less than necessary remix of FAME. Throughout his career, the Thin White Duke has been blessed with a long line of stellar guitar foils, including Mick Ronson, Carlos Alomar, Robert Fripp, even a pre-fame Stevie Ray Vaughn, yet it is Ziggy himself who is always the Starman.  RATING: FIVE OH BOWIES!
