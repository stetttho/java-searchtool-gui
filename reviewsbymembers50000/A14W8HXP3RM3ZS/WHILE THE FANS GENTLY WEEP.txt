 It's very hard to fathom why an event as tragic as Lonesome George's death still hasn't produced a decent single disc solo career retrospective for his fans. This shoddy mix of admittedly great Beatles bits, such as While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Taxman, and Something, and stellar solo hits like What is Life, My Sweet Lord, and Bangla Desh is over a quarter of a century old. I had it on 8-track fer cryin' out loud!! The Rodney Dangerfield of rock and roll deserves much, much better than this. So listen up, compilers that be! You'd best not be ignoring any of Harrison's later delicious semi-classics This Song, Blow Away, Apple Scruffs, Ding Dong Ding Dong, or Crackerbox Palace if you know what's good for you. Traveling Wilbury and Cloud Nine successes need to be acknowledged as well. Pop it all onto a twenty track disc.  And for the love of all that's sacred in this world, will you PUH-LEEEZE give the man some respectful cover art? This ghastly mess looks like a bootleg scan job if I ever winced at one! Poor George looks like he's wearing too much QT Tan! A Dark Horse indeed!!!
