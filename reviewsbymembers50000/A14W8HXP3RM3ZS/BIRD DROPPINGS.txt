 EAGLES-SELECTED WORKS 1972-1999: If ever a music act could be rightfully accused of "feathering their nest", it would have to be the Eagles. Never mind that they initiated the era of the overpriced concert ticket, charging a then unheard of $75 for their first reunion tour in the mid-90's. SELECTED WORKS 1972-1999 is a superflous box set that stretches the point by...oh, let's say twenty years (after their last studio LP, '79's THE LONG RUN, they've only managed to dole out five new songs, none memorable). Worse, if you already own the Eagles' half dozen albums, you also own everything here, save a lame live disc containing a pair of tracks from Don (You want your face ta freeze like that, dude?) Henley's solo flight, a Joe Walsh tune, a Tom Waits cover, and not one, but TWO Xmas cuts! So how many EAGLES concert classics IS that exactly? (Don't even bother doing the math-even THOSE are available elsewhere). Let's call this un-thology what it really is---THE GOOSE (or better, THE TURKEY) THAT LAID THE GOLDEN NEST EGG! Man, I sure hope Randy Meisner is at least gettin' his cut! RATING: ONE BAD YOLK
