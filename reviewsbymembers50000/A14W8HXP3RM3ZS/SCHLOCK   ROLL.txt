 The King of Kitsch, Kraziness and all things Kooky deftly rounds up an asylum-full of novelty nincompoops, just as on his long running weekly syndicated radio show. If you like this sort of thing (and who, short of the deceased, doesn't?), the spoils are almost embarrassingly endless here. Weird Al Yankovic (a Dr. Demento apprentice) jump-starts the fun with one of his best song titles (and parodies) ever, SMELLS LIKE NIRVANA. Then there's that timeless tribute to everyone's fave knucklehead, THE CURLY SHUFFLE...Trekkie wet dream HIGHLY ILLOGICAL from Leonard ("I am not...ahhh, the HELL with it! I really AM spock!") Nimoy, not to mention Bobby "Boris" Pickett's spot-on satire STAR DREK...TIMOTHY, The Buoys' macabre ode to cannibalism (penned by Rupert PINA COLADA SONG Holmes)...Brownsvile Station's twisted blues-clashes-with-sci-fi feast MARTIAN BOOGIE...Da Yoopers' hilarious stinker SECOND WEEK OF DEER CAMP...Meri Wilson's double entendre delight PETER THE METER READER...The Chips' original gobbledygook version of the Blues Brothers-associated RUBBER BISCUIT...even the rare as a porkpie hat SONG OF THE SEWER, courtesy one Art "Ed Norton" Carney, fer cryin' (laughin'?) out loud!!! Sicko oldtimers Tiny Tim, Spike Jones and Demento regular Benny Bell also share space with artists as diverse as folkie Christine Lavin and gross-out rockers Green Jelly, keeping the fun/pain threshold at an excrutiatingly high level. LISTEN WITH CAUTION!!! RATING: FIVE BELLY-LAUGHS
