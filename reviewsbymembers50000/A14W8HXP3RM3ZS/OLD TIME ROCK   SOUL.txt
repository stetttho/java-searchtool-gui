 RARE EARTH-GREATEST HITS AND RARE CLASSICS: Rare Earth was something of an oddity at Motown: an all white, self contained rock act that played with unadulterated soul. Starting with a gritty revamping of the Temptations' Smokey Robinson-sired classic GET READY and following up with a similarly reworked (I KNOW) I'M LOSING YOU (another Tempts hit), they were powered by the mighty vocal explosions of sticksman Peter Riviera and Gil Bridges' tasty woodwind accents. Worthy follow-ups included life-affirming anthem I JUST WANT TO CELEBRATE, HEY BIG BROTHER's hypnotic pulse, and the against type (and Bee Gees assisted) disco charter WARM RIDE, but even the non hits ("Rare Classics") deserve a spin. BIG JOHN IS MY NAME is a funky, chunky slab of fuzz tone/wah wah-injected psychedelia, while HUM ALONG AND DANCE invites you to do just that. At twenty cuts, GREATEST HITS is perhaps too much of a groovy thing for the uninitiated, but better too much Rare Earth than too little, I always say. RATING: FOUR BIG BEATS
