 BREAD-ANTHOLOGY OF BREAD: THE definition of seventies "soft rock", David Gates and company could be enjoyed by teenagers and parents alike, hence their incredible popularity. AM radio fairly resounded with their folky and sweet, gentle and non-confrontational ballads and love songs, even though ANTHOLOGY demonstrates that occasionally a Jim Griffin rocker (TRUCKIN', not the Dead version) broke up the pace. From the wah-wah pedal punctuation of GUITAR MAN to the dulcet melodies of EVERYTHING I OWN, SWEET SURRENDER and IF, Bread's sound was instantly recognizable and equally welcome, offending no one other than brain-fried fans of the one chord/one idea rock dinosaurs so typical of their era. Though this 20 tune collection would have been almost as good if it just included their dozen or so hits, true fans will savor this chance to delve a little deeper into the soul of Bread. RATING: FOUR CRUMBS
