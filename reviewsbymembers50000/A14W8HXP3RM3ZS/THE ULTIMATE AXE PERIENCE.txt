 JIMI HENDRIX-THE ULTIMATE EXPERIENCE: There are literally dozens of discs out there that chronicle the pyrotechnic (in more ways than one) career of Jimi Hendrix, but THE ULTIMATE EXPERIENCE lives up to its title. Twenty terrific tracks touch upon all the important bases, including FM cornerstones (FOXY LADY, PURPLE HAZE), hopped up blues (the riveting RED HOUSE, plus VOODOO CHILE, which HENDRIX disciple STEVIE RAVE ON later tackled), his only Top 40 hit (ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER, only one of the most innovative Dylan remakes ever), psychedelia (CASTLES MADE OF SAND), and classic concert covers (STAR SPANGLED BANNER and WILD THING, barely recognizable via Hendrix' twisted visions). This is one of the best single CD history lessons imaginable, from the man who shook, rattled, and rolled rock music to its very core; the aftershocks are still being felt over three decades later.
