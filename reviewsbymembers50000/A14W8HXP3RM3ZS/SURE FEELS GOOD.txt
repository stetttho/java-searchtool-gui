 Folks who know Elvin Bishop solely due to his 1976 Top Ten entry FOOLED AROUND AND FELL IN LOVE (sung by a pre-Starship Mickey Thomas) are missing out on what true fans have long known---the former Paul Butterfield Blues Band axe slinger's real stock in trade is soulful country boy pyrotechnics and a downhome sense of humor. Possessing a considerably homelier set of vocal chords than Thomas is just a part of Pigboy Crabshaw's earthy charm on cuts like the aptly titled SURE FEELS GOOD. Semi hits include the funk-filled STRUTTIN' MY STUFF and the lively gospel rock of TRAVELIN' SHOES on this too short (ten track) career review. If you crave more of this stuff, check out Elvin's series of fine blues efforts on Alligator Records. To quote the man his own self, it's more fun than STEALIN' WATERMELONS! RATING: FOUR YEEHAWS
