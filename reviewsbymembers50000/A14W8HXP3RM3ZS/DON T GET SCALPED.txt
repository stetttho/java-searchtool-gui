 Redbone fans (I know you're out there), BEWARE! Unfortunately, this is a batch of remakes which, while far from awful, are still a far cry from the funky RNB-heavy hits by America's greatest all Indian rock group (sorry Indigenous). Tribe leaders Pat and Lolly Vegas were very capable of turning out a catchy composition (Niki Hoeky, a hit for P. J. Proby), and their two biggest, the swamp-inflected "Witch Queen of New Orleans" and soulful smash "Come and Get Your Love" are both here of course. So is the lesser known FM hit "Maggie", a cover of "Poison Ivy", and the historical account "We Were All Wounded at Wounded Knee". It's just a shame that Redbone, like so many classic rockers past their expiration date, were talked into re-recording their catalogue for a quickie cash-in (the unimaginative album cover is a dead giveaway). Their legacy deserves better than "Greatest Songs" and actually, the 23 track "Golden Classics" is just that. Seek it out instead. It's the most fun since the Heckowi tribe ruled the roost on "F Troop"!  RATING:  TWO "UGH"S
