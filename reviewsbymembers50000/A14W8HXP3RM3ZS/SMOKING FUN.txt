 ROBERT CRAY-STRONG PERSUADER: This Grammy winning LP was both smooth 'n soulful singer/guitar slinger Robert Cray's commercial breakthrough and an introduction to the blues (along with Stevie Ray Vaughan's debut) for much of the rock crowd. SMOKING GUN, a fiesty slice of rockin' RNB that works as either a pop or a blues number propelled the dues-paying Cray's name into the stratosphere; the rest of STRONG PERSUADER is equally vital and delightful. I GUESS I SHOWED HER is a cleverly ironic piece of storytelling and FOUL PLAY laments the most popular subject in all of blues music---infidelity. Lending a soul-searing Stax credibility to the party is the legendary Memphis Horns, frequent guests on Cray albums, who punctuate the proceedings with righteous blasts of feel good funk. Here is the rare record you'll want to listen to all the way through, and often. RATING: FIVE FINGERS
