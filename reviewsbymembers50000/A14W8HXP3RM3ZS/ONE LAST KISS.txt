 KISS-THE VERY BEST OF KISS: Let's see now...just how many Kiss kompilations does this make?...Oops! My kalculater just imploded! Shout it out loud kids, at last they got it right! Here's pert' near all the Kiss klassix from the glory daze (STRUTTER, HARD LUCK WOMAN, CALLlNG DR. LOVE, ROCK AND ROLL ALL NITE, DETROIT ROCK CITY), to the (blessedly brief) disco phase (I WAS MADE FOR LOVIN' YOU) to the solo forays (Ace Frehley's funky NEW YORK GROOVE) to the make up challenged---"if we don't take it off now, we'll never be able to slap it back on"---years. Sure, BETH is a better power ballad than FOREVER and GOD GAVE ROCK 'N ROLL TO YOU should have stayed in Argent's catalogue, but at least they ignored concept disc THE ELDER and 90's desperation ploy I JUST WANNA, the WORST sex song since Billy Squier's SHE GOES DOWN. This won't be KISS' last greatest hits kash-in, but they'll never be able to make a better one. RATING: FIVE LOVE GUNS
