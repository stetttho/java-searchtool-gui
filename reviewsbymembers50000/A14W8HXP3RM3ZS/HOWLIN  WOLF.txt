 Boring cover art and a measly nine tracks aside, the fact that several of these are pulsating, showstopping live renditions should automatically tell the unitiated that the mighty J. Geils Band was one of THE premeire blues/rock concert acts of its or any other day. A ferocious hodgepodge of lean guitar work, swirling organ, heart-stopping harp, and the woofin' goofin' Peter Wolf's funky rasp, they OWNED covers of soul chestnuts "Lookin' For a Love", "Where Did Our Love Go", and "I Do". Their originals were equally classic: the reggae workout "Give It to Me", the complete pop perfection of "Musta Got Lost", and "Southside Shuffle"'s infectious RNB groove make this a House Party indeed! Again, it's MUCH too short, but I was going to get another brew anyhoo. WHAMMER JAMMER, DICKIE!!!
