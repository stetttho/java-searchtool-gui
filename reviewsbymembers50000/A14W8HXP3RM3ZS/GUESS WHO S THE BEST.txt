 For the Guess Who fan (and aren't we all?) who wants a near perfect collection of ALL their radio staples, plus just a tad more, this is the one to beat. More comprehensive than THE GREATEST OF THE GUESS WHO or THE BEST OF THE GUESS WHO, yet not as longwinded as their double disc anthology, this 18 track sampler includes all the post-Randy Bachman greats as well as the "classic" years during his tenure as Guess Who guitar guru. Lead vocalist Burton Commings belts with arena rock ferocity on righteous ravers NO TIME and AMERICAN WOMAN, yet croons with unbridled passion when needed (THESE EYES, LAUGHING). The keyboardist also contributes jazzy flute to B-side-gone-smash UNDUN, on which Bachman adds delicate axe colorings, much as he did later on B.T.O.'s LOOKIN' OUT FOR NUMBER ONE. Even the last gasp hits (STAR BABY, CLAP FOR THE WOLFMAN, DANCIN' FOOL) are good ones, and in between you get the singalong shoe-ins SHARE THE LAND and HAND ME DOWN WORLD, not to mention such cautionary tales as FOLLOW YOUR DAUGHTER HOME and GUNS, GUNS, GUNS. One spin of THE GUESS WHO'S GREATEST HITS will make readily apparent why they are truly one of Canada's most important exports.
