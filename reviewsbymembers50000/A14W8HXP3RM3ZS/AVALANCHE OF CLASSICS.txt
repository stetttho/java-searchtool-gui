 Though revivalist rockers Dave Edmunds and Nick Lowe made some of the late seventies' most satisfying retro masterpieces (albums REPEAT WHEN NECESSARY and LABOUR OF LUST for starters), usually only under one or the others' names, SECONDS OF PLEASURE is the only one credited to Rockpile, their crack genre surfing outfit. Overstuffed with covers of many of the artists whose influence they wore on their sleeves and a handful of Lowe/band originals, here is a joyous folk/RNB/rock romp on par with NRBQ's better efforts. Edmunds is, as always, in fine rockabilly vocal and guitar form, lettin' it rip through Chuck Berry's OH WHAT A THRILL, soul shouter Joe Tex's IF SUGAR WAS AS SWEET AS YOU, and bluesy novelty A KNIFE AND A FORK ("Girl, you let a knife and a fork dig your grave..."). Lowe likewise packs a pop wallop on radio ready ditties TEACHER TEACHER, NOW AND ALWAYS, and WHEN I WRITE THE BOOK, and even axe man Billy Bremner turns in a pair of goodtime lead vocals on chiming charmers HEART and YOU AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT FINE. The  party concludes with a quartet of "unplugged" Everly Brothers classics interpreted authentically by the Rockpile Brothers, Dave and Nick. If you are a fan of the "everything old is new" sound of, say, the Traveling Wilburys, you'd be doing yourself a great disservice not to LUNGE into this album. RATING: FIVE TWANGS
