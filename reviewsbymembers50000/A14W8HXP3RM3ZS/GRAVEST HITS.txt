 At long last, the powers that be have compiled every one of the former Vincent Furnier's gravest hits on a single disc. This is all twelve cuts from his seventies classic GREATEST HITS---my very first album purchase ever---plus ten more from his later ballad heavy career. Even ONLY WOMEN, I NEVER CRY, and YOU AND ME, though a far cry from his shock rock daze, are quality radio fare, plus you get the harder to find GENERATION LANDSLIDE, CLONES, and DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH, all pop gems in their own right. Forget his late eighties "comeback" schlock---only POISON is represented from that era, though the FRIDAY THE 13TH killer tune HE'S BACK (THE MAN BEHIND THE MASK) would have been a wiser choice.  This is class-sick Alice all the way. Welcome to his nightmare.  RATING:  FIVE
