 Ol' Slowhand has more concert DVDs out there than your average rock guitar God, and ONE MORE CAR ONE MORE RIDER his most recent roundup of blues and pop journeys is one of his better efforts. Backed by longtime band stalwarts Nathan East on bass and guitarist Andy Fairweather Low (with organ sideman to the stars Billy Preston thrown in for ultra good measure), EC pulls out several notable stops from the fine REPTILE album, including the pleasurable pop piece SHE'S GONE (no, not the Hall & Oates tune). You also get the timeless Muddy Waters-associated HOOCHIE COOCHIE MAN, the by now expected, but still poignant TEARS IN HEAVEN, and of course, J. J. Cale's ode to excess COCAINE, as well as a couple Cream and Derek and the Dominos favorites.  Thankfully, LAYLA is rendered in its original classic rock manner, not UNPLUGGED.  A pity Cale's equally outstanding AFTER MIDNIGHT or the seldom utilized six string showpiece LET IT RAIN couldn't have been squeezed in someplace, but at least musical maestro Preston gets to show his chops (not to mention some funky dance steps) on his near legendary WILL IT GO ROUND IN CIRCLES, a crowd pleasing encore. Clapton may have mellowed a bit with age, but his vocal and axe abilities have gone largely undiminished; to paraphrase his own overplayed wedding song staple, he was wonderful that night.
