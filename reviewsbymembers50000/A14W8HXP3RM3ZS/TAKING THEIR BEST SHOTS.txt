 38 SPECIAL-FLASHBACK: 38 Special was one of the more pop oriented (and most successful) Southern rock outfits, due more to co-lead singer/guitarist Don Barnes' ability to pen and sing righteous hooks than to the contributions of Donnie Van Zant (he of the famed trio of Van Zant brothers, two of which have anchored Lynyrd Skynyrd at opposite ends of that band's career). On early classics ROCKIN' INTO THE NIGHT and WILD EYED SOUTHERN BOYS the two shared vocal duties, but the group soon fared better chartwise (losing some of their edge in the process) when Barnes took over as frontman, leaving Van Zant with little to do but look on. Resulting big hits FANTASY GIRL, CAUGHT UP IN YOU, and HOLD ON LOOSELY, while top notch Top 40 fare, began to all sound alike, and soon enough Barnes dealt the gang a crushing blow by quitting their ranks for a still-born solo career. This necessitated the addition of capable but mellower  songwriter/vocalist Max Carl, who played a keyboard instead of an axe (later Carl also "subbed" for the irreplacable Mark Farner in a faux Grand Funk)...38 Special's cheesey prom anthem, the syrupy SECOND CHANCE (thankfully not included here), proved to be their last chance. The inevitable return of Barnes couldn't rescue the group from endless "Flashback" tours and hits repackagings. That said, this original anthology remains far and away their best, even if those Southern Boys ain't quite as wild as they used to be. RATING: FOUR BULLETS
