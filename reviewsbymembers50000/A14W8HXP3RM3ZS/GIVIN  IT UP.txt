 Betwixt playing harmonica on early 60's Bruce Channel classic HEY BABY, giving John Lennon a lesson or two on said instrument, having his compositions covered by everyone from Emmylou Harris (TWO MORE BOTTLES OF WINE) to the Blues Brothers (B-MOVIE BOX CAR BLUES) to Vince Gill (VICTIM OF LIFE'S CIRCUMSTANCES), scoring his own Top 40 hit GIVIN' IT UP FOR YOUR LOVE, recording for predominant blues label Alligator (and scores of others), and winning a Grammy for a duet with Bonnie Raitt, Delbert McClinton has seen it, done it, and sung it all. The Lubbock, Texas belter of all things blues, RNB, and country has deservedly been given the "Ultimate" package treatment by retro-specialist label HIP-O. Here are eighteen tasty as BAR-B-Q tracks of honky tonk sweat shouted out in the world weary rasp of a thousand smoke filled roadhouses. These meaty slabs of soul include IT AIN'T WHAT YOU EAT BUT THE WAY HOW YOU CHEW IT, THE JEALOUS KIND, LOVE RUSTLER, and patented takes on the afore mentioned hits for others. Like John Hiatt, Delbert McClinton may still not be a household name after lo' these many eons, but true relishers of raw roots music will always know where to go for a satisfying fix. RATING: FIVE HARPS
