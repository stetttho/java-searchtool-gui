 KISS-SMASHES, THRASHES AND HITS: There are a ton of KISS kompilations on the market, and not a perfect one in the bunch, but at least SMASHES is one of the few that mixes a smattering of their post-makeup years in with the dumb fun klassics of their salad days. Unfortunately, prom staple BETH, (from their high wtaer mark album DESTROYER) is heard in an "alternate" version here, with second drummer Eric Carr inexplicably replacing Peter Criss' vocals. The expected six-pack anthems ROCK AND ROLL ALL NITE and SHOUT IT OUT LOUD both made it, though the omissions of acoustic chestnut HARD LUCK WOMAN and lusty rocker CHRISTINE SIXTEEN are penciled-in eyebrow raisers. Ultra-commercial disco stab I WAS MADE FOR LOVIN' YOU, boot stomper I LOVE IT LOUD and their last mighty gasp LICK IT UP are the cream of KISS' second phase, miles better than "new" tracks LET'S PUT THE X IN SEX and (YOU MAKE ME) ROCK HARD, which are even worse than their titles suggest. Perhaps this anthology woulda been more appropriately titled SMASHES, TRASHES AND FLOPS---to paraphrase the Gruesome Foursome themselves, "You wanted the best...ummm, this just ain't it." RATING: THREE WAGGING TONGUES
