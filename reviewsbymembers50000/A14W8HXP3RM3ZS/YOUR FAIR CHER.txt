 If anyone ever needed a collection spanning all phases of her long career, it has to be the Dark Lady herself, who's made more "comebacks" than Shirley MacLaine...and Cher's are actually "on record". Hear the husky voiced quick-change artist in her role as: Sonny's Queen ("I Got You Babe", natch), Tall Tale Telling Queen ("Half Breed", "Dark Lady", the untouchable "Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves"), Disco Queen ("Take Me Home"), and Late 80's Comeback Queen ("Just Like Jesse James", the aptly titled "If I Could Turn Back Time"). Thankfully omitted are Cher's Rock Queen phase (Oh?...Missed that one?) and Electro-Dance Queen phase (Next time, leave the synthesized vocals and canned backbeat to Britney; you're above it, darling).  It woulda been nice if a few more "Sonny and..." chestnuts had been favored over such dreck as a Bon Jovi-assisted remake of her own "Bang Bang", and lyrics should have been included (ever notice Cher's mumbly-mouthed delivery is just a tad hard to understand sometimes?). But heck, it just wouldn't be Cher if she didn't need a little "overhauling". Now HERE'S an idea! How 'bout the WORST of Cher, featuring her duets with Gregg Allman and Meat Loaf, her early "I Love You Ringo" single, recorded as Bonnie Jo Mason, her work as leader of rock act Black Rose...PLEASE!! Somebody STOP me before I mention her post-"Believe" rehashes!!!
