 Some might suggest that one Foghat anthology was sufficient, but if you are a die-hard fan of the British boogie boys and their hamfisted hits, everything that missed the cut on BEST OF is here for the partyin'. Besides perhaps obligatory live takes on two of their biggest triumphs FOOL FOR THE CITY and I JUST WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU (available on volume one in their original versions), you get a fistful of near misses like the pumped up RNB remakes SOMEBODY'S BEEN SLEEPIN' IN MY BED and SLIPPED, TRIPPED, AND FELL IN LOVE, plus raucous readings of Sun Records shaker UBANGI STOMP and Buddy Holly's immortal THAT'LL BE THE DAY. Though personnel changes (notably the exit of slide guitarist Rod Price) led to a streamlining of the well tread Foghat sound, LIVE NOW-PAY LATER and STRANGER IN MY HOME TOWN remain catchy singles efforts. And NOTHIN' sounds better blastin' through the car speakers of your choice than WHAT A SHAME, a simply monstrous '73 slab of high octane rock that loudly demonstrates why Foghat, like a six-pack, goes down easily and leaves you feeling pretty durn good. RATING: FOUR BIC LIGHTERS
