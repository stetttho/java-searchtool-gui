 THE GRASS ROOTS-ALL TIME GREATEST HITS: The Grass Roots created some of the best doggone music on AM radio in its (and their) heyday. From the mid 60's through the early 70's, the faceless L.A. act managed a consistent string of hit singles chock full of near perfect pure pop nirvana. The bouncy MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS, SOONER OR LATER, and TEMPTATION EYES still have the power to have you singing along instantly, while the mellower strains of LET'S LIVE FOR TODAY and WHERE WERE YOU WHEN I NEEDED YOU are introspective delights. Unlike several earlier compilations that were stretched out over two discs, this sixteen track sampler collects everything important in one place, save TWO DIVIDED BY LOVE, their final biggie. Plant this one in your CD player and watch it take root. RATING: FOUR BLADES
