 GRAND FUNK RAILROAD-CAPITOL COLLECTORS SERIES: For fans interested in a dynamic overview of Mark, Don & Mel, giving equal time to both their "underground" early classics and their subsequent Top 40 run of pop rock smashes, listen no further. The Capitol collection touches on all the right bases, chronologically encapsulating milestones from the bloozey HEARTBREAKER (head honcho Mark Farner says it's the first thing he ever wrote) to their last biggie, the incandescent singalong BAD TIME. In between, there's the beautifully rendered CLOSER TO HOME/I'M YOUR CAPTAIN, the slam-jam of SHININ' ON, and  autobiographical party-boy anthem WE'RE AN AMERICAN BAND.  Tastefully selected cover tunes, always a GF staple, include Eric Burdon's INSIDE LOOKING OUT, the Stones' GIMME SHELTER, RNB nugget SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL, and their mega-watt reconstruction of LOCOMOTION.  Critics always hated the Funk, and fans always didn't, and though I am both, I certainly know real ROCK & ROLL SOUL when I hear it! RATING: FIVE THUMPS ON A BARE CHEST
