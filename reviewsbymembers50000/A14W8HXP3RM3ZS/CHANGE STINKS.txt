 Fans of this Beantown sextet's rafter-raisin', harp-saturated boogie n' blues might well gasp "WHA' HAPPEN???" upon spinning this second career compilation of new-wavey, MTV-ready hits. Like the Doobies, Dr. Hook, and Boston's other homeboys Aerosmith, J. Geils pulled a musical 180 midway through their careers. Upside: increased airplay, platinum sales...Downside: lousy music, decreased creibility. Sure, "Love Stinks" is a fun li'l ditty (Who can't relate to THAT sentiment?), and "Centerfold" was accompanied by a sexy video in its day, but this J. Geils Band is a Howlin' Wolf cry away from "Whammer Jammer" and "First I Look at the Purse". At least "I Do" is a live version of the same song on the superior first anthology, "Best of". 'Twasn't long after till Peter Wolf (a charismatic front man if ever lived one) split from J. Geils over creative differences and recorded..........the equally synthetic "Lights Out"! Sorry, but "Flashback" ain't nothin' but a dull party, folks.
