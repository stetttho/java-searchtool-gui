 Singer/songwriter Albert Hammond's greatest hits collection (culled from his first three albums) features his endearing ode to the often futile search for stardom, "It Never Rains in Southern California", a seventies pop classic if ever there was one. But don't stop there. "Down By the River" (not the Neil Young tune)is a catchy anti-pollution protest, "The Free Electric Band" is an apparent musical autobiography, and "I'm a Train" an infectious novelty. You'll also enjoy the Hammond compositions "The Air That I Breathe" (a smash for the Hollies), and "Smokey Factory Blues" (covered by Steppenwolf), plus numerous other folky pop gems. Remember, this is the man who penned classics for Leo Sayre, Starship, Willie Nelson, Ziggy Marley, and countless others, so he knows his way around a melody. Check out "Names, Tags, Numbers, and Labels", "The Peacemaker," and "The Day the British Army Lost the War", and you too, will be a believer. An interesting footnote; Albert Hammond Jr. plays guitar in the recently hot band The Strokes.
