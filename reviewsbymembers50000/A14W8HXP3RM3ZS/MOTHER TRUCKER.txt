  COUNTRY SHOTS: GEARJAMMIN' GREATS-VARIOUS ARTISTS: Truck drivin' music, that often comical, occasionally dramatic sub-genre of country and western is probably best listened to on an old 8-track tape from the noisy cab of a smelly big rig for authenticity's sake, but trust me---it sounds mighty darned good in ANY form. This ten track tribute to America's modern day cowboy begins and ends with the unchallenged "King of Truckers" Dave Dudley, whose big, booming voice propels SIX DAYS ON THE ROAD (a true genre classic more recently covered by Steve Earle and Sawyer Brown) and TRUCK DRIVIN' SON OF A GUN like a Mac diesel. Maine's eye patch-wearing Dick Curless contributes cautionary tale TOMBSTONE EVERY MILE, while George Hamilton IV hits on all gears with jaunty singalong TRUCK DRIVIN' MAN (probably familiar to rock fans through J. Geils' live version). And who among us has not sung along more than once to C.W. McCall's guilty pleasure C.B. saga CONVOY? You don't have to be a highway diner regular to appreciate these infectious "road trips", all vital slices of Americana from a time in country music when "six-pack abs" came courtesy of Pabst Blue Ribbon, not a personal trainer. RATING: FIVE MUDFLAPS
