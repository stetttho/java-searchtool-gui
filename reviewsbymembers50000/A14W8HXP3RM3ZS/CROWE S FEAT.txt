 Sheryl Crow?...Counting Crows?...The only songbirds that really mattered in the 90s were Chris and Rich Robinson's retro Stones-meets-Faces slam-bang rock n' soul act The Black Crowes.  What a welcome and all too raw and rare respite amid the roster of grundge, neo-country, rap-hop, and bubble-teen that clogged that decade's airwaves! From their debut LP's channeling of Otis Redding's sweaty HARD TO HANDLE through REMEDY's dose of Southern salvation to later hipshaker KICKIN' MY HEART AROUND, the Buzz Brothers aren't reinventing rock n' roll, merely keeping the Bic Lighter flame going for the faithful millions who still hold onto the belief that a good song with a trashy beat will never go out of style. The cream skimmed from the Crowes' first five discs are compiled chronologically here, the way all good anthologies oughta be, showcasing Chris' snotty yelp and Rich's righteous axe work on boogie inducer JEALOUS AGAIN and ballad break SHE TALKS TO ANGELS alike. Listeners are advised to play this Crowes' feat at annoying volumes accompanied by the vices of their choice. I'm sure the Robinson boys wouldn't have it any other way.....RATING: FIVE "HITS"
