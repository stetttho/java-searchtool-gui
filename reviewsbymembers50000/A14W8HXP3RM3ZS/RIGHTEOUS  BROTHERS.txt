 Yeah, I know, i know...Brother Jake has long gone to that great greasy roadhouse in the sky. Granted, the Blues Brothers, especially today, are more a product than a real band. True, even when they WERE an actual working unit, all the roots-purist detractors claimed their brand of blues was about as authentic as a near-beer. But damn it all, these cool cats introduced me to the likes of Sam and Dave, Junior Wells, Solomon Burke, and countless other RNB masters when I was just a naive teen hopelessly hooked on KISS and Meat Loaf. Maybe John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd were no Ray Charles or Little Walter in the vocal and harp departments respectively, but they had heart 'n soul to spare and were shrewd enough to surround themselves with living legends of the musical world. The Stax studio dream team of former MG's Steve "The Colonel" Cropper and Duck Dunn, plus Matt "Guitar" Murphy, were legitmate old pros on beloved standards like RIOT IN CELL BLOCK #9, WHO'S MAKIN' LOVE, SWEET HOME CHICAGO, GOIN' BACK TO MIAMI and HEY BARTENDER.  Most important of all, hearing these renditions made me want to check out the originals, which of course, have never been bested. So, Jake and Elwood, for introducing me to my first musical love, the blues, a heartfelt thank-you. You will forever remain Brothers in my soul. RATING:  FIVE FEDORAS
