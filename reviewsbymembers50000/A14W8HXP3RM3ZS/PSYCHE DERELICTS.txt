 Three decades ago, the Patti Smith Group's Lenny Kaye coined the phrase "Nuggets" as a term for trashy garage band classics recorded in the 60's, mostly by one-chord wonders with names as surreal as Strawberry Alarm Clock, the 13th Floor Elevators, and the Electric Prunes. His insightful compilations contained the stuff of a thousand glam, punk and grundge acts to come. These garbled one-off smashes and semi-underground gems have been mined endlessly ever since by the likes of Alice Cooper on the Music Machine's TALK TALK, The Cramps' reincarnation of the Count Five's PSYCHOTIC REACTION, Brownsville Stations' bruising bash-up on Balloon Farm's QUESTION OF TEMPERATURE, even JOHN BELUSHI, whose slob-fest rendition of the Kingsmen's ultimate Nugget LOUIE LOUIE appeared in ANIMAL HOUSE. Certainly, groups like Arthur Lee and Love could muster considerably more talent than the musically impaired yet still charismatic Seeds, but a snotty attitude counted far more than a perfect solo, and most of these ragtag ensembles had the former to spare. WOOLY BULLY's sleazoid Tex-Mex groove, the frat house shout-along DOUBLE SHOT OF MY BABY'S LOVE, the Jagger-esque snarl of DIRTY WATER and LITTLE GIRL, and NOBODY BUT ME's gloriously repetitive chorus will almost make you forget the unforgivable omission of Van Morrison's GLORIA, which ties LOUIE LOUIE for all time garage great. That minor gripe aside, NUGGETS is an avalanche of the nastiest, homeliest and funniest that sixties rock had to offer. RATING: FIVE SOUR NOTES
