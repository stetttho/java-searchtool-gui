 The RHH cover looks like a klass-sick kitschy B-movie scene, complete with shreiking BETTY PAGE-like babe in distress, which is no doubt the point of SPACE HEATER...tongue in cheek fun funneled through hopped up bop.  COUCH SURFIN' starts with a classic retro BATMAN riff, the instrumentals are succulent slices of surfabilly, and song titles like BABY I'M DRUNK, STARLIGHT LOUNGE, and TEXAS ROCKABILLY REBEL give a clear indication of the retro roots rock vortex where REVEREND HORTON HEAT hangs its twangin'/bangin' hat.  These three cool cats pummel shards of THE RAMONES, SOUTHERN CULTURE ON THE SKIDS, BRIAN SETZER, ELVIS PRESLEY, THE CRAMPS and DICK DALE into their very own charismatic slab o' mince-meat musicology.       I can't sum it up any better than this soundbite: "Turn up the bass...turn up the treble...TEXAS ROCK-A-BILLY REBEL..."   RATING: FOUR GEAR SHIFT KNOBS
