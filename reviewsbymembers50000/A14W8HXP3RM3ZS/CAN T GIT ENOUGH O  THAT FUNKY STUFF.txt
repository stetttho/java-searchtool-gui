 PURE FUNK-VARIOUS ARTISTS: Funk, especially 70's funk, was soul's nastier cousin, pioneered by the likes of James Brown, Sly Stone, and George Clinton and their bass thumpin', groove humpin' bands, turning up in everything from the blaxploitation flicks (SUPERFLY, SHAFT) of the era to the sample-heavy hip hop hits of today. That said, not all of PURE FUNK is...well, pure funk, skirting just as closely to disco and other RNB genres in the case of Earth, Wind, and Fire's SHINING STAR, Rose Royce's  CAR WASH, and certainly Carl Douglas' novelty smash KUNG FU FIGHTING. Jean Knight's infectious (just ask Everclear) MR. BIG STUFF and Patrice Rushen's FORGET ME NOTS (you kids under twenty, think MEN IN BLACK) are ringers also, but that still leaves enough funky stuff to keep the party goin' full throttle. The guttural chants of JUNGLE BOOGIE is Kool and the Gang's most primitive single ever (only later did they go "pop" with CELEBRATION and its ilk), and Scotland's Average White Band scores with PICK UP THE PIECES, an instrumental chunk of epic proportions. The Commodores' street walker classic BRICK HOUSE (not, incidentally, sung by Lionel Richie, hence its funkiness), Cameo's ear-risistible dance floor filler WORD UP, and Rick James' Temptations-enhanced SUPER FREAK all reverberate with slinky, shameless, sexual abandon as well. Let's call this funk for the masses, since the rawest practitioners ("They call me "BOOTSY", baby!") rarely made it onto the pop charts, plying their trade mainly for inner city audiences who "got it". PURE FUNK should be retitled "PURE FUN", 'cuz that's just what it is. RATING: FIVE BASS STRINGS
