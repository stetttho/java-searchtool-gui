 ROD STEWART-THE VERY BEST OF ROD STEWART: This is probably the most comprenensive single disc collection of the Mod one's defining moments. Covering three decades, VERY BEST contains nothing but, from never bested debut chart conquerer MAGGIE MAY to oft chided disco stab DA YA THINK I'M SEXY to soul duet (with the peerless Ronald Isley) THIS OLD HEART OF MINE to Celtic charmer OOH LA LA (first performed by Rod's old mates Faces, but now with backing from the Corrs). There are also plenty of decent slow dancers, such as TONIGHTS THE NIGHT and YOU'RE IN MY HEART, the better to make the ladies swoon.  Always a fine interpretter of outside material, Rod's definitive covers (Tom Wait's DOWNTOWN TRAIN, Van Morrison's HAVE I TOLD YOU LATELY) are exquisitely rendered in that unmistakable yet charming rasp. The only quibble is that more prime pieces didn't make the final cut (THE FIRST CUT IS THE DEEPEST, STAY WITH ME, PEOPLE GET READY), but that's what sequels were invented for. RATING: FIVE CROAKS
