 HAIRSPRAY-ORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE SOUNDTRACK: From outrageous cult director John Waters' most accessible comedy (starring none other than Ricki Lake, Divine, Sonny Bono, Debbie Harry, and Jerry Stiller!), the audio companion to HAIRSPRAY is every bit as much grand, giddy fun as the fabulous flick, thanks to tastefully obscure song selections from the pre-Fab Four era of 60s pop and RNB.  Gene Pitney's dramatic TOWN WITHOUT PITY and Barbara Lynn's YOU'LL LOSE A GOOD THING aside, near-forgotten classics such as Ray Bryant's swinging dance instruction tune THE MADISON TIME, the Five Du-Tones' funky frenzy SHAKE A TAIL FEATHER, and Little Peggy March's bubblegum lipsmacker I WISH I WERE A PRINCESS are crafty, blessedly abstract choices. Throw in the Ikettes' (Ike and Tina's backup singers) soul-saturated I'M BLUE (THE GONG GONG SONG), Brenda Lee-wannabe Rachel Sweet's kitschy title number, and not one, but TWO insect ditties (THE ROACH and THE BUG), and you've got a soundtrack that's pure dance nirvana. So tease yourself with HAIRSPRAY today! RATING: FIVE RAT TAIL COMBS
