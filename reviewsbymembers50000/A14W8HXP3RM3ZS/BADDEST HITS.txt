 Often unfairly written off as a Fab Four clone (they recorded for Apple Records), Badfinger was in truth one of rock and roll's hookiest and most harmonic singles bands, thanks chiefly to the sweet songwriting and vocal efforts of tragic figure Pete Ham. Although Paul McCartney penned their debut charter COME AND GET IT, the boys REALLY hit the pop stratosphere via Ham's NO MATTER WHAT, DAY AFTER DAY, and BABY BLUE (he also co-composed the beautiful Nilsson smash WITHOUT YOU, included in its original form here). Other bright spots on this 22 track overview include MAYBE TOMORROW, a pre-Badfinger single from their days as the Iveys, though nothing appears from their brief comeback attempt without Ham (who had committed suicide). In short, this is as near a picture perfect pop postcard of early seventies radio rock as you can get. So by all means, come and get it. RATING: FIVE FINGERS UP
