 You can wade through this 16 track testimony to 70's high tech and harmonies for the decent tunes, or you can simply slap on their first album BOSTON, because that's where all of the good stuff still is, even three decades after the fact. Aside from  the near perfect pop power of MORE THAN A FEELING, LONG TIME, and autobiography ROCK & ROLL BAND, GREATEST HITS is mainly limp retreads from second elpee DON'T LOOK BACK (advice Boston svengali Tom Scholz apparently did not heed), and elevator music from THIRD STAGE. Even worse, the "band" (really Scholz and a rotating cast) attempts abominable new stuff without key vocal slayer Brad Delp and a version of THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER that's about as vital as a greatest hits collection instead of Boston's debut  disc. Spare me. RATING: TWO SLICK
