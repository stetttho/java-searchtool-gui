 A flawed, if spirited musical companion to the completely botched sequel to the overly long original semi-classic flick (Jim Belushi, your agent shoulda been horsewhipped!). Stacking the deck with welcome blues/rock guest stars from the old school (Wilson Pickett, Aretha, B.B. King) to the new (Blues Traveler, Jonny Lang) can't divert attention from the fact that Dan Akroyd hasn't taken any recent vocal lessons, and John Goodman, while a talented actor, ain't no better. Sadly, even the song choices are often uninspired (RESPECT, CAN'T TURN YOU LOOSE, RIDERS IN THE SKY, turned into a RAWHIDE wannabe here).  At least the BB KING-led Lousiana Gator Boys (an all-star turn featuring everyone from Bo Diddley to Jimmie Vaughan to Gary "U.S" Bonds to Steve Winwood) stoke enough righteous riffing to pull off HOW BLUE CAN YOU GET. The Paul Butterfield Blues Band's BORN IN CHICAGO is uniformly excellent, and Blues Traveler can kick out the jams, but overall, BLUES BROTHERS 2000 is no match for its original inspiration, THE BLUES BROTHERS soundtrack. Some things just shoulda stayed dead and buried (Doors reunions, anyone?). RATING: THREE PIECES OF DRY TOAST
