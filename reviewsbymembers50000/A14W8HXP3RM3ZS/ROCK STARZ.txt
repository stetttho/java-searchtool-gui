 This enrgetic 70s rock quintet featured one time pop idol Rex Smith's brother Michael on high pitched lead vocals, but unfortunately, never became as big as their name implied. A pity, because VIOLATION, their hands down best album effort, was chock full of slick, dumb-fun rockers (they were once tagged by one reviewer as a mini-KISS).  Almost hit CHERRY BABY, sleazy seducer C.O.O.L. ONE, the futuristic title tune, and would be arena anthem SING IT, SHOUT IT were possibly too heavy for AM radio yet too pop for FM. Starz nonetheless delivered the goods, deserving far better status than a mere footnote in pop rock annals. That's what I call a "VIOLATION".  RATING: FOUR STARZ
