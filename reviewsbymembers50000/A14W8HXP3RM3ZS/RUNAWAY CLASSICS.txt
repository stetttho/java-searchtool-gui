 JOAN JETT-FIT TO BE TIED-GREAT HITS BY JOAN JETT AND THE BLACKHEARTS: In the seventies, England had Suzi Quatro to carry the glitter rock torch for the sexier gender; in the eighties, America had Joan Jett. This comprehensive collection of tuff 'n trashy classics features the ex Runaways grrr-tarist/sneerer/singer rippin' a page outta the Gary Glitter big-riff-shout-the-chorus trick book (admittedly, it was a one page book). Raucous remakes of pop cherrystones rule, from Glitter's own DO YOU WANNA TOUCH ME (OH YEAH!) and Tommy James' CRIMSON AND CLOVER (lip-smackin' bubble-glam here) to the Runaways' own almost hit CHERRY BOMB and a supersonic LOVE IS ALL AROUND (as Mary Tyler Moore never envisioned it). Jett's own derrier-kickin' compositions I HATE MYSELF FOR LOVING YOU and BAD REPUTATION sound right at home next to career maker I LOVE ROCK N ROLL (another cover tune), a genre anthem in the league of Kiss' ROCK AND ROLL ALL NITE and Led Zeppelin's ROCK AND ROLL. Forget the leather (if you can); Joan Jett's music literally screams for respect---and she'd better get it, or chances are she'll be kickin' YOUR derrier as well! RATING: FIVE "UNHHHS"
