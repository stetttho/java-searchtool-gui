 THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW was quite possibly the best sitcom to ever mosey onto the airwaves (who wouldn't wanna live in a town just like Mayberry?), and homespun music was as integral a part of its success as its gentle backwoods humor. From its snappy whistled theme song (also available here with lyrics warbled by Andy as THE FISHIN' HOLE) to Griffith's good timey renditions of bluegrass traditionals such as SOURWOOD MOUNTAIN, FLOP EARED MULE, and CINDY, this album is an audio photograph of a simpler, more carefree time when a neighbor was also a friend, and a man's word still meant something. Thrown in for extra good measure is Griffith's own unique spin on fairy tale JACK, THE GIANT KILLER, and familiar incidental instrumentals from the series with titles like BARNEY'S HOEDOWN and MAYBERRY MARCH. This here's the next best thing to watchin' the reruns for the one hundredth time. RATING: FIVE FISH ON THE LINE
