 Tho' Aerosmith's first greatest hits package wasn't perfect (lacking Train Kept a Rollin' and featuring edited AM single versions of a couple big hits), it still stands hair and shoulders above this "Second Coming of Aerosmith" mix. Where Dream On was a definitive power ballad of its era, Big Ones is overstuffed with the lame metal mellow-dies (Cryin', Amazing, Crazy) that have become the bad boys' schlock in trade.  I reckon chart peak/career low I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing will have to wait for Hits 3.  Even the so called rockers (the dumb and dumber Dude Looks Like a Lady and Love in an Elevator) can't hold a Bic lighter to fine, funky seventies fare Walk This Way and Same Old Song and Dance, and I refuse to dignify anything from Get a Grip with an insult.  it only gets worse, and sadder, after THAT album, folks.  What's the point of being the longest lived rock band after Mick and Keith if you're not even gonna ROCK anymore??? (Sigh)...call me "Jaded". RATING: TWO LIPS
