 For pure, mullet-headed, blooze-based boogie n' roll, few seventies bands carried the torch (or Bic lighter) higher than this Savoy Brown offshoot. Rightly christened "the kings of 8-tracks and six packs", Foghat's lead yowler Lonesome Dave Peverett and slide guitar slinger Rod Price rode a hard rock riff into oblivion and back on tried and true chestnuts like Chuck Berry's MAYBELLINE and Willie Dixon's I JUST WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU. They delivered the goods on their own stompin' stamps SLOW RIDE and STONE BLUE as well, providing the soundtrack for many a frat/biker party. Even when they (rarely) deviated from the formula, as on left field hit THIRD TIME LUCKY, it could scarcely qualify as one of the pedestrian "power ballads" so prevelant to the era. Sure, semi obscure barnstormers WHAT A SHAME and SOMEBODY'S BEEN SLEEPIN' IN MY BED would have been welcome additions to this overview, but if you don't find your workboot bangin' to what's already here, it's time to break out yo' Mama's Barely Man-enough 45's and hoist a cream soda to MANDY's magnificence. RATING: FIVE FISTS IN THE AIR
