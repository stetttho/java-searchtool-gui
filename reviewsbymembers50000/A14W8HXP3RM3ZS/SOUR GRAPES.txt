 When Rod Stewart began tackling the great American songbook not long ago, the idea was already as old hat as the very chestnuts he covered---ask Robert Palmer, Toni Tennile, Carly Simon, Bryan Ferry, or any number of contemporary balladeers who'd already been there, done that. When Michael Bolton hopped aboard the big band wagon, you just KNEW the fad had been stretched beyond the point of no return. Bolton started out as a hard rock vocalist (if you doubt me, check out FOOL'S GAME) who turned sorta soul "channeler", meaning he shrieks, wails, and moans in an over the top manner like a man badly in need of a prune juice enema.  He's since tried just about everything else to keep his once rabid audience of undemanding females in check. He's cut his thinning mane, he's belted neo-opera, he's even unsuccessfully countersued the almighty Isley Brothers (who brought him up on plagiarism charges)...now it's come to this. The man who shamelessly butchered none other than Ray Charles' and Otis Redding's truly untouchable GEORGIA ON MY MIND and DOCK OF THE BAY respectively, now feels he has something to add to the legacy of Charlie Chaplin's SMILE (betcha didn't know HE wrote it) and SUMMERTIME, perfected eons ago by both Janis Joplin and Billy Stewart in incomparable style. Sinatra? Armstrong? The Mills Brothers? Who the hell needs 'em when you've got the constipated crooning of Mr. Bolton for a new generation to breathlessly savor? This disc o' ditties shoulda been titled after one of its classics, AT LAST; at last Michael Bolton can sink no further. RATING: ONE SCREEEEEEEEAM!!
