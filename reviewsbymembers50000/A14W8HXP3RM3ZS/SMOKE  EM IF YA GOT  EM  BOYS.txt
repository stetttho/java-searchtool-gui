 I feel sorry for all the deprived youngin's who have been raised on MOTLEY CRUE's ummm..."motley" cover of SMOKIN' IN THE BOY'S ROOM, the uncontested juvey delinquent anthem of the early seventies.  YEAH! is a short n' sweet, snarling, sweaty testamant to the charismatic GARY GLITTER-meets-BO DIDDLEY garage rockin' blooze-bustin' punk pioneers christened  BROWNSVILLE STATION.  In one thirty minute in-yer-ear blast, music historian/record collector CUB KODA's impeccable taste in genre-jumpin' cover tunes spans country's HOYT AXTON (LIGHTNING BAR BLUES), reggae's JIMMY CLIFF (almost hit LET YOUR YEAH BE YEAH), New Orleans soulman ROBERT PARKER (BAREFOOTIN'), punk Godfadda LOU REED (SWEET JANE), and psychedelic one hitters BALLOON FARM (QUESTION OF TEMPERATURE), all rendered in BROWNVILLE's patented slam-bang-thank-you-glam delivery.  Smoke 'em if ya got 'em, boys!  No one owned rock and roll covers (or created their own covers to be) like these Ann Arbor overgrown high school greasers.  More fun than cherry bombs in the boy's room urinal!
