 This is the premiere all around "live" or "greatest hits" collection by the original Little Feat, featuring the late and also great Lowell George. A crowd pleasing mix of folk, funk, country, blooze, boogie woogie, and rock, Feat was always at their bizarre best in a concert setting. From a nine minute "Dixie Chicken" jam, to rollicking workouts on staples "Oh Atlanta", "Fat Man in the Bathtub", and "Feats Don't Fail Me Now", you just won't find a finer party in a package. Kudos to the lead vocal work of guitarist Paul Barrere and pianist Bill Payne, proving Lowell George wasn't their only interesting singer and the righteous Tower of Power horn section, who joined in on the fun fest. A minor quibble: The short track "Don't Bogart That Joint" (an old Fraternity of Man ditty) and the funky "Apolitical Blues" from the original double LP have been omitted on this single CD. Even so, "Waiting For Columbus" stands head and Feat above almost all other concert recordings.  RATING:  FIVE FEAT UP
