 RAMONES MANIA means well, but it's biggest flaw is that it's not ALL THE STUFF (AND MORE), VOL.'S 1 and 2. Granted, thirty selections on one disc that's 76 minutes long is nothin' to sneeze at, but too many late entry numbers lack the high energy and dumb fun lyrics of the first few indispensable elpees (of which STUFF 1 and 2 are entirely comprised). Next to expected bubble-rock class-sicks BLITZGRIEG BOP, TEENAGE LOBOTOMY, SHEENA IS A ROCKER, I WANNA BE SEDATED, and ROCKAWAY BEACH, latter day efforts HOWLIN' AT THE MOON (SHA-LA-LA) and ANIMAL BOY run outta gas fast. At least ROCK 'N' ROLL HIGH SCHOOL and DO YOU REMEMBER ROCK 'N' ROLL RADIO? are joyfully nostalgic excursions, and Joey Ramones' earnest take on the 1910 Fruitgum Company's INDIAN GIVER is a thing of rare beauty. But trust me: a quick trip on their ROCKET TO RUSSIA is much better than HOWLIN' AT THE MOON (SHA-LA-LA). So, Hey! Ho!! Let's Go!!! RATING: THREE GABBA GABBA HEYS
