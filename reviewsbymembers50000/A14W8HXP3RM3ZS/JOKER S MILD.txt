 Everyman blues-rocker Steve Miller, like virtually all 70s musical icons, has trotted out a twilight-of-his-career overview. However, it won't exactly force many to replace their well-worn copy of his GREATEST HITS 1974-1978, one of the pivotal anthologies of its era. That's because out of twenty-two tracks here, well over half are from GREATEST; it's virtually the same record with a handful of lesser known tunes thrown in to reach compact disc length. This is not a shocking development, as nothing Miller recorded from the 80s onward netted him the airplay of, say, FLY LIKE AN EAGLE or JUNGLE LOVE (save the decidedly un-magical atrocity ABRACADABRA). Later efforts WIDE RIVER and MAKE THE WORLD TURN AROUND are scarcely more than pleasant diversions, forgotten almost before they are over. The real meat of YOUNG HEARTS remains his classic catalogue of hippie era hits (LIVING IN THE USA, SPACE COWBOY) and pop 40 ear candy (the hard to resist Paul Pena composition JET AIRLINER, the Homer Simpson favorite THE JOKER), with a smattering of country (DANCE DANCE DANCE) and blues (WHO DO YOU LOVE) added to take up slack. Although the catchy SHUBADA DU MA MA makes the cut here, it's too bad that once again the compilers that be have criminally ignored funky B-side YOUR CASH AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT TRASH (hey, Huey Lewis threw it on HIS r&b covers album). A few more rare tidbits like that, and a few less retreads from the original GREATEST HITS woulda made this album more of an event, and less of a cash-in. RATING: THREE TAKE THE MONEY AND RUNS
