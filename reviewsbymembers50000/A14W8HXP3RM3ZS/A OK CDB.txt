 The Charlie Daniels Band is the musical bridge that connects straight ahead country music to southern fried rock better than anyone else. From his first hit, the classic tall tale UNEASY RIDER through his affectionate tribute THE SOUTH'S GONNA DO IT to patriotic anthems STILL IN SAIGON and IN AMERICA, the guitar and fiddle wielding North Carolina native is a charismatic favorite of practically everybody. SUPER HITS also lets rip with the barstool belter DRINKIN' MY BABY GOODBYE, line dance request BOOGIE WOOGIE FIDDLE COUNTRY BLUES (as apt a description of Daniels' style as any), and his best known kicker THE DEVIL WENT DOWN TO GEORGIA. You even get an updated UNEASY RIDER '88, this time involving a ruckus in a (ahem) "fern bar", although I'd druther have missing older tracks WITCHITA JAIL and THE LEGEND OF WOOLEY SWAMP, both fine story songs in their own right. Overall though, SUPER HITS is a good ol' collection from a good ol' boy. RATING: FOUR FIDDLES
