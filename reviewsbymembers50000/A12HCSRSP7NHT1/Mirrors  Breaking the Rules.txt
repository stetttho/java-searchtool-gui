 It's no wonder that Mirrors was nominated for a Lammy.  Marianne Martin tackles so many issues that confront us all, guilt, commitment, concern, harassment, insecurity, religion, professionalism, and, of course, love.  Mostly, Marianne Martin writes about the heroism that occurs in ordinary lives. Sound overwhelming?  Not really because of the ease in which she imbues her characters with these human qualities and emotions.   Is this a Romance novel?  You bet it is.  Does it break the rules?  It does so marvelously.  Mirrors is the story of two professional women who find themselves more adept at doing the appropriate thing than finding the right thing within themselves.  As with all romance novels, they fall in love, but that's when things really start to get complicated.  As Bette Davis said in "All About Eve", "Fasten your seatbelts; we're in for a bumpy ride."  And what a ride it is?  Martin keeps us guessing as to the outcome of several situations up until the end.  She also makes us, the reader, look into our own mirrors to view our own behaviors more clearly. Tautly written, humanly portrayed, and realistically fraught, Martin's characters leap from the page to become your next-door neighbor or one's own niggling conscience. Just as easily, some of these characters could be drawn from today's headline news stories.  Buy this book.  You'll be happy you did.  It makes for an excellent read.
