 I only wish it were summer so that the heat of day could match the heat within the pages of One Degree of Separation.  Should you read this review and it happens to be summer, snatch this one up for a beach read.  Just remember to turn over. One Degree of Separation is a delightful romance.  It takes place in the swelter of an Iowa summer, but the characters generate enough heat that you'll be sweaty no matter what the weather.  Liddy makes a cool escape from California to do a research project for a well-known writer while trying to heal wounds from a romance gone bad.  Her destination is Iowa City, a small college town, where there are more lesbians per capita than New York City.   Marian (yes, the librarian) is equally burnt by a love affair, and by her unrequited love for the next-door neighbor.  Neither Marian nor Liddy are in the market for a relationship.  Add to this mixture a group of friends who have switched partners enough times to call a square dance.  This coffee drinking crowd will have you lusting for pancake breakfasts and homeopathic couches.  Who says that the heartland is devoid of ... drama? Neither Marian nor Liddy are prepared for the spontaneous combustion that occurs between them.  Sparks fly and ignite enough passion to leave you panting for more.  Fueled by witty dialogue, realistic and likeable characters, Kallmaker proves once again why she's considered the Mistress of Romance.  With One Degree of Separation, she takes home the title.  I guarantee this one will leave you begging for water, or a latte, or an iced mocha decaf with chocolate sprinkles.
