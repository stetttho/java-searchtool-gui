 I can see why anyone who thought that "First Resort" was about golf would be bitterly disappointed. This is not a book about golf; that's merely the setting. Rather, it is a story about relationships, friendship and healing. I would agree with some of the former reviewers that say, "God, can those people drink!" I don't believe, however, that it is inconsistent with either character's facility for denial or propensity towards escapism. I think the fact that they drink so much is the point. It allows them, temporarily, to be able to live with themselves. The fact that they can function and seem to function fairly well is all part of the myth they've constructed. I guess those readers never got the continual references to "The Great Gatsby."  As for another reviewer's criticism that Jorden seems too good to be true, what's wrong with being multitalented? We never question a variety of expertise's if the character is a man. Tom Clancy's characters are far more extraordinary in their ability to be experts in a multitude of areas. Why can't a woman? What I found in Nanci Little's writing was a narrative style that is finely tuned, poetic without being excessive. Her characters live and breathe on the page. They are flawed, and they have courage and grace. They are not so different from many people I've known. As I wrote earlier, this is not a book about golf; however, I learned more about the beauty of the sport than anyone has been able to convey to this non-golfer. I finally understood the allure of the greens. I've even considered taking it up. As a book, "First Resort" is better than most. If you prefer stories about human relationships, take a chance on this one. It's a good read.
