 This is not an easy book. Maybe Next Time is well layered and brilliantly structured in both plot and character development.  Kallmaker introduces characters early in the book whose significance won't be realized until well towards the end of the story.  However, it's their early introduction that lends to the startling impact they have as events unfold.  Similar to the way a mystery writer leaves you clues, Kallmaker sets the reader up with innocuous references that appear to have little to do with the current action. Beginning at age 7, this story spans 35 years of Sabrina (Bree) Starling's life.  The story is written in a series of flash backs as the 40-year-old Bree returns home to Hawaii to attend her adopted aunt's funeral.  It was her Aunt Lani who enabled Bree to find her voice through the violin.  It is her musical genius that gives Bree strength, but it is also her violin that isolates her from everyone around her. Perhaps, it's due to the death of her Aunt Lani that sends Bree reeling in reflection about her own life.  Everything seemed to have started off so innocently: the love of music and her violin, the love of her girlhood sweetheart, Jorie, the friendship with a long-term couple, Pam and Diana.  However, through a series of mistakes, misinformation, and omissions, Bree's life comes crashing down around her. There is a beautifully written part of this book that truly captures the panic, confusion, and guilt that Bree comes to feel.  Kallmaker achieves this through the pacing of memory and real action in her writing.  When I read this particular part, I found myself gasping because I'd stopped breathing. This is a romance that reads like saga, is structured like a mystery, and is written with an ear for music.  By the way, the [physcial] scenes are sizzling.  Although I've re-read KK's books from time to time, this was the first one that I turned immediately back to page 1 as soon as I'd read the last.  ...
