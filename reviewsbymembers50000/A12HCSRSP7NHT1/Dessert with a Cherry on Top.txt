 This is a yummy collection of short stories based on all of Karin Kallmaker's books. Each story is like dropping by to see what your friends have been up to.  On two occassions, Kallmaker takes the opportunity to develop the story around relatively minor characters from "Unforgetable," and "Touchwood."  However, that's not why you should buy the book.   As we all have over the years, these characters have grown and they reflect the changing concerns, joys, attitudes and fears we have as lesbians and as people.  I literally rolled with laughter at the attempts at pregnancy in "Mechanics." For many women, gay and straight, this is a heartfelt issue.  Kallmaker treats it with tenderness, respect and a good dose of humor that might relieve the pressure for many couples attempting pregnancy. Her characters range from youthful to perimenapausal, butch/femme, caucasian, Afro-American, Japanese, confident, insecure, parents, non-parents, in long-term relationships to just getting started.  In other words, Kallmaker explores the diversity that is the lesbian nation.  Throughout it all, she never fails to portray that which makes us all human first. Down to the nitty gritty.  Is there sex?  Plenty, and as always, beautifully written.  Just like dessert, it'll make your mouth water. For those of you who have never read Kallmaker, will you be able to follow the action?  You bet.  Therefore, if you're one of those people who likes to eat your dessert first, this one's a must.  For those of you who are fans, this truly is "The Frosting on the Cake."  As for the cherry on top, Kallmaker takes the time to write to her fans about how she conceived each story, what she wanted to accomplish, and how romance really works. This one's a mouth-watering delight.  You'll even like the cover.
