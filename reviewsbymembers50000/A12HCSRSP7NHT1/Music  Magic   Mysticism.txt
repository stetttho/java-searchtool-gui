 What happens when you've moved heaven and earth, reached past time and space to reunite with the woman you love and she doesn't know you?  That's only the beginning of "Seeds of Fire."  In the sequel to "Sleight of Hand," Laura Adams (Kallmaker) doesn't find easy answers.  Instead, she creates more questions.  The same cast of characters come back to life, but she expands the depth and breath of their involvement within the story and with each other. "Seeds of Fire" is a fantasy based upon the ancient legend of St. Ursula.  In the early days of Christianity in the British Isles, St. Ursula was revered because she chose martyrdom over marriage to a pagan king.  Adams speculates about the reasons for Ursula's fate other than her devotion to the "White Christ." What truly provoked her escape, execution and exile into chaos?  This is a tale of jealousy, music, magic and love that spans two millennia. "Seeds of Fire" expands on the characters developed in "Sleight of Hand."  We get to know them better.  As often happens in real life, we may think we know someone well enough to extend trust, only to be rebuked by his or her own agenda.  Such is the case with Seeds.  It's the classic tale between good and evil, but Adams still manages to surprise us. Can someone read this book without having read the first?  Yes, this book stands on its own, but it's highly recommended that you read the first of the trilogy.  It simply adds to the suspense and angst if you have the background that "Sleight of Hand" provides.  This story was meant to be a series.  Having read the second of the trilogy only makes me yearn for the third.  Besides, if you're into a good read, finding another good read makes it that much more satisfying. Either way, you're in for something special.
