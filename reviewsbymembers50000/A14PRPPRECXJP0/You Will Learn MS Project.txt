 I think this book is excellent.  I found the material accurate and easy to follow.  I brought this book for my whole project team, I thought so highly of it meeting it's title claim.  I was able to take a topic and actually  learn it in the alloted time.  The beginning chapters provide a good  overview of the topics and using MS Project, setting up the project, and  good structured project design. When I have a team I need to get up to  speed quickly on MS Project, I will again use this book as the tool.
