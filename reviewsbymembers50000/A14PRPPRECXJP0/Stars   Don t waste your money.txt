 Maybe it's what I get for buying a book not rated and with no "look inside," but this book is pretty worthless to me (and can't return an e-book.)  I've been using outlook/office for years, migrated to 2003 outside of our corporate migration schedule - so with no internal resources I figured I'd get a book for reference... And that's the problem, it's not reference. I wouldn't even recommend if you were New to office, though that appears its target audience as it is literally detailed step by step instructions on how to perform simple tasks. BUT, beware it doesn't cover basic functions.  Let me give an example, suppose you create a meeting with attendees (this is covered) and then need to cancel it, 2003 Outlook has both Cancel Invitations and Cancel Meeting commands.  Apparently performing slightly different functions (the former removes the meeting distribution list; the later actually cancels sending a cancel notification to attendees.)  These commands, here again, apparently, are available depending on meeting type (recurring/not; series/single occurrence - I haven't figured it out yet.)  I searched (e-book) on "cancel meeting", found nothing, searched on "cancel" all finds were related to print.  I manually checked the index under cancel, appointments, calendar appointments, invitations, recurrence, meetings, etc and reviewed all possibly relevant pages -- absolutely nothing on how to cancel a meeting!  Hmmm, I guess cancel meeting is not considered even an "Outlook: Advanced Concepts."  At 644 pgs/4K this book is a waste of disc space, not to mention a waste of money!
