 I found this to be a good high level view of the PM discipline, its concepts, and processes.  The section on Risk Management provided a good overview.  All chapters are "overview" level, but the book has a  good reference section for further reading.  I'd refer readers to Lewis'  The Project Managers Desk Reference" for more detailed reading.  I do  find I refer to this book and am glad I added it to my library.
