 I've used a number of the games in this book and found they've helped me achieve my goals with the team. They stimulated converstaion and team building.  One game I found particularly useful was the "Tie that  Binds" in visually demonstrating how interdependent we are as a team.   I found this book a real bargain and a good book for getting started at  using games within meetings to build teams, emphasis concepts, and  introduce topics.
