 Packed with lots of information, pantry staples, low-fat snack choices and excellent recipes. Recipe ingredients are detailed in two portion sizes (1 and 2 or 2 and 4) and include nutritional info by portion(calorie, fat, sodium, etc.) I've cooked two of the recipes so far and was particularly pleased with the Bachelor's Chicken, am anxious to try the Mexican Lasagna. I highly recommend this book, the recipes are tasty, fast and easy to prepare. I will keep this cookbook close at hand!
