 I bought this book last week and have tried two recipes so far.  Okay not a lot, but enought to say it lives up to its' name.  The Sante Fe Chicken soup was wonderful, I love chipote peppers, it gave this chicken soup a nice smokey taste.  I also love tortilla soup, toasting sliced tortillas as a topping for the chicken soup reminded me fondly of my favorite tortilla soups.  I made the Chicken and Rice today, again wonderful flavor -- from start to table in about 45 minutes.  As I thoroughly enjoy my pressure cooker, I was looking for exactly what this book delivers  -- healthy recipes, thoughtfully low in fat, easy to follow, delightfully seasoned, and fast.  This one I'll keep close at hand.
