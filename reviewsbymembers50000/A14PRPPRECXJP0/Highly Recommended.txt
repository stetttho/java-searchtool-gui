 I've used MS project for over a decade, I've probably tossed more books than I can count over the years -- I recommended "teach yourself" 98 and bought for my project team, was using the Que book for deep reseach then.  Would have bought Que again but not avaialble, so I bought this a year a go, have used when needed for reference.  Yesterday doing research decide to load the cd, uh duh!!!, why didn't I do that a year ago -- the eBook is excellent, most of the material of the text, e-searchable, good search engine.  This is a real time saver!!!!  The diagrams pop in a browser window for better viewing, page back and forth through a topic -- my gad, I can skim the whole book in a couple hours w/ebook. I only wish it had bookmarks -- other than that, I'm thrilled, I can read/prep on the plane/hotel.  This and my e-PMBOK will be with me always.  And for any like me neglecting to load the cd -- the Visio demo shouldn't be missed.  Had been using Visio for importing and creating gantt/timelines -- the quick demo, though light, even helped improve my proficency in those efforts.  If you're a senior PM having to train/ramp up associate PMs, this is an asset not to be missed.
