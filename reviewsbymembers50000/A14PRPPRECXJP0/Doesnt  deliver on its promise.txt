 I was very disappointed with this book. It began well, with humorous antedotes of cross-country travels with spare-parts-cars.  However, the actual clutter-cleaning content is minimal at best, the bulk of the book is a recommendation for clutters annoymous, with memoirs from reformed clutters.  I learned there is a DSMV diagonsis of "hoarding."  And that's the sum total of the value afforded my reading investment.  There was no substantive information to be gained on how to avoid and/or clear clutter.  A look on ehow.com for how to clean a closet gave me more valuable information than did this book.  PS Dear Amazon:  This one will be coming back.
