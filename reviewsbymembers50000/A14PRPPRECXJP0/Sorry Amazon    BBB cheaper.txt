 I put this in my shopping cart after reading all the reviews here and elsewhere.  Then at Bed, Bath & Beyond and found it for 299 - I always have my 20% off coupons with me, so I got it for $299 - 20% Plus Tax.  Still a savings off the Amz price.  I buy alot from Amazon, but always try to price shop.  I haven't used it yet, but if I'm not happy its a lot easier to take back to BBB than ship back to amz.  Thanks everybody for all the reviews.  I'll come back after I've used it to post my "usage" review.
