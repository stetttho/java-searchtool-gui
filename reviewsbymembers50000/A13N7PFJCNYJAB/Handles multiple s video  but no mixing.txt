 If all you need is a little box to allow multiple s-video outputs to go to one s-video input on your TV, then this box is fine. However, it would be great if it also allowed the user to mix RCA-composite and s-video inputs to one s-video master output, allowing the signals of all input devices to show up with the best signal on the TV. For example, a VCR with only RCA-composite output, when routed through a device with s-video inputs and outputs (e.g.-a digital video recorder, or DVR) to the TV provides dramatically better picture than if the VCR was routed to the TV's RCA-composite input. If the Terk switcher provided mixing, then one could get much more utility out of said RCA-composite only VCR and the extra RCA-composite output jacks on DISH and DirecTV receivers. So, if you're looking for mixing capabilities as well as switching capabilities, this device is not for you.
