 No product leaves its packaging - never to return - like an artificial Christmas tree. By its expansive nature, it never compacts back to that original size. We've tried taping the box flaps up to make the box bigger and sealing it with a taped on garbage bag and other strategies to store this cumbersome item. But with the Rubbermaid storage bag, the problem is solved. This easily accommodates the tree and even extra items such as wreaths and holly trim. Then it pops into an attic, storage room or closet until the next holiday season. I know it's only a heavy-duty vinyl bag, but it really is great for this pesky problem. You won't be disappointed.
