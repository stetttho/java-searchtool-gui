 You'd think after the years of aspiration and discernment, the three years of seminary and subsequent service in the transitional diaconate, that ordination to the priesthood would not leave one fumbling to conduct the  ceremonies of the Church. Fortunately, wise souls who have gone before us  knew better and this outstanding reference was the result. The beauty of  our liturgical heritage is preserved when the celebrant is aware fully of  his or her duties in each ceremony. "A Priest's Handbook" gives  each fledgling priest a vital grounding in the essential elements of  presiding over and celebrating the rituals of the Church. More importantly,  the handbook reaffirms the gravity and solemnity of the celebrant's role  and the necessity of leading a given service effectively. This handbook is  an excellent reference for Lay Eucharistic Ministers as well, but no deacon  or priest should be without it and should approach no ceremony until  thoroughly familiar with its contents.
