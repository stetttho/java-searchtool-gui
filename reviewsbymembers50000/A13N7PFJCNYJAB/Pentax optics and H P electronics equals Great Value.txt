 After extensive research into 2 and 3 megapixel cameras, I settled on the H-P C618xi (identical to the C618 except for included software). I was going to Europe for two weeks and wanted to give digital photography a serious workout. Boy, did I make the right choice! The camera is worth much more than it costs, an idea supported somewhat by resell prices higher than what I paid for it new. It has tremendous versatility: Easy to use automatic features for carefree snapshots and excellent manual capabilities for greater artistic control. I do professional work for feature and spot news stories. Over the last two or three months, I gradually have pared down the "film" equipment I keep with me until all I take along is the C618xi. The lower JPEG settings are great for newspapers, yet the highest rez TIFF images reproduce perfectly in 4-color glossy mags. Instead of a bulky kit, now I have only a small tote with a wrist strap, containing the camera, 4 spare AA's, a lens brush and CF memory cards. That will last me all day in just about any setting. If I'm doing a flash-heavy shoot, I carry along 4 extra AA's just in case. This camera is not as power-hungry as some I've seen. However, any user will find that 1600mAH NiMH batteries are the way to go to keep the energy costs down. My personal recommendation is to go with Ray-O-Vac: Their AA's are the highest potency around and they make a great compact 1-hour charger that will charge 4 AA's at once (...). For the amateur or the professional, I can't recommend this camera highly enough. I wouldn't part with it for anything.
