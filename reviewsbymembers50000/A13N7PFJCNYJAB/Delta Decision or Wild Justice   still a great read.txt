 Readers should be aware that this book was published in the United States with the name "The Delta Decision" in 1979. "Wild Justice" was the name used for the British edition. As other readers have pointed out, it is not a new work by Wilbur Smith. I mention this only to prevent earlier readers of "The Delta Decision" from ordering a book they've read already. That said, this is one of Smith's best works. It followed an equally good thriller - "Hungry As The Sea" - that captured many new Smith fans. I have read every novel Wilbur Smith has published over the past 40 years and can say not one of them was anything less than captivating. Whether you are new to this great author or have read his works in the past, you will enjoy thoroughly "Wild Justice," while marvelling at his ability to envision, more than a quarter century ago, the world we find ourselves in today.
