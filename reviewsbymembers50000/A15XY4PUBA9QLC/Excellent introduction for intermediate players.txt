 One warning in advance: Tournament and master players who employ the Bb5-systems in their games will be disappointed by this book, which will bring them "nothing new" and which is not "complete" at all.  Still, at university the most popular books are not the complete ones, but those small guidebooks that prepare students who do not necessarily want to become Nobel laureates for their next exam, right?   McDonald's book is just like that: a fantastic introduction for the club player and players of up to, say, ELO 2.200. McDonald explains the strategies in such a  clear, entertaining and didactically excellent way, that those players will learn a lot not only about this opening, but also about chess strategy as such. Though this is a rather slim work, he still presents enough theory for the reader to employ this system (Moscow and Rossolimo variations) in his own practice without fearing any nasty surprises.
