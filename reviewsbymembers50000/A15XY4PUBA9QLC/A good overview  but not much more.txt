 This is a good overview over almost all relevant variations in the Slav and Semi Slav (the quiet 7.... Nb6 in the Ne5-mainline seems to be missing, though). Each variation is explained very well, using one or two games from current tournament practice. You get some statistics plus a hint if a line needs a lot of theoretical knowledge or not. Beginners as well as strong players will benefit from these annotations. But the material presented is far too little to play the Slav or Semi Slav after studying it. This has of course nothing to do with the author, but with the concept of the "Starting Out" series. I think that you simply get too little material for your money, although Flear does an excellent job within these limitations.  Recommended for players under 2000 ELO or as a first overview if you plan to play (or face) these openings.
