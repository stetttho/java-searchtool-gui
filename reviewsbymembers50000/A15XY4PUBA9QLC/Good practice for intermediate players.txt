 This is good training material for up to intermediate players (from maybe 1.600 to 2.000 strength). While the weaker players will learn many tactical concepts by going through the exercises, the stronger ones can use them to practice daily, like the piano player has to practice his fingers on a daily basis.  Only four stars, as this is definitely a book that was easy to produce.
