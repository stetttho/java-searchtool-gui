 This is an alltime classic. Although the subject is defence, it would be more accurate to call it a book on tactics: Not combinations of the kind "white to play and checkmate in five moves", but all the little tricks (strategic as well as tactical) that strong players use in every game with almost every move. The games are basically from the first half of the 20th century up to the seventies, but still very relevant, as tactics is tactics.  This book is incredible value for money, highly-recommended.
