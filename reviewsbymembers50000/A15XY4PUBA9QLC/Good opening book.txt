 This is a very good book on the closed Ruy Lopez. For the positional player this is an excellent choice, as this opening demands a good strategic understanding and can lead to a lot of different pawn structures. White players are usually not so experienced with it, as it is rare on amateur level. With Flear's excellent selection of mostly current games you can try to find your way through all the different sidelines.  Flear does not take a "repertoire approach" and does not clearly indicate always, which variations he recommends. As they are all played by top players, this approach is understandable. But you need to look a little bit behind the annotated games to develop your own repertoire.  Needless to say that playing 1.e4 e5 you will have to study many other openings as well, not to mention other Ruy Lopez variations, where white avoids the main lines.
