 This is a very useful book for every active chess player. You learn a lot about original strategies and methods that modern chess players use. As such, the book is good, really inspiring and highly-recommended.   However, the author did not want this to be an instructional text only but rather a book on philosophical/basic aspects of chess strategy, and I find his theory simply wrong. It seems correct that chess is basically "rule independent" and that in the end only analysis counts. But unlike other authors (like Kasparov in his recently published "Predecessors" books) who stress the gradual development of chess thought with different contributions by different players over time, Watson seems to claim that there is a "conceptual shift" somewhere between modern and traditional chess, with the classical players following some written or unwritten rules and modern players relying on concrete analysis. As I know hundreds of examples of "classical players" using strategies given by Watson as "modern" and as there are plenty of quotes of classical players making a case for the concrete analytical approach (and modern players talking about the "laws of chess" as well!) I must regard his theory as refuted. One could go into many details but overall his case does not convince me at all, even if it might help to correct some dogmatic player's world view.
