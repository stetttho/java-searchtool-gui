 This is an excellent training and puzzle book, very similar to the classical work by Hort/Jansa. It trains the most difficult aspect of the game: To judge positions correctly, based on the dynamic possibilities available.  The statistics given are also interesting: You can find out exactly how well you did compared to other ELO-groups of players.   Really enjoyable and useful at the same time. Not for beginners, however: a certain level of chess experience and chess book reading should be there.
