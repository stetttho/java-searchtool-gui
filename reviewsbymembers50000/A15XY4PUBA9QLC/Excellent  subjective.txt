 This is an excellent work!   You get Kasparov's opinion on the games of World Champions Spassky and Petrossian plus some other players from the same era (Leonid Stein, Lev Polugaevsky).  Do not be intimidated by some people's small-minded comments about some historical inaccuracies or analytical errors (most people who have never published any relevant analysis are just powering up their engines, find differences and without understanding anything claim "they" had "found many mistakes").  The point is: You buy this book to get Kasparov's very own, subjective interpretation of chess history, and nothing else. People who tell you that something is wrong with his perspective usually do not explain the one point: If he is so much wrong, why does he play so strongly then? It is all about what you want from a book. Reading "correct" computer analysis will not improve your game much, but learning about and understanding the perspective of one of the greatest players of chess ever might well do so.   If you are not interested in that, simply do not buy it.
