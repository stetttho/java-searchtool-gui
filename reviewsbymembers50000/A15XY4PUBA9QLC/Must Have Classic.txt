 This is a must have for every serious chess player. Botvinnik's annotations are excellent with a very good balance between variations and verbal explanations. On top, he is undogmatic and very objective (much more so than e.g. Alekhine). He even tells you when he overlooked something. In this way you get a true picture of what really happened in a game and how the fight and initiative flow back and forth. The chess is quite modern. What I like most is that in these times the fight starts around move 8 already, while modern players head for starting positions way beyond move 15 or so.  This collection is incredible value for money. It tops many expensive modern instructional books.  After reading this book I am considering to get the whole three volume Botvinnik epos.
