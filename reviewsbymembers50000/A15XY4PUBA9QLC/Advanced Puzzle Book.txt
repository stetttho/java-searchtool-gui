 This is an advanced puzzle book with some interesting articles on the thinking process in chess.  Good for regular "sharpening" of your chess mind. Too difficult for beginners!  "Only" four stars because the title is not accurate (I wish I could really learn how to avoid foolish mistakes, and by the way, I would like to avoid intelligent mistakes as well).
