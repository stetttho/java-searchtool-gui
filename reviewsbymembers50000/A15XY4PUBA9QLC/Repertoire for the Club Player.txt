 This is a good repertoire book for the club player. Collins usually recommends main lines that are also played by the world's top players. However, in the Sicilian he recommends playing 2. c3, which has come somewhat out of fashion at GM level. He presents the repertoire by giving complete games and analysing sub-variations in this context. Collins is a very enthusiastic writer. Yet, when checking some variations I found that he did not mention several lines that black can choose and which may cause trouble for the inexperienced player. For example in the 2.c3 Sicilian he misses a variation where black can force queens off (which is probably why Bc4 is now usually being played before d4). Also some sidelines in the Scandinavian (with Nc6, not solid but very popular and dangerous at club level) and the Alekhine (4. ... Nb6) are missing. When I compare this book with Emms' repertoire book then Emms is more complete and "waterproof", although Collins' variations are more aggressive and most are probably better.  Still, this book is good especially for learning the Scotch opening, the Panov Attack and the Advance French as white. But you will need more material to really have a complete repertoire - therefore only three stars, although the quality is four to five stars.
