 The diaper genie works great if you read the instructions and follow them.  Installing the refill can be tricky until you've done it a few times.  When you put a diaper in, be sure to twist at least 3 full times( I do about 5 half-turns) to get full odor protection.  We use small plastic cable-ties which we have around the house for all sorts of things instead of trying to tie a knot at the beginning and end of the "sausage".  Be sure to have a refill on hand at all times because you cannot predict when the current one will run out.   I have tried many others and think this is the best "pail" out there.  Regular pails children can get into...and believe me they WILL.  The part where you insert the diaper on the Diaper Champ tends to get soiled and needs to be disinfected often.  The Genie is covered in plastic all the way. They now sell new refills for "toddler" diapers for a buck more.  The plastic is thicker, but otherwise didn't notice much difference.
