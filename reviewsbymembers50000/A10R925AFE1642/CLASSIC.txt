 This is THE classic histology atlas.   It was recommended to me by other students to use as a first year medical student, and it has everything I need plus more.  It also has very helpful explanations next to each  picture.  Some atlases have pictures with all text in one section of the  book.  One is not better than the other.  It 's just what you prefer. They  all have the same pictures.
