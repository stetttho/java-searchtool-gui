 I am so glad that we have this piano.  I have it in my son's crib.  I has 3 settings, the 1st it plays music for about 10 minutes(nursery rhyme songs) while the lights blink.  This is the one I have used most.  We start it at bed time, it turns itself off, and my son learned that he can push any "key", and it will restart whenever he needs it at night.  NO mommy required.  The volume is a little loud, so I put several pieces of scotch tape over the speaker which he has never removed.  My son doesn't much care for the other settings where he can play his "own" music, and he has never played it by kicking like the baby does on the TV commercial.
