 I have used this coffee maker now for 2 semesters of medical school, and I wouldn't trade it for any other coffee maker.  It makes my life so much easier to have coffee waiting for me every morning.  The instruction manuel  warns that if you use oily beans, the grounds chute may clog.  You can take  the top off of it, and push them through.  If the much superior to blades  boar-grinder is clogged, you put dried bread pieces in the grinder and run  it (as the instruction manuel advises), so the bread can absorb the oil and  "unclog" it.  Moral of the story if you use oily beans...maintain  before it gets completely stuck.  I haven't had one problem with medium  oily beans.  And my aunt in Anchorage hasn't had one problem with this  model in many years.  I LOVE THIS MACHINE!
