 The photographs are excellent, but the index sucks.  It is poorly organized and incomplete.   Take my advice and buy this book for Neuroanatomy just for the pictures.  The paperback edition is very  afforadable.  Just put lots of little flags on the pages or sections you  use most.  It will save you much brain-ache.
