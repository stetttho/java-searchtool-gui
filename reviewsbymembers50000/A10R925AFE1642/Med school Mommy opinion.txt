 I have a degree in Child Development, am certified Early Childhood Ed Teacher, and now am in medical school for my MD.  My husband and I use this technique w/ our 6 mo old, and we know many parents who have used it on their over 5 mo old children.  It is a very developmentally appropriate technique that works if you follow it...especially if you followed babywise sleep training.  Or course the most important thing is to be consistant in whatever you do, so if you just go at this without true committment, you will be frustrated as well as your baby.  And yes, babies CAN sign.  Just take a look at the very popular Joseph Garcia's Sign with Your Baby.  The only thing that I have had trouble with is the suggestion by this book to toss the pacifier at age 6 mo because it's no longer physiologically NEEDED by the child.  We tried and gave in the our baby's cries because he started sucking his thumb instead.  Breaking the pacifier later is easier than the thumb for us.
