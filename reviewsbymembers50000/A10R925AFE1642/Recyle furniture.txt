 You don't have to go out and buy a changing table for your baby...a large piece of useless furniture in a couple of years.  We attached this to the top of a dresser we already had.  ANd will remove it when we stop changing diapers.  I have friends who just take it wherever they need it...floor, bed, etc.  Buy 2 covers for it.  If both end up dirty, you can lay a recieving blanket on top or use it without a cover.  Love it.
