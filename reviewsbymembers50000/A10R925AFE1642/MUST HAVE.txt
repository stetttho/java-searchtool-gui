 You need this seat.  You will need no other high chair.  We started using ours when our son was 2 months old and still use   it every day at 15 months...plan on using it a lot longer.  We've taken it to restaurants, grandma's house, and vacation.  You can use it with the tray or just pushed up the the dining room table.  We've even used it just sitting on the floor.  We run the tray through the dishwasher every night.  The WHOLE CHAIR can go in the dishwasher when it gets too messy.  I have found only good things to say about this chair.  Love it.
