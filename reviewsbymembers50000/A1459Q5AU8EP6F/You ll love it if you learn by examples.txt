 Okay, this book won't let you miss much.  Every detail is covered IN DETAIL, but only to the intermediate stage.  If you have no idea what OOP is, I suggest you get this book before any other.  OOP (Object Oriented  Programming) can be a little tough to understand, but this book's approach  is very good. The book is LARGE (dense) and looks like the typical goofy  Deitel tutorial, but it's actually a pretty good book. NOTE - If you  already know C++, you'll probably want to skip this one.  But if you  currently know nothing, or you are a VB programmer, then this would be an  excellent purchase. This is my gripe and the reason for three stars.   While the self-study answers are provided, the solutions for the real  exercises are NOT provided and they will NOT provide them unless you have  some kind of arrangement with Prentice Hill.  That was a very annoying  discovery.  You can't purchase the answers and they aren't available  online, don't ever bother. If not for that BIG flaw, this is actually a  very good introduction to Java, and the pace is very good for the  beginner. If you don't buy this one, my advice is to look at Thinking In  Java, Java Examples in a Nutshell, Core Java 2.0, or Just Java 2.0.  Those  are all VERY GOOD books and worthy of serious consideration.  In addition,  the ANSWERS are PROVIDED in those books!  What a concept!  You'll actually  know if you have it down well enough to move on.  However, once again, THIS  book probably has the best introduction to OOP that I've seen, so if you  don't know it, consider buying this one.
