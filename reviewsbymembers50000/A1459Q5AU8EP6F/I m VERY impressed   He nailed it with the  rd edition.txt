 This book is my new favorite Java book.  This book is probably my new favorite technical book.  It's simply an excellent example of what a technical reference book should be. The first quarter of the book is a  very good introduction to Java, the syntax, as well as object oriented  programming (OOP).  The syntax and OOP portions of the book are the best  I've seen in any book.  If you are new to Java, reading through these  sections carefully will teach you almost everything you'll need to know  about the Java language.  The third edition of the book doesn't assume a  C/C++ background, so even those with limited or no programming experience  will find this section very helpful. Next you'll find excellent coverage  of the Java platform.  The bulk of the book is a reference of the different  Java classes in JDK 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and even 1.3Beta.  The coverage is  excellent.  I would have liked to see examples, but I suppose that really  is asking too much from one book. I have a large library of Java books,  but this one is #1 for me.  Shelf time for this book is going to be very  low.  The book literally hasn't seen a shelf since it arrived from  Amazon. There are several Java books I find to be far superior to others.   For anyone new to the Java language, I believe the following are the very  best books to have nearby (ranked in order):   Java in a Nutshell, 3rd...     Java Examples in a Nutshell...    Java Foundation Classes in a Nutshell...     Java Enterprise in a Nutshell...    The Java Class Libraries, 2nd, Vol  1. by Patrick Chan Obviously, I'm a fan of David Flanagan's Java books  (he wrote the top four).  Pick one up to see why.  They are all excellent,  but my favorite is this one (JavaNut 3rd edition).  The set of four  Flanagan books easily comprise the best resource on Java available.
