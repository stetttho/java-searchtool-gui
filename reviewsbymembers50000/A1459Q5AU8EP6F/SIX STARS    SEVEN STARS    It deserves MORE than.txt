 This is a great book.  This book is a very quick read, and one that I'm sure you'll read again several times in your life.  This is one of those books you'll keep in a special place, never to be sold at Half-Priced or  loaned out. This book will do one thing and do it very well: make you  pause a moment and consider what is important.  Everyone owes it to himself  or herself to spend an hour or two and read this book. WARNING: THIS BOOK  CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE. I can't give it a higher recommendation only  because Amazon doesn't allow anything more than FIVE STARS. When you are  finished, I promise that you'll agree with me 100 percent.  I didn't expect  much from the book at first, but I was quickly drawn into it and then  amazed by the mastery of the writing when I finally closed it. This is  the book that makes you want to read just ONE MORE chapter.  Just ONE MORE  chapter.  It's EXCELLENT!
