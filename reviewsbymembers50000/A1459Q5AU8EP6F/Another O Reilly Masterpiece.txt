 This is an excellent book.  Think you know Windows?  Read this book, and I think you'll discover more than you think.  If Windows is giving you fits, or you'd simply like to change a few things that just annoy you (who  doesn't?), pick this one up.  It's very simply an excellent reference tool  for both Windows users and anyone who administrates Windows computers.    Fortunately, this book should be good for both the novice and the  professionals.  However, if you are a novice, just make sure you understand  the instructions that are carefully laid out in the book.  There is nothing  at all complicated, but there are many examples of simple registry changes  that could be bad news if you just rip through it.  Take it line by line  (few examples have more than 5-6 simple steps), and you'll have no trouble  at all. O'Reilly is truly an amazing book publisher.  It's very uncommon  to pick up one of their books and find even one error or lack of coverage.   This book is NO EXCEPTION.  O'Reilly makes a durable book with a clever  binding called a RepKover.  That's very important, something you'll  discover after referring to O'Reilly books over & over & over  again.  These books are kept on the desktop or very nearby and used  continuously.
