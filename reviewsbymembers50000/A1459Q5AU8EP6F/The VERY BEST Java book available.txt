 When I started to learn Java, I think I purchased ten differentintro books.  It seems that it just wasn't "clicking" withthose other books.  I happened to pick this one up as well thinking that it would be a great tool after I learned the language.  Boy, was I ever wrong! This book is a GREAT book to learn Java!Over and over again, you'll see a "master java programmer" (in my opinion) create simple programs and explain every step.  The book goes into more detail, but only a little at a time, nothing overwhelming. This book taught me Java - PERIOD.  Leave it to O'Reilly to once again create a phenomenal book like Java Examples in a Nutshell. If I could give it 10 stars, I would.  This is still my #1 favorite Java book.
