 Dreamweaver 2.0 - Hands On Training, one of two great Dreamweaver books.  You should really consider this book if you'd like to go through simple exercises that will demonstrate the true power of Dreamweaver 2.0.  I  thought I knew what was easy and powerful with Dreamweaver - UNTIL I  purchased this book!  My eyes were opened to ideas I never before  considered.  Dreamweaver 2.0 is an unbelievably great web design product,  and this book is the perfect companion to anyone at the beginner or  intermediate stages.  Then again, I thought I was pretty advanced, so  unless you know EVERYTHING about Dreamweaver, consider ordering this one.   It's a great book.  You'll probably rediscover things you had previously  forgotten.  I did, several times. The other great Dreamweaver book is the  Dreamweaver 2.0 Bible.  It's an excellent reference that covers everything  you would ever want to know in great detail, but in a simple fashion. I  wish all technical writers could pick up a few tips from these writers.   The simple language and easy examples are about as perfect as one can  imagine. One note - DW2 - Hands On Training has a few typos, but nothing  serious.  You'll see them immediately, and they shouldn't be distracting at  all.  I don't remember even one typo that made this book technically  inaccurate.  Don't worry about that.  You'll LOVE this book.
