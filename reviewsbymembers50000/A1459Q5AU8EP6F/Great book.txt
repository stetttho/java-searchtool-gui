 This is one of the few books about Dreamweaver 2.0, but it's absolutely one of the two very best books available.  If you are looking for a great reference that is structured in such as way that you'll actually learn the  methods, then buy this book.  I believe you will have a very hard time  finding better reference material on Dreamweaver 2.0.  Another  consideration should be Dreamweaver 2.0 - Hands On Training, the other  great Dreamweaver book oriented more towards a careful and thorough  tutorial.  Buy it - this one is a keeper!
