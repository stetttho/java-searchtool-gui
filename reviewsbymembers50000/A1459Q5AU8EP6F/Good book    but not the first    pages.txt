 About 10 pages into this book, I think you'll really enjoy it.  However, if you are not already familiar with Object Oriented Programming (OOP), I think you'll find the next 50 pages very confusing.  I recently discussed this book with other Java programmers I know - we all agreed that the  initial OOP converage is weak.   However, the remainder of the book is  excellent.  I do recommend it, especially for C++ programmers or those who  already understand the basics of OOP.
