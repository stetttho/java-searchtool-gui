 Amazon - How can I give a book six stars?   An exception should be made here. This book is truly excellent.  If you are just starting out, you'll learn enough here to be WELL on your way to being a Linux pro.  Matt Welsh  et al write wonderfully.  Everything is explained in the clearest manner  imaginable.  No, the book doesn't cover everything, and I don't believe  that is the intention of this book.  This book is a superb introduction to  Linux and a wonderful reference.  If you go through the entire book, you'll  easily be an advanced user of Linux.  The best part is that this book  explains it all so well, you'll find nothing is very difficult at  all. I've owned all three editions of this book.  Each edition replaces  the prior on the same location on the shelf - the closest shelf to my  computer. O'Reilly is truly an amazing book publisher.  It's very  uncommon to pick up one of their books and find even one error or lack of  coverage.  This book is NO EXCEPTION.  O'Reilly makes a durable book with a  clever binding called a RepKover.  That's very important, something you'll  discover after referring to O'Reilly books over & over & over  again.  These books are kept on the desktop or very nearby and used  continuously. This is a sure-fire winner!  I doubt if Amazon ever sees  one of these books show up as a return.  It's truly among the very best  computer books available today.
