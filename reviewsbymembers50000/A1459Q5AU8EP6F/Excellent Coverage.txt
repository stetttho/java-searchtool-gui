 I searched long and hard for a book covering the details of the ZAK and other methods that I could use to simply my administrative function.  This book is it. The full spectrum is covered here, from installations to  security profiles, from Office suite control to remote registry edits.   Each topic is covered in full. This is another fine example of what a  technical computer book SHOULD be from O'Reilly & Associates,  Inc. Trust me with one thing .... there isn't another book that will give  you the depth of coverage that this book provides.  I literally looked at  50 books before finding this gem.
