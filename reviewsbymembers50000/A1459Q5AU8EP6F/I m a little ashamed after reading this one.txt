 Story after story, I was amazed at what took place, at what people did with their lives.  The Greatest Generation is a perfect title to describe such a group of people. I'm comparatively very young.  I'm right in the  middle of the so-called generation X.  After reading this book, I realized  that we owe much, so very, very much to our parents and grandparents. I  thought I knew history.  I thought I knew what happened.  I didn't.  I only  knew the historical details and facts, not personal stories.  Now I know  that the details and facts I learned in college don't amount to much at  all, and no history lesson is going to ever teach you that.  This book  will. I'm somewhat ashamed of my own generation, and I'm very honored to  know a little more of a prior generation that deserves FAR more credit than  we X'ers give them.  This is an excellent book.  This will force you to  reconsider the value of your parents and grandparents, no matter how you  think you already value them.  I wonder what my generation will be called  in 40-50 years.  I doubt the word Greatest will be used, and least not in a  positive light. When you finish one story, you will either put away the  book just to consider in amazement what you've just read, or you'll hasten  to read another story, and then another, and then another.  All are  excellent! Believe me - I'm not a big history fan, but I loved every  square inch of this book.  I treasure this book.  I think everyone will.
