 If you are somewhat lost with Linux, I highly recommend this book to you.  While there is no book that can spell out every minute detail and every point of Linux, this book does a far better job than most.   I'd give it  5 stars, but the included software is not that great.  I doubt anyone would  actually use the CDROM anymore, but then, that's not really the value  behind the book at all.  Linux and almost all applications are free on the  Internet anyway. If you plan to run Linux, and you are having a tough  time finding what you need to know at the Linux Documentation Project (LDP  = NOT a well organized place), this book will certainly lead you in the  proper directions.  Once you have general knowledge of a given subject  matter, then you can much more easily find additional information online.   But remember, unless you can ask the right question, you'll never get the  right answer. If you are new to Linux, you will not regret buying this  book.  Download RedHat 6.1 from the Internet to have the latest release and  forget the CDROM.  However, don't feel that this book is in any way  outdated.  Most of the code of the programs you'll use on a day to day  basis in Linux is already years old, and that's often based on software  that is sometimes decades old.  Sure, the code is updated, but the commands  and command structure rarely change. An excellent reference.  CDROM  should be updated, so think of this one as a shiny coaster.  This is still  a good purchase.  Only the Linux pros should skip it... they already know  their way around the confusing LDP.  They already KNOW the RIGHT QUESTIONS.
