 This book is somewhat of a rarity to me.  Many of the other SQL books are, as you can well imagine, very boring.  Rob Vieira does a great job making this book flow from subject to subject in such a way that it's almost a  page turner.  If you have any interest in SQL design (or admin), I'm sure  you will find yourself reading this book much longer than originally  intended.  It is an excellent job. Rob Vieira obviously has real world  experience with SQL Server, and it shows between the covers of SQL Server 7  Programming.  I'd suggest you read the book from cover to cover, all along  the way picking up little tips and suggestions, remembering what you may  have forgotten, and learning a whole lot of new tips and tricks that you  never knew (or at least I didn't know about). The book's title doesn't  fairly represent the content in my opinion.  This book covers almost  everything about SQL 7 Server, from T-SQL basics through OLAP, tuning,  replication (a great chapter), etc.  If there is a "bible" for  SQL 7 Server, this book is it.
