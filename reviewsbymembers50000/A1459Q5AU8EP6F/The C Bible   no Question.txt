 This is probably the greatest introductory programming world ever written! This is the classic "how to program" book.  The book may seem quite old, but so is C, so you'll not miss anything.  Half of the other introductory books written today will often quote this book, especially in reference to the "hello, world." example contained within.  The "K&R"  is well known among programmers as the all-time classic programming book -  for any language. If you read through this book, I promise that you'll  find it easy to grasp with a pace that will not bore you to tears. For  those of you just starting off, remember that this is not a C++ book.  You  may not want to use Visual C++ 6.0 with this book.  Instead, you can  download a DOS based C compiler from wwwdeloriecom.  I  believe you'll find that compiler much more appropriate for learning C with  this book, and best of all, it's FREE.  After this book, you should have  very little trouble adapting your knowledge to C++ and the Visual C++ 6.0  IDE.
