 Who thought Windows 98 was going to eliminate all the annoyances of Windows 95?  Hardly.  If anything, there are more annoyances with Windows 98 than ever before! This is an excellent book.  Think you know Windows  98?  Read this book, and I think you'll discover more than you think.  If  Windows 98 is giving you fits, or you'd simply like to change a few things  that just annoy you (who doesn't?), pick this one up.  It's very simply an  excellent reference tool for both Windows 98 users and anyone who  administrates Windows 98 computers.   Fortunately, this book should be  good for both the novice and the professionals.  However, if you are a  novice, just make sure you understand the instructions that are carefully  laid out in the book.  There is nothing at all complicated, but there are  many examples of simple registry changes that could be bad news if you just  rip through it.  Take it line by line (few examples have more than 5-6  simple steps), and you'll have no trouble at all. O'Reilly is truly an  amazing book publisher.  It's very uncommon to pick up one of their books  and find even one error or lack of coverage.  This book is NO EXCEPTION.   O'Reilly makes a durable book with a clever binding called a RepKover.   That's very important, something you'll discover after referring to  O'Reilly books over & over & over again.  These books are kept on  the desktop or very nearby and used continuously.
