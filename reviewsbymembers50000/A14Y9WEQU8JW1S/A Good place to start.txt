 Whilst other reviews might criticise this book for not going into enough detail, it does work out as either a good foundation for further study, or simply as an interesting insight. It covers most aspects of the war, providing unbiased and clear points, with summaries to help simplify the  arguments. It demonstrates the sudden changes and shocks that this new,  technological world war presented each of the powers, particularly the  stubborn Japanese Imperial code, and how the ordinary soldier was affected,  often fatally. The book presents a range of careful individual personal  profiles, mirroring the events, that so-often suffered from similar flaws,  and in turns leads to an intriguing summary of the simple problems that  were magnified into major flaws in planning and procedure. This is a good  textbook, or a good read.
