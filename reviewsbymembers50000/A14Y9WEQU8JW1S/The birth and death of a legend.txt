 As in his other books, Lucas once again does not fail to deliver a thrilling and educating winner of a novel. Whether as a textbook, or for personal interest, this book is a great read. It charts the conception,  legendary fighting and tragic fate of the 2nd Waffen SS division, 'Das  Reich.' Noted as one of the most efficient, and daring fighting forces of  any World war two army, the book follows Das reich from it's first  tentative recruting in the mid 1930's, and into it's famous wartime  exploits. From the daring and heroic fields of Holland and Poland, to the  horrors and miracles of the Eastern front, and the desperation of Normandy,  the saga finally ends in Germany, at the ruthless hands of Russian forces.  The men that the reader empathise with live and die on these pages, their  legend slowly becoming a reality. These men were not the political SS, they  were not murderers or instigators of the holocaust, they were young  patriots, who made the ultimate sacrifice for the country, but are  remembered forever. If you want to learn anything at all about German  soldiers, this is the book to buy.
