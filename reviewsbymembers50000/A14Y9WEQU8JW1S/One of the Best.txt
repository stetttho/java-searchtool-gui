 This is one of the more thorough examinations of the life of one of World War II Germany's most colourful characters. Otto Skorzeny is practically unknown outside the realm of Military History, and has never really been  bought to the public eye. Though this book was written in the 1950's,  before some of Skorzeny's prolific post-war activities, Foley manages to  conduct one of the most thorough and justified examinations to date of  Skorzeny. he gets inside the subject's head, consulting him, his colleagues  and his enemies, giving a well researched and detailed account of  Skorzeny's early career and famous exploits. A certain degree of bias must  be accepted, due to Skorzeny's influence in writing the book, but it is  still a classic. A must for anyone interested in the subject of WWII  commando operations, and the one which all other authors on Skorzeny quote.
