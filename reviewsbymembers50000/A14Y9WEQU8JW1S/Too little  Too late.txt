 This book is one of the most deep and intriguing looks at the tantalising 'James Bond' exploits of the German army during WWII. From undercover infantry detatchments, to human torpedoes and midget submarines, to piloted  missiles and kamikaze jet fighters, and finally to the German version of  the French resistance, Lucas delivers concise, detailed but thrilling  accounts of the Germans amazing efforts to stem the tide of the Allied  forces. Every branch of the armed forces are looked at, in some form, and  the tales of men and machines responsible recounted, often with comic, and  tragic results. The ideas presented by the Germans were just as, if not  more inventive than the Allied efforts, but against the mighty Allied war  machine, could only hope to prolong the war, never win it, despite the  maniacal belief and faith put into the programmes by the ailing Fuhrer.  This is a great book, even if you're not a fan of military history, and  it's interesting just to see the ideas that laid the basis for action  movies for years to come. A must read.
