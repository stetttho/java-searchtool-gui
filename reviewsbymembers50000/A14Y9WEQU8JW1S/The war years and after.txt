 Another well researched and fair evaluation of one of WWII's most notorious charcters. Otto Skorzeny once again had a certain amount of influence over the content, giving his last interview before his death from  a war wound in 1976. The book provides an entertaining and intriguing  perspective on the development of German special forces, as well as  Skorzeny's own colourful personal life. Whilst Charles Foley's book  'Commando Extraordinary' goes into the German commando exploits of the war  in far greater detail, this book reviews most of Skorzeny's postwar  activites, a field previously not written about. Not only does it reveal  several key examples of allied treachery and wrongdoing towards the end of  the war years, but also a slightly lighter and poignant side to Skorzeny,  demonstrating his loyalty to his country and comrades, not it's regime.  Essential for anyone interested in the man himself, but not one to start  with.
