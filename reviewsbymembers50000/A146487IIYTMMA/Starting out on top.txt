 It's amazing, but Aimee Mann's subsequent albums aren't really disappointing. You might think they would be, as her solo debut "Whatever" is so perfect that no rating or review is really going to do it justice. Absolutely everything works on this album, and in ways the listener isn't going to expect. The production is what catches the attention first: it often sounds otherworldly, with unfamiliar or strange-sounding instruments (the first song, for example, ends with Mann singing into a Dixie cup), but at the same time entirely natural and inviting. It would be nothing, though, without quality songwriting. Mann has been known since her 'til tuesday days for her way of combining irresistible hooks with dark, gloomy, and unforgettable lyrics. "Whatever" represents the peak of her writing output, with every song worth lingering over. My particular favorites: the haunting "4th of July", "I've Had It", "Way Back When", "I Know There's a Word", "Say Anything", and the sole surprising note of optimism, "Mr. Harris". I might as well have listed the other half of the songs on the album, as they're equally fascinating and well-crafted. There's no filler here. I discovered Mann with this album when it was in its first release, when I was in tenth grade or so. My own musical interests have migrated a long way since then, and I've abandoned most new music. And I still listen to her music, and this album is still one of my favorites.
