 Gerard Alessandrini has certainly gone to the well many, many times with his "Forbidden Broadway" series. As such, the most timeless subjects have been more or less exhausted -- we certainly don't need another appearance by Ethel Merman in *every* new edition, and the concept of stars inappropriate for their roles (this time, Cheryl Ladd as Annie Oakley) is nothing new at all. The "Strikes Back" edition set a standard which worked extraordinarily well at the time, but Alessandrini has hewn perhaps too closely to that standard in subsequent editions. Still, the well isn't dry yet, and there are plenty of gems on this album. Notable among them: "Sondheim's Blues", the second half of the "Music Man" sequence, "Scars", "Beauty's Been Decreased" and the "Aida" sequence. A previous reviewer decried the Gwen Verdon number as tasteless; it was actually written to appear in the show and dropped immediately after her unexpected death, and was recorded as a tribute to her talent. That said, it is only mildly amusing, far less so than the brilliant "Contact" parody which was too visual to record, or even the numbers preserved from earlier editions of the show. On the whole, of course, people new to the series would be well advised to pick up volume 2 or volume 4 first -- while these parodies are fresh, they lack the thrill and bite of the ones included on those albums. I still laugh harder at the memory of number 4's "Shall We Boink?" than I have at anything here that I've just heard for close to the first time.
