 John Bucchino has accomplished quite a lot for a theatrical composer who has yet to have a major production of his work (until a one-act in "3hree", at least, which will hopefully reach Broadway within the year). Notably, his songs have been performed and recorded by some of the greatest luminaries of the theatre world, and a few more recognizable celebrities as well. The reasons for his success in this regard are abundantly clear: he has a knack for writing melodies that stick with you, coupled with an uncanny ability to choose subjects for his songs that are surprising, yet immediately compelling. Happily, this album pairs Bucchino's gentle, wonderful songs with interpreters who are their equals, including several who are renowned songwriters in their own right and clearly know how to put across a lyric (Adam Guettel, Amanda McBroom, and Art Garfunkel). As such, this is simply a stunning album -- every nuance of every song is carefully fleshed out. RCA should be commended for taking a chance and releasing a tribute (of sorts) to someone who has yet to find major mainstream success. Bucchino is a real find -- who knows what turns his career might have taken had he been born forty or fifty years earlier. For more of his songs, I equally recommend Patti LuPone's "Matters of the Heart" and Sally Mayes' "The Story Hour", on both of which you'll find songs also on this album and songs not found anywhere else. They're worth it for the other Bucchino songs. Heck, they're worth it for the duplicate Bucchino songs.
