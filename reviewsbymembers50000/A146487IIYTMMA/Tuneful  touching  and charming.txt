 I was initially worried that this album would be something along the lines of Liz Swados's Runaways, but that score had several drawbacks that this show does not, only one of which is Liz Swados herself. Both scores needed to have a contemporary and "with it" feel to be authentic as expressions of the angst of children and teenagers, but the earlier The Me Nobody Knows had the benefit of a more fertile pop/rock landscape. That's not to slight the contribution of composer Gary William Friedman, though: his tunes are original and genuinely appealing, particularly on the up-tempo "Light Sings", the haunting "Sounds", and the stirring "Let Me Come In" finale. Lyricist Will Holt provides more of a mixed bag, perhaps inevitably given the melodramatic subject matter. The liner notes indicate, though, that the book and lyrics were directly adapted from transcripts of interviews they conducted with inner-city children, in which context his work seems far more impressive. That's the one real problem with the disc, though: these are kids singing, and no matter what their problems or how cute and clever they are, there are limits to how much I'm going to want to hear from them. On the other hand, if they're going to be this insightful, it's not the bitter pill it might otherwise have been. What's more, the performers are all strong -- none stand out, as they're all children and none is allowed by the format to create a character through an arc of songs, but all have the voice required for their music. The class of this album extends to its sound quality (analog distortion is at a minimum; but for the arrangements it could have been recorded recently) and to the dazzling package (extensive liner notes and beautiful photos). 150 Music put a great deal of loving care into this release, and I hope it pays off. It's lovely to find a new label which takes its work on theatre-related projects so seriously.  I'm looking forward to the proposed off-Broadway revival of this show.
