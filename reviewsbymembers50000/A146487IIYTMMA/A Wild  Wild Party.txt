 It shouldn't be a slur to point out that this was the more lightweight of this season's two WP musicals. Where Michael John LaChiusa's version succeeded by grounding the story in the context of the twenties (including  the characteristic sounds), Andrew Lippa's just sets out to have a darn  good time. And that it does. While the tragedy of the story is not  underplayed (indeed, it's really vivid in the lead performances of Julia  Murney, Taye Diggs, Brian D'Arcy James and Idina Menzel), there's an  irrepressible optimism bubbling away underneath it, palpable in such  numbers as "Raise the Roof," "A Wild, Wild Party," and  Alix Korey's outstanding solo "An Old-Fashioned Love  Story". Given that the more reflective numbers are just as memorable  (with "Maybe I Like it This Way," "What Is it About  Her?" and "How Did We Come to This?" the standouts), this is  one dazzling disc. Much of the score is omitted to fit a single CD (most of  it recitative and dance music), but those unfamiliar with the show  shouldn't notice a thing. And who'll be able to resist playing the two  PARTYs back to back?
