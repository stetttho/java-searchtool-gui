 I expected "The Producers" to be a hoot on stage and as a cast album. What I didn't expect was that it would be such a genuinely lovable and endearing show -- it doesn't generate warmth by making you love the characters, really, but it does so with its obvious love for the Broadway musical. Mel Brooks has in fact described the show as "a love letter to Broadway", and it's completely true. Brooks is at his considerable best in his lyrics for the show; new songs and lyrics fit snugly alongside the old, all provoking fits of laughter. What's surprising, though, is the music. While none of it is exactly distinctive, it's all well-crafted and pleasant enough. And it fulfills its function as well as possible -- the music emphasizes every last comic beat and every intentionally cheesy "moment". It's a classic score, full of production numbers, ballads, showstopping solo turns, a long and luscious overture, and a thrilling and utterly satisfying finale. All in the traditional style, with no "innovations" that might distract from its simple and abundant pleasures. Tons of this kind of album used to be recorded every year, making "The Producers" even more of a wonderful treat. But it wouldn't have been at all shabby thirty years ago -- its cleverness and the quality of its execution both make it a knockout and a must-have.
