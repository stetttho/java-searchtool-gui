 These aren't the most laudatory adjectives, no. <i>The Full Monty</i> doesn't quite merit them... but that doesn't mean that it isn't a good album, one well worth your money. What it does mean is that it's rarely going to knock most of your socks off with soaring melodies and well-crafted lyrics; David Yazbek was clearly striving for a comfortable groove and not for something that would really make us stand up and take notice. Well, he's achieved that goal. Most of the songs are cheerfully melodic and sung with spunk by a wonderful cast, even if few of them are going to have you running for the replay button. The most entertaining: the twisted ballad "Big Ass Rock", Emily Skinner's irresistible "Life With Harold", Kathleen Freeman's star turn ("Jeannette's Showbiz Number"), and the gorgeous "Breeze Off the River". Nothing else offends, even if the lyrics clunk here and there. For such a load of faint praise, you might think I don't like this album. Not true in the slightest. It's just that I find it difficult to articulate why I've been delightedly playing it so often lately.
