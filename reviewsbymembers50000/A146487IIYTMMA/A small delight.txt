 Laurence O'Keefe's achievement in "Bat Boy" is substantial -- he has at once managed to make the characters ridiculous and genuine. This, I think, stems from his having made them real human beings and not cartoons, a tactic which also worked in the "Scream" movies and "South Park". We really feel for Edgar and the other principal characters, even as we laugh at the tongue-in-cheek nature of the show and score. All of this album is easy to take, with special credit deserved by "Show You a Thing or Two", "Comfort and Joy", and the dazzling "Three Bedroom House". All brim with melody and wit, and also with heart. One doesn't expect to see many new musicals with all of these qualities today, so this is an album to be treasured.
