 Michael John LaChiusa is my personal favorite of the "new generation" of theatre composers; he blends a modern and experimental approach with traditional theatricality in a very exciting way. This 1994 effort lacks a bit of the edge of the recent "Marie Christine" and "The Wild Party" -- in its place is a strange kind of warmth and optimism. Even as the characters of "Hello Again" try and fail to find emotional fulfillment through ... liaisons, there's never a doubt that most of them have the capacity to find it in some other way. And as is typical for LaChiusa, the score is highly melodic and accessible, if not something that can be easily broken down into individual songs. Insofar as it can, "Tom" is the principal standout. The lyrics are clever and appealing, and the performances first-rate without exception.
