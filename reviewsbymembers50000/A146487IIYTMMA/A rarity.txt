 This is the highly unusual case of a revival cast album which surpasses  the original. The classic, sparkling Jones & Schmidt score is well sung  by the talented cast, the tempos are generally better, and -- best of all  -- much of the dialogue is preserved, giving a better impression of the  magic of the show. Even the reduced instrumentation contributes to this  album's charm. I wouldn't be without it.
