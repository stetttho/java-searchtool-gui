 I've heard mixed things about the show "The Witches of Eastwick" -- some good, most terrible. I probably won't be able to comment on the show as a whole until the show is brought to Broadway, if it ever is, but I can comment on the score right now. And "mixed" is still the adjective I reach for, though my feelings about the score on the whole skew more towards the positive. I'm not bewitched by Ian McShane's portrayal of Darryl Van Horn or by the songs he's given, though maybe you just had to be there. And while Rosemary Ashe dazzles as Felicia, I find her songs to be even sillier and less functional than Darryl's. But all of this is forgotten whenever the leading ladies are heard. Composers Dana Rowe and John Dempsey had their work cut out for them in writing for the Devil, and succumbed a bit too much to caricature when writing for the townspeople... but they came through in spades for the more complex lead characters Alexandra, Jane and Sukie. Their seduction numbers are all brilliant, as are their second-act solos and several trios. Lucie Arnaz, Joanna Riding and Maria Friedman sing beautifully and create memorable characters. The import price is a little steep for half a good score, but theatre buffs will consider it a must.
