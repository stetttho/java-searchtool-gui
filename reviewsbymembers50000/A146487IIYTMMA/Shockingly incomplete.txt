 The habit of most software stores of shrinkwrapping their books is infuriating sometimes, since it's tough to figure out from the cover whether a guide is likely to be helpful. The fact that this is the official  guide might lead some to believe that it's of high quality; nothing could  be further from the truth. Ideally, RPG guides should spoil little of the  plot while revealing most of the secrets and winning strategies. This book  does the opposite: it reveals virtually every turn of the plot, and  discusses little of the gameplay. There aren't any maps of the tough  dungeons (the "go north, then go east" directions are impossible  to follow), tips for defeating bosses, lists of the treasure to be found in  any particular place, listings of base character statistics... generally,  anything that can be found in a guidebook worth its salt. It's particularly  lax about any kind of overall strategy, like which characters might make  best or worst use of weapon/armor upgrades or Mana eggs at particular  times. Most astonishing: it doesn't even *attempt* to cover the bonus  dungeons. Isn't this what we buy these books for, to ferret out the secrets  hidden within them? One wonders just what you have to do to get someone to  let you write one of these; this author clearly wasn't up to the task, even  by Prima's usual less-than-exacting standards.
