 Given how much is wonderfully right with this recording, it's a shame that enough is wrong with it to deny it the fifth star. The problem lies mainly  in the casting. Everyone sings beautifully, as one might expect from the  albums of this series. But the book scenes rarely register with the proper  impact because of the lack of chemistry between the leads and the lack of  suitability of the leads for their roles. (Tony winner Karen Ziemba comes  across as sweet and winsome, for instance, where the role of Cleo requires  a genuine force of nature.) Still, the album is gorgeous from start to  finish. The fine singing, the luminous stereo sound, the numerous restored  cut songs (one performed by original Rosabella Jo Sullivan Loesser), the  thick and elaborate booklets (essays, photos and libretto), and the  signatures of both Loesser women (available to the first 100 people to buy  the album through Amazon) are all major pluses. Emily Loesser is radiant as  Rosabella, and the recently deceased Louis Quilico offers an excellent take  on Tony. This album cannot replace the definitive and very complete  original cast album, which stands as perhaps the best representation of a  classic score as it appeared in a show. But it is still an invaluable  supplement to that album; people familiar with the original will want to  hear a longer and sonically superior take on it, and people unfamiliar with  it might find the newer one a better place to start.
