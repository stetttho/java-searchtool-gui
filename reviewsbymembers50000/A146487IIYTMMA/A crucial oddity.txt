 I'm not sure whether it's stranger that this album has languished in the vaults for so long or that it was recorded in the first place. But we should be grateful that it's here, as it's an important recording, a fun score, and a fascinating piece of theatre recording history. Dinah Shore is by no means an ideal substitute for Ethel Merman (who was under contract to Decca Records and not permitted to appear on the official cast album), make no mistake. But Merman made her own album with her own takes on the big songs, so it's perhaps a good thing that RCA went for a dramatically different take here. Shore sings very attractively here -- she's not a tough broad, but a sweet charmer, but the album still works. The show was, of course, a big hit that had plenty of strengths even though it might be too dated to rework today. The Merman album was already released on CD once, and will be issued again within the year, but this is still worthwhile for Shore's performance, for the niceties of the show like the other original players, orchestrations and songs that Merman didn't preserve, and for a lengthy appendix of Shore's versions of classic Irving Berlin songs. No one will ever claim that Call Me Madam changed their life. Shows didn't used to need to elicit that reaction to be considered successful.
