 Why does Square think we don't want to have fun? Honestly. The company turned a corner with FF7, deciding to concentrate on realism to the exclusion of entertainment value. Well, they haven't achieved realism by any measure (the graphics are still unexpressive and the voice acting wooden), their stories have become incomprehensible (FFX isn't much better than Xenogears or FFTactics), and the characters just about dare you to enjoy their company. Who in this game is supposed to be likeable? Or cool? Or sexy, even? It's hard to say. I would love a complex and subtle RPG, but you cannot afford to be subtle unless you first know how not to be *lifeless*, which Square apparently does not. The full voicing completes the process of draining the characters of energy, making them sound even dumber than they look and act. FFX is a huge chess game where you don't know the players and don't understand the rules...and *never* figure it out. This installment also takes away the world map, meaning that you have just about no choice in what section to play -- were any of us clamoring for this change? No. Nor did we care to lose the method of running from battles that dates back to the SNES; the encounter rate is ridiculous and getting out of battles is *hard*. Other demerits -- the music is Uematsu's worst effort to date (exactly one memorable tune, and it's not even a cool one), weapons and armor are incredibly hard to upgrade, and dungeons are tough to navigate even with an onscreen map. The pluses -- blitzball is a terrific minigame and it's great to be able to use the entire party in a single battle (something I've wanted for years). That's about it. This is a game from which you should stay far, far away...even if you, like me, started playing the FF series with the first game.
