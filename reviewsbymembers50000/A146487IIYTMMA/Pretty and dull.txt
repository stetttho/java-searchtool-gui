 This recording, like the show on which it is based, is inoffensive but generally misguided. The story of Jane Eyre is a lovely and haunting one, but not one that is really suited to a musicalization of this scale -- it should be small, intimate, and as meditative as Jane herself. Instead, we get big overblown anthems wherein the characters express such operatic angst that we expect the story to end like a Greek tragedy. Even worse, these songs continue the recent trend towards overwhelming literalness in lyrics; few of them find an oblique or metaphoric way to express sentiments that are perhaps over-familiar to the audience. Worse still, the lyrics are poorly crafted (hint to aspiring lyricists: the quality of rhymes *does matter*). But the music is undeniably pretty in most places, and I enjoy "Sirens", "Sweet Liberty", and a couple of other songs. They aren't right for Jane Eyre, of course ("Painting Her Portrait" and "In the Light of the Virgin Morning" come closest to that), but they're the most enjoyable things this album has to offer. And Marla Schaffel and James Barbour are ideal as Jane and Rochester. One almost forgets about the show when they're singing; the show and the score are counterfeit, but they're the real deal.
