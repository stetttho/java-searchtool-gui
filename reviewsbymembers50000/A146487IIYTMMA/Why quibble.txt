 The chief complaint that theatre fans have levied against the cast album of the current Broadway revival of "Kiss Me, Kate" is that the new orchestrations unnecessarily underline the jokes in the lyrics and actually work against them. But I've not found this to be the case, personally, nor did I understand similar statements about the revivals of "How to Succeed..." and "Guys and Dolls". All I hear is great music performed by a cast that may be definitive. It's not as though other albums haven't taken their liberties with the score, anyway -- the original cast album and its remake both suffered significant cuts and some strange changes in casting (such as Alfred Drake singing both parts of "Brush Up Your Shakespeare" under a pseudonym). The score is unexpurgated on several studio albums, but not ideally cast. This recording is reasonably complete; even if it deletes the overture and original dance music, all of the original parts remain intact. (The near-exception: a version of "From This Moment On" was interpolated into the revival for Harrison Howell, but not recorded.) And it features some of the best singing actors in the theatre industry today -- Tony winner Brian Stokes Mitchell is big-voiced and very funny, and Marin Mazzie sings thrillingly and with conviction. (Mazzie in particular is probably the best-ever Lilli Vanessi, but this is more clear from her performance in the theater than on disc.) Michael Beresse is strong even deprived of his dances, and Amy Spanger makes "Always True to You (In My Fashion)" work for me even when it's not one of my favorite songs. I could go on to single out the rest of the principal cast for praise, but this review has gone on quite long enough. They're all winners. As is this take on "Kiss Me, Kate". A definitive take on the original form of the score has yet to appear, but this one is just fine as far as I'm concerned.
