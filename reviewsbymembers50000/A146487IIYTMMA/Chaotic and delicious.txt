 Like many people, I picked up this book after seeing one of the two musicals in New York based on it last year (the LaChiusa one on Broadway, in my case). I thought both shows were highly enjoyable, and was pleased to learn that a good deal of their success could be attributed directly to the source material. March's poem (if it can indeed be called that) itself provides a brief but memorable glimpse into the darkest corners of a dangerous era. The story, such as it is, concerns the unhealthy relationship between two vaudeville performers, Queenie and Burrs, which comes to a head when they throw the party of the title. Among the guests are a number of people who have lived the high life for so long that they are no longer able to put their emotions in perspective -- they hurt each other and are hurt, but appear unable to learn from their mistakes. Naturally, the party ends with a mistake that is completely irrevocable and devastating. The piece would be compelling even without Art Spiegelman's perfect illustrations. With them, this is a book that shouldn't be missed.
