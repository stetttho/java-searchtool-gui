 Ordinarily when I don't feel moved to post a review immediately upon getting something (book, game, CD, movie), that thing will go unreviewed by me. Not so Michael John LaChiusa's THE WILD PARTY. I've had it for the  entire summer, and not a day has gone by without one of the melodies  popping up in my head. The haunting quality is what distinguishes this  work from Andrew Lippa's recent show of the same name. (Read further  reviews if you need that situation explained to you.) While Lippa's songs  are immediately extractible and perhaps more engaging than LaChiusa's  complex and heavy numbers, their appeal is far more limited. LaChiusa's  score is as dark as the material demands, with even the fun numbers laced  with a sense of foreboding and given real purpose in tracing the descent of  the characters into tragedy. The comic and tragic aspects of the story  are adeptly handled by the cast. Toni Colette was given a great deal of  attention in her Broadway musical debut, and deservedly so; not only is her  singing flawless, but she managed to be the center of attention as  necessary when the stage also contained Mandy Patinkin and Eartha Kitt.  Both of these performers, needless to say, were terrific, with Kitt taking  particular honors for her delivery of her two solos. Patinkin comes across  better on disc than he did on stage, where the shallowness of his character  was a more serious liability. ("Burrs" is the only character who  I found to be richer in the Lippa version; in the LaChiusa he lacked the  sense of pathos that might have made us care more about his fate.) These  flaws aside, this WILD PARTY is one which sounds terrific on first listen  and only gets better. It should be ranked high among the best scores of the  past twenty years.
