 Jason Graae is one of the most hysterically funny performers in theatre today. The fact that he can sing makes for an attractive bonus in this album of songs he's mostly performed before, but the real reason that musical theatre fans have to own this is the endless stream of in-jokes that Graae supplies. But even if you've never heard of Judy Kaye, Lillias White, or Andrea Marcovicci (and why not, I should ask), you should pick this up. Just as hysterical as the in-jokes are the ones that aren't going to go over anyone's head, such as an entirely off-key take on "The Wrong Note Rag" and his famous version of "Applause" featuring dead-on impersonations of Johnny Mathis, Tallulah Bankhead, and others. Graae's timing is impeccable, and his sensibility agreeably bitchy -- appropriate for the likely audience, in other words. And yeah, he can sing too. Quite attractively at that, especially on the handful of soft numbers ("What More Can I Say", "Something That I Wanted You To Know", "It Would Have Been Wonderful"). But it's not those numbers that I'm going to be playing over and over again.
