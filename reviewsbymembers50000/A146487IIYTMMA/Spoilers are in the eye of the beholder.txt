 The chief complaint that others seem to have about this book is that there are spoilers in places. Well, this is true, but they could be much more intrusive than they actually are. None of the big plot twists were spoiled by what little narrative Hollinger includes, which is really necessary to allow the reader to follow instructions. And the spoiler content is really irrelevant -- what matters is that the book is excellent in all other respects. Its breakdown of where to find the 108 stars is thorough and helpful, as are its careful explanation of how to get each ending, its list of the recipes for the cooking mini-game and its timetable for the Clive/Elza subquest. Beyond that, there are a lot of gorgeous color pictures and complete dungeon maps, which are always a big plus. Overall, this is a guide I wouldn't want to be without.
