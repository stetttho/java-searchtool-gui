 Back before Final Fantasy 7 turned the RPG genre upside down, games used to look a lot like this. Only not as good. Working Designs and GameArts have between them produced a pair of little masterpieces in the Lunar games; they won't set the world on fire, but they encapsulate what was best about RPGs before everything went 3-D. The story is simple enough -- stop Zophar before he destroys the world of the Silver Star -- but what makes the game is the amount of character development and quality dialogue. Even the most unimportant NPC will have several comments (most of them quite funny) over the course of the game. It's simple enough to pack loads of text into a game to increase the replay value, but only Working Designs has really been willing to do so. What's more, there are a lot of hidden weapons, accessories and items strewn throughout the game that completists will need to find. As far as the technical aspects of the game are concerned, it's got lovely music and beautiful if primitive graphics. My rating for the original Lunar game would be five stars, as it is short and perfect. This one doesn't *quite* measure up -- its length really isn't sustained by the slender plot. Moreover, there are three or four anti-gay jokes that are kind of inappropriate. But this game is rarely anything but fun to play, and I'd recommend it in a heartbeat.
