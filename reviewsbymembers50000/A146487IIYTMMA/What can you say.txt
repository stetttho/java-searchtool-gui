 ...about a score that includes "Big Spender" and "If My Friends Could See Me Now", but in which they aren't the best songs? Cy Coleman's other work has been distinguished and attractive enough, but it was with this show that he left a permanent mark on the history of the American musical theatre. The story of Charity (essayed unforgettably by the late Gwen Verdon) is an uproarious and very moving fable about love, trust and their implications. This potent mix of emotions didn't entirely translate to the movie (where Charity's humiliation was a bit too realistic for comfort), but it emerges fully from the original cast album. Coleman's score (with fine lyrics by Dorothy Fields) is dazzling, ranging from the aforementioned standards to the haunting "Where Am I Going?" to the exhilarating "I'm a Brass Band". And this recording, despite its small omissions (the third part of the "Rich Man's Frug" dance sequence, for example), stands as the definitive account, and would do so even without the interesting bonus tracks.
