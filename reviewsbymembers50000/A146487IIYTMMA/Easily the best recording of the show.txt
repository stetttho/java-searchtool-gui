 The excellent original cast album is sadly truncated, the longer Broadway revival album features performances that aren't as impressive off stage, and the soundtrack (like the movie) is missing much of the score.  This is not only the most complete reading of CHICAGO (including lots of dialogue, brief reprises, dance music and other odds and ends), but it's possibly the best performed overall. Ruthie Henshall seems at times to be channeling Judy Garland as Roxie; it's a shocking, thrilling, totally satisfying account of the role. Also excellent is the great jazz singer Ute Lemper, perhaps the most distinctive vocalist ever to take on Velma Kelly.  Henry Goodman has all the voice required for Billy Flynn and puts a wonderfully wry spin on the lyrics. Nigel Planer is the most obvious piece of casting of the leads as Amos, and curiously the least successful; even if he can't touch John C. Reilly, he's an improvement over Joel Grey. Meg Johnson snarls more than she sings, but that's absolutely fine for Mama Morton, and she's a riot.  The orchestra is marvelous and the tempi are kept brisk. Every minute of this album is compulsively listenable, which is important because it's such a long sucker. If you can only get one recording of this great score, this is definitely it.
