 My Neighbor Totoro has always been a favorite movie of mine (which is fortunate as my youngest son watched it hundreds of times growing up), ever since I bought the VHS version which was released  many years ago.  I have been waiting a long time for a US DVD release which I finally received last week.  I was surprised to find that the movie has been re-dubbed, featuring the voices of Dakota and Elle Fanning as the sisters Satsuki and Mei.  The original English dub on the VHS release is far superior.  Unfortunately the English dub in this version has been completely Americanized, losing much of the charm of the original.  You can see the difference if you turn on the English soundtrack along with the English subtitles.  The subtitles are a much better reflection of the original Japanese language script.  At least you can watch the dvd in Japanese with English subtitles, bypassing the poor dub.  It's a shame Disney apparently felt that Americans would not appreciate a real "Japanese" flavored film, which to me is a big part of this movie's charm.  That said, My Neighbor Totoro is still a wonderful film, for children and adults and it's great to finally own a widescreen copy on dvd.
