 I tried to watch this dvd, but after about 10 minutes gave up.  It was impossible to watch because only bits of the conversations between the characters were translated.  I've seen some poorly subtitled foreign films, but this was by far the worst.  Don't bother until a dvd with decent subtitles is released.
