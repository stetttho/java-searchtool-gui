 This is one of the outstanding memoirs written by women who have served in the US Army.  Charity Adams Early was the first African American woman to receive a commission in the WAC during World War II, and later became the commander of the 6888th Central Postal Directory, the only black WAC unit sent overseas.  She frankly discusses the problems faced by black WACS, including segregation in training and unit assignment, and the prejudices she faced.  Highly recommended.
