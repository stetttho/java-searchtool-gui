 We have needed a new tv for quite some time (our 14 year old Hitachi set was failing), and after doing research on the different types of tvs available, plasma vs LCD vs conventional set, I decided to go with a conventional set, which delivers the best picture for the least amount of money.  I chose Sony's KV-30HS420 widescreen high definition tv after looking at a number of tvs in the store and reading reviews (it recently got a great rating in the March 2005 issue of Consumer Reports).  I could have saved about $60 on the set buying on Amazon rather than locally, but decided not to in case there were any problems with the set and also I would have to wait at least a week to receive it.  Be warned that if this is your first HD tv, you will probably need to spend about $150 buying new cables to take advantage of the HD features when you hook up your dvd player and cable box to the tv.  I bought two sets of Monster brand cables for my Comcast DVR cable box and my dvd player.  This tv is HEAVY!  My husband and I managed to carry this down steps from our driveway into the house and then down a flight of steps into our basement tv room, but that's only because he's very strong.  You really need at least 2 strong people to carry this.  If you buy locally and can't find help, it would be worth it to pay for delivery and set up.  We did have some problems hooking up our cable box to the tv, as Sony's directions are not clear, but we finally got everything working. We have Comcast digital cable and receive a number of HD broadcasts and the picture quality is unbelievable!  Our dvds look equally as great.    If you are considering a new tv, I would highly recommend this model.
