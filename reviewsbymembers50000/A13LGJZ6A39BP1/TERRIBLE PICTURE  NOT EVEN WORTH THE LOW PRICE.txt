 I've been wanting to buy a portable dvd player for some time, and with an airplane trip from Boston to Alaska planned, I thought this would be the perfect time to take the plunge. I was attracted to the Audiovox D1500A 5" Portable DVD Player due to the low price and great Amazon ratings. I received the player and after testing it with several dvds, I'm wondering - is this the same player everyone here is raving about?  The player looks sturdy and figuring out how to use it was a snap. I popped in my first test dvd, The Sound of Music, and turned the player on. The sound from the speakers is about what you'd expect, terrible, but with headphones it was fine. I was surprised with the picture quality. There was a problem with aliasing as well as colors looking washed out.   Thinking it might be the dvd, I also tried my Fargo dvd and then a dvd from the tv series, X Files, and had the same problem with each - washed out color, aliasing, and titles which were blurry around the edges and extremely difficult to read.   The only adjustment you can make to the picture is the brightness, and playing around with that didn't help. I am not particularly demanding when it comes to video quality, but I could not put up with this poor picture quality for an entire movie.   Even the extremely low price does not justify the worst picture quality I have ever seen on a portable dvd player.  I returned this to Amazon and bought a Panasonic brand player instead.
