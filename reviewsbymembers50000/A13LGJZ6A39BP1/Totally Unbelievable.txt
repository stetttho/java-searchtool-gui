 Spanglish is a big boring mess, with terrible performances by Adam Sandler (completely miscast) and Tea Leoni. If this had just been a movie about a Mom from Mexico trying to deal with raising her daughter in the US, it would have been great.  The performances by Mother and daughter, Paz Vega and Shelbie Bruce, were excellent.  The most unbelievable part of the film was that the audience is supposed to believe that Adam Sandler's character, a chef and restaurant owner in LOS ANGELES, speaks not a word of Spanish!  Not a chance in real life.  Who do you think is working in the kitchens in these fancy restaurants?  Spanish speaking employees.
