 Today I received my recent order for these champagne glasses.  The quality is excellent, I could find no flaws at all in these glasses.  I have other glassware from Spiegelau (from the Vino Grande line)and have been equally pleased with those.  The price was fabulous as well.  I paid $29.99 with free 2 day shipping (I'm an Amazon Prime member) for 12 glasses just a few days ago.  Now I see that these glasses are no longer offered directly from Amazon but through another merchant, and cost $69.99!  This seems to happen all the time on Amazon; I suggest that if you are interested in these glasses, keep checking and see if Amazon offers them directly again at a better price.
