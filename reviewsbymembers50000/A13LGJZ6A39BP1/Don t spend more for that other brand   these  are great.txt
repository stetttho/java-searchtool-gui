 I bought a set of these glasses for my husband for Christmas after debating a long time between these and some similar glasses from Reidel.  I have to say that we are very happy with these lower priced glasses (although I paid $39.99 in December 2004 and now in January 2005 the price has gone up to $58.99!).    As other reviews have stated, these are large, but are beautifully made.  Mine had no optical distortions.  They are perfect for use as all purpose red wine glasses.  Give these a try before buying the more expensive brand.  You will be pleasantly surprised.
