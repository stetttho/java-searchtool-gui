 I don't own this particular set, but I do own a bottle of the Gingerbread Man Bubble bath and despite the description here that these items are infused with "philosophy's famous gingerbread scent," be warned that these products do NOT smell like gingerbread.   Rather the Gingerbread Man  scent is supposed to smell like ginger ale and actually has a rather citrusy fragrance.  It's a nice bubble bath, but smells nothing like gingerbread.
