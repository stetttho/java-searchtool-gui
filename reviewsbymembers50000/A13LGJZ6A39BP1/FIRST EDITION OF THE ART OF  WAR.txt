 If you are a Candace Bushnell fan, or just looking for an enjoyable fun read, this book fits the bill.  It could have used some more careful editing.  Nico, one of the main characters, tries to woo an advertiser to her magazine by spending $1,000 to buy him a FIRST EDITION copy of the Art of War (by Sun Tzu).  Pretty neat trick, considering that this book was written about 2,500 YEARS ago in Chinese!
