 This book was well written with a very intriguing premise; should 13 year old Anna, who was conceived as a cord blood donor for her older, leukemia stricken sister, have the right to make her own decisions about continuing to assist her sister medically?  This book held my interest up to the conclusion, which was a complete disappointment and a bit of a cop-out.  **WARNING**  Stop reading here if you haven't read the book or don't want to read a mild spoiler.  Something extremely improbable happens at the end of the story, which renders the entire question of Anna's medical rights moot.  Note to the author - anyone with the medical condition of one of the characters involved in the incident after Anna's last court appearance would not be allowed to have a driver's license.  I felt incredibly cheated by this ending, although it certainly allowed the writer to tie everything up neatly.
