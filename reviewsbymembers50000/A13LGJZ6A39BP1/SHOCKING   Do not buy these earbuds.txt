 I bought a pair of Sony MDR-EX71SL/WK Fontopia Headphones last November to use with my iPod mini and they were a big improvement over the standard iPod earbuds.  They block outside sound a lot better and provide decent sound quality, especially for the price.  However, I cannot recommend these because I have experienced the same problem as some other raters, that these earbuds are literally shocking.  The earbuds come with a 1-meter extension cord.  I noticed that when I used the extension cord, when the metal end of the extension cord brushed against my arm, I got a shock.  I had to cover the exposed metal with a piece of tape to stop this.  Then I started getting shocks in each ear from the earbuds, at random intervals.  This is unacceptable.  I will be complaining to Sony, although I do not know if they will do anything about this.    Don't buy these.  I'm sure there are other earbuds of similar quality and price where you don't risk getting shocked every time you use them.
