 This is a nice cd player with good sound at a reasonable price, which you should consider if you only want to play regular cd disks.  However, if you want to use this for MP3 format disks, forget about it.  I bought this for my mom and she told me that it would not play the tracks of MP3 cds I had made for her in the correct track order.  She contacted Panasonic who could not figure out the problem and had her send it to them for repair.  She got it back, and it still didn't play tracks in order.  Then I discovered that for some odd reason, this player will only play MP3 tracks in the correct order if they are named properly, example, 001.mp3, 002.mp3, etc.  Seems odd that Panasonic employees couldn't figure this out. I use Roxio to burn disks and I cannot name tracks in this way.  I have owned a number of MP3 cd players and this is the only one I have owned which won't play tracks in order.    I have purchased my mom a Sony MP3 cd player and I suggest that you do the same.
