 This is an excellent car charger for your iPod.  It is sturdy and well designed.  Even though it does not indicate this anywhere on the packaging, it works great for an iPod mini as well.  I really like the fact that I can plug my cassette adapter into this charger, rather than into the earphone jack of my iPod mini, to play tunes through my car's speaker system.  Before I used this charger, I could not always get the plug from my cassette adaptor to fit snugly into my iPod mini's earphone jack.  This is NOT a wireless system for your iPod to play in your car; I  believe the reviewer below from Texas posted under the wrong product.  If you're looking for a car charger for your iPod or iPod mini, you won't be disappointed in this product.
