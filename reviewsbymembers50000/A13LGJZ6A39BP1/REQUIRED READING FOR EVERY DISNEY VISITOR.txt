 Whether you're planning your first trip to Disney World or your tenth, The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World should be required reading.  This book has it ALL - detailed advice and price guide for Disney Resorts, including suggestions for the best rooms and room plans, descriptions of off property hotels, comparisons of different ticket packages, dining ratings, plans for touring the parks, ride descriptions, visiting with children, and even info on attractions outside Disney.  I bought the 2004 edition for our first Disney World trip and just received the 2006 edition for our next trip in January 2006.  It has been extensively updated.  If you're looking for the best all around guide to Walt Disney World, this is the only book you'll need.
