 I've been wanting to get a portable dvd player for a long time and with an upcoming 13+ hour flight from Boston to Alaska, I decided to take the plunge.  (...) To my surprise, the little Panasonic LS5 player with 5" widescreen display was a standout!   The Panasonic LS5 has a bright, clear picture which even I, who need glasses for close work, could see just fine. The coolest part about the monitor is that you can adjust the angle of viewing just by popping the LCD forward (as shown in the picture of this player on Amazon). The screen can fold down almost flat on top of the player so it takes up even less space. The whole player, even with the battery attached, is really small - perfect for travel.  This does not come with a car adaptor, but I found an extra battery, CGR-H601, with about a 4 hour playtime (I actually watched two dvds on a recent flight and did not run out of power), online for $49.00. That's a lot cheaper than the car power adaptor. You'll also need an earphone splitter (they are very inexpensive) if you want to watch using earphones with a friend as there is only on earphone plug. (...) This really is a great little portable dvd player.
