      Now, Fantasia may not have been the best singer in the last American Idol competition, but she's surely proven to the world that she's an entertainer.  Whenever she sings a song, she makes the song her own.  She won that competition because she was one of the only competitors with style and charisma.  This album proves that Fantasia belongs in the music industry.  The songs fit her voice very well which she's chosen to experiment on different types of songs.  The only problem I can see with this album is it's not getting the promotion it deserves.  These days, the ALBUMS that are getting so much promotion are sounding like gargbage and the great albums are being SLEPT ON.  Overall, the album is great and you must buy it.  You will not regret your purchase.
