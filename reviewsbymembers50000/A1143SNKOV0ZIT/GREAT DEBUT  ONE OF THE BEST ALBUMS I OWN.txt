 I listened to this album fully for the first time about two years ago and I must say, it's off the hook even though it was released 13 years ago.  Wow!  L.A. Reid and Babyface surely knew what they were doing when they signed this group.  This is one of the best girl groups of all time.  They have sold millions of records and not even Destiny's Child, oops, I mean Beyonce & Destiny's child can top this groups' success.  What I like about this group is none of the members ever hogged the spotlight like Beyonce did.  They were equals and also different.  Overall, great album.  Even though it's 13 years old, it's a must buy.
