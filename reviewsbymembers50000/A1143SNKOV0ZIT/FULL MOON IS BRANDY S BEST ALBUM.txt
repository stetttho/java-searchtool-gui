 I remembered waiting and waiting and waiting for this album to dropped.  I thought that there could never be an album released better than NEVER-SAY-NEVER but I was wrong.  FULL MOON is the bomb.  I've listened to this CD over and over and over and I like it more and more everyday.  Brandy is fierce and she's a talented singer and actress.  Unfortunately, FULL MOON has been only certified PLATINUM which is good for selling albums but a let down for her.  NEVER-SAY-NEVER sold over 5 million copies to date.  I think that people was trying to compare this album to her last one because everyone loved her last album.  I wish people would listen to FULL MOON more so they could understand what she's saying.  She has grown and matured so much and she'll always be one of my favorite entertainers.  Right now, she's going through a divorce but she's in the studio right now getting ready for her 4th LP.  Brandy is the bomb.
