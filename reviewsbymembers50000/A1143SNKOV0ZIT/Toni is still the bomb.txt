 I remembered when I first bought and listened this CD, I thought it was trash.  After listening to it a few more times, I realized that it's a good CD and I just had to give it a chance.  She has some very good songs on this CD.  It's not her best CD ever released but it's very good.  The only problem I saw with this CD was that it was not promoted enough.  Now I see why she left Arista records and signed with Blackground records.  Toni is still the bomb!!!
