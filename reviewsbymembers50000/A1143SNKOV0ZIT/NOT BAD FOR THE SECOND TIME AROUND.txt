 I loved the first album but this album is okay.  It took a while to grow on me but it's a nice album. I'm glad they left some songs on the album where Nutari's voice was still there.  I think she is the best singer even though everyone would say that it's Adrienne.  Anyway, overall the album is good for the second time around.
