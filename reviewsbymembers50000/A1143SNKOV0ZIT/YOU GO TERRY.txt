      Terry was my favorite member of the group En Vogue and I always thought she was the best singer of the group until I realized it was Dawn.  Southern Gal is a laid back, mid-tempo album the brings forth another side of Terry.  On this solo album, she really pushes her vocals and she proves that she can make it on her own.  Unfortunately, this album didn't really sell because of the bad promotion.  Overall, this album is really nice if you like the laid back grooves.
