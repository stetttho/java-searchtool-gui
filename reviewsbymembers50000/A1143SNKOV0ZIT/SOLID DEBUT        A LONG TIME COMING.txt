 This is a great album.  The only fear I have of this album is the promotion it's receiving.  Keyshia is the real deal.  I can tell that some of the songs she released on this album are related life experiences she encountered.  These days, the real artists and musicians that are gifted with talent are the ones that are not getting the promtion and credit they deserves.  Keyshia Cole is surely one of them.
