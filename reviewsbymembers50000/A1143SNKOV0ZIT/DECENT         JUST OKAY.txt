 Even though Janet is my favorite Jackson of them all, Rebbie is the only one out of the three sisters that can really sing.  Her style of course differs from her two younger sisters.  Rebbie never portrayed the sexy side of herself like her sisters but concentrated more on her vocal ability.  She doesn't have the best singing voice like Mariah or Whitney but she can surely sing.  This album delivers tunes about love in every way whether it's fast, mid-tempo, or slow grooves. Even though she would be considered a one hit wonder with her hit "Centipede", Rebbie released about 4 albums overall, which none of the albums really made a dent on the charts. Rebbie is talented, but maybe if she had gotten the right promotion in her singing career, Michael and Janet wouldn't have been the only 2 Jacksons to make it big.
