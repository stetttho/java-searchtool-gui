      Tevin Campbell use to be one of my favorite male singers but what happened to his career.  This album is just okay but I think the real problem was the promotion behind it.  Even though the first single which was titled "Another Way", got a lot's airplay, it wasn't enough to put him back into the runnings with other male R&B stars.  His first two albums got him famous but this album and his third didn't make a dent on the charts.  Overall, due to the scandals and tabloids, this talented young man's career is over.
