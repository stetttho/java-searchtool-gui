 Wow!  I waited for this album for weeks and it's finally here.  I think this album is okay.  When I first listen to this album, I was disappointed but now it's growing on me.  The tracks that really got my attention was "Thinking about my ex", "R&B Junkie" and "My baby".  Over the years, I've heard people say that Ms. Janet can't sing.  I really think she can sing but she hasn't done a song that can really bring out her vocals.  I expected at least a song to show her vocals on this album.  This album is very different because normally she has a lot of interludes on her albums.  I guest she's trying different things.  Overall, the album is okay but I'm sure after I've listened to it, it will be da bomb.  Ms. Jackson has done it again.
