 I'm really feeling this album.  I was very hesitant to buy it at first but I'm glad I did.  Joss Stone proves she can hang with the R&B crew and produce good music.  She's not just another "blue eye soul" wannabee.  Overall, this is a good album and if you're into good soul music, this is it.  You will not regret your purchase.
