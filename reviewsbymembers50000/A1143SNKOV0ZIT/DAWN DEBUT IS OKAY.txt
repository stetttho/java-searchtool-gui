 When I first bought this album, I didn't really listen to it that much.  After time past, I placed it in my CD player one day and listen to it.  This CD is really good.  It could've been a little bit better but I still give her credit.  I always thought that she had the strongest voice out of the whole En Vogue group and I noticed that when she left, the group went down hill.  The only problem I see with this album is that it wasn't promoted enough.  I don't even think she did a video.  I hate it when a damn good CD drops and there's no promotion behind it.  I guess you can thank her record label for that.  Overall, this album is good.
