      Trisha Covington is just one of those artist who came onto the music scene and disappeared just as quickly.  The album is good, but got little promotion.  With the right promotion, Trisha would've been one of those female artist that would've stayed around for a long time.  Her first single got a lot of airplay but it wasn't enough to put her onto the scene.  Overall, good album, bad promotion.
