      ALLURE is one of my favorite female groups and I was very suprised when I heard they were releasing a new album.  I thought it was over for them when they released their sophmore album.  I thought their sophmore album was good but didn't get any promotion just like this album.  In order for a album to sell, you must promote it.  I haven't seen them on TV or heard anything on the radio.      Even though they're short one member, ALLURE still proves that they can harmonize and compete with other female groups.  They've stuck to their old style of music along with a new sound which is blended in.  My favorite tracks so far are HATE 2 LUV U and LET HIM GO.      Overall, these girls delivered a good album with hot tracks but promotion however is needed desperately.
