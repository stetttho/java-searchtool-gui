 Tracie Spencer was one of the most favorite female R&B artist of the early ninties.  I never cared for her previous albums but I love this album.  Too bad the album got little promotion just like Tevin Campbell and Shanice's albums that were released that same year.  Tracie hooked up with producers "Soulshock & Karlin"  which I think she was dating one of them at the time.  It's rare that you find a album where you could listen to every song.  This album is very nice and I would recommend buying it.
