 This is one of the best greatest hits collection I've ever heard.  The lyrics especially are so deep and true.  This album is a must buy or download.  I really recommend it.  My two  favorite tracks are #14 which is titled "No Night So Long" and track #13 which is "After You".  Dionne has always been one of my favorite "old school" divas in the industry.  Overall, this is a great album and I recommend purchase if you're a Dionne Warwick fan.
