 Wow!  I never thought this CD was going to be any good but it is.  Melanie B. has really good producers on this CD like Missy, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Teddy Riley and Rodney Jerkins.  I'm sorry I didn't buy it sooner.  I wish this CD was released in the U.S. because I think it would've blown up.  It was only released overseas though.  Melanie B. is the bomb.  I wish we could see more of her.
