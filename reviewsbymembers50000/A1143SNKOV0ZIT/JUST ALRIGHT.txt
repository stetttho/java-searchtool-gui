 This album is nothing really to brag about but it's just okay.  Ashanti was never really a big fan of mine but sometimes she releases good singles.  My favorite tracks from this album are "Break up 2 Make up", "I found Lovin", and "Rain on me".  The first single off this album wasn't to bad either but it surely got a lot of airplay.  Even though the two singles released from this album made it into the Billboard top ten chart, the album didn't sell as much as the first one.  Chapter two has been certified platinum which is still good but I think her debut CD sold over three million copies.  I try not to compare music artist because everyone is an individual and does their own thing.  Most music artist have their time to shine and Ashanti has had her moments but she needs to come back very strong or else she will be forgotten.  Overall, the album is okay.  It's not a must have but good to get.
