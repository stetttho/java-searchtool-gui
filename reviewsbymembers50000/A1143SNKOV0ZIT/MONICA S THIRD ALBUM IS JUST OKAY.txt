 I waited and waited and waited for this album to be released and when it did, I was kinda disappointed.  I think that Monica should've released this album last year when it was titled "All eyez on me."  I heard the album "All eyez on me"(which only was released overseas) earlier this year before she released "After the Storm".  Monica thought that if Missy produced her CD, it would sell but so far, the CD has been certified GOLD.  Both her first and second albums were certified triple platinum.  I think she should've stuck with Dallas Austin when it came to producing her albums.  I know sometimes everyone wants a change but it's like the saying goes, "If it's not broke, don't try to fix it."  There are a few good songs on the CD though.  I like the song "Hurts the Most" and I like the duet she did with DMX.  Overall, this CD is okay but I expected more from Monica.
