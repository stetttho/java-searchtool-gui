As one of the lead vocals for the famous group DRU HILL, Sisqo always stood out from the rest and he was never was hated being the lead singer like Beyonce.  UNLEASH THE DRAGON is a great solo debut and Sisqo captured everyone's attention with songs like "THE THONG SONG" and "INCOMPLETE".  Suprisingly, Sisqo fell off the map and has disappeared for a long time but he's coming out with a new album in 2006.  Be prepared for THE LAST DRAGON which will blow everyone away.
