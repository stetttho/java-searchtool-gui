 This was all in the plan from the beginning.  Matthew Knowles had one goal in common; to make sure his little girl reach the top.  He surely didn't care about Kelly, Michelle or any of the other girls that left the group.  This CD got so much promotion.  What about Kelly and Michelle's CDs?  There CD didn't even get promoted that well.  They were good CD too.  I think Beyonce and her father is one of the biggest phonies in the entertainment business.  Like I said in the beginning; this was the plan from the start.
