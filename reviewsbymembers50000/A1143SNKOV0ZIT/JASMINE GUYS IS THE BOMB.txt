 Jasmine Guys is one of the most talented black entertainers in the business.  I first saw her on "A Different World" and then found out that she was a singer.  I've seen her sing on a few episodes on the show and I said to myself, "She should release a album" and not to long after that, she did.  I have the cassette version of this album and it's the bomb.  She has a okay singer voice.  It's not a Whitney or Mariah singer voice but it's okay.  I'm so sorry that I don't see more her on TV but she's doing broadway.  For all the Jasmine Guy fans out there, she been doing broadway for a while now.  Jasmine is the bomb.
