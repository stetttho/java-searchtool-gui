   Faith Evans is one of my favorite female artist and I couldn't wait for this album to drop.  This is her debut album from her new record label which is Capitol records.  There's no more BADBOY or Puffy behind of her.  If you ask me, she doing well without them even though she will always be a part of the BADBOY legacy.  Faith really delivers on this album. One of the things I've always admired about Faith is her song writing abilities and the way she blends it with the working of hot producers like Jermaine Dupri and Pharrell Williams.  She has always managed to blend in the old school sound with the new or current sound that's going on today.  I must admit that her 1995 debut is my favorite followed by 2001's FAITHFULLY.  Overall, this album is really good but not her best work.  As said before, Faith always delivers.
