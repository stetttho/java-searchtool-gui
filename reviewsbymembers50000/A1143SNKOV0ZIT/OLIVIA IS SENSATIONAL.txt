 I remembered when I couldn't wait for this CD to drop and when it did, I thought it was the bomb.  Olivia's album was the first album to be released from J Records in 2001.  This album is really good and I wish that it got promoted, as it should've been.  They're right about what they say about her.  She's got the mouth of a bad girl but the voice of an angel.  Her voice kinda reminds me of Aaliyah's.  I think that Clive Davis didn't promote this album enough.  I hope that she releases another album soon.  One of my favorite songs on this album is the duet with Jimmy Cozier, which is the last track.  Overall, Olivia is the bomb and so is her album.
