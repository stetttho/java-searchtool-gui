 One of the reasons why I love Missy is because she's so unique.  Missy is one of the only female rappers in the game that brings forth her own style and originality.  This album is not her best work but it's good and of course it was certified platinum.  This is Missy's fifth album which I think now she's taking a break and doing a new reality show starting early 2005.  Overall, this album is good and can stand on it's own.  GOOD JOB MISSY.
