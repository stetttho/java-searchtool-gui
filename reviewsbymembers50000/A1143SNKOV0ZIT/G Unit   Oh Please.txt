 G-Unit!!  Oh Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  50 Cents thinks that he's on top of the world now.  His ego has gotten so big and he talks like he's been in the music business for twenty years.  It makes my stomach sick the way he talks about other artist and disses them.  When 50 cent first came out, he was a nobody and he wouldn't have blown up if it weren't for Doctor Dre and Eminem.  This album was horrible.  He's trying to blow up his friends by putting himself on the album because they know without him, they're nothing.  Overall, this album sucks.
