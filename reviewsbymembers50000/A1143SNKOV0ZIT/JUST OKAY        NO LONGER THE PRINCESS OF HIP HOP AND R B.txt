      I couldn't wait for this album to be released.  I thought that Ashanti would release a banging album after her debut and sophmore effort.  Over the years, an individual artist who have released many albums always have ablums that are da bomb, just okay, or whack.  Every album that Ashanti released was just okay.  CONRETE ROSE is no exception.  Even though I commend her on her song writing abilities, CONCRETE ROSE doesn't do it for me.  Ashanti needs to take a break and re-invent herself.  Overall, this album is just okay but nothing to brag about.
