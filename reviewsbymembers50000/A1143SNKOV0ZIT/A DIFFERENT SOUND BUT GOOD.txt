 When I first heard this album, I didn't know whether to give it 5 stars or 1 star.  I've listened to this album all weekend and I must say that it's really good.  Some people may not agree because she changed up her sound a little.  Brandy's music is more mature and sensual.  Most of the songs are just laid back.  When Rodney "DarkChild" Jerkins produced her music, her songs were more "up-tempo" and "popish" which he gave to everyone else.  That's why she left his production.  His sound is so familiar.  People must stop comparing this album to her previous albums because the sound and style are different.  Timbaland and Kanye West did a good job on this album.  It has been ten years since Brandy's debut and she's still going strong.  My favorite tracks so far is AFRODISIAC and TALK ABOUT OUR LOVE.  Overall, it's a nice album and it's a must have.
