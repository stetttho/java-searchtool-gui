      I was really suprised when I listen this album.  I didn't even know that Raven was releasing an album so soon.  Wow!  I guess the promotion behind this album was really bad.  I saw this CD in BEST BUY and I thought I should get it.  I'm glad I did though.  This CD is not so bad.  I was expecting it to be terrible.  She really got some good songs on this album.  What I really like on this album is there's a mixture of songs.  It's R&B, Pop and Rock all together.  Raven is not a bad singer either.  She doesn't have a Mariah, Celine, or Christina voice but she can carry a tune.  I think her voice is still maturing and she did good with the vocals.  Overall, Raven did good on this album but the only problem will be the promotion.  These days, I hear a lot of good albums with bad promotion.  There are a lot of CD's being released today and are selling millions but are garbage.  The good CD's are getting no promotion.
