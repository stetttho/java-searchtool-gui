      I bought this album the same year it was released because of the song WHY I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.  This album growed on me after a while and even though I liked it, I felt that most of the songs were a little to mature for her only being fourteen at the time.  The lyrics were so grown up and Dallas Austin did a good job producing this album.  Monica has a unique voice; which has matured over the years and she will be one of those female artist that will be around for a long time.  GO MONICA.
