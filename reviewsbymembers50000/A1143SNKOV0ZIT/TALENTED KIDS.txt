      One thing I really like to see is when kids who release albums act like kids.  I hate when kids try to act like they're ten years older than what they are.  On this debut album, these boys act their age.  The songs are focus on teenage crushes, puppy love and just being kids.  The production of the album is very good.  Dallas Austin(who discovered Monica), wrote and produced most of the songs which was a good combination.  Overall, this is a good album.
