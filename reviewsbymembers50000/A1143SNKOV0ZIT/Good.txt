 I think this is a very good Cd but the only thing I hate is that Christina is very arrogant when it comes to her voice.  She feels that no one can sing better than her and she talks about other female artists like she's a legend.  She gave a good performance at the grammys but the night belonged to Beyonce' when she gave that marvelous performance.  Take that Christina!!!!!!
