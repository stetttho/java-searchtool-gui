 I was always a fan of Amerie especially when she debut in 2002. I anticipated the arrival of her new album "Touch" which I feel is just okay.  The first half of the CD is slammin, but the other half is nothing to brag about.  Amerie doesn't have the best singing voice but she delivers on certain tracks.  Overall, the album is okay but I would recommend downloading rather than buying.
