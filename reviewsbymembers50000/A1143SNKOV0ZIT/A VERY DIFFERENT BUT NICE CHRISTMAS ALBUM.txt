      I love this album.  On most Christmas albums, artist tend to sing and remake the old classic Christmas songs but the majority of this album are songs recently written and produced my Keri Lewis who's Toni's husband and Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds.  My favorite track is track 8 which is titled THIS TIME NEXT YEAR which is a love and Christmas song mixed into one.  Overall, this is a good Christmas album and you won't be disappointed.
