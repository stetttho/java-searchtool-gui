 You know what, when Terry Dexter first came out, I wasn't at all interested in her because I felt her first single didn't move me to well.  Another time, I was hearing one of my friends saying that her CD was really nice.  I finally bought it and I think this CD is really good.  She's just another artist that didn't get promoted enough.  When I first listen to this CD, I didn't like it at first but after the second and third time, I realize this girl can really sing and she deserves more.
