 This is a really good CD.  I didn't like it at first but now I think it's da bomb.  Maria is just another artist that didn't get any promotion.  The world doesn't know who she is.  I love this CD.  This album was produced by Soulshock & Karlin which are very good producers but doesn't receive any credit.  These producers also produced Tracie Spencer's last album which was da bomb.  Overall, this CD should be listened to.
