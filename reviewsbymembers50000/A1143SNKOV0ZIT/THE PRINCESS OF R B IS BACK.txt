 Wow!  I love this single and I think it was a good choice for Brandy to release it first.  She is back and ready to re-claim her title.  During the time of her last album, she was dealing with mother hood so she really couldn't promote her album.  Kanye West is a good producer and I think it was a good colaboration.  Brandy's last album was certified only platinum but this upcoming Cd will be the bomb.
