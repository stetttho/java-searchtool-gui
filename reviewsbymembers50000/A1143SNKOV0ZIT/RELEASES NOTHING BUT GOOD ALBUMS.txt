      I've always been a fan of Jon B and this was surely a album that got no promotion.  When I bought this album, I din't even know that Jon B was releasing another album.  When I first listen to it, I was disappointed but I realized after a few listens that this album is great.  The production is great and also his colaborations which includes NAS and Faith Evans.  Overall, this album is a must buy.  You won't be disappointed.
