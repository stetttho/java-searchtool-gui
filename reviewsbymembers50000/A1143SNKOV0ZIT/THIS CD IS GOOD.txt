 I must admit that this CD is really good.  The only thing I hate to say is that Christina has gotten so full of herself when it comes to her voice.  I mean, I know she can sing but she feels that no one can sing better that her.  She's so arrogant when it comes to her voice.  When Beyonce gave that marvelous performance at the grammys, I knew that Christina felt bad.  Beyonce just let her have it.
