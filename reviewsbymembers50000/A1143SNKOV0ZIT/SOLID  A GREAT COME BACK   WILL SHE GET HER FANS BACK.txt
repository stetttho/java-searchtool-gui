 One of the things I've always loved about Mariah is that she always delivers a compilation of good songs.  I wish she would pay more attention to the way she dresses these days.  For the past 6 years, she's been dressing like a hoochie.  Her look is the hoochie type but her songs are not.    This is a great album which I honestly favor over her last release which was CHARMBRACELET.  My favorite Mariah album would be RAINBOW which was released in 1999.  Overall, this is a good album and I recommend purchase.
