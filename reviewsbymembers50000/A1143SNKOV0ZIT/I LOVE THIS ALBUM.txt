 Besides En Vogue, Jade was one of my all time favorite female groups out there.  During this time, there were only three other girl groups that were hot and they were EN VOGUE, SWV and BROWNSTONE.  I'm so sorry that JADE broke up.  I heard that there were members within the group that couldn't get along.  This is one girl group I can say that all the girls can sing.  Tonya's range was different from Joi and Di but these girls can blow.  I can sit down and listen to every song on this album.  I hated that they didn't get the credit they deserve.  It would be very nice if they made a comeback.
