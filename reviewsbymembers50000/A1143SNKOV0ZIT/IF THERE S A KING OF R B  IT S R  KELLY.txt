 R. Kelly has done it again.  I can honestly say that I've never really been disappointed with an R. Kelly album.  This album is good.  Not his best work but it's really good.  [...] which was released in 2000.  TP.3 Reloaded displays R. Kelly's talent as a songwriter and a producer.  Even though some of the songs are predictable by sound, the production and lyrics are off the chain.  He's colaborated with great artists on this album which includes Snoop Dogg, Elephant Man & Nivea.  Overall, TP.3 Reloaded is a good album and it's surely a "must buy" for R. Kelly fans.
