      I've listened to this album about 5 times and now I can say that it's not so bad.  Actually, it's a good album but just needed to be given a chance.  Though RL didn't push his vocals on this album, the lyrics and production are pretty good.  If this album was promoted properly, RL would have the success of other lead singers from groups like Sisqo and Beyonce.  Overall, not bad.
