   I have been waiting for years to see Wonder Woman on DVD.  She was the first female television super hero watched by both men and women.  They couldn't have picked a better actress to play the femele heroine.  Lynda Carter is beautiful.  Overall, this collection is a must to have for all the old-school fans.
