 Wow!!  She did it.  Dawn finally released her solo album after all these years.  That is one of the reasons why she left En Vogue.  Part of the deal while being a member of En Vogue is that she can release a solo album just like Terry Ellis did.  I think this album is okay.  Although she has a very powerful voice and I always thought she was the best singer of En Vogue, I think that some of her songs could've been a lot better not that they're bad.  I heard on the last track how she's talking about En Vogue and Lucy Pearl.  It's a funny thing because these days, you don't hear anything about Dawn, En Vogue or Lucy Pearl.  The last I heard, Dawn was on tour doing a play with Johnny Gill.  Overall, Dawn is talented singer and her album is okay.
