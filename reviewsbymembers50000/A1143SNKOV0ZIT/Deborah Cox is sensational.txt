 This is my favorite Deborah Cox CD.  I'm so sorry that it wasn't promoted enough.  I don't think it sold well either but it's da bomb.  I think she really out done herself on this one.  My favorites tracks are five and six.  She's a very good singer and I hope she releases another album real soon even though she tackling motherhood right now.
