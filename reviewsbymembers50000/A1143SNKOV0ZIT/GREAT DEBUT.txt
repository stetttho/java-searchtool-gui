 This album has a nice pop/r&b feel to it.  JoJo is the ordinary girl next door and she delivers nicely on this album.  Her first single is getting a lot of airplay which is pretty good.  I can see this young lady going places.  I think she's only fourteen or fifteen and her voice is still maturing but she did a good job with her vocals.  Overall, a great album.
