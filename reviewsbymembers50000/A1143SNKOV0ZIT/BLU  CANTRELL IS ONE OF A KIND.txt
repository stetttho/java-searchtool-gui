 I love this CD.  I wish that people would sit down and listen to it.  I think a lot people didn't like this CD because these days, people are into all this "hip hop".  This CD is the bomb and it should've been promoted.  I saw no promotion for this CD at all.  Blu has a powerful voice and the look to match.  So what if she took pics for playboy?  This girl is one of the many entertainers that are so talented and don't get any recognition.
