 Whenever I think that Jessica Simpson has done a bad job on something, she always proves me wrong.  This CD is really nice and laid back.  I didn't like it at first but now I do.  I thought it wasn't going to sell but it was just certified platinum.  Very good Jessica.  I wish that Nick could share the same glory with his solo project.
