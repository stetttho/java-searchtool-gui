 This CD is really nice.  I wish it was promoted more and Tamar got the credit she deserves.  She really can sing.  People always says that she is trying to sound like her sister Toni.  Hello!!!  They're sisters!  They don't sound exactly alike but you can hear the similarities in their voices.  Tamar is the bomb.
