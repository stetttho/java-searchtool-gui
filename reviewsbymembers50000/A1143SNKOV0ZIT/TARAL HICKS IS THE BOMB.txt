 Taral Hicks is one of my favorite actresses and when I first heard that she released a album, I made sure I bought it right away.  This girl can really, really, really sing.  I heard that she was dropped from Motown records when they were doing some restructuring.  One of these record labels needs to sign her because she is really talented.  I give this album an A+.  I really wish she would drop another album soon.  The last time I saw Taral was on a episode of the series "Soul Food" and she did outstanding ofcourse.  Taral is the bomb.
