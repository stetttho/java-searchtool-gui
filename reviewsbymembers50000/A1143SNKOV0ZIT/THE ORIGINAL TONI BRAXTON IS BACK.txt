 Toni Braxton has always been one of my favorite female artists of all time.  She has now made it to her fifth album which is a good thing because some artist doesn't even make it to their sophomore album.  The style of music on this album is a lot similar to her self titled debut album.  She's gone back to her original sound which is a good thing.  One thing that I noticed is there are no hip-hop songs or quest rappers on this album. Toni stuck to her original sound.  This album is a great buy for all the Toni Braxton fans but I'm worried about the record sales.  In the industry today, most CD purchases are by teenagers and young adults.  They are into artist today like Usher, Beyonce, Fifty Cent, Lil Jon, T.I., Ciara, Ludacris and Bow Wow.  Her fans will surely buy this album but it's all about the promotion behind it.  I honestly feel that this album is not being promoted well.  I would call this Toni's comeback album but the promotion behind it sucks.  Overall, LIBRA is a great album and it would be a shame if it doesn't sell.
