 I've read through some of the one star reviews and have noticed people getting some of their facts wrong. Many of you are saying that Raven is only a singer because of Disney. That is NOT true. This is her third album. She's been singing for a long time now, before she was even signed to Disney. I'm on Tower Records online and listening to the sample tracks. So far, it's pretty good. I prolly won't buy it because while it's good, it's not that good. Raven has a beautiful voice and is a great actress.   Actually, now having listened to 10 of the tracks, I think I may go get it. I'll have to see if my campus bookstore still has it. I need to go there anyway to see if they have Lisa Marie Presley's new album. By the way, I'm 19 guys, so those of you saying that only little kids will like this album, THINK AGAIN. I'm on the last song now, and I'm gonna go now. I may come back and edit this review and give a full review of the CD.
