 This is such a good show. I am so glad I bought this. I remember watching this on A&E a couple years back and prolly when it was actually on NBC.   I read SO MANY reviews about the "poor video quality" and I was a bit worried, but I've watched it on my laptop and my regular TV and the video and audio quality is great. I don't know what other people are talking about; I think there must be something wrong with your discs (they could be dirty) or maybe your DVD player. But it's not happening with every DVD set.   Anyway, the commentaries are hilarious (I'm watching an episode with it right now) and the episodes are even funnier. The extras are great and this is just one DVD set everyone should get. It's that good.
