 I love this whole CD. I got the DualDisc version and the extras are great. In the interview she did, she said that every song is different and I like that every song has a different feel. Each song was captured in a moment, in a feeling. I find this refreshing. I mean, with every song being the same kind of beat or same kind of instruments, makes things kinda dull. With every song in corporating a different genre of music, it spices things up a bit.   I can't wait for Oral Fixation vol 2 in November! I'm gonna get that too.
