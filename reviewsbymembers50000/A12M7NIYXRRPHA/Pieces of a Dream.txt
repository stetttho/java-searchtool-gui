 I just got this today from UK Amazon (cheaper than on here) and I was stunned that it came in a "book"-like package. The package is amazing and beautiful with the lyrics inside on the pages. The CDs are in sleeves in the front and back of the package.  But what really counts is the tracks and amazing remixes on the remix CD. By the way, the description on here is wrong for the special edition. There is no DVD included in the packaging: just Disc 1 (with all her hits and 4 new songs and a megamix) and the remix disc. There will be a DVD being released of her Live at Last tour in March, so look for that.   All of her singles are here (except for Boom and Love is a Crime, though they are on the remix disc) as well as 4 new songs. The title track and new single, Pieces of a Dream, which is amazing and a pure Anastacia rock ballad. There's also I Belong to You, with Italian singer Eros, another ballad and In Your Eyes (ballad) as well as her contribution to the Fantastic 4 soundtrack with Ben Moody, Everything Burns. The club megamix is a almost-12 minute dance tour de force, including her biggest hits, totally remixed. It is amazing.  The remix disc is really good too, including some rare remixes of her biggest hits as well as to Love is a Crime and Boom. It's an amazing addition to have to this greatest hits set.  It really sucks that she isn't more known in the US. Most of my friends don't know who she is. I hope that whenever she releases her fourth studio album, she works harder to try and break the US. I really hope she can get successful here in the US.  So buy this awesome greatest hits package! You won't regret it.
