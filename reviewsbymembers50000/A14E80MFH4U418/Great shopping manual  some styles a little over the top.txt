 When I picked up InStyle, there were pictures of movie stars and what they were wearing.  My first thought was, "Who Cares???" I am not a movie star, just a regular woman who wants to look her best, and this is why I bought the Lucky Shopping Manaul.  I loved the presentation, the book does not use fashion models, and the focus is kept on the clothes providing you with a great idea of the styles.  Also, the authors give relevant suggestions of outfits that look good on all body types and by specific body type.  My only issue with the book is that a small numbr of the styles were a little outrageous for me (I'm a bit conservative), but overall the book is great and a must have!!!
