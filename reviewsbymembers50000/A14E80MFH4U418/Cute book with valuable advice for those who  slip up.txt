 I loved this book.  Yes, it may contain things that most would consider common sense.  However, judging by the way many women act and dress today, this book is a gentle reminder of what being a "woman" is all about.  It makes feminintiy fun again!! I liked the advice on planning your wardrobe and the example they gave of a rich woman with plenty of expensive clothes but she didn't know how to "wear" them vs. the less than rich woman with inexpensive but well tailored clothes, who looked great. It's all about planning your purchases to expand your wardrobe and making the most of it, not how many clothes you have or how much they cost.  There are other cute little tidbits that make you think twice about your behaviour: such as...do you talk to loud? The art of "small talk/chit chat", what to tell and what not to tell. The importance of consideration, loyalty, sweetness and sympathy. I'd strongly suggest adding this book to your etiquette book collection.
