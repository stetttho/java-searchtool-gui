 As part of a bookclub, I forgot to inform them that I did not want this selection, so they sent it. That was three years ago and I never really looked at the book until this past thanksgiving.  Since them I've used it frequently and it's amazing!! I first tried the after thanksgiving turkey soup, it was great, I then tried scalloped potatoes (which I'd usually failed at before), and they were good, then I tried the simple pasta with peas, and again very good.  As I've looked through the other recipes, there are so many I've marked to be tested.  I'm glad I got this book by mistake....and hate that it took so long for me to give it a try.  I highly recommend this book!!
