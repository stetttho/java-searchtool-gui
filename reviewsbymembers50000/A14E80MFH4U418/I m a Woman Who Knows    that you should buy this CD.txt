 "Tell Me All About It" and "Better Than Anything",  are the reasons I got this CD.  They are cute and catchy, but there is alot more to Natalie Cole than "cute and catchy".  The songs really speak to me, I love "The Music That Makes Me Dance", and "I Haven't Got Anything Better To Do", they are true love songs.  "Ask A Woman Who Knows" and "I Told You So", talk of heartbreak that most can relate to.  The entire CD is top notch, enjoyable, relaxing and soothing.
