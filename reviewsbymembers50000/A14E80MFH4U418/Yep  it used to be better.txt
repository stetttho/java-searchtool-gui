 Bon Appetit is still one of my favorite cooking magazines.  The covers are works of art. However, there are some areas that can stand some improvement: get rid of the excess non-food ads, show families of all races (regularly, not just once a year), a better variety of recipes, I'm not sure if Rozanne Gold still writes a column, but I simply do not care for her recipes. But I absolutely love: the celebrity interview page at the end, Dorie Greenspan is fabulous and makes you want to go out and buy convection ovens, mixers and the whole nine, I love the "Too Busy To Cook" section where everyday readers share their recipes.    I also miss William Garry, his writing had me in stitches. Despite the cons, I think this magazine is a must have for every foodie.
