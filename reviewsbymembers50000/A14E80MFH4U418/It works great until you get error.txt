 I used this software for 3 years. It worked great!!  I used the daily task planner to help me do my job and keep me on track. I had things scheduled out as far as 2003. Well on Monday,I signed in and got an ugly error message, 3343. The FC website told me to email the database in for repair (I guess this is a common problem). I did and when the database was returned all of my entries were lost!!!! Gone!! Needless to say, I feel completely lost at work, wondering about all the tasks I'm not doing. I'm also afraid to begin using it again. It's like a relationship, I feel as though I can't trust it anymore....but on the otherhand 3 solid years of performance is a lot to disregard. If you decide to buy this software, I suggest synching it regularly with your palm, which is something I chose not to do, as I use my palm for personal use only. Maybe I should rethink that decision.
