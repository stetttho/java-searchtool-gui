 I was hesitant to read this book, since I'd heard that it taught people how to be phony. I'm overjoyed that I didn't listen to the naysayers. This is an excellent book to use in your personal and professional life. More than how to win friends, it teaches you how NOT to lose them.    Some of my favorites were:  The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. Call attention to peoples mistakes indirectly. Become genuinely interested in other people.   I especially liked the examples of parents in the book who used the techniques to stear their children in the right direction.  Not yell, not spank, but stear.    Great book!
