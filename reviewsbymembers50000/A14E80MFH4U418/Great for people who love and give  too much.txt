 I wouldn't follow the rules to the letter, but when you feel yourself giving more to a relationship then you're getting, this is a good reference that forces you to slow down.  Step away from the relationship, spend some time taking care of yourself instead of being so wrapped up in him.  Allow him time to realize the gem you are, if you're calling 2 or 3 times a day just to "say hi" and you become clingy, even mildly so, it can be a big turnoff.  I recommend this book, just don't take it too seriously, there is no way I can stick to the 10 minute phone call rule when we're having a great conversation, and I see no need to do so.  On the other hand, I agree about not calling guys, I can't tell you how many times I've called, they were busy, and my feelings were hurt.  It does feel much better when they call me, and yes I do return their phone calls, I think it's just plain rude not to.  Like any advice, apply the parts that fit with your personality and your life and leave the rest behind.
