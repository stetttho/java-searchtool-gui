 Great etiquette book! After reading it, I thought about buying copies for friends and family, but wait, that would suggest that I consider them uncivil, which according to Forni is not polite.  The saddest thing about this book is that the people who need it the most will never read it, and won't learn civility rules such as:  Think twice before asking for a favor, Keep it down and rediscover silence, Respect others peoples time and space.    I have to agree with another poster, this book should be required textbook reading for girls and boys beginning in the seventh grade, or even in Sunday school.  Manners are so important, and since we all come from many different cultures, this is great guidebook to build relationships on.   For anyone looking to be more cultured, civil and have proper etiquette, I recommend this book be on their list.
