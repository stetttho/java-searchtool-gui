 In general, assortments are hit or miss.  In this box, I liked about 6 of the candies, the rest were okay. My favorite was the white chocolate with lemon (I think, the tin nor their website tell you exactly what flavors are inside).  However, for my money, I still prefer Godiva, their flavors are complex and not as sweet.
