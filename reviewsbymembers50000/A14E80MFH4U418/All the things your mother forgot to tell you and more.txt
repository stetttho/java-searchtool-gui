 This was a fun, quick read.  Although the author does not delve too deeply in each subject, she does give some very important reminders that we owe it to ourselves to live a beautylicious life.  Taking the time to pamper ourselves and re-adjust our negative thinking, gives our lives a great boost and makes us better to be around. I found the earmarks of a lady very interesting, such as she waits her turn, never pushes ahead, is not loud and boisterous, speaks clearly and correctly.  And yes, this is common sense, but how many of us get impatient, mumble and don't look people in the eye when we speak?  Raines talks about stars having an entourage of people to help them look good, but she makes a point that we do too; our hairdresser, manicurist, dentist, the lady we always talk to at the makeup counter, etc, this is our beauty team and we should recognize that and make full use of them.  She gives great tips on taking adventures while we're out alone, how to flirt, how to mix a great drink, a little advice on everything. Buy this book!!!
