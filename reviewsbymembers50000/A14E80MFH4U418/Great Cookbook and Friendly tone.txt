 I subscribe to CI and have one of their books as well. Yes, the recipes are the same in many cases, but what makes Anderson's book a bit better is the friendly tone. The chicken stock was wonderful and who would have known that a simple hamburger could taste so good? I also love the stir fry section with the many selections of sauces and have tried the oyster sauce and was very impressed with the results. Tonight I am trying the butterflied chicken with lemon, rosemary and garlic, and am quiet sure it will be delish as well.  I wish she had a show on FoodTV!!
