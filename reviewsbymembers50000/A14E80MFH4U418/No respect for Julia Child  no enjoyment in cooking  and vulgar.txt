 Julia Child is referred to as the "B" word a couple of times, very disrespectful.  The author nevers seems to enjoy the process of cooking, instead resorting to the "F" word whenever things fail, and just in general. Her kitchen was so dirty and disgusting, she got a maggot and fly infestation, you can't cook that much and let your dirty dishes sit for days on end. What was she thinking?  Also way to much emphasis on the cooking of brains and kidneys, things that many would never cook.   It's sad that the author has used Julia Childs name to gain fame and fortune. She never admired her, and it's never made clear on why she decided to cook all of her recipes.  She definitely has not learned a thing. She was a wreck when she wrote the book and she's a wreck now. I'm glad she doesn't work for the government anymore, since dealing with all the "crazy" 911 victims and families was not a good use of her time, how sad.    I hate I wasted good money on this book, if you love to cook and hold Julia Child in high regard, don't bother reading, if you must read it, borrow it from the library.  If you're depressed, vulgar and bored, it may be just the ticket.
