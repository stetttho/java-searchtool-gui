 This morning I tried making the buttermilk pancakes, I knew I was in trouble when it told me to add the melted butter to the dry ingredients, and I was right, the pancakes were horrible. I threw them out.  I have two of the Jamisons books,  I buy them because they get good reviews, but I'm 2 for 2 and they were both bad.  I'll try to make a couple more recipes from the book and review again.
