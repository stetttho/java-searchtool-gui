 Anne George has a wonderful comical writing talent.  Her saying that some people "just don't have walking around sense", makes me laugh out loud.  She has also written a more serious book called This One and Magic Life which I read first, and really enjoyed. But then when I began reading her Southern Sisters series and I just couldn't put the books down.  On more than one occasion my sister has burst into my room asking me what in the world I was laughing at, I'd read her a passage and she would leave the room laughing too.
