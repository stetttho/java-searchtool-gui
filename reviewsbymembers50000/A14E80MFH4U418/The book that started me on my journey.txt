 When I was 24 I had no idea what I wanted, I was in a rut and had friends who were okay with having no goals and no future. I wanted more, one of my favorite sayings was that you have to let go of the naysayers, and those who do not support your dreams, and surround yourself with positive people.  I gave this book to a male relative when he was "lost" and he is doing very well now.  I'm buying this book again just to have on hand.   Thanks to Les, I know that I can have anything I want if I believe and work hard enough. Some people may have been raised in a nurturing environment and told this daily, but for the rest of us, this book is a lifesaver.  I've achieved many goals since reading this book and have no doubt that I'll achieve many more.
