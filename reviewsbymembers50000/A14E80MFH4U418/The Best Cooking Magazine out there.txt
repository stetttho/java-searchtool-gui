 Some people don't care why the food came out great or why it came out horrible.  I do, and that's why I love this magazine.  I enjoy reading what the author/cook went through to arrive at the printed recipe. I also enjoy the colorful covers and the back page with beautiful drawings of a "topic" food, such as a variety of tomotoes, hams, etc.  Great magazine.  However, I'm not crazy about their website.
