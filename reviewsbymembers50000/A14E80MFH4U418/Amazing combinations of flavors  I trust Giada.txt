 As anyone who visits her tv show website can see, most of her recipes get 5 star ratings.  This book is no different. So far I've made the following:  -White Bean and Tuna Salad-Excellent, I will always have good italian tuna and cannellini beans in my pantry for quick meals. -Marinara Sauce-Excellent, who knew such simple ingredients could make such a good sauce? -Turkey Meatballs-Very good, I'm not a big fan of ground turkey but these meatballs taste as good as ones made from beef. -Farfalle with Turkey Sausage, Peas and Mushrooms- Excellent, I can't tell you how big a difference using sea salt makes in a dish!! -Chicken Saltimbocca-Excellent, my moth began to water as I was making the dish in it's rare state.  This was beautiful and delicious, amazing taste. -Veal Marsala-Very good, I'd never made veal before in my life, but as with most things Giada, just has a way of making things easy and good.  There are so many other recipes in this book that I can't wait to try.  I've also downloaded many of her other recipes and they are fantastic as well. The combination of flavors she uses are very new to me, but they always turn out great.  She also has a lot of neat simple tricks that make a difference in the turnout of the dish. I have alot of other complicated Italian cookbooks, and the recipes don't even sound tempting.  Buy this book, you won't regret it.  I can't wait until her next one comes out.
