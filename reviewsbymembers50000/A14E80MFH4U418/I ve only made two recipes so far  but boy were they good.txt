 So far I've made Nachos Supreme and Kung Pao Shrimp, and both were surprisingly good.  I always felt that low fat, meant low flavor, but not with this book. I've earmarked many other recipes to try like Roasted Chicken with Coconut Lime Glaze, Shrimp Pad Thai, Corn and Jalapeno Quesadillas, and many more.  I'm a foodie and can tell just by the list of ingredients in the recipes that these are going to be good.
