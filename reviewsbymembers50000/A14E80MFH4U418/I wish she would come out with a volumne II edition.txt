 I refer to her book twice a year when I'm about to do my seasonal shopping.  She gives great advice on how to look great, how to shop, applying makeup, you name it. Anything that has to do with looking good.  Although 90% of what she said is still relevant, I wish she would come out with a new book with more up to date pictures of clothing and maybe some new "tricks" on looking stylish. I highly recommend this book.
