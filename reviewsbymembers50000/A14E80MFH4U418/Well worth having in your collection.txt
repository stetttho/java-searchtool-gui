 I checked this book out at the library and last night made the Banana Cake with Caramel Frosting.  It would have been better if I'd found the banana liqueur, but it wasn't at my local grocer. Last night the cake was simply 'okay', (although the frosting was great) but today the cake was pretty darn good.  My sister loved it, and made me take a picture of it because she thought it was so pretty. (She doesn't get out much).  As with most cookbooks, you'll probably will only use a third of the recipes, but after reading this book, I'm sure you'll make good use of that third.  I'll be purchasing this book soon.
