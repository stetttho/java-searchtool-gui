 The 2nd or 3rd time I used this pan, I burned it so badly, I thought for sure it was "trash".  Not this pan, it works great, still hasn't peeled, and is absolutely fantastic for making macaroni and cheese, the cheese sauce rinses out great.  I also use it to "Quick Cook" veggies like Broccoli, Cauliflower etc. Where I add a little bit of water and blast it at high heat for about 4 minutes.  I find myself reaching for this pan time and time again.
