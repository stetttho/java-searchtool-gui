 I have mostly praise for Pirates. Johnny Depp absolutely carries the movie with his exceptionally brilliant, somewhat comedic, performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. He was everything you could imagine a pirate to be - a sly thief with a swagger in his step and nothing but a desire to sail his beloved ship on the high seas. Orlando Bloom gave an excellent performance as heroic blacksmith Will Turner and Kiera Knightly played Turner's captured love interest Elizabeth Swann. Also, great performances by Geoffrey Rush as Jack Sparrow's undead enemy Captain Barbossa and Jack Davenport as Commodore Norrington. Another great attribute of this film was it's soundtrack. Klaus Badlet hit the nail on the head..perfect Pirate music! I only had two problems with the film. First, there were questions pertaining to the plot that should've been answered such as, why a Turner's blood was needed to break the curse. (It is possible that that question was answered but I missed it.) Also, the fight scenes between the British and the skeleton-pirates were a bit drawn out and could've been shorter. However, overall, this movie was one of the best times I've had at the movies in a long time!
