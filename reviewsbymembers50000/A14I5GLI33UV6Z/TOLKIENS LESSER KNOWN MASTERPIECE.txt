 Tolkien considered this book to be his most important work, and died before it could be completed. His son edited it after his death. Neverless, his wit and imagination is expressed within every page of this great book.  The best way to describe this book is as a sort of bible but without all the preachy lessons. The book deals with the creation of the world as well as the creation of elves, dwarves, and men.  The title refers to 3 ancient jewels called silmarils that were made by the elves in the beginning of time, which have the light of two ancient trees that are eventually eradicated and their light extinguised forever. The jewels are eventually stolen by Morgoth, who serves as the root of all evil, prompting a battle of epic proportions between good and evil that spans many thousands of years and involves many people and races, including some characters that appear in the Lord of the Rings.  There is also another book included called the Akallabeth which tells the story of Saurons creation of the rings of power including the one ring, his eventual rise to power, the war of the ring, and his eventual downfall. Also included is a brief synopsis of Frodo and his journey to eradicate the One Ring to end the 3rd Age of this world.  Overall this is a worthy selection to anyone's book collection. But LOTR fans beware for this book is very different from LOTR with its narrative style as well as its subject matter. But if you do enjoy it, once you finish it you will get the urge to read it again and again, as well as read other books by Tolkien. Also be sure to check out the companion to this book in Unfinished Tales. In it you will find alternate versins of some of the stories as well as another, longer version of the adventures of Turin.
