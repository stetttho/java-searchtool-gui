 I am a huge fan of Star Wars, and have seen each of them dozens of times in both the original and special editions. The one thing I do not understand is why these new editions have recieved so much reverence from the fans. Yes there have been a few minor new changes, but overall, the magic is still there.    I compare this controversy to another recent outcry regarding a certain film called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I remember reading an article where a middle aged woman boycotted the movie stating that her childhood was now ruined and she will never get it back. I consider this a baseless complaint seeing that the new version was so much different from the old version and that the two should remain seperate.  Such isn't the fate of Star Wars, which still retains all of the elements that made it a classic today, the only difference is that its a little more polished and fleshed out. I am not saying that the changes were necessary, I miss the old films too, but to say that the new dvd edition takes away from the overall experience is in my opinion, bantha fodder.
