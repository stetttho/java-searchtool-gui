 Mad scientist Jack Griffin (Claude Rains) has discovered how to make himself invisible. Problem is, a drug included in the formula has also driven him mad, and soon he is terrorizing the English countryside. One of the all-time great Universal chillers, huh? Well, I am reasonably impressed, even if I didn't find it particularly SCARY. It's fast-paced, well-acted (especially by Rains) and features special effects that are actually very good considering this film was made approximately seventy years ago. Best thing about these Universal monster movies is they're not long. They're over before you know it, and this movie is no different. Some people may even wish they were longer. Acting honors definitely go to Claude Rains (this was his film debut). Jack Griffin certainly qualifies as one of the more memorable madmen I've "seen" in motion pictures. By the way, for those of you who don't know, a much younger Gloria Stuart, who was so good as the old version of Rose in Titanic, is the leading lady here.
