 The Hobbit: Or There and Back Again is the precursor to the Lord of the Rings. It tells the tale of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who never had any adventures or excitement, who goes on a journey of self discovery and learns that the smallest person can change the future.  Follow Bilbo as he encounters and overcomes trolls, wolves, giant spiders, and imprisonment, and even a dragon, and learn how he acquires the One ring.  I highly reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys reading fantasy and adventure novels. Actually, this book should be in every readers collection no matter what they read whether its poetry or politics.
