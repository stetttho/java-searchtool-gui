 The Muppet Show was before my time, but having grown up to the animated tv show Muppet Babies as well as the Muppet movies, I decided to take a risk and find out where it all began. I wasn't dissappointed. This star studded first season is packed with well known guest stars such as Rita Moreno, Harvey Korman, and Vincent Price, not to mention Broadway legend Rita Moreno. Of course who could forget the real stars of the show, Kermit, Miss Piggie, Gonzo, Fonzie, and the others, in their early incarnations.  This set is great but some of the sketches like the ballroom dancing sketch and the hospital sketch, are done too frequently and one wishes that there were more, but rest assured, in the last half dozen episodes, they really hit their stride, from Vincent Price's memorable guest appearence (a ghoul who turns into an orchestra conductor at midnight on New years Day!!!) to Ethel Merman and her arguments with Miss Piggy, the last half is can't miss.   Another plus in this DVD is the special features. You get one of the original pilots, Muppets Sex and Violence hosted by a Janitor, as well as the demo reel that Jim Henson presented to the television executives that propelled the muppets to prime time and a place in our history and hearts. I recommnd this show for ages 1 to 111.
