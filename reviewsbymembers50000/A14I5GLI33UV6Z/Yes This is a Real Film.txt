 "The West's deadliest Gunslinger against the World's most diabolical Killer = One Terrible Movie!!!!  John Carradine plays a sickly, frail looking and dentured Count Dracula is just TOO old and his intended "bride" the bland, wide-eyed teen Betty Bentley (lamely portrayed by the untalented Melinda Plowman) is just TOO young for the aged, supernatural Grandpappy (a true odd couple!). This Dracula is able to freely go about during the daylight hours, he drinks whiskey (Olde Red Eye?), his deportment and delivery of dialogue completely lacks any genuine continental bearing or aristocratic flair and Carradine's campy, creaky performance of the Count is much more akin to a cheating, unscrupulous gambler from Baltimore circa the mid-1800s rather than a dignified nobleman from Transylvania.  Bullets don't affect the Vampire yet when Billy the Kid hurls his empty six-shooter at old Drac's noggin he actually knocks him out and how about that absurdly dumb visibly string-operated rubber bat poorly utilized in those scenes where this hilariously bobbing and wobbly contraption flutters out-of-sight behind a conveniently stationed bush followed by an obvious "break" in the filming after which Dracula immediately pops out from the same obstruction thereby attempting to imply that the bat has somewhat discreetly transformed itself into Dracula .  Lastly dig those numerous, unsubtle red lighting effects projected onto Count Dracula's leering (and bleary-eyed) visage. Just awful!  On the plus side, who can possibly forget such priceless tidbits of dialogue as when Dracula contemptuously refers to Billy the Kid's friend and ally the stalwart, pistol-packing Dr. Henrietta Hull (Olive Carey) as a "backwoods female pill slinger?"   In short, with the exception of some of the dialogue, this movie is not worth your time.
