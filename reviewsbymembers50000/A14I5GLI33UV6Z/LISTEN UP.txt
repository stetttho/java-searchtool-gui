 If you like your zombie movies frsh with a pot of gore, hilarious one liners, and gratuitous nudity, look no further than Return of the Living Dead.  This movie stars B movie legend Clu Galager as a factory manager who unwittingly releases the same gas that was accidently spilt used in the movie Night of the Living Dead and the mayhem within it, complete with an awesome punk soundtrack.  I don't ever remember a time when I laughed so hard at a zombie movie, and I am sure many others agree with me. After all this movie did spawn 3 sequels. The bottom line is, if you are a fan of zobies, gore, and slapstick, this is the movie for you.
