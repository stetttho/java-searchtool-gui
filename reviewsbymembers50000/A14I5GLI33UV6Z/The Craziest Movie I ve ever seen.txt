 MEET THE FEEBLES IS THE SICKEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN, BRILLIANT FROM START TO FINISH. I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS THE MUPPETS MEET TRAINSPOTTING AND SCARFACE!!!  BUT, I WOULD LIKE TO WARN YOU THAT THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE AND THAT THE DVD WAS [bad]. THE MOVIE WAS DISTORTED AS WELL AS THE SOUND. WHOEVER DEAD ALIVE PRODUCTIONS ALSO DID A REALLY BAD JOB AT THE TRANSFER. BUT IF YOU DO BUY THIS MOVIE, I FORWARN YOU ITS NOT OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY.
