 I was very impressed with this book, not only does Bill Froug clearly present the pitfalls and "tricks" associated with writing a screenplay, he also leads each writer to discover their own approach to screenwriting, which I must say is a very valuable concept.  Unlike other screenwriting books, many of which are outdated or overdone, Froug simply guides the screenwriter on an insightful journey from the first urge to write through the completion and eventual selling of your script.  I highly reccomend this book for all who aspire to either become a film maker, write screenplays, or even writing in general. You will not be dissappointed.
