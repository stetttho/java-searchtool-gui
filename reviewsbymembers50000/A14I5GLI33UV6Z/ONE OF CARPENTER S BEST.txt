 John Carpenter's 1987 film, "Prince of Darkness," is a dark, tense, and disturbing journey into philosophy, religion, and man's basic, instinctive fear of the dark. The film begins with the death of a priest who represents the last member of an ancient, ultra-secret Catholic order that was created to guard the ultimate threat to mankind. With the death of this priest, another priest by the name of Father Loomis (Donald Pleasance), uncovers the first priest's diary and begins to investigate this secret order of priests called "the Brotherhood of Sleep." In the process, he visits the old priest's church and, deep in the basement, discovers the mysterious secret that the Brotherhood was protecting (or rather, protecting the world from). Overwhelmed by this discovery, Loomis seeks out a physics professor by the name of Birack (portrayed by the late Victor Wong). Birack is also more than a little intrigued because he, in turn, summons his students for an "extra-credit" project over the weekend at the church. Now I will not reveal what happens next but i assure you that you're in for a hell of a ride! This is one of John Carpenters best after The Thing and Halloween. It boasts a provacative storyline , creepy atmosphere and also a very good score.  Also, be sure to turn up the volume during the "real time" video sequences. What you hear will freak you out!!
