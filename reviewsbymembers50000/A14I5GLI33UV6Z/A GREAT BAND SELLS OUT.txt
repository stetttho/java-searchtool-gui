 I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD LIVE TO SEE THE DAY WHEN METALLICA WOULD SELL OUT TO MTV. BUT THAT DAY DID COME WHEN I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT THIS CD. THE FIRST TRACK AND ST. ANGER WERE ALRIGHT, BUT THE REST SUCKED. I REMEMBER A DAY WHEN METALLICA RELEASED THE BLACK ALBUM AND S&M, WHICH I THINK IS THEIR BEST CD. THEY WERE MUCH BETTER THAN THIS GARBAGE. I AM NO LONGER GONNA BUY ANOTHER METALLICA CD AFTER SEEING THIS GARBAGE. I WANT MY MONEY BACK.  DO NOT BUY THIS CD IF YOU ARE A TRUE METALLICA FAN OR A METALHEAD.
