 I DO NOT WANT TO RANT AND RAVE ABOUT ALL THE FINE POINTS OF THE MOVIE, BUT TELL YOU THAT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE GORIEST FILMS THAT I'VE EVER SEEN. THE FILM WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED WHEN I FIRST PUT IT ON, I EXPECTED IT NOT TO LOOK LIKE IT WAS FILMED IN SOMEBODY'S BACKYARD, AS IT WAS MOSTLY THE CASE IN BAD TASTE. I ALSO EXPECTED TO SEE THE ALIENDS COOKING THE HUMANS AND SERVING THEM IN A RESTAURANT ON EARTH. BASICALLY I AMAGINED A WHOLE DIFFERENT MOVIE THAN THAT. BUT IT WAS STILL GREAT, THE SPECIAL FX, THE CAMPY DIALOGUE, AND EVEN SOME OF THE CAMERAWORK WAS GOOD. THIS MOVIE INSPIRED ME, AND MOVIED ME, NOT TO MENTION MAKE ME SPEW. I RECCOMEND THIS MOVIE TO ALL FANS OF SPLATTERSTICK WITH A WARNING, THIS MOVIE IS VERRRY GORY. BUYER BEWARE. DON'T EAT BEFORE THE MOVIE.
