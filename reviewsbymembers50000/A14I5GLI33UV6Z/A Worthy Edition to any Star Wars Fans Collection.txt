 Revenge of the Sith is the adaptation to the best of the "new" star wars trilogy. From the opening battle sequence to the introduction of Vader, this book is a can't miss for all star wars fans.  Revenge of the Sith begins with Anakin and ObiWan on a rescue mission for emperor Palptine. From there the seeds of Anakins descent to the dark side are planted.  It doesn't help that Anakin is haunted by visions of Padme's death, and he swears to do whatever he can to prevent that, because "he" is the most powerful and able out of anyone else to help her.  This book provided a fascinating look at how one's pride and power can become the root of all evil. You learn that not all evil stems from hate, but it can also stem from wanting the power to do good. I reccomend this book for all who of course like star wars or even anyone looking for a good read.
