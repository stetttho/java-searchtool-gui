 THIS IS BASICALLLY A GREATEST HITS CD THAT COVERS ALL OF BLINK'S ALBUMS UP TO ENEMA OF STATE, AND YOU'D BE SURPRISED AT HOW GOOD THEY SOUND LIVE!!!!  PERSONALLY I'VE NEVER BEEN A REALLY BIG FAN OF LIVE CONCERTS, BUT WAS SURPRISED AT HOW MUCH BETTER SOME OF THEIR SONGS SOUNDED COMPARED WITH THEIR OLDER RELEASES. SONGS LIKE PEGGY SUE, CAROUSEL, AND EVEN DAMMIT ARE EVEN BETTER LIVE THAN THEIR STUDIO COUNTERPARTS!!!!  ALL IN ALL BUY THIS CD NOW AND YOU WILL BE TREATED TO ONE OF THE BEST LIVE ALBUMS MONEY CAN BUY.
