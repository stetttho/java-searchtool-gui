 As an Aspiring writer/filmmaker I found this an excellent read after reading the Silmarillion. This is basically a book with a few alternate versions of stories that appeared in the Silmarillion, as well as background notes etc. Not to mention its also a very entertaining book too!!  The only advice I would give you prospective buyers is to buy the Silmarillion first, as well as the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.
