 Make Love the Bruce Campbell way while an entertaining book, fails to hook the reader into his fictional account of the making of an A picture called Lets Make Love directed by Mike Nichols and starring Richard Gere, Renee Zelleweger, and of course the author himself.   The first 20 pages of this book are all right, but after that it all goes downhill. Campbell is tapped to play a supporting as a doorman named Foyle, an all knowing relationship guru. As he travels across the country to research his character he runs into trouble in the form of Colin Powell and becomes a "Person of Interest" with the US govt and also "infects" the set of his movie with his B movie persona.   The main plot of this book never appears coherent, I'm not sure if this is intentional, after all it is a satire of the Hollywood system. Even so the plot plods along to a weak conclusion. I reccomend this for anyone who wants a quick entertaining read. Flawed yes, but entertaining.
