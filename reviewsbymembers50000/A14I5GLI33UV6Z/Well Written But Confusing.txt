 I picked this book is without a doubt one of the most challenging reads I've ever had. It is a perceptive and comprehensive study on Kubrick and all of his movies. Nelson practically dissects and analyzes all of Kubricks films shot by shot, which results in a joyfully convorted mess of a maze, much like Kubricks films themselves.  While not for the average fan, this book is reccomended for die hard fans of Kubrick along with students of film or psychology.
