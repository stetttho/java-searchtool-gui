 If you are a fan of Pulp Fiction or want to be a screenwriter, this is one of the best screenplay novelizations you can buy. Well written and described, Tarantino definitely ranks as one of the best writers of modern cinema. Not only does this book help you learn basic screenwriting structure, but its also very entertaining too. Highly reccomended.
