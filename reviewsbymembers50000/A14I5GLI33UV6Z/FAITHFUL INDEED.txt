 THIS GAME IS A VERY FAITHFUL REDITION OF THE TELEVISION SHOW. I DO NOT WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME SO I WILL PROVIDE MY SUMMATION IN AS FEW WORDS AS I MAY. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE. THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WAS THAT IT STARTS TO GET A LITTLE BORING AFTER A SHORT WHILE, HENCE THE 3 STAR FUN RATING. BUT I WOULDN'T SAY NO TO PLAYING THE GAME. THIS GAME IS FUN TO MILLIONAIRE FANS AND IT SHOULD BE BECAUSE IT IS A FAITHFUL REDITION. EVEN THOUGH THE SHOW IS NO LONGER ON THE AIR, THIS GAME IS STILL PLAYED REGUARLY AT MY HOUSE AND DINNER PARTIES. BUY THIS GAME!!!
