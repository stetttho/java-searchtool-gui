 This book is an indispensible guide for anyone who is aspiring to get into showbiz in any way shape or form. Bruce Campbell has done it all, from acting in Super 8 movies, including the well known cult fave Evil Dead and its sequels; to producing and directing, as well as acting in the syndicated t.v. shows Hercules and Xena, one must wonder why this guy is still the biggest working stiff in Hollywood.   If you are a fan of Bruce Campbell, an aspiring film maker, or just looking for an interesting read, this is the book for you. I can't even explain this any better. This is probably one of the most entertaining books I've ever read in my life.
