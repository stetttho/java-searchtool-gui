 I am a big baseball fan, so I forced myself to sit through the whole thing. This movie was very slow and it completely lost my attention. The combination of a strong cast and great original material (taken from the play) should have equaled a fun movie, I normally like movies like this, where the action takes place in one setting, this being a minor league ballpark.  Unfortunately I paid the price of my enthusiasm, this movie plodded along at a snail like pace, wasn't funny, and the plot was too unbelievable. The protagonists in the movie fight, bicker with their wives, and even fall in love, all within 2 hours of a baseball game. I recommend the play instead.
