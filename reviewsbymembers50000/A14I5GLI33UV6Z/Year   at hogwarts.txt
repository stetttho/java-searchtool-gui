 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, is the second book in the Harry Potter book series, and it surpasses Sorcerers Stone in almost every way.   Year Two starts with a bang, literally, thanks to an eccentric house elf named Dobby who warns Harry Potter that he is in great danger. In danger he goes as in his second year he has to deal with womping willows, cornish pixies, giant spiders, a new stuck up professor, the unwanted attention of his best friend Ron's sister, and moaning myrtle a strange ghost who resides in the girls bathroom. Not to mention the fact that someone in hogwarts is trying to kill all the students in the school. And everyone thinks its Harry  This book is an improvement on the first, but not by much, It was much creepier than the first and it had much more emphasis on plot that the first one. Overall it was a very enjoyable read.
