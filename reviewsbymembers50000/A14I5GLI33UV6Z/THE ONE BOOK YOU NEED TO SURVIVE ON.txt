 IF I WERE STRANDED ON A DESERT ISLAND AND COULD ONLY TAKE ONE BOOK WITH ME, IT WOULD BE A NO BRAINER: J.R.R. TOLKIEN'S LORD OF THE RINGS.  WHY YOU ASK? WELL, FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF, BUT BELIEVE ME, YOU WON'T BE WASTING YOUR VALUABLE TIME OR MONEY ONCE YOU GET THROUGH THE 1000 PLUS PAGES FILLED WITH FURIOUS ACTION AND SUSPENSE, NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT THE CHARACTERS SEEM TO GROW ON YOU AND YOU BEGIN TO THINK OF THEM AS AN EXTENDED FAMILY.   THE ADVENTURE BEGINS IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, WHEN THE RING GETS ENTRUSTED TO FRODO BY HIS ELDERLY COUSIN BILBO. FRODO MUST LEAVE HIS HOME ON AN EPIC JOURNEY TO DESTROY THE RING FOREVER IN THE CRACKS OF DOOM ACCOMPANIED BY 8 COMPANIONS.  IN THE SECOND BOOK, THE TWO TOWERS, AMID GREAT DANGER AND WITH 2 LOSSES IN THE FELLOWSHIP ALREADY, THE FELLOWSHIP BREAKS UP AND EACH GOES ON THEIR OWN JOURNEY.  LASTLY IN THE CONCLUSION, YOU FIND OUT JUST WHAT HAPPENS WHEN FRODO AND HIS COMPANION FINALLY REACH THE CRACKS OF DOOM, THE FATE OF THE WORLD RESTING ON THEIR SHOULDERS.  I PERSONALLY HOLD THIS BOOK AS THE DEFINITIVE READ OF ALL TIME. YES ITS A VERY TEDIOUS READ BUT THE PAYOFF IS GREAT TOWARDS THE END. I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN FANTASY OR IF THEY HAVE THE GUTS TO TAKE ON A CHALLENGE SUCH AS THIS.
