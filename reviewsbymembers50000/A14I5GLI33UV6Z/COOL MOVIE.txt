 Everything is idyllic in Suburbia when the little family moves in, as the father have got a new job in a computer company there. But no paradise would be complete without its snake. Strange things happens as the family joins the local country club without the husband, as it certainly holds secrets. Suspenseful and well-made chiller with a bitchy Susan Lucci as club chairperson. The movie captures the sense of paranoia and the special effects final is worth waiting for.
