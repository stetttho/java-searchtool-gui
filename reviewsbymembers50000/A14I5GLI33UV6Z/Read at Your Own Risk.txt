 Reading Murakami is a bit like wathing a David Lynch film, its twisting and confusing, but I just can't seem to dislike it. Kafka on the Shore follows 2 storylines, the first follows a boy named Tamura who runs away from home to avoid a oedipal prophecy involving his mother and sister; and an aging disabled man named nakata who has a strange ability, he can speak to cats. Their stories are accomplished through some very strange events including the appearance of Colonel Sanders who happens to be a pimp, a rainstorm of fish, and a forest with ww2 era soldiers who have unaged since the war. There is also a brutal murder with an unidentified body and perpetrator. Yet in the midst of this mess, everything is resolved and explained at the conclusion of the novel. This book is not for the average reader.
