 I saw this movie on Labor Day and I have to say that this was a complete waste of time and money. I normally never fall asleep during a movie, which I did twice in this one. The only reason I even gave this 2 stars is because of the fact that I have a crush on Elizabeth Hurly and I'm a big fan of Bruce Campbell. Otherwise, stay away from this horrendous insult of a movie.
