 While not able to live up to the comic genius of its predecessor, Bill And Ted's Bogus Journey is still a very enjoyable film. The Grim Reaper's scenes, in particular, are quite amusing, and there are some fairly clever jokes. A high-spirited, good-natured laugh, without the preponderance of objectionable material that has come to dominate many more recent comedies.
