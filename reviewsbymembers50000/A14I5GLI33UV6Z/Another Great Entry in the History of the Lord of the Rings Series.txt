 This book, while mostly for die hard fans of the book as well as aspiring writers, does not fail to make me wonder what could have been "the Lord of the Rings". Who knew that Tolkien, one of the greatest writers and linguists of his time, could have strayed so far from what became the masterpiece that exists today.   This book is truly a great example of creative imagination at work, providing an alternate look at The Fellowship of the Ring , and you see alternate versions of Frodo, (Bingo Baggins?) as well as Aragorn (a mysterious hobbit named Trotter) and much more. This book even depicts a few beloved characters as evil, and many of Frodo's companions undergo many transformations of name and personality.   I highly reccomend this book for all fans of Lord of the Rings with keen an interest in how the epic we now know came to be.
