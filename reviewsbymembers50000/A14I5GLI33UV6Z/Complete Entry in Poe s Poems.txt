 I was delighted to find a book with the complete collection of Poe's poems, being a fan of his for years. From Annabel Lee to the Raven, its all there and more. The themes of love death and despair, which recurred frequently in his poems, reflected the events in his own short life from the death of his first wife to the Raven where he turns a strange visitor into a symbol of his own sorrow.  The best feature in this book is that there are alternate versions of some of his poems. Unfortunately there aren't any footnotes to explain any of these things, which would probably dete new fans who want to know more about the master of macabre. Nonethenless this is a good read and worthy of anyone interested in poetry or has an interest in Poe himself.
