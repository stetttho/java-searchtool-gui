 A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T GIVE TIMOTHY DALTON CREDIT FOR HIS ROLE AS JAMES BOND BECAUSE THEY ONLY ATTRIBUTE HIM TO LICENCE TO KILL, BUT THEY ARE DEAD WRONG, BECAUSE THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS IS THE BEST BOND FILM OF THE 80'S. THIS ONE HAS IT ALL, GREAT SCENERY, GREAT CHARACTERS, GREAT BABES, AND GREAT GADGETS. THIS ONE IS SURELY A MUST SEE AND I ASSURE YOU THAT YOU WILL NOT WASTE YOUR VALUABLE TIME OR MONEY. BUY IT!!!
