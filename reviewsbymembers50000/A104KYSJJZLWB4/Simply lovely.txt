 This, the opera that first brought Rossini fame, is a rather dramatically run-of-the-mill affair.  Hero believes heroine unfaithful, fights for her honor anyway, and realizes the entire time that she has been true to him.   But the music is quite wonderful, and sung with brilliance and conviction  by the entire cast.  The Bulgarian mezzo, Kasarova, is marvelous, her dark  tone and rock-solid florid technique ensure that one does not forget she is  playing a man.  Eva Mei floats lovely pianissimos and sings her coloratura  with assurance, while managing to put some character to this  one-dimensional role.  Ramon Vargas proves himself a Rossini tenor par  excellence, and the rest of the cast is strong.  RCA provides both finales  Rossini wrote for the opera, one with a "happy" ending (Tancredi  lives) and one with a tragic ending (Tancredi dies).  There are also two  arias for the hero and heroine in an appendix.  Very full, complete  recording.  A must for Rossini and bel canto enthusiasts.
