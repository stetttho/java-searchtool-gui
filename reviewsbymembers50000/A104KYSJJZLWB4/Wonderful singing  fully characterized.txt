 French soprano Veronique Gens has made something of a specialty of singing 18th century opera, including the works of Mozart.  But don't think that Gens is one in the line of asexual, vibrato-less, "period"  sopranos.  Her voice is warm, creamy, womanly, and full.  Her techincal  accomplishment is excellent, and while her coloratura never dazzles, it is  always propelled by dramatic impetus. In fact, it is Gens' sense of drama  and attention to character, situation, and text, which sets this disc on a  higher level than that of other fine Mozart aria recitals.  Gens inhabits  each character, so that her Vitellia is mature, weary, and resigned, while  her Sesto is noble, impetuous, and highly earnest.  She differentiates  Cherubino from the Countess, Zerlina from Donna Elvira, while sounding  vocally "right" for each.  Listen to Sesto's "Deh, per  queste istante" and then the following "Batti, batti," and  see if you don't for a moment wonder if two different singers recorded the  arias. For those already familiar with the work of Mme. Gens, this  recital is self-recommending.  For those who have yet to discover her  artistry, I urge you to purchase this recording and succumb to the  considerable charms of one of the finest Mozart sopranos singing today.
