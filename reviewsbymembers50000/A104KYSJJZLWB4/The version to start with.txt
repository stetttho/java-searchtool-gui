 Everyone who loves musicals (I feel sorry for people who don't) should have at least one recording of the "King and I" with Yul Brynner.  This is the best one available.  Not only one of the most complete  recordings of the "King and I" (all that's missing is some  underscoring and the "Small House of Uncle Thomas"), it also has  one of the best casts assembled.  Brynner is fine, the lung cancer which  killed him in 1985 very much NOT in evidence in this '77 recording.   Constance Towers is a terrific Anna, and she most certainly CAN act.  Her  "Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?" betters Gertrude  Lawrence.  Hye-Young Choi is my favorite Lady Thiang, floating her descant  in "Western People Funny" better than anyone else.  Martin  Vidnovic and June Angela are an appealing pair of lovers, and the two boys  roles are sung with energy.  A treat for lovers of musicals, Rodgers &  Hammerstein, and "The King and I."
