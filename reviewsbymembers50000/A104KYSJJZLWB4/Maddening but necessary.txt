 Until we get a decent recording of this wonderful score, fans of Rodgers and Hammerstein will have to settle for this stopgap.  Providing only 33 minutes of the show in truncated versions of the songs, this is the only  recording of "Allegro" ever made.  Why did no one think to record  the wonderful concert staging at "Encores!" a few years back?!   If you love Rodgers and Hammerstein, you will want this, but the poor  recorded quality and the brevity of the selections are drawbacks.  5 stars  for the show, but 3 for the recording.
