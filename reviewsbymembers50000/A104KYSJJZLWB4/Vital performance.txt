 Every classical music lover has certain albums or discs that they have a particular fondness for, in spite of what the critical consensus may be.  This recording of Verdi's Requiem is one of mine.  In our current era of  flawless ensemble and bloodless excellence above all, Ormandy leads a  highly charged, individual performance of this masterpiece. The soloists  (despite the dismissal in the Penguin Guide) are all excellent, with  particular honors going to Richard Tucker and Lucine Amara, whose  pianissimo B-flat in the "Libera me" is exquisite.  She is one of  those artists taken for granted during her time, but whose talent and  commitment would be most welcome today. Ormandy has an (undeserved)  reputation of being dependable but dull; however, on this recording he is  anything but run-of-the-mill.  Listen to the frenzy he whips up at the  beginning of the "Dies Irae" (terrific sound, by the way --  listen to that bass drum!) or the beauty with which he shapes the  "Recordare."  This is a conductor who is in the service of the  music, not the other way around.  This is most refreshing, especially since  so many uber-maestros tend to turn this work into a showcase for how  idiosyncratic their style can be. The performance of Rossini's  "Stabat Mater" which accompanies this set is more of a  disappointment.  I prefer the Chung recording on DG or the Hickox on  Chandos.  But no matter.  At super-bargain price, this "Requiem"  should not be passed by!
