 I eagerly awaited the release of this recording because I am a great fan of Angela Gheorghiu and look forward to hearing her recordings.  This one, I am afraid, while good, cannot join the ranks of other classic recordings  (namely, Beecham's, Karajan's, and Pappano's).  The premise for this  recording is interesting, being a return (supposedly) to what Puccini  originally wanted.  Notes in the booklet suggest that Puccini wanted it  faster and less lingering than most conductors took it.  While this  recording is a bit brisker than most, there is nothing earth-shatteringly  different that listeners will notice.       The performance itself is not  a complete success.  I have never been a real fan of Roberto Alagna, but  found his Rodolfo in Pappano's "Boheme" recording to be quite  good.  Here, alas, he mars his line with many choked sobs, typical to  tenors trying to sound "bigger" and more dramatic than they are.   This also marred his performance in Pappano's recording of "Gianni  Schicchi"  He also can no longer provide the piano singing that so  nicely shaded his performance in the previous "Boheme."   Gheorghiu sounds better, using her substantial instrument to ride the  climaxes nicely, and she can also deliver a lovely pianissimo high C at the  end of act I.  However, she sometimes sounds throaty here, although she  inhabits the character well.       The most successful casting is Simon  Keenleyside as Marcello, using a lieder-singer's understanding of the text  and a beautiful baritone to create a winning portrayal.  Elisabetta Scano  sings intelligently, but her voice is small and sometimes shrill.  Her  performance recalls the tradition of the comprimarie singers who often  performed the role in the first half of this decade.  A decent enough  recording, but "Boheme" needs -- and deserves -- more.
