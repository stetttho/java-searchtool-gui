 Ethan Mordden is one of the finest writers working in the area of musical theatre and opera.  His insights are not only spot-on but witty and revealing.  This book is another welcome addition to his works and to the  works written about American musical theatre. It is difficult to conceive  what a fertile time the 1920's was for musicals.  Today we consider  ourselves very lucky to have more than eight new musicals open on Broadway  in a season; back then, it was not uncommon to have more than five times  that many.  Mordden's skill lies in his ability to delineate the feel of  the era, and he is able to dissect, with surgeon-like skill, the strengths  and liabilities of each show he discusses. He not only tackles the  well-known shows of the decade ("Sally," "No, No,  Nanette," "Good News," "Show Boat") but gives  equal attention to the flops as well.  Operetta and musical revues such as  George White's Scandals or Ziegfeld's Follies are also given plenty of  coverage.  In fact, I can't think of a major show from this era that  Mordden does not cover.  It is clear that Mordden loves and respects his  subject.  He knows, too, that many of the shows of this time are thin and  poorly constructed, but he never sidesteps or apologizes for this material.   If you are looking for hard-core facts, this is not the book for you:  Mordden is somewhat skimpy in giving particular dates.  But if you want an  entertaining and comprehensive analysis of a dizzying time in the American  theatre, give this book a try.
