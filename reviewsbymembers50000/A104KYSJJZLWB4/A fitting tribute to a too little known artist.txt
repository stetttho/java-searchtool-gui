 Today the name of Frances Alda is remembered mainly as having collaborated on several Caruso discs, but she was a fine singer in her own right, as this excellent Romophone set proves. Alda was a student of the celebrated  Mathilde Marchesi, who also taught Nellie Melba.  Indeed, at Alda's  audition, Marchesi told her husband, "Salvatore, I have found the new  Melba!"  Alda was in fact good enough to present a threat to the more  established diva, who insisted that Oscar Hammerstein chose between the two  of them:  "Either Alda or Myself!" runs the famous  telegram. Mme. Alda was one of the most colorful operatic personalities  of the early twentieth century.  She was married to Giulio Gatti-Cassazza,  head of the Met at the time, but she did not abuse her influence as a more  capricious diva might have.  She had a dry, caustic wit, as evidenced in  her autobiography, "Men, Women, and Tenors" (a thoroughly  enjoyable read, by the way). These recordings present the voice behind  the legend, and an excellent voice it is, too.  A lyric soprano of  substantial weight, she was careful to remain well inside the lyric fach,  venturing only a single Aida as an experiment.  Her favorite role was Mimi,  and it shows: her two arias from "La Boheme" are magical.  Her  high notes glitter, and the low range is full and round.  The voice is even  throughout the registers, a hallmark of the Marchesi school. The  transfers, as on all Romophone editions, are expertly done, allowing the  voice to come through with added freshness and clarity.  A wonderful set,  one of the best of the series.
