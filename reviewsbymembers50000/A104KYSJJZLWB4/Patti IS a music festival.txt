 The above quote, from Patti herself, pretty much sums things up.  Adelina Patti was, undoubtedly, the most famous singer of the 19th century.  In Mr. Cone's exhaustively researched book (in appendix form are lists of her  roles, recordings, stage and concert appearances), the life of this  extraordinary diva is examined.  She started as a child prodigy, and made  her official operatic debut at the age of sixteen (!) in "Lucia di  Lammermoor."  Patti lived in an age when operatic star power reigned  supreme, and Cone includes tales of her capriciousness to highlight that  fact.  However, Patti was a true artist, able to even melt the hardest of  hearts, including George Bernard Shaw.  This is a marvelous book for anyone  interested in singers and/or famous women of the 19th century.
