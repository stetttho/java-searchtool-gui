 "Wonderful Town" is one of the frothiest, most delightful forays in the musical comedy genre ever created.  This recording will certainly bring the piece to more listeners, which is good, but it isn't the best  recording available.  By far the most successful casting here is Audra  McDonald as Eileen, her sweet, full soprano making the most out of  Bernstein's marvelous music and Comden and Green's terrific lyrics.  Kim  Criswell trades in her usual brassiness for a more throaty and wry  characterization than we are used to from her, but she makes it work well.   She seems to be singing at the extreme low end of her range at times  (especially in the "Ohio" duet) but this is because the role was  originally written for Rosalind Russell, who had an incredibly full lower  range (almost tenor-like).  The rest of the casting works fairly well, but  Rattle's conducting is what keeps this set from earning top honors.  Parts  are way too slow (the spoken section in OHIO) and others way too fast: the  vamp in "Conversation Piece" needs to go at least twice as slow  as Rattle takes it, or the number loses its humor.  For better recordings  of "Wonderful Town," I recommend either of the Ros Russell  versions (the second one is slightly better) or the new, two-disc recording  with Karen Mason and Rebecca Luker, which includes all the music plus  several variants.
