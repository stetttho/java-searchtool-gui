 This was Rodgers and Hammerstein's first foray into pure musical comedy (as distinguished from the musical plays they had been writing), and it was not a success.  The story was slight, and is essentially a retelling of the  "Oklahoma" love triangle.  However, the score is quite enjoyable,  with fun numbers like "That's the Way it Happens," and "It's  Me."  Also, any show that contains "No Other Love," one of  the loveliest ballads R & H ever wrote, cannot be dismissed entirely.   "Me and Juliet" lacks the depth and brilliance of  "Carousel" or "The King and I," but it is quite likable  on its own merits.
