 I have come to expect that any release from Opera Rara recordings will be intruiging at the very least, and truly marvelous at best.  This set is a real example of the latter.  Any lover of bel canto opera cannot do without  this set, and even if you are not a devotee of the bel canto period, I urge  you to hear this recording.  There are many gems here, not least several  selections from Donizetti and Meyerbeer's earliest Italian operas, as well  as items from the unjustly neglected Mayr and Pacini, as well as a lovely  concert aria from Carl Maria von Weber.  Some items look back to the  elegant classical line of Mozart and Haydn, while others preface the rise  of the decorated florid cantilena made popular by Rossini.  There are only  two items which I would label as somewhat banal (one a duet by Manuel  Garcia, famous tenor and father Pauline Viardot and Maria Malibran), but  the rest is enchanting and reminds us what a fertile period this was for  Italian opera.  Everything is beautifully sung by a group of excellent  singers, including Yvonne Kenny, Della Jones, Chris Merritt and Alistair  Miles.  A delightful set, well worth the price.
