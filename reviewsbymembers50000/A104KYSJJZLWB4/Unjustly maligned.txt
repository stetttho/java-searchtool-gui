 When this set was first released a couple of years back, all the reviews  dismissed it as a failure.  I truly cannot understand why.  Certainly, it's  not the greatest "Ballo" ever recorded, but it is a strong,  persuasive performance.  Richard Leech sings with heady beauty of tone and  a real feeling for line -- forget Alagna and Cura, Leech outclasses both of  them.  Vladimir Chernov does here what he does best -- namely, sing with a  vocal richness and beauty which is rare in the modern crop of Verdi  baritones.   Michele Crider has been unjustly criticized: this is the  first recording I have heard of her, and from what I've read I expected to  hear a hooty, gusty, ill-supported soprano.  What I got instead was a rich  voice, brilliant and blazing at the top, full and rich at the bottom, able  to negoatiate the subtle piano passages beautifully.  It also helps that  Ms. Crider sings with a real feeling for the text (listen to "Ecco  l'orrido campo" and the following aria).  The voice might not have the  ultimate degree of rock-solid steadiness that such sopranos as Margaret and  Leontyne Price bring to this music, but that is in keeping with the  vacillating nature of Amelia's character.  I hope to hear more from Ms.  Crider. Elena Zaremba as Ulrica may be the weak link in the cast --  changes in register do not always happen smoothly -- but she brings a dark,  ominous sound perfectly in keeping with the character.  Maria Bayo is a  charmer in the breeches role of Oscar.  There is no trace of acidity or  shrillness in her voice, merely lovely tone with excellent coloratura.  She  is my favorite Oscar on records. All in all, this recording is much more  of a success than critics would have us believe.  I got a great deal of  enjoyment out of this set, and I recommend it highly.
