 While all the arias on this disc have been recorded before, this is the first occasion I can think of in which the program is specifically devoted to the arias Mozart wrote for the talented sister of his wife, Aloysia  Weber.  The arias indicate that the singer had both a phenomenal range and  technique, both of which the present artist, Cyndia Sieden, has.  Her  singing is soft-grained and lovely, with notes above the staff always sweet  and bell-like, right up to the top G.  While she may be tempermentally a  little tame, so too was Weber, who reportedly was not much of an actress.   A lovely disc by a singer who deserves to be recorded much more frequently.
