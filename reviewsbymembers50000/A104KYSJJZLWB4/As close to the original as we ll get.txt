 This film version of "Show Boat," while not perfect, is the best one available.  Not only does it follow the story more closely (except for the end) but it also preserves three performances by members of the  original Broadway cast -- Sammy White, Charles Winninger, and Helen Morgan.   White is very good, his frenetic dancing a highlight, and Winninger is a  real winner as Andy.  However, Morgan's performance is a revelation -- we  get a chance for once to sample a bit of musical theatre history  first-hand.  She is what Kern and Hammerstein originally intended, a frail,  touching, tender Julie, who also sings her songs in the original soprano  keys.  In addition to this, Irene Dunne as Magnolia is lovely (she took  over the role on Broadway from Norma Terris, the original Magnolia), and we  are truly lucky to have Paul Robeson's Joe, the original choice for the  role.  You can hardly get closer to authenticity than this cast, and the  entire production was supervised by Kern and Hammerstein themselves.  This  film is the one to own if you want the best "Show Boat."
