 It seems that a decent baritone can be found nearly anywhere nowadays, but a truly magnificent one is a rare phenomenon.  That's why it is such a joy to discover this disc of Matthias Goerne singing three of Bach's solo  cantatas for bass.  Simply put, this is the best recording of these  cantatas that I have ever heard. Mr. Goerne combines a really beautiful  voice (his opening phrase in "Ich habe genug" will make your  heart stop) with intelligent, subtle word-pointing (not suprising, being a  student of both Fischer-Dieskau and Schwarzkopf).  His singing is both  poignantly human and reverently spiritual, exactly right for this music,  which is some of Bach's finest. Sir Roger Norrington conducts with an  unerring sense of line and phrasing, and Camerata Academica Salzburg play  with a warmth and transparency that is wholly engaging.  Special mention  must be made of oboist Albrecht Mayer's haunting solo lines in BWV 82, the  best I've heard them played. If you are unfamiliar with Mr. Goerne, I  strongly urge you to hear this disc for yourself and succumb to the  artistry of one of the finest young baritones in classical music today.
