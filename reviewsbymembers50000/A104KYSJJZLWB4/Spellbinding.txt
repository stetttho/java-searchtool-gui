 I have lived with this disc for nearly two years now and am still blown away by it.  It is simply breathtaking.   For those unaware, Sanford Sylvan is an American baritone best known for roles in John Adams' operas  "Nixon in China" and "The Death of Klinghoffer."  But  where Sylvan really excels is in the world of the art song.  These three  song cycles showcase his considerable interpretive talents.  He has a truly  lovely lyric voice full of expressive capabilities and myriad colors, and  he knows how to use the text intelligently without becoming blatant or  arch. The first song cycle, by Theodore Chanler, is a little-known gem  consisting of epitaphs by Walter de la Mare.  Each selection is so simple  and direct that one can easily imagine oneself reading these epitaphs  carved on tombstones in a New England cemetary.  The simplicity is so  affecting and Sylvan's performance so understated that after the cycle has  ended the listener feels emotionally drained. The two more famous  selections are Barber's Hermit Songs and Copland's Emily Dickinson poems.   The Barber interpretations rank with the best, if not perhaps topping any  of them (Eleanor Steber's comes readily to mind).  The Copland, on the  other hand, is my favorite rendition of these pieces ever.  This is a  personal preference, for normally these songs are sung by a woman.  But to  hear Sylvan, an openly gay man, sing "Heart, we will forget him,"  is an experience not to be missed for its added dimension of loss and  loneliness. Not to slight the accompanist's contribution, Mr. Breitman  plays exceptionally well, coloring the piano tone almost as expertly as  Sylvan does his voice.  These two make up an extraordinarily attuned  duo. Do yourself a favor and pick up this disc -- I guarantee you a  listening experience you won't soon forget.
