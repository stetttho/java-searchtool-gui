 This installment in Opera Rara's "Hundred Years of Italian Opera" project again reveals a treasure trove of lovely melody and high operatic drama.  The examples are well-chosen and really lovely,  making one wonder at their neglect.  One can almost hear history in the  making, as these composers push the boundaries of musico-dramatic  conventions.  Listen, for example, to the excerpt from Mercadante's  "Amleto," a Italian version of "Hamlet" which plays  fast and loose with Shakespeare but is marvelous on a musical level.   Mercadante includes whistling piccolos in the orchestration, which sound  eerily like human screams, a truly bone-chilling effect.  I was reminded of  the "Dies Irae" of Verdi's Requiem.  There is also a lovely aria  a due from "Rosmonda" by Coccia, sung deliciously by Yvonne Kenny  and Diana Montague.  Kenny, who is featured prominently in this set, has  lost some of the ease of her highest notes but sings with a beautiful line  and an alertness to the dramatic situation.  Other singers include Nuccia  Focile, Della Jones, Bruce Ford, and Alistair Miles.  An essential set for  the lover of bel canto and for those who enjoy discovering (unjustly)  forgotten works.
