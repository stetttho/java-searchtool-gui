 Barbra Streisand, like many other artists, went through an "experimental" phase, trying to expand boundaries and broaden the apparent limits of what she could do.  Some of it, like her forays into  contemporary music, worked beautifully.  Others, like this odd  "concept" TV special, seemed to be early signs of the Streisand  ego getting in the way of her music-making.   The title says it all;  those "other musical instruments" are chosen from around the  globe and sprinkled in various numbers to add an international flavor.  It  works in some ways, but mostly sounds clumsy and poorly thought out. Babs  also tries to push the boundaries by using electronic instruments (which to  modern ears sound delightfully absurd) and "found" instruments,  such as kitchen appliances.  Judge for yourself, but for my taste, the  results are nearly unlistenable. However, I still don't want to be  without this album, because it contains two really marvelous cuts, with  Barbra doing what she does best: getting to the heart of a song and giving  it everything she's got.  "I Never Has Seen Snow" and "The  Sweetest Sounds" will be familiar to Broadway buffs (they were both  originally sung by Diahann Caroll, although for different shows) and are  fine ballads, given top-notch performances here (although how "I Never  Has Seen Snow" fits the concept is something I'm not clear on). I  must also register a pet peeve: although I love her, Babs has no business  singing "Auf dem Wasser zu singen," and certainly not giving it  the cloying, condescending treatment she does here.  And why the  pseudo-baroque instrumentation?  The song was written in 1823, for Pete's  sake!  Try Elly Ameling or the late Arleen Auger to hear how Schubert  should be sung. In summary, a failed experimental album, but  indispensable for two prime Streisand cuts.
