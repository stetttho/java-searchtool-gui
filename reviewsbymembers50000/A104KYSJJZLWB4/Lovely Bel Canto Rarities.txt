 For those who may not be aware of her formidable talent, this disc is a welcome introduction to the art of Della Jones.  One of the finest British singers of her generation, Jones sings with fire and passion, always  dramatically involved.  The selection of arias is a fascinating one,  including a lovely aria for the hero from Donizetti's very first opera.   Nothing here is from the "standard" repertory, so even devotees  of bel canto should find something new to savor.  Highly recommended.
