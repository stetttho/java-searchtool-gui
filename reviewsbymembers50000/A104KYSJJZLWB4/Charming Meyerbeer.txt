 This work, a staple of such prime donne as Adelina Patti and Amelita Galli-Curci, has all but disappeared from modern opera stages.  Thankfully, the people at Opera Rara have produced this recording, so those of us who  are curious may see just what the opera has to offer.  While it is not a  masterpiece, it is quite charming and filled with much delightful music,  not the least of which is the most famous aria, the heroine's "Shadow  Song."  That aria is well sung by Deborah Cook, small and fleet of  voice (not unlike Galli-Curci) and capping the aria with a high F.  The  rest of the singers are great, with Della Jones and Marilyn Hill Smith in  small roles.  It goes without saying that Opera Rara's packaging and  presentation are first-rate.  An important addition to operatic recordings.
