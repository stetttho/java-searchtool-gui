 When this set was first released a couple of years ago, I hesitated in purchasing it because of the mostly negative reviews it received.  I should stop listening to the critics.   Carlo Rizzi's recordings of "La  Traviata" and "Rigoletto" are both highly enjoyable and well  conducted.  This one is no exception -- Rizzi leads a spirited, engaging  performance that nicely balances Verdi's lyricism and drama, never trying  to smooth over parts that other conductors do because of their perceived  "vulgarity." The cast is quite good, certainly much better than  critics have given them credit for.  Richard Leech sings with heady beauty  and handsome tone; forget Cura and Alagna, he outclasses both of them.   Vladimir Chernov does here what he excels at, namely, spinning out a rich,  velvety voice, and singing with an authority that is quite compelling.  The  mezzo, Elena Zaremba, is a bit gusty and not ideally steady, but her dark,  Russian, contralto-like tones are right on for Ulrica.  Maria Bayo is a  charming Oscar, with clean, sharp coloratura and without a trace of acidity  in the voice.  She is my favorite Oscar on records. Which brings us to  the Amelia of Michele Crider.  Judging by the harsh reviews she has  received, one would expect an large, unwieldy, undersupported voice of  limited dramatic expression.  How unjust that verdict is can be heard by  listening to her first aria, "Ma dall' arido stelo divulsa."   Crider is dramatically alive and possesses a warm, rich spinto soprano:  brilliant and blazing at the top, full and creamy at the middle, strong and  steady at the bottom.  She can sing with clarion power or spin a high  pianissimo line reminiscent of Caballe.  Critics have not been kind (I  cannot understand why), but I for one would like to hear more from Ms.  Crider. All in all, this is an engaging and highly enjoyable performance  of "Ballo," perhaps not the best available, but one to which I  will frequently return.
