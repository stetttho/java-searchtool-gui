 What a pleasant surprise this disc was!  Realizing that I had no copy of the "Anna Magdalena Notebook" in my collection, I browsed around until I selected this particular recording, mainly because of the number of  selections it offered.  I had not heard of any of the performers before,  but am glad I took the chance. Karina Gauvin sings the arias with a full,  flutey timbre, eschewing the "white" sound favored by many  sopranos in this repertoire.  Her account of the lovely "Bist du bei  mir" is particularly good: exalted, grave, and ethereal all at once.   There were times when she struck me as sounding remarkably akin to the late  Arleen Auger, and that can only be to the good.  I really hope to hear more  from her. Luc Beausejour plays with a delicacy and refinement that are  most welcome, and embellishes tastefully.  The simplicity of many of the  selections bring playing that is clear and alive; Beausejour fills these  old chestnuts with charm and individuality.  The recording engineers have  done a superb job in making the harpsichord sound full and rich -- too  often, the harpsichord can sound tinny, even abrasive on recordings. I  heartily recommend this disc.
