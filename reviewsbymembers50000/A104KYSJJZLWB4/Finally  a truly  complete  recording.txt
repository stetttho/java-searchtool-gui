 I never tire of defending "Oklahoma!" to those willing to dismiss it as merely musical comedy fluff.  No show which changed the format of the Broadway musical can be dismissed so casually, and let us not  forget that it contains issues of sexual harassment, territorial rights,  and includes an onstage death at the end. This particular recording is  the first ever to include the "Dream Ballet," another important  historical aspect of the show.  That fact alone puts it at the front of  current recordings of the show.  In addition, spoken sections within  numbers are included, giving the whole album a more theatrical feel than  most.  The only major musical segment not included is Ado Annie's encore  verse of "I Cain't Say No," but this fact shouldn't deter  listeners. It also helps that the cast is excellent.  Hugh Jackman is  more a tenor than the high baritone the role calls for, but is engaging  nonetheless, giving full rein to the character's machismo and tenderness.   Jimmy Johnston and Vicki Simon are perfect as Will and Annie, utterly  beguiling and believable in admittedly two-dimensional roles.  The always  delightful Maureen Lipman is great as Aunt Eller.  Josefina Gabrielle as  Laurey is a fine actress, but her head voice and chest voice seem to be two  separate entities and a break is evident between them.  Admittedly, Laurey  is a tough role vocally, being a soprano in a very low tessitura.  However,  Gabrielle makes up for any vocal shortcomings with her truly winning  performance. The sound is fantastic, and this is one of the few British  cast recordings of an American musical in which the accents are uniformly  excellent.  For devotees of Rodgers and Hammerstein, for lovers of classic  musicals, and for anyone who may be curious, I highly recommend this new  recording.
