 My admiration for this recording grows more every time I hear it.  The agreed-upon classic set is the Bjoerling/De Los Angeles version, but I think this is the one I will listen when I want to hear the opera in  beautiful, warm, digital (not to mention stereo) sound.  I am not a fan of  Roberto Alagna, but he sings quite well and with much commitment here.  He  manages some lovely piano phrases in the quartet.  Leontina Vaduva  initially struck me as light-voiced for Mimi, but I now feel there is a  lovely, touching pathos in the delicate sound of her voice.  It is a  beautiful instrument, reservations aside.  Thomas Hampson and Ruth Ann  Swenson are completely marvelous as Marcello and Musetta, Hampson engaging,  intelligent and wry, and Swenson sweeping through the score with a voice  that puts most other recorded Musettas to shame.  Pappano conducts a  performance both lively and lush, and all supporting roles are strongly  sung.  This is the one to have if you want a good digital recording of the  opera.
