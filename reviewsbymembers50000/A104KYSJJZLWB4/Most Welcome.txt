 This, the first complete recording of Gluck's original Italian version of "Alceste," is an excellent achievement.   Before this recording, I knew only the primary arias from the French  "Alceste" recorded by Callas and Janet Baker.  Both of these  divas give an electrifying performance of "Divinites du Styx,"  the most familiar aria.  Here, titled "Ombre, larve," the aria is  simpler, less assured, and perhaps not as fully developed as the French  revision.  However, throughout the entire opera, the simplicity of line and  the musical distillation of emotion which Gluck sought is supremely  evident.  To compare this work to the opera seria of Handel's time almost  forty years earlier is to realize the true extent of Gluck's reforms. The  cast is, for the most part, excellent.  Teresa Ringholz brings a lovely,  rather soft-grained instrument to Alceste's music and sings with a firm  line and dramatic commitment, if perhaps without the fire of a Callas or  Baker.  A fuller chest register would be an asset in this music, but that  is a small point.  She is quite good and dominates this set as she should.   Justin Lavender here sounds a little unfocused and woolly, qualities I have  not heard in him before, so I am willing to chalk it up to a peculiarity in  the recorded sound.  Other than that, he makes a fine Admeto.  A couple of  unsteady minor roles aside, the rest of the cast is very good. Arnold  Oestman leads the Drottningholm Orchestra and Chorus with style and  excellent control.  Everything is well-paced and the recitatives are lively  and involving, never dull.  Despite this being a live performance, the  stage noises are almost nonexistant.  Naxos has provided an English  translation alongside the Italian libretto, and the cueing points are more  than generous.  While we are unlikely to have another recording of  "Alceste" (French or Italian) anytime soon, I can't see this set  being bettered.  Tremendous value and an excellent buy.  Don't miss it.
