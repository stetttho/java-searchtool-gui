 Okay, so "Flower Drum Song" might not be great theatre and might not be top-drawer Rodgers and Hammerstein.  But it is lovely and contains some sharp moments.  "A Hundred Million Miracles" is enchanting,  and ballads like "Love, Look Away" and "You are  Beautiful" cannot be passed by so easily.  "Chop Suey" is  awful, and "Sunday" is one of those tunes that's supposed to be a  hit but never really sticks in your mind no matter how often you hear it.   But, contrary to the reviewers opinion below, it DID have a small,  successful revival in New York a few years ago.  Overall, a pleasant  diversion and a must for R & H fans.
