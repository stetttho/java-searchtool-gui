 I have taken much flack from my theatrically elitist friends when I defend (vehemently) the works of Rodgers & Hammerstein.  I find their shows (especially the first five) and the works of Stephen Sondheim to be among  the best things ever written for the theatre.  Not just musical theatre,  but THEATRE.  Sadly, this recording would give R & H detractors support  for their views.  While it is valuable as the only recording to include ALL  the music written for the "King and I", the cast feels  dramatically hazy and unfocussed.  Valerie Masterson sings beautifully, as  one would expect from her, but she hasn't had the time to really get to the  heart of Anna, though she does a fair job.  Christopher Lee's dark black  voice fits the King, but he is too laid back for my taste.  Sally Burgess  is a fine Lady Thiang, and the most successful casting of the set.  Tinuke  Olafimihan, usually such an excellent performer, is dull and a little hooty  here.  The two boys are poor.  Valuable, then, for its completeness, but  maddening for its slackness.  For more dramatically convincing recordings,  check out the 1977 RCA version with Yul Brynner and Constance Towers, or  the fine 1996 Broadway revival with Donna Murphy and Lou Diamond Philips.
