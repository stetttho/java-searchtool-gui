 We are lucky to have this recording back in the catalogue after a much-too-long absence.   In fact, as far as I can tell, this is its first release on CD. Many listeners will have fond memories of having been in or seen a production of this show at an early age and will treasure reliving those memories through this CD.  For those who don't know anything about the show, I recommend highly that you set cynicism aside for an hour and give into the delights in store. "You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown" came out of a decade when off-Broadway shows were in their prime. "The Fantasticks," "Little Mary Sunshine," "Godspell," "Dames at Sea,"; all these shows used their small budgets and limited resources as assets, counter-acting the overblown, bloated, lavish Broadway productions.  These shows had at their center a sense of fun and, most importantly, heart, which drew audiences to them in droves. "You're a Good Man" captures not only the fun of the "Peanuts" characters but the essence and spirit of the wonderful comic as well.  The actors are simple and direct, never falling into the coy archness some adults adopt when playing young children.  The show itself is sweet without being syrupy and the music is pure fun and joy. I won't compare this recording with the new Broadway cast; I like both of them, and don't wish to denigrate either of them.  Both are valid ways of performing this show, although very different.  The new cast is more polished and is backed by a more varied instrumental group, while the original cast plays the piece more sincerely, at a less cartoonish level.  Again, I like both versions and recommend having both in your collection, but if you only want one, decide which is more important to you: polish and sparkle, or simplicity and charm. This disc is a great memento of one of the most beloved off-Broadway shows ever written; many thanks to Decca for bringing it back to us!
