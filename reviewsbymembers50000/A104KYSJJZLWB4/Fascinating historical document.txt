 This recording was made just about a year before Solti and producer John Culshaw started on their now-legendary "Ring" recording for Decca.  On this album, which might easily be regarded as a testing ground for the later project, the formidable Kirsten Flagstad takes the role of Brunnhilde. Flagstad was in her early 60's when this recording was made, but aside from a few slightly hollow-sounding notes, you'd never know it.  Nobody could sing Wagner like this woman, and believe me, she really does SING this music.  No shrieking, belting, or bellowing for Madame Flagstad -- just pure, rich, dark, tone: this is what Wagner singing is all about. Otto Edelman is disappointing here.  He simply doesn't have the vocal heft or dark beauty of tone one expects from Wotan.  He is always intelligent and musical, but there are better recorded Wotans. Marianne Schech may not have the loveliest voice, but she is dramatically alive here in her brief contribution as Sieglinde. One or two voices aside, the Valkyries are a strong group, and I must single out Claire Watson's Helmwige for her fabulously secure singing of the opening "Ho-jo-to-ho" -- she doesn't scoop up to those perilous B's and C's but attacks them assuredly and fearlessly. Solti conducts well, if pressing a bit at times, and the Vienna Philharmonic plays beautifully.  The sound is excellent, bright and detailed, typical of Decca's high standard.  Notes on the recording are included, as well as a complete text.   This is a valuable issue for those who want to hear the legendary Flagstad in one of her signature roles in excellent stereo sound.
