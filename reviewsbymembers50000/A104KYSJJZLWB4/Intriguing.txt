 This recording, one of Opera Rara's earliest, presents the 1838 version of Donizetti's "Gabriella di Vergy" (not to be confused with "Gemma di Vergy").  This opera is unique in the Donizetti canon  because it was one he composed without a prior commission in 1826.  He  revised it again in 1838, but the opera did not receive a staged  performance until over thirty years later, in a version cobbled together  from various Donizetti operas. The full history and story of the opera  are documented in the copious notes provided with this set.  The music is  not first-rate Donizetti, but can achieve moments of loveliness and drama.   The casting is good but lacks the last degree of polish.  Ludmilla Andrew  in the title role sings with lovely tone, although notes above the staff  tend to constrict and do not "float" as one would ideally wish.   She is always dramatically alive, however.  Maurice Arthur's voice is only  serviceable in music which cries out for the beauty of voice and the  commitment of a young Pavarotti.  He is the weak link in this cast.   Conversely, Christian du Plessis is the most successful of the soloists,  firm in his line and fully bringing out the conflicting emotions within his  character.  John Tomlinson is not as steady as he can be, but sings with  imposing assurance in the role of the king.  Allun Francis conducts with  real feeling for the music. As a bonus, the set includes two arias and a  duet from the 1826 "Gabriella," beautifully sung by Della Jones  and Eiddwen Harrhy.  All in all, a highly enjoyable set.
