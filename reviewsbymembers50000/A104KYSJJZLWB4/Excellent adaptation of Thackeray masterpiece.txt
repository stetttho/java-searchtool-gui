 Thackeray's "Vanity Fair" is such a sprawling, grand example of the Victorian novel that any mere two-hour movie adaptation will be forced to leave out crucial elements.  As it is, this six-hour BBC film version  emits certain items (Jos Sedley's ultimate fate, the James Crawley  episode), but is remarkably faithful to its source.  Indeed, a television  mini-series is the best way to adapt such a work, allowing the story to  unfold and the viewer to become involved with the various  characters. This production is fantastic, with beautiful costumes,  excellent performances, and a fine script.  Chief among its attractions is  Natasha Little in the key role of Becky Sharp.  Miss Little is not only  luminously beautiful, but manages to arouse our sympathies toward a  virtually unsympathetic character.  Special mention must also go to Jeremy  Swift, whose portrayal of bumbling Jos Sedley is a delight.  Miriam  Margolyes (always wonderful) and Eleanor Bron appear in secondary roles.   The rest of the cast is well-chosen and all play their parts with  conviction. The greatest hurdle a filmed version of "Vanity  Fair" faces is how to convey the many shifts of tone which Thackeray  goes through in the novel.  This problem has been solved by use of an  unusual score, which draws from such diverse sources as military marching  bands, Strauss waltzes (wrong for the period but who cares?), and a bit of  Kurt Weill.  Murray Gold's score never lets us forget that we are in the  world of Thackeray's biting satire, and not Jane Austen's more delicate  world of comedy-of-manners. All told, it will take a long time before  this film treatment is bettered.
