 Apparently the reviewers below had no prior exposure to this work before viewing the DVD in question. That can be a handicap when coming to a work such as "Carmelites." Perhaps I am a bit better equipped to judge, as this is one of my favourite operas of all time.  This is a truly excellent performance, recorded in 1999 at the Opera National du Rhin. Aside from a small spoken scene in Act Three where Blanche learns of the arrest of the sisters, the performance is complete. The cast is uniformly excellent, but particular mention must be made of Anne-Sophie Schmidt's highly moving Blanche and Nadine Denize's haunting old Prioress with a riveting death scene. Additionally, Patricia Petibon is a charming Constance and Hedwig Fassbender a sympathetic Mere Marie. The sets and costumes are simple and evocative without getting in the way of the action, and although I'd quibble with the staging of the final climactic scene, everything else that is done is done extremely well. In short, if you want a DVD version of "Dialogues of the Carmelites," I really can't see this fine edition being bettered anytime soon.
