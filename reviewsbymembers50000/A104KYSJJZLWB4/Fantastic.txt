 EMI have raided their considerable vaults and come up with a collection that has been sorely needed.  Many of the singers on this disc are unrepresented in the current CD catalogue, so it is a real pleasure to have  them here at last. The sopranos chosen certainly fit the description  "In the Grand Tradition," although I'd quibble with a couple of  choices (it's hard to think of Alda Noni as "grand").  Each is  represented by one well-chosen aria, beginning with a 1926 recording by  Puccini's first Liu, Maria Zamboni, singing "Signore, ascolta."   It is too choked with sobs and overwrought, but what a piece of history!   Other highlights are a moving "L'altra notte" by Pia Tassinari  (who indulges in one disruptive sob at the end -- you can't accuse the  Italians of a lack of passion) and a lovely "Donde lieta" by Sara  Scuderi.  We also get an authoritative "When I am laid in earth"  by Kirsten Flagstad and a lush Marietta's Lied sung by Joan Hammond.  Best  of all, perhaps, is Eleanor Steber's rapturous rendition of "Depuis le  jour," one of the best recordings of that aria ever. Every track,  however, is highly enjoyable and unique.  These are singers that left their  indivual stamp on the music, from the lyric Toti dal Monte and Margherita  Carosio to the dramatic Gina Cigna and Maria Caniglia to the more famous  Sena Jurinac, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, and Leonie Rysanek.  Today's focus on  superb musicianship above all else has raised technical accomplishment but  has eliminated the individuality and overwhelming personality evident in  these early recordings.  For a glimpse into an older (but hopefully not  forgotten) tradition, this disc is invaluable.
