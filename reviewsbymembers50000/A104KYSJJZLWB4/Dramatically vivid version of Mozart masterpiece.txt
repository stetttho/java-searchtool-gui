 William Christie and Les Arts Florissants have amassed an impressive body of recorded work, and this disc of Mozart's C Minor Mass is one more feather in their collective cap.  Christie conducts a rather fast  performance, yet he finds the humanity in this music and never treats it  with kid gloves, as some period performances make the mistake of doing.   (Who said one has to take the guts out of Mozart to make it authentic?)   Christie's Mozart is both passionate and committed, making this a  rewarding, moving, and involving listening experience.   It helps that  Christie has excellent soloists at his disposal, particularly in the two  prominent soprano parts.  Here we actually get a second soprano instead of  a mezzo, and the music benefits from the sound of two well-contrasted  soprano timbres.  That second soprano is the excellent Lynne Dawson, who  sings "Laudamus te" with clean attack and full, rich tone.  Even  better is the relative newcomer, Patricia Petibon, who can cope with the  extreme low notes in the "Kyrie" (one of the few recordings in  which those notes are truly audible) or the high, ethereal line in "Et  incarnatus est" without losing her sweetness and purity of tone.  That  last aria is taken a touch too fast for my liking, but Petibon's  performance is so lovely that I can easily set aside my  reservations. While this may not be the best performance of Mozart's C  Minor Mass, it certainly places high against the recorded competition.  For  a refreshing view of a much-loved work, try this recording.
