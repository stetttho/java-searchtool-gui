 "Maria de Rudenz" may have a rather unsavory and highly improbable plot, but the masterly music of Donizetti helps put the work over.  All the singers are first rate, with special mention going to Bruce  Ford, one of the finest tenors working in this repertoire, and Nelly  Miriciou, who sings the title role with complete conviction reminiscent of  Callas, without her predecessor's unsteadiness.  This may not be a lost  masterpiece, but it is a highly enjoyable addition to the recorded  Donizetti canon.  As always, Opera Rara's presentation puts all other  complete opera sets to shame, with its deluxe packaging and first-rate  booklet and notes, detailing the history of the opera.  Fantastic.
