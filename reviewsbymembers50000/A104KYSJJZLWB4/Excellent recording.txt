 While this may not be the best "Magic Flute" (and the debate on that topic is too involved to get into), anyone looking for a good digital recording can't go wrong with this version. Solti's conducting hasn't  changed that much since his earlier recording.  That one may be marginally  better than this version, but it comes on three CDs compared to this later  recording which takes only two. The best thing about this recording is  Ruth Ziesak's lovely Pamina: pure, lovely tone, lighter than others  (Janowitz, Te Kanawa) but convincingly girlish rather than matronly.  One  of the best.  Kurt Moll is once again an excellent Sarastro, though maybe  lacking the final degree of authority found in his earlier recordings.   Kraus as Papageno sounds a bit fluttery at times, but he projects the  character well.   Uwe Heilman's Tamino is not as bad as some have said,  but he certainly is no Wunderlich (who is?).  However, he sings with  commitment and a sure sense of style.  While I prefer a dramatic coloratura  in the Queen's music (a la Studer, Deutekom, or best of all, Edda Moser),  Sumi Jo has the pyrotechnical accomplishment to make her one of the finest  Queens on rcord.  The voice is round and bell-like, never shrill, and the  high staccati notes glitter.  However, she is even better on the Arnold  Oestman recording. The rest of the cast is fine, with special mention  going to Heinz Zednik's oily, sycophantic Monostatos.  Also worthy of note  are the three boys, who sing gorgeously, better than any other recording  which uses treble voices in the parts.  A fine version of "Flute"  for the first-time listener or to add alongside other recordings.
