 Let's get one thing out into the open right now: if you only like a plotted story with a clear beginning, a developed middle, and a firm, tidy ending, then you will probably be frustrated by "Griffin &  Sabine."  Those who value imaginative stories, open endings, and  haunting artwork are encouraged to read further. This lush, beautiful,  eerie and somewhat baffling trilogy relates a series of letters and  postcards between two artists living half a world apart.  The story is told  entirely through the letters themselves; however, there is a twist sure to  delight the voyeur in all of us.  All the correspondence is printed as if  it were in its original form, so we see the postcards, and in order to read  the letters, we must remove them from the envelopes pasted within the book.   This gives the reader the slightly "naughty" thrill of going  through another person's mail. As for what actually happens between  Griffin and Sabine or who they might really be, I will leave for the reader  to ponder.  Suffice it to say that Bantock's beautifully illustrated series  will make a pleasantly diversion for those with an eye for the unusual.
