 Melissa Mueller states at the beginning of this book that she does not intend for this volume to be a replacement for the diary, but rather an adjunct to it.  This goal has been acheived admirably through extensive  interviews and research, giving insights in not only Anne's life before and  after her experiences in hiding, but also shedding light on the various  family members and people involved. One thing Mueller accomplishes, which  may well be worth the price of the book alone, is to paint a more accurate  picture of two of the most maligned figures in Anne's diary: Edith Frank  and Fritz Pfeffer (Albert Dussel in Anne's pseudonym).  Especially moving  are descriptions of Edith's tenacity in keeping her daughters with her at  Auschwitz-Birkenau, and a letter written by Pfeffer to his fiancee,  Charlotte.  One would wish Mueller had been able to do the same for the van  Pels family (the van Daans in the diary), but perhaps the information  available was simply too scant. For anyone who cherishes the diary and  legacy of Anne Frank, this book will be a welcome addition to the body of  work this remarkable child has inspired.
