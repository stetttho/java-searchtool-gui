 These recordings are taken mostly from the Harnoncourt/Leonhardt complete sacred Bach cantatas project, with several selections from the Saint Matthew Passion included as well.  While I generally prefer women's voices  to boys' in this repertoire (not authentic, I know), this CD makes an  excellent case for using boys' voices in this music.  The young soloists  are all remarkably assured and sing with lovely, full tone, much different  from the sound of English choirboys (most of the soloists here are German,  Austrian, or Dutch).  There are particularly lovely accounts of "Mein  glaubiges Herze," "Blute nur," and "Flosst, mein  Heiland" included here.  So if you are looking to sample Bach's vocal  works, or wish to hear the pure sound of boy sopranos, or simply want some  lovely music, this is a disc to try.
