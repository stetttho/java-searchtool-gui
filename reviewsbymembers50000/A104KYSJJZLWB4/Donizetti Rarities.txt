 Opera Rara has done more towards unearthing forgotten and neglected bel canto works than any other record company, and for that, they deserve to be commended.  The additional fact that virtually everything they produce is  so well recorded, performed, and packaged is another bonus. The present  recording is no exception.  It presents alternate numbers written by  Donizetti as additional or replacement material for several of his operas.   The overtures are pleasant enough, but it would have been nice to have even  more vocal material, for the selections included are truly fine. The  singers are up to their assignments, with the notable exception of Rockwell  Blake, who has lost the freshness and ease of tone found on his Mozart and  Rossini discs during the 1980's.  However, Nelly Miriciou once again does  herself proud, singing with dramatic intensity and excellent technical  aplomb, while newcomer Garry Magee takes the baritone roles with beautiful  tone and full commitment.  An excellent disc.
