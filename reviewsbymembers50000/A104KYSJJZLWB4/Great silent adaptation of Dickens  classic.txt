 This version of "Oliver Twist" is a scant 74 minutes long, but contains much more of the book (including a portion of the Rose Maylie sequence) and retains a highly Dickensian flavor when viewed alongside other adaptations. If you are new to silent films, this could be a good  one to whet your appetite.  If you are already a fan, give this one a try.   The film is primarily a vehicle for Jackie Coogan, which proves to be just  fine, as he is delightful in the title role.  His expressive face and tiny  stature are dead-right for Oliver, and he has more spunk than most  exponents of the role, which helps to allay the saccharine nature of the  character. Fans of Lon Chaney may be disappointed with the little screen  time he is given, but he makes the most of it.  Subtle touches Chaney adds  (such as gently laying a hand on Bill Sikes' chest) give a wealth of  subtext and nuance to his performance, and adds immeasurably to our  understanding of Fagin as petty thief.   The rest  of the cast is good, with a fine performance from Gladys Brockwell as  Nancy.  She is another aspect of the film which rings true to Dickens: she  is less the "hooker with a heart of gold" than a complex,  hardened woman who has grown up among criminals yet retains her  conscience. Mention must also be made of the fine production design.   Many scenes look as though they were lifted from the original Cruikshank  illustrations (especially the meeting at London Bridge) and the men look  particularly appropriate for the period.  Some of the women retain the '20s  look in makeup and hair, which is typical of Hollywood period movies  through the 1970's. The title cards also are well-done, either quoting  directly from Dickens or retaining his authorial flavor. All told, this  is a winning adaptation of a perennial favorite.
