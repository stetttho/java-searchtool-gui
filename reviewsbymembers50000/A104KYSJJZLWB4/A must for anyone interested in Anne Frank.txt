 This edition of the famous diary of Anne Frank is unlike any other.  Subtitled "The Critical Edition" it includes not only the published version in the translation by Mrs. B. M. Mooyaart-Doubleday, but  also everything that was withheld -- at the request of Anne's father --  from the original published version. While in hiding, Anne heard on a  radio broadcast that after the war the Dutch government wanted to collect  memoirs and diaries of citizens' wartime experiences.  Anne decided to  start a revision of her diary, clarifying certain passages and adding in  more detail, while deleting items that she deemed unimportant or too  personal (Anne wrote very candidly about her own sexuality).  The critical  edition of her diary includes Anne's first diary, her revisions, and the  final, published version. In addition, this volume contains exhaustively  researched sections on the arrest and betrayal of the members of the  "Secret Annex," the publishing history of the diary, an account  of the creation of the play version, a chronicle of the attacks made on the  diary's authenticity, and an incredibly meticulous handwriting analysis  comparing letters known to have been written by Anne with excerpts from the  diary itself. I first read "The Diary of Anne Frank" when I was  thirteen years old.  I reread it about every three or four years and it  speaks to me on a new level every time.  It has become my all-time favorite  book.  With this beautiful edition, I am once again disovering this amazing  document and this remarkable child.
