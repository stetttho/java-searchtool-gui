 Pros: Very compact design, great picture quality, compact size, comfortable in the hand, customizeable scene modes, 2-megapixel resolution for prints up to 8 x 10 inches  Cons: Problems when using with LCD monitor off, scene modes can be a bit too customizeable, and distract you from the shot  Summary: I had an option at the camera store between the Nikon 2100 and an Olympus model that was 3.0 megapixels. They were both priced the same and basically had the same specs. It boiled down to "ease of operation". To delete a shot with the Nikon 2100, you touch one button. On the Olympus model, you have to navigate through the menu and it's quite aggravating. That's just one of the many features that Nikon has added to the 2100. The menu is quite user friendly and the camera is very easy to use. A part of me was worried getting a 2.0 megapixel camera, but there really isn't that much of a difference between a 3.0/2.0 on a 4X6 picture. One other note, and this may seem elementary: the camera looks great! Very sleek and compact.  There are some downsides: the flash seems a bit hot and the shutter is quite slow - you can't snap the shutter like you can on an SLR, causing you to miss some of those moments that happen in the "blink of an eye". BUT, for the price and the great quality, you can't beat it. And the biggest PLUS? NIKON! It's all about the NIKON quality - far and away the best brand!
