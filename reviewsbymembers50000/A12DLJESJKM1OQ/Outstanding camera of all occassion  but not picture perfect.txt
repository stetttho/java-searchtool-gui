 Pros: Very compact for its specs; comprehensive feature set; high-quality images; long battery life. Cons: Autofocus speed average at best; continuous-shooting mode only 1fps; no slow-sync flash setting; no RAW mode. I recently brought the Pentax Optio 550 and this camera has a wide range of possibilities. THe colors are vibrant, the 5x optical is awesome, the 5.03 mexapixels are nice, and the wide range of options is awesome. The microphone records at 64 kpbs and can record somewhat decent clips. I have only taken 100 or so pictures, but most of them have turned out very nice. Only two possible down sides, though they are easily compensated for. First of all the noise levels at 400, and even 200 can be hideous. Just go to user mode and set the ISO to 64 or 100. Then set the Exposure Compensation to +1 or +1.3. Secondly, the movie mode is not of high quality, as it only records 320 * 240, however, given that this is a digital Camera, and not a video camera that is acceptable I have two 256 MB lexar card and those are definitely useful.
