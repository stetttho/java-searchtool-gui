 To me, I think that this is a very good book that describes  the moving from the Polynesian cultures on Easter Island to the flourishing American civilizations of the Anasazi. "Collapse" is a really good book that takes place as one of the essential books of our time, raising a question people have been asking: How can our world best avoid committing ecological suicide? It also answers what had caused some of the great civilizations of the past to collapse into ruin, and what can we learn from their fates? This is a really good book if you like to learn about history, or just like learning new facts. I learned a lot out of this book. It reminds me of "Angels and Demons" by Dan Brown, where you learn countless of history of 'The Vatican.' But anyways, I really recommend this book to everyone!!!
