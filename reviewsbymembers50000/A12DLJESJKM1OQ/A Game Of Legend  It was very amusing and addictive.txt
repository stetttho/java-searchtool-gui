 This game was a sim of the highest caliber. It had me enthralled the whole time. I couldn't stop playing until I had beaten the entire game, and it left me wanting more. This Game is in the spirit of RollerCoaster Tycoon, with superior graphics and sound. The built in MP3 player is a nice feature I will use it alot in this game! This is worth of buying it just to see how awesome the graphics are. It is like Theme Park World but a million times better. Its not really worth the purchase if you only have 56k or less modem or if your system is less than Pentium 500 though. Despite that, this is the best game I've ever played in my whole entire life, and, trust me, I've played millions and millions of games!
