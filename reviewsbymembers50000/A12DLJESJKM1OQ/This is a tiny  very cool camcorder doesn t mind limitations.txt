 Pros: Stylish and amazingly compact; innovative design; built-in flash and low-power video light; flexible low-light shooting. Cons: Limited choice in editing apps for MicroMV video format; lens has fairly narrow angle of view; no accessory shoe or external microphone jack. It has been a week after I bought this camcorder and so far it is great. The super night vision comes really handy if you go on camping or some other interesting dark places. The controls are very easy to reach and the picture quality is really good. Some people say that they do not like the cassette to be ejected from bottom, but I have no problems with it. I think it is fine. The movie shaker software that comes with the camcorder is not a very professional one. It can handle basic editing and it has great effects. Very easy to use and to set up. You can export the movies you capture in different formats such as real audio, quicktime, etc. It really takes a long time to export though. It is the same with other digital cameras. So, it shouldn't be a concern for you to decide if you should buy the camera or not. You can use the network function to email the photos to a website.If you have a bluetooth cell phone, it is very easy. But if you don't have one, you will have to buy the sony bluetooth adapter for the camcorder which costs about $199. It is better to buy a new cell phone than buying the adapter. This little device is top of the line. It has manual focus for better capturing. It has a smart flash which pops-up automatically when you hit the photo shoot button half-way down. One downside of the camera is that it does not have an input for external microphone. But the built in one does a good very good job. All in all, you should not miss this camcorder. It is affordable, small, cute, and it is SONY. You would never mind carrying it to everywhere you go. And if you are a guy, you'll make a lot of "female" friends. You'll become the center of attention. GRAB ONE! HAVE FUN!
