 After reading his book God's politics: Why the Right Gets It Wrong and the Left Doesn't Get It, I believe this is one of the best political books on the analysis of contemporary US politics. Jim Wallis successfully opened our eyes. In God's Politics, the author dissected the problems of the gross misinterpretation of Christian Ethic by the Religious Right and the Republican party, as well as the little attachment to religious discourse by the Democratic Party. Through his fair and balanced analysis of the two parties, Wallis made a strong conclusion and came up with suggestions on several things that should be done if we want to see a new dawn in political discussions.   Jim Wallis is truly a gift to America, this book is a blessing to all those who hunger for political leadership grounded in authentic Christian faith. Share this book with your pastor, Sunday School teacher, youth group and congressperson. May this book be a bestseller, while it challenges the secular left and the religious right. This is a must read for any Americans and the rest of the world.
