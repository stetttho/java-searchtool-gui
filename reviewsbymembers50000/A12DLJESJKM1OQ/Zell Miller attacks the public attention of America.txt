 After receiving a limited release of his book, A Deficit Of Decency, Zell Miller urges students to live out their lives of faith within a culture that is increasingly forsaking the foundational truths of the Bible. Basically, his book addresses specific issues where Miller sees a need to a return to a basic sense of duty. He discusses candidly about the values that led him to attack his own party and deliver a keynote speech at the 2004 Republican National Convention. He also writes about his rise and service as Governor and United States Senator, drawing upon public service in each of the past six decades. As I read through his book, Miller identifies a wide range of issues - from media and sports role models, to the judiciary, to the decline of traditional Christian values of the family, responsibility and sacrifice - where an absence of decency is threatening the heart of America. Basically, I really recommend this book to anyone who wants to know Zell Miller more, what his goals are, and what he wants to accomplish within America. I also read his other six books he has written, including Corps Values, and the New York Times bestseller A National Party No More. I really recommend all his books to everyone.
