 Pros: Very easy to use, inexpensive, sturdy, Easy to use, lightweight, great pictures, video out, lcd and traditional viewfinders, Good exposure, compact, Easy download of pictures, good starter software. Cons: No optical zoom, The extra "dock" costs you ..., but you don't really need it, small lcd, small internal memory, Zoom options are limited, Only 16 MG of internal memory, Secure Digital is the only memory upgrade avaliable, eats AA batteries like candy!!! Summary: The pictures that I have downloaded and printed on my printer have been excellent quality. I even printed an 8X10 of my daughter and it turned out great. The images were not grainy as I had suspected they would be. I have read a lot of reviews that state the casual photographer should not need much more than a 2.0 mega-pixel camera. After printing pictures and having some printed by online retailers, I must say I am NOT disappointed. The colors seem true to life and I haven't seen much red-eye.  Transfering pictures to your computer is easy, even without the dock. Just connect your USB cable to the camera and your computer, turn on the Kodak easy share software and hit transfer. You can transfer all your pictures at once, one-by-one, or by date acquired. I transferred 8 pictures at once and it only took a few seconds. You can edit the pictures with the software, e-mail them or order online prints. I have it set up so that pictures automatically get stored in the "my pictures" file on my computer, but that really wasn't needed.  I think this is a very good camera for first timers and people that are on a limited budget. A must Want List!!
