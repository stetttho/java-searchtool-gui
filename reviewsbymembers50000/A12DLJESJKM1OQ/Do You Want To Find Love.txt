 To me, I think this is a really good book that identifies the broad-based compatibility of powerful attraction between people and leads to have long-term love. It explain the rules in how we all should find true love, and describe ways people can change after marriage...and ways they can't and never will. It also explains the sixteen factors that can make or break your relationships and also mentions many secrets men need to know before starting a relationship. This book really helps you to avoid wasting years on the wrong person and the pain of a broken heart. This is an excellent book for those who want to find true love that you can relish for a lifetime. I recommend it!!!! Because you're learn something out of it!!! This is a great book for any gentlemen!!!
