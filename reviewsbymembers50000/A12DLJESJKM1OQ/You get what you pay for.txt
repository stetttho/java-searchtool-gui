 Pros: MP3 playback, sleek design, extended battery life, No skipping/clipping, Vibrant sound/bass (with good headphones), SOLID Construction, style, large display for clearly visible screen, great sound, quick, high-quality feel, remote, WMA support Cons: Somewhat expensive (although worth it), Can't recharge batteris, No backlit display Highly Recommended!! JVC's XL-PM30 is more than just a CD player, although it is a perfectly fine CD player. The XL-PM30 can also play MP3 and Windows Media Audio files.  The XL-PM30 has a very clear display that will show MP3 text with ID3 tag, segment, track, and title data. The CD player has the usual assortment of playback features: repeat, intro scan, and random play, in addition to a 20-track program memory.  This is a very stable player with 45 seconds of antiskip protection for a CD and an incredible 140 seconds for an MP3 disc. It would take a massive earthquake to disrupt the XL-PM30. Designed with efficiency in mind, it will playback CDs for 22 hours or MP3 discs for 15 hours with alkaline batteries installed.  It comes with very comfortable headphones, which are actually a neckband with a wrap-around style and attached remote control. The headphones sound good, although the Hyper Bass provided a nice boost to the lower frequencies.  This is a very functional player that is ready for all of the best sounding formats.
