 This is my first camcorder and although I am by no means a dummy, this is making me feel a little bit like one. I immediately took it from the box and started using it. Most products I can pick up on like that, not this one. I have been looking over the owners manual and am now finding it pretty easy to operate. I purchased this to film my son and family outings. It has alot of features for video editing etc.. I will probably never use but they are there. Overall I would say it was a good purchase. The image quality is great and if you want a 4x6 still it is great for that too. The night shot is unlike Sony which is what I am used to. There is some sort of delay so when you move the camera it takes a second for the image on the screen to catch up. I don't know if that is from me not using it correctly or what. There is a built in light so you can't be sneaky with it in low light conditions. I would spend the extra money for the 20 over the 10 for the color view finder and other options. I ultimately didn't go with the Sony TRV 38 because of canon quality and recent things I have heard regarding Sony service and the lack of aftermarket support products. All in all a good camera.
