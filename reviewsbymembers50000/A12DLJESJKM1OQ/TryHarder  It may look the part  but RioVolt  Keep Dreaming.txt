 All I have to say is this is the worst player ever! My MP3 cd player kept on skipping and having a rough time playing cd music. I didn't even bother of keeping it, I just throwed it outside my window into my trash can. There is way too much negative description for this player and it is way too much that I am not going to list them.  RioVolt, if you want to try to make a better innovation for the community, then I suggest you to fix up this RioVolt SP350. Stop ripping off people money and start fixing up this MP3 CD player!
