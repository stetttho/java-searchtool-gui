 Pros: Price, 7 MP, size, functionality, and it's easy to use and comes with an excellent user manual.  Cons: 3x optical, the Set-up menu is a bit hard to use.  Summary: The Samsung Digimax A7 is a very easy to use and simple to connect to my computer. Very impressive that doesn't confuse people. It is one of the most easiest to use camera on the market. Relatively small size and a 32mb card (not the usual 16mb) as well as a rechargable battery kit which should be good for 30 pictures or about 3 minutes of movies. You can of course upgrade your card to store more pictures. Other than that, I don't have much complain about the camera.
