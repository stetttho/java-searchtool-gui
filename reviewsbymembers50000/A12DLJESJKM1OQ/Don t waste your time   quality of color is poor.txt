 Pros: Small with many feathers and good price. Cons: Bad quality of color and auto focus, Objects may have low visiblilty under low light sutiation, The Night-shot is not pratical with very slow shutter speed. I'll be the first to admit this camcorder is very stylish and the 3.5 LCD were some of the major factors why I purchased it. But when it came to crunch time, this is nothing more than a pretty package with not much substance. A typical camcorder functions,(manual, auto, night live etc) but the digital still camera is why I rated this product so low. A majority of my stills came out with a yellow tint. YELLOW!! I know not to expect much from a camcorder/digital camera but I certaintly don't want any of my pictures yellow when it shouldn't be. I know you are probably thinking it was the lighting. But it wasn't. I took pictures in all different lighting environments. And my pictures still came back with a yellowish tint. Bottom line, I had a very bad experience with this cam
