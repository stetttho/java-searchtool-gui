 Pros: This camera is compact, easy to use, has very good photo quality, inexpensive, Easy menu navigation, 3X zoom lens in relatively compact body, separate self-timer mode. Cons: The movie (video) mode has no sound, Some add ons are a must and cost more, No rechargeable battery included, fairly long shot-to-shot delay, noisy images. Summary: Just bought the A303, and I don't think I could be any happier. I have been snapping and printing shots for the past few days and it has been very easy, even for a technological nivice such as myself. The camera is small, good looking, and lightweight (7oz!). I Paid $300 before accessories, resonable for 3 megapixels. The camera basically comes with everything one would need, but for those who take a lot of shots, a larger memory card (16mb included with camera) would be necessary. I looked at many other brands. Canons were a little bit overpriced, Sonys looked good, but the accessories end up costing more than the camera. If your first time digital enthusiast like me, go for the A303, you won't be sorry!
