 As a Hugh Hewitt fan for serveral years now, this book is a really good book that illustrates the phenomenon of blogs. After receiving a limited release for his book, I am very surprise with the accurate detail he describes in the book. This book answers many question people might have been wondering, and one of them is: why so many people are now turning to 'Blogs' as sources of credible information. This book is a great book. I am very happy with Mr. Hewitt because he finally found the time to pen a thoughtful, well-documented look at the rise of the blogosphere. Mr. Hewitt is nothing, if not prolific, and we're fortunate to have a visionary thinker like Hewitt on our side. I would encourage anyone for this book who is interested in the blogosphere, and what it might look like in the future with all the "Blogs" we have today.
