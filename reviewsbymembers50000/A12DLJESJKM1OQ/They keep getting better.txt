 After receiving a advance readers copy of Kim Harrison's book, "Every Which Way But Dead," she mentions how a character Rachel made a deal with Al, a demon, where she risks all to save a thousand year old elf child, Ceri, from Al's group.  For the present, she has to deal with the effects of her other choices as her boyfriend, Nick abandons her and one of her two partners. The vampire, Kisten, does help her feelings a good bit. Ms. Harrison is basically rapidly becoming the best of the paranormal writers. She is building a world that only grows more fascinating with each new entry. I don't want to give too many details but fans of the series will not be disappointed. The characters & story lines , both new and old, are well developed. Ms. Harrison just gets better and better with each book (amazing but true).
