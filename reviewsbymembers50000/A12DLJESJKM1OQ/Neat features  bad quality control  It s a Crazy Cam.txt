 Pros: Thoughtful control layout; intuitive user interface; nifty Make-up mode; still image capture to Memory Stick; sharp LCD; optional VL-S1FL unit functions as both a video light and a flash. Cons: Questionable quality control; bottom-loading cassette; no built-in flash for shooting stills. Summary: I was sold on this camera for its size. I have tested the quality of the images against my larger Sony TRV-310. While the unit produced acceptable results I was disappointed in the color fidelity. Contrast to my Sony, the Samsung displayed muted colors lacking the depth and sharpness I have taken for granted. I must admit that the features are very good, but the image quality is not very good. Dim light shooting is not the best for this camcorder, unless you want to use night pix (greenish infrared light) The quality control is BAAAD, there were many things wrong with my camcorder when I got it, I had to send it back to the store for a refund. Price is great, but I'm now concerned about the Samsung company, continously failing over and over.
