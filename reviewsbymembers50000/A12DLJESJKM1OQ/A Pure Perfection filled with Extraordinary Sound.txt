 Pros: The best sound available in a "micro" system. Small size, elegant style. Cons: Poorly designed remote control. Summary: When I got to the store, I listened to anything in this price range and nothing came close to producing the clear, crisp sound of the Yamaha. I expected the Denon/Mission systems to be great, based on the reputation of those brands, but was quite disappointed with the flat, unremarkable sound they produced.  There was one Sony system that included a small subwoofer for about the same $400 price as the Yamaha, but it had a trendy vertical-loading CD player that didn't look as though it was made to last.  The Yamaha on the other hand, produces the beautiful sound I expected from the Denon/Mission stereos and combined it with timeless, sturdy design and construction. I am not a music aficianado, and even I was amazed at the clear superiority of the Yamaha's sound compared to anything else in the store.  When I set it up at home, I was impressed by the "screw post"  speaker connections, additional built-in AC outlet for plugging in additional components, and solid contruction quality.  The only drawback is a remote control where every button feels the same to your fingertips and nothing is spread out enough to make it easy to navigate without looking at it. After 8 months, I can now handle it fairly well, but it's about 10 years behind the remote from my old Aiwa stereo. The sound, as I've said, is beautiful. Acoustic music sounds as if it is being played right there in the room, and amplified music comes across far cleaner than I've ever heard.  The only drawback is a lack of the thumping bass you can get from less expensive systems. I've recently added a Yamaha subwoofer for $150 and it has definitely taken care of that slight drawback. Overall, a nice looking unit based on quality engineering with excellent sound reproduction, rather than trendy design.
