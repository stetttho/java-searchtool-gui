 Pros: A deep, full baritone voice that has incredible range, lush, a bit heavy on the orchestration, but not at all bad for a premiere, strong powerful voice, full, strong, beautiful baritone voice, the potential point man of quality vocalists for the next generation, he has the voice of an Angel, great lyrics, beautiful music, emotionally charged. Cons: Production could have been a little bit better, some of the background instruments spike in volume for no reason, only 13 tracks, no translations of foreign lyrics in the CD jacket
