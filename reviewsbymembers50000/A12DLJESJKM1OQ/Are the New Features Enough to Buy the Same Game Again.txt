 Pros: All of this year's new features are commendable, a remarkably enjoyable, authentic football presentation, graphics, sound, owner mode, leagues, reality of it all, some improved A.I., owner mode, add-ons, deepest Franchise mode ever, spot-on controls, playmaker, FUN!! Cons: Dry, insanely repetitive commentary, still a few key issues EA has managed to overlook, controls take the beginner a while to get accustomed to, typically stilted speech engine, horrid O-Line A.I., playing Defense is still a pain, funky-looking players, basically the same game as Madden 2003, graphics were sacrificed for substance, you can't play ownermode with a created team, playmaker feature is hard to use well, AI not always the best. I think this is a great game. I brought this game to replace my Madden 2003. The reason why I gave it a 4 star is because I really didn't find any much different from 2003. The graphics are the same, the gameplay, and the bonus materials. The only thing new to Madden 2004 is the more control over the players and a new roster/franchise mode. This is a great game if you are a huge football fan. But if you're not a football fan and in financial need to save money, then I suggest you get 2003 to save some money because there really isn't much distinctive comparison between 2003 and 2004. I hope 2005 will have a new better look then 2003/2004.
