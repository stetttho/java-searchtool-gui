 Pros: Amazing Sound, Good FM reception, Very lightweight and small, Good battery Life, superb sound quality, loaded with features, convenient joystick controller, great value Cons: No armband, ear buds not comfortable, feels rather cheap, Included software is very no-frills: no drag & drop, or re-sampling, complicated menu, flimsy chrome colored plastic, lack of beltclip, maybe a larger hard drive but 256 is good enough for me. Summary: I tested a few MP3 players and this one is the best for its size. I personally use these for when I work out and jog. This one is very small and works and sounds great. I was going to get the ipod but then I decided I rather have something smaller and less bulky. The ipod is about 4-5 times larger than this unit and heavier. Plus the ipod is very scratchable due to its shineyness. This one is more durable. Plus it comes with a neck piece so you can put it on your neck.  The ipod can hold a ton more mp3s but personally I cant even fill this one up with songs I like. And average song is 5 megs and this unit holds 256 meg. Thats an average of 51 songs (at best quality in MP3)which is 5 hours of songs that you like. To me im not going to listen to this for more than 5 hours so this is perfect. Plus it has a Radio bult in.  I was a little skeptical when I bought this product because I never herd of the company but I recommend it to anyone who wants to use this for workign out or anyone who wants somethign very lite and to listen to there mps. I suggest this unit over any other. This unit also plays WMA files which supposivly compresses better than mp3's (supposivly half the size) So you can actually fit 100+ songs on this if you compress with WMA. But personally I keep everythign mp3 so far because I havent filled this unit up yet with songs I like.
