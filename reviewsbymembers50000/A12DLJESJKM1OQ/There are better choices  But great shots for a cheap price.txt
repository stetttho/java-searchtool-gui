 Pros: Great software, panaromia mode, nice clear lcd, and quick download of pics to pc.  Cons: Some blurryness if you take pictures in motion, Battery life, and the way the lens expands.  This camera was easy to use. Tested this camera side by side with other cameras in the same price range and this one took better pictures. The included software is really easy to use. The camera has two issues. The first downfall with this camera is the batteries. BE SURE TO CARRY AN EXTRA SET OF BATTERIES AT ALL TIMES. We were changing batteries about every 40 pictures or so....which is very easy to do in a short amount of time with the "rapid fire' mode. The other downfall of this product is the media card. The media card is not compatable with our printer's (HP 2210) smart card reader ports. Even with these little issues it still is a great camera to own.
