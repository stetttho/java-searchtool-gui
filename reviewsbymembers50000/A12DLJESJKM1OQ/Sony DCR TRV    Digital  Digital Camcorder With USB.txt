 Pros: Performance for the price, features, looks Cons: Size, pricey, still picture quality, no analog inputs or backward compatibility with 8mm/Hi8 Summary: The Digital 8 camcorders uses Hi-8 tapes (you can use cheaper 8mm tapes but it is not recommended) and perform digital recording. The Digital 8 camcorders are usually backward compatible with 8mm or Hi-8 tapes - they can play your old 8mm or Hi-8 recordings.  Advantages of D8 camcorders:  1. Ability to play 8mm and Hi8 recordings - TRV140 cannot do this  2. Hi8 tapes are a little cheaper than MiniDV  3. Sony D8 camcorders are cheaper than their MiniDV camcorders with similar features  4. Even inexpensive D8 camcorders usually have analog inputs and analog-digital pass-through - TRV140 doesn't  Disadvantages:  1. D8 is not widespread and if your D8 camcorder dies or becomes obsolete, you will have to get another D8 camcorder.  2. Hi8 tapes are larger in size than MiniDV  3. MiniDV is widely supported, unlike D8. If you need to play your tape on another digital camcorder or VCR, chances are they will be MiniDV.  As you can see, two major reasons to get a Digital8 camcorder would not apply to TRV140 (you can buy TRV240, which has both 8mm/Hi8 playback and analog inputs). And the Hi8 tapes are not much cheaper than MiniDV. So the only reason would be:  You want a digital camcorder from Sony that is inexpensive.  The TRV140's main advantage is its price. But there is little sense in buying the Digital8 camcorder that lacks D8 features ...
