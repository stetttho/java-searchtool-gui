 I got this camcorder last week and it has a good optical zoom, pretty cool digital effects and the analog to digital converter feature is a plus. I've only owned the camera for a couple days and I am very impressed with what I have seen so far. The low light quality leaves a bit to be desired but overall a very good camera. The manual focus can be a bit of a struggle because of the location of the buttons. For the average user this is a great point and shoot camera DV camcorder. However, I was very dissapointed by the indoor performance. Like all the digital effects, this indoor video is very, very grainy. Since we will be using the camera mostly inside, it is worth spending a little more to get better indoor quality. We had the Sony TRV27 and returned it to buy this camera just because of the price difference. Big Mistake! The Sony took way better indoor video. Outside, they are about the same. But despite that, this camera is to take short videos and import old VHS tapes to DV and download to the computer to edit. A must try!!
