 After reading her book, "It's in his kiss," Julia Quinn describes how the father orders Gareth St. Clair to marry Mary Winthrop for money. The father is stunned because Mary may be a year older than him, but no more than just a child in her mind. He refuses to marry Mary Winthrop. Stunned, Gareth vows to learn the truth about his roots. Ten years later, Gareth finally has a clue, the diary of his Italian grandmother. He asks intelligent linguist Hyacinth Bridgerton to translate it into English for him. As they work together on the translation and interpretation, they fall in love. Readers will not be disappointed with Gareth as Julia Quinn. This book is simply amazing. She delivers under extreme pressure to find the right hero in her life. This is a perfect book for those who like to read romance stories or something different. I recommend it to anyone!!
