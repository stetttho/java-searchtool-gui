 Pros: Low price, compact, uses 2 AA batteries, good performance, image quality, build quality, it's a CANON, digital zoom is really sharp better then some 5.1 meg  Cons: Only 3.2 MP resolution, no ISO 400, no dedicated zoom control, no wide angle, battery life  Summary: Ok guys, that Canon Powershot A410 isn't a bad camera nor a good camera. There are of course better choices. But to make it short, this camera is a very good quality product that has many many good technology like the high priced one. It can record 180sec of digital movies at 640 x 480 (VGA)when you forgot to bring that digital movie camcorders on that special events.   My recommendation of this product: Please get that re-chargeable battery for 2600mAH MiMH for longer usage and upgrade to 1G Compact flash memory. It's really worth spending an extra money for this nice Canon camera.
