 Pros: Top toy with lots of great features: cameras, keyboard, voice recorder, color screen, medium-res camera, audio/video/photo capture, Wi-Fi capability, fast CPU, Metal Case, Decent camera and video, lots of software included, faster processor, Clie Launcher, Clie Memo, Small, built in keyboard, swivel screen, color screen, and an array of programs. Cons: Limited battery life, high cost, you should buy more memory to go with it, Not too much OS5 software available... yet, price, Clie Viewer, Internet, Sony's obsession with copyright protection, low memory. Summary: As you can see this product comes basically fully loaded. Yet, in my opinion the best feature is the built in keyboard. On previous PDA's to enter in information you either had to write in grafitti(which is the most annoying thing in world) or purchase an external keyboard, which is really expensive. Entering information into my Sony CLIE PEG-NX70V is so easy now, that I feel as if I have a computer right in the palm of my hand. The HOT-SYNC function on this product is the fastest and most reliable syncing that I have ever worked with. Because of the state of the art high resolution TFT screen with built in back-light, you can even look at your Sony CLIE PEG-NX70V in complete darkness or in extremely bright sunlight. There is no discoloration while using it while being outdoors. I don't suggest leaving it in the hot sun for long periods of time, though, because it will ruin the screen. I have not personally used the internet feature on my device, however, I have heard that it is the best wireless connection for any PDA. This PDA is so small that I can comfortably keep it in my pocket without any restriction in movement. All in all, I say that this product is miles ahead of any other product of its type!
