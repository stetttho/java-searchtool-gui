 Just picked up yesterday and took out last night for a run. Have been evaluating against Panasonic DV953. Comparison so far, 1) Sony TRV70 excellant in low light with very little grain in night setting, Panasonic 953 cannot be used unless highly lit object like a sign on bldg. 2) video capture is almost equal to the three chipper. 3) 2.5" lcd is smallish but i did like the touch screen which is very easy to manuver thru setting menus. Panasonic 953 has wheel but still have to use lcd or really cant make options out. however the 3.5" is nice to read and clear. 4) Panasonic 953 has more color saturation and more manual control. Althought with the manual exposure I was able to saturate also on the Sony TRV70. At this point I have not tried still function on either yet, but if you want to shoot indoor footage the Panasonic will need lots of light to avoid grainy picture where the Sony TRV 70 is at home indoors or out in auto settings. With the panasonic hard to find and the sony trv70 available @ $1,000.00 at this point you either have to leap to the over 2k price thresholdfor GL2,VX2000 or better. The sony trv70 or trv80 if you want to pop for the larger lcd may be your choice.
