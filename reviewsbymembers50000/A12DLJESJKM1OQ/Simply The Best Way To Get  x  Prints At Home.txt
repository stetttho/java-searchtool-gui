 Pros: Prints decent photos from high-resolution images; its prints are relatively inexpensive and indestructible. Cons: Can't view photos directly on printer; prints fall out of paper output tray when left unattended; noisy; doesn't run off batteries; low-resolution pictures become inferior prints. Summary: I just purchased the Sony DPP-EX5 earlier this week. I am absolutly amazed! I have been using an Epson Stylus Photo 820 inkjet printer. That printer does produce very nice photos, however, I kept running into problems with ink clogs, poor edges in borderless photos, and the speed of the printer. So, knowing that all I ever print at home for photos is 4x6 prints, I decided to give the Sony a try. I am glad I did! Dye-sublimation produces much better and longer lasting prints. I have made many comparison prints from the Epson and the Sony. Hands down the Sony wins. And that is saying a lot considering Epson's reputation for making good photo printers. I still have the Epson as my everyday printer and it works well for that. But from now on for my photos it will be the Sony. When you factor in price per print and the fact that you are only printing the digital photos you want, it is very affordable. I am useing this printer in for photos shot with my Olympus C-5050 5mp camera. I purchased the DPP-EX5 at [local store]for [$$$]. The 25 pack ink/paper packs sell there for [$$$]. Not a bad deal. One last thing. If you purchase the Sony, download the most recent driver from Sony's website if you plan to use the printer with a pc like I do. It ads a few fine tuning options not on the included CD. Despite the cons, the pros still outwheigh the cons, to me. Just buy it, you will love it!
