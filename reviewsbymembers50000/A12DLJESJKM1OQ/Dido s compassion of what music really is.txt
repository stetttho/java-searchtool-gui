 This CD Life For Rent has been in my top 5 for quite some time. The music is very easy to listen to, ranging in emotions from happy to sad and reflective. The overall mood of the CD is quite relaxed. Dido's voice itself is probably the strongest asset to the music. While the lyrics themselves are good and the arrangement is much better than most music produced in the last 10 years, it is Dido's voice itself that shapes the tones and words together into art that remakes and refreshes itself everytime it's put into the CD player.
