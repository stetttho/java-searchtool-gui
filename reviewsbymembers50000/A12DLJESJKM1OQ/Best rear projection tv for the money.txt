 Pros: Solid video processing with CineMotion 3:2 pull-down; 46-inch, 16:9, HDTV-capable rear-projector; 480p and 1080i display capability; 3D-YC comb filter; two-tuner picture-in-picture mode; relatively inexpensive.   Cons: No independent input memory; tabletop design is an awkward, in-between height; nonremovable protective screen. Summary: I have had this tv for almost 6 weeks and so far, I have never regretted buying it! The only regret is not buying it sooner! In fact, so impressed am I with the picture and the sound that I have already recommended it to a friend who is in the mkt for a new tv. After some research of his own and his own personally conducted "eye-ball" test, he came the same conclusion and purchased the set 1 wk after my recommendation. I believe the HD microfocus lens and picture tubes really work to produce a superb picture -- such that it's hard to believe that it's rear-projection and not the standart CRT which are purported to be clearer, but that in this case it's not! Also, the $3000CAD that we paid included the tv stand which makes it a great value when compared to other rptvs of this size. I watch only cable tv on this set and I am still amazed at the picture. I also watch DVDs on progressive scan and am very happy with the PERFECT picture -- which goes to show what it's capable of, given a superior signal. Overall, this a great widescreen TV.
