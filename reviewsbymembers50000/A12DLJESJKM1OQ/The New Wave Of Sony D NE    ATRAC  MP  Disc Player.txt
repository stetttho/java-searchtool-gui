 When I first starting looking at MP3 players, I was always very disappointed at how much money it was to expland your MP3 players memory. I was looking at around 100 bucks just to get about 490 music into one cd. I recently brought this wonderful player at Target and I was quite surprise it was one of the first ATRAC3 MP3 cd player. What a great idea for Sony. You get over 490 music on one cd and the cds only cost about 6 cents a piece. I've been a strong believer in sony discmans ever since the Sony D-CJ01 came out. I replace my d-cj01 to this ATRAC3/MP3, which deliever far better sound and style. Sony put their D-NE710 ATRAC3 MP3 cd player on the market and this discman really lives up to sony quality. Now you get Sony's long lasting battery life, 2 different levels or ATRAC3 and MP3 play back. The two different ATRAC3 settings give you these two choices: 1 small buffer and higher quality of music, and 2 large buffer and lower quality music. I have yet to hear the difference in the two qualities. While running the ATRAC3 proved to be better than my previous sony discmans the D-CJ01 and the DEJ62. I have yet to hear this ATRAC3 skip while playing MP3 cds. It's been dropped, dragged, smashed but the player keeps on going. One of the coolest features of the ATRAC3 cd is that the cd itself stops after about 10 seconds of spinning and doesn't start up again for another minute and a half. Making it impossible to skip during that time and also impresses your friends. Sony's ATRAC3 lets you listen to about 72 hours of normal music and about 48 hours of MP3 format music give or take depending on the batteries you are using. Rechargable batteries have significantly lower battery times. This CD player shows next generation Sony quality. I'm glad I waited for sony to come out with a ATRAC3 cd player. A must BUY!
