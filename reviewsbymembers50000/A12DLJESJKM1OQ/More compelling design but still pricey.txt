Before this I've used two Palms, the 130 and the 515. I always give my old gadgets away to family because I love keeping up with the latest.  The first thing that should strike you is the great look. This is a handsome PDA; although built with plastic, and not metal, it doesn't take away from the quality feel.  The screen is great. Way better than the Palm 130 and 515, and much better than most Power PC's I've seen. With the backlight on I'm able to utilize it non stop for about 9-10 hours, so this will last you probably about 2 weeks with average use.  The processor speed is lightening quick, I was able to move around while playing MP3's with no lag, also playing MPEG's was a great experience. With the 128 or 256 or bigger meg memory sticks you can fit a huge amount of multimedia in there.  My favorite thing about this as opposed to the Power PC is the speed with which I can just open up and use it. This is a great OS first and foremost, and doesn't have TSR's and other BS piggybacking it like the Power PC OS.
