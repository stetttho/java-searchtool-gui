 Pros: Ultra compact, five megapixels, manual exposure options, Compact, high resolution, razor sharp, bright LCD, Small, lithium ion battery/charger, picture quality, compactness, easy to use, loaded with advanced features yet point-and-shoot simple on automatic, multiple resolution options, including uncompressed TIFF, compact and light. Cons: No LCD screen cover, no AF assist light, questionable low-light capabilities, many settings, price, uses new xD picture card, Poor LCD viewing in very low light, extremely slow save for TIFFs, occasional image noise, works poorly with a tripod. Summary: I did quite a bit of research before deciding on the Olympus C50. I wanted a small digital camera that had some manual controls. The camera also had to feel sturdy and have a menu system that was intuitive for me. The C50 won out over my other choices hands down (Minolta F100 and Nikon CP4500). Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and can live with the little quirks I've read about with this camera. The remote comes in handy when displaying your pictures on TV. Also, the battery life on this little guy is quite good -- much better than the Kodak I had. Olympus could have done a better job on the printed manual. The manual on CD is much better and they should have just printed out that manual in the appropriate language for the countries they ship to.
