 After listening to his music, I must say that this is not the worst music I had ever heard before. I mean, come one, give him a break. He's asian! William Hung is just trying to do what he think is best for him. Sure, of course the music sort of sounds gay and funky, but I think we should all give him major props for him becoming one of the only Asian singer celebrity in the United States. So even though his music is crap, I am very proud of his accomplishment he had to go through in American Idol. Music should always be fun and entertaining, and not necessary enjoyable.
