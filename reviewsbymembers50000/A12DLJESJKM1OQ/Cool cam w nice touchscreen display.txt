 Pros: Excellent value, very good picture and sound, features, connections, touch-panel screen Cons: No memory card, average still picture quality, no analog inputs This is my first mini dv camcorder and I am satisfied with it. Many reviews talked about the graininess of low light, but I can say it's really good. The nightshot is abit awkward coz the color goes unnatural, but generally the video quality is good. It's not really a good advice to take those internet footage as means to judge the camcorder because the quality deterioates when it gets to computer. But it'd be fine on tv. Overall, it's value for a camcorder under a grand. Touhscreen display completely ends this one to the head of the class! Just a solid little digital cam with dedicated features in a noce package. Clearly the best of the bunch. A must try.
