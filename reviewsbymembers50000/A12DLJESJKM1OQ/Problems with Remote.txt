 The SL-CT700 is a great cd player. It plays cd-r and mp3 which is fantastic. What I was dissatisfied was the remote. The remote is so small that I couldn't even press the button to raise the volume. Also, when I brought this cd player, the remote back-lit display does NOT work. The manual book and the box clearly states that the remote light feature is avaliable for this cd player. I was so mad that I exchange it. When I got the exchange one, I went back home and tried the remote. Once again, the back-lit display does NOT work. I didn't exchange again and I kept it because I really don't care about the backlit light that much. Despite that problem, the cd player works perfectly and the sound crisp and clear.
