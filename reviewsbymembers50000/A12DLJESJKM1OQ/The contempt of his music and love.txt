 Pros: Amazing song choices highlighting with superb voice.  Cons: The only downfall is there are no translations for the lyrics. The sophomore studio CD attempt by singer Josh Groban in my opinion has far exceeded expectations by myself and many more of his fans. I bought the CD because I love his voice and I am completely intrigued with this young mans choices in music. You can be sure, when you pick it up at the music store, that you will be transported in your mind to many different places. Whether it be Italy, France, America, or in the case of You Raise Me Up to the rolling hills of Ireland! My only complaint about "Closer" is that it does not last forever! With only 13 songs, you unfortunately have to start it over at some point to continue to hear his amazing voice! My Bottom Line Not as brilliant as his first, but so much better than anything that Clay Aiken or would/could ever put out.
