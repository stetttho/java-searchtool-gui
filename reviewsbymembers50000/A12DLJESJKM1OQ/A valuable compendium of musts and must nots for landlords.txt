 After receiving a limited release for his book, I believe that this is an excellent book that will save you tons of money on taxes while avoiding bad lawsuits. I believe that this is a book for every apartment building owners, on-site managers, and property managers. It describes how to screen and choose the best tenant, write a lease and hire a trustworthy property manager. This is really a basic comprehensive reference for thos who are real estates. This should be a required text for every landlord. I treated this book as though, it was my 'Holy Bible!' It's really that good! Recommended!
