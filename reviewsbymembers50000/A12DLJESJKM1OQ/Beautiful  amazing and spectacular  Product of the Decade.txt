 Pros: Best-of-breed design and interface; excellent playlist features; clean, configurable sound; smooth syncing with both Windows PCs and Macs; organizes contacts; includes games; functions as an external drive. Cons: No FM or voice recording; line-in recording included but not enabled; no USB kit until June; battery life compromised somewhat by small size; no AAC ripping or purchasing by Windows users. The minute I openned my iPOD 15 GIG, I was so impressed with the packaging that I could not wait until I started using this marvelous product. I was up and running in about 5 minutes after a full battery charge. I brought it to work and the all of my co-workers are racing out to get one. The sound quality is great and the features are wonderful. Bite the bullet and purchase this very well designed electronic marvel. I would need several pages of text to continue to explain how great this product is.  Also, I would like to mention that the battery life is horrible and there was no FM and voice recording. But desptie that, I suggest that you hurry up, try it for yourself, and you won't look back.
