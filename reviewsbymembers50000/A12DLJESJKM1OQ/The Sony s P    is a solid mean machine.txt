 Pros: Size, Above average to excellent photos, 7MP camera, KISS camera, big pictures, fast everything speed, movies with sound. Quality rules, sharp detail, stunning color, long battery life, truly point and shot for beginner or expert.  Cons: Weak flash, lack of advanced features if you're looking for that, microphone/speaker is kind of small, exacting manual control is sacrificed to keep it small, could have included a larger Memory Stick and case.  Summary: I just got my Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-150 & I love it. It has 7.2 megapixels, so my pictures have stunning detail. The color is also excellent; even on an automatic setting. The movie mode has is excellent; with 2X the frames/seconds & 2X the resolution (I regularly record my golf swing, so this is an important feature). It's only time limitation is amount of memory (many cameras have 30 second limits). I also regularly use the mult-burst mode to take 16 pictures in ~2 seconds (also for my golf swing). In bright light, I can increase the shutter speed to 1/1,000 second to capture more high-speed detail. The Battery life is much better than my old camera (I get ~3 hours/charge). I carry my DSC-150 everywhere, so I'm capturing pictures I would have otherwise missed. I highly recommend it.  Bottom Line: It's an excellent choice for anyone who wants professional resolution & color pictures in a tiny camera.
