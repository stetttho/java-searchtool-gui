 Pros: Easy to operate; generally good video quality; strong home-video feature set. Cons: Constant low-level noise; middling low-light performance; no control over auto power-off. Summary: As noted many times before, the indoor lighting is not very good..but I expected this much from reading other reviews. But what has really bummed me out is that 3 months after purchasing the camera (with little use in that time) the camera eject refused to open. So now my cassette is stuck inside the camera. We have provided the maximum power to the camera by using the power from the wall outlet and still no tape eject. My wife contacted Canon support. They told her there are only 2 places in the country that fix Video Cameras..(yeah, ok)..and that we would have to ship back to them. According to their tech support, it sounds like an alignment problem. Sounds like I'm taking my car to the mechanic. They said they would have to get it back to the factory to re-align it. Give me a break. If you do not plan on using this camera for alot of indoor footage..and if you are lucky enough to avoid getting a CANON LEMON, such as mine..you may be okay. But my Canon experience has been horrible .regardless of whether or not the problem is covered under warranty (which it better be) I'm disappointed with my decision to choose this product.
