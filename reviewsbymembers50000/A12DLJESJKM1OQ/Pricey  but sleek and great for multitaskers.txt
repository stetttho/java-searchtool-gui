 Pros: Stylish looks; no cable clutter; lets you watch and record TV; DVD-recordable drive; loads of multimedia software;  Clear picture and features; Neat keyboard, mouse; Small compact design; Great on looks and fits into cramped spaces; Wireless; Great for small work areas.  Cons: Poor performance; expensive; not configurable; no IR blaster to control set-top TV boxes; HD too small for extensive recording in DVR; The mouse's battery dies before 2 weeks if you forget to turn it off (its hard to remember); Disappointed that it didn't come with infrared set and/or external floppy.  The bottom line: Aside from its sleek design and wealth of bundled software, there's little to recommend about the pricey and underpowered Sony VAIO V200G.
