 Pros: gameplay, definitely has to be the game play, and the SOUND, The feel of World War II's realism factor doesn't get any better but here, First Mission, WW2 Depicted Well, Incredible gameplay, unreal sound, historically accurate, excellent game, Music, a good variety of levels, good choice of authentic weapons, By far the best war game out on the Playstation 2. Realistic and gripping! Cons: frame rate, controls take a bit of getting use to because of the sensitivity, Replay Value, over-sensitive, some rendering quality, wish it was fully 5.1 format, A bit hard, Sometimes shaky aiming control, seems like TOO much fun to be healthy, What happened to Tom Hanks?, Real as this game is it would've been nice if there was some blood, Too short, not enough cinematic sequences between missions, Maybe a bit too fast paced for some, levels can get repetitive, Becomes too linear in latter stages and little replay value once completed. Overall: 4.5
