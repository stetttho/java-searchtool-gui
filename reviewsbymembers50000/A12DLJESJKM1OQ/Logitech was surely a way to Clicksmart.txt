 Pros: Quality web cam, smooth installation, software, basic off-line cam, Easy Installation. Lot of Photo Storage, Ease of use, Cheap, Makes a decent PC camera, Great webcam, lightweight. Cons: Poor quality offline pics, drains batteries almost instantly, Indoor Photos Usually Blurred, Picture quality is unreliable for realistic photos, Added light needed for decent photos, Digital pictures are a bit out of focus, automatically shuts off after 30 seconds non-use. Summary: The camera is very small and lightweight, made from a strong plastic, I admit my daughter dropped it and it was not damaged at all. I had heard nightmares about the installation process. For me, I put in the disk, it loaded perfectly and never proved to be a challenge at all. Installation took less than 5 minutes and worked fine the first time. I went through the software quickly and the program that runs the webcam/digital photo album/live video e-cards is easy to use - if you can read, you can use the program without any difficulty.  The live video feed and taping come through virtually crystal clear. For the "Creating Videos" you have three pixel size options - 160x120, 320x240, 640x480. It is as easy as setting the camera in so that your subject is in the viewer and pushing a button on the computer to tape. For Digital Pictures - you can unplug the camera and take it with you. High Resolution (352x288 pixels) allows you to take 40 pictures, Low resolution (176x144) allows 160 photos or 15 seconds of video. A timer option allows you to be in the photo as well. In Digital Camera mode you can take photos, Video or Multisnap (allows 5 photos at 1 second intervals)This camera runs on 4 aaa batteries that are not included. The Bottom Line This makes a better webcam than digital camera, but for those on a limited budget, it is by far better than not having a digital camera at all!
