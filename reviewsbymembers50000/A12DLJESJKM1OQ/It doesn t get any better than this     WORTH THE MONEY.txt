 Pros: Broad feature set for the money; speedy and efficient performance; accepts accessory lenses. Cons: Flimsy-feeling CompactFlash compartment cover; distracting reflective frame around LCD. I bought this camera because I needed a digital camera that had a good set of features without breaking the bank. This one fit the bill perfectly. Not only is Canon known for its reliable cameras, and this camera is no exception. While there are cameras out there with more features, nothing comes close to the features/value combo that this camera delivers. The pictures take so far have been great. There has been a bit of purple friging when taking high contrast photos, but I read many other types of review and knew about that. This is no big deal, however, becasue comparable camera in this feature range also suffer this problem. If this is an issue for you then don't buy this camera. Pony up and spend some more money in order to eliminate that problem. The software suite included with this camera is also decent. All in all I would say to those of you that are considering this camera to go out and buy it without hesitation. Good quality, good price, and good pictures will make you a happy photographer.
