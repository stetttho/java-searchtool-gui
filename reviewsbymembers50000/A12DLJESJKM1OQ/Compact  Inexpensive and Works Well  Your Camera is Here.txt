 I must admit that this is a very simple to shoot and easy to share Digital Camera that lets you capture eye-catching images. With this camera, I have been able to get an effective MP CCD that generates high-resolution images for up to 20" x 30" prints. The 1.6" high-resolution display lets me view brilliant, sharp pictures with ease and clarity. One thing I like is that it includes the Kodak EasyShare software, which works seamlessly with the C310 and allows you to edit, organize, print or view a slide show from your computer. Another great feature is the on-camera share button which allows me to email my pictures to my friends or print them directly to share them with my family. Along with images, I can shoot continuous video at 20 fps at resolutions of up to 320x240 pixels. Compact and lightweight, the Kodak EasyShare C310 is an ideal way to share your life's special moments. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR FIRST TIME DIGITAL CAMERA USERS!!!
