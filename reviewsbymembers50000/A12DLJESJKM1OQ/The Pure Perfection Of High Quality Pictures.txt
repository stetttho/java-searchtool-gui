 Pros: Great photos, fast, quiet, USB 2, individual ink tanks, separate print heads Cons: No direct camera connection, Manual alignment, Without the right software and paper results are average at best, Software could be more intuitive and More detailed hard copy manual Summary: I have always loved Canon products (especially their cameras and lenses)and the Canon i950 lives up to the standard I expect from them: It is sturdy, reliable, attractive and--above all--delivers exceptional performance! I searched all over to try and find the Canon s900 because of the rave reviews it was getting, only to find out that it was discontinued. I am glad that I couldn't find one! With the release of the new i950 I feel that I can meet or exceed the quality of prints that I was getting from a professional photo lab. Set up was easy. It took me about 30 min. To load and figure out the software but after a few tweaks, I was printing breathtaking 8"x10" photographs of my daughter at the beach(from film negs that I scanned). It had beautiful skin tones, sharp detail and rich color depth. I would be proud to frame these photos, hang them on the wall or give them as gifts. I defy anyone to tell them apart from standard chem. processing. It is very important to use high quality photo paper (I am sticking with the Canon Photo Paper Pro). If you are interested in setting up a digital darkroom and saving $$ on processing over the long term,look no further than the Canon i950.
