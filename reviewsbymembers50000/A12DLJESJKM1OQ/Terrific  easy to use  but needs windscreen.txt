 After months of research we chose the TRV27 but it had been replaced by the TRV33. We bought the TRV33 sight unseen Sears great price and return policy made the decision easier. This thing is great. It is as small as my Canon G2 and a third the size of my old Sony Hi-8. It's very easy to use, and very intuitive. While my brother can just point and shoot, it still allows me to do spot focusing and spot metering which if you've never used these features on a camera, you will now--it's that easy. Low light features are great--while the infrared feature is a little creepy, the slow-shutter feature lets you take cool MTV-style videos in low light with great color quality.  GOOD: features, compact size, outdoor image quality, ease of use. Little flip-cover is cool too.  BAD: lack of windscreen, LCD is very difficult to see in bright light, and the software isn't great. I didn't bother with the still photo feature, same reason why I don't make movies with my G2. Overall, this is a terrific camera and a good value, esp, if the price drops below $650 or so. Only caveat: the wind noise is really awful when filming outdoors. I have to go find a microphone to attach now.
