 After receiving a limited release of her book, this book describes how a mother works really hard to find the best journey for her child. This book happens to be a genuinely encouraging book. As a mother and a grandmother, I can tell you from experience that the 'kid who thinks outside the box' ends up with the ultimate success. Take it from me, I had my hands full with a wonderful child who was not easy, but as with the living legends in the book...my kid went on to become an exceptional success story. It's an easy read, and one that is meaningful to parents, teachers and kids. It's a basic book written by a mother who actually focusses on her child. If you want to have well-adjusted successful children that grow into well-adjusted successful adults, then you have to get this book, read it, highlight it, read it to your children when they feel down or when the going gets tough. This is an inspirational book for parents, moms and dad, and grandparents. A bible for the 21st century.
