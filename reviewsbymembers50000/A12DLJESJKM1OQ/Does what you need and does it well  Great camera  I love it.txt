 Pros: Compact and lightweight; spot metering with selectable spot area; flexible low-light features. Cons: Hard to see LCD in daylight; fairly narrow-angle lens; bottom-loading tapes; no wind filter. Summary: I purchased this camera immediately after returning a Canon ZR65MC. The problems I had with that camera were very poor quality video under normal indoor lighting conditions. With that experience fresh in mind, I tested the TRV-22 under the same conditions and found the results that I would expect from any decent digital camcorder: crisp, low-noise images far superior to those of the Canon. So to compare the two, I think the extra $90 I paid for the Sony is well worth it. I then took the camera on a mini-vacation, which is a more realistic test. I found the camera extremely easy to use - every family member was able to pick it up and start recording with no explanation. I took some video under poor lighting conditions, such as indoors on a cloudy day with a bay window as a backlight, and was very surprised later when I reviewed the footage and found that it was pretty good despite that. The final test was to capture the video to my PC using the IEEE-1394 interface. The video was captured flawlessly andthe resultant AVI is as sharp as any I've seen. To sum it up, I think I got my money's worth and then some with this camera. A digital camcorder should provide a high quality image, and this camera is the best I've ever owned. Add to that the abundance of cool features and you can't go wrong. The ONLY thing negative I can say is that the still image resolution is too low to replace a dedicated DSC. But unless you want to cough up a few more bucks for the TRV-33, you'll just have to carry two cameras like I do.
