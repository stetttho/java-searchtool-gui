 Pros:  1) Compact Size  2) 4.0 Megapixel Camera!  3) 3x Optical Zoom, 3.6x Digital Zoom  4) CompactFlash media with High Speed CompactFlash support.  5) Improved Movie Record Mode (up to 3 minutes with High Speed CompactFlash card)  6) 9 point AiAF system (Artificial Intelligence AutoFocus) (S200 has 3 point AiAF system)  7) DIGIC processor (specialized processor made by Canon specifically for digital cameras... supposedly improves camera photo quality)  8) iSAPS (Intelligent Scene Analysis based on Photographic Space) for improved camera focus and white balancing.  9) Direct printing to DPOF (Digital Print Order Format) compatible printers.  10) Accepts the original Lithium-Ion batteries of the S110 and S300 cameras.  11) Adjustable ISO settings from 50 to 400  12) Self-Timer from 2 or 10 secs  13) Continuous Shooting mode  14) Stainless Steel Casing.  15) Built-in speaker  16) FUNC button like S45/S50 PowerShots for easier navigation through camera options especially in manual mode.  17) More rounded body gives a slightly sleeker look to the S400.  Cons:  1) Short Battery Life but seemed better than S230  2) Flash is weak especially in nighttime settings with no additional lighting and at 3x zoom.  3) Additional Batteries from Canon are Expensive. J&R sells non-Canon brands for as low as $...  4) Tripod mounting now on far left side of camera (you are looking at the back of the camera  5) Minimal Accessories available for the camera  My Opinion:...I brought 3 different camera with me. The S230, S45, and the S400 up to Boston while I do a bit of sightseeing between interviews. The reasons why I brought 3 of my camera was to see which camera will have the higest quality of picture. I took photos of the Cambridge area, the Northern docks, and of Fenway with all three cameras... and of close up and group photos with my friends in the area. The fastest camera to start up was the S400. In fairly close up photos and group photos in daylight or good lighting situations, there wasn't a discernable amount of difference between the three cameras especially after printing out the photos on a photo-quality inkjet printer. I noted differences in distance shooting (landscaping photos) and low light situations. Landscape shots of the Boston Harbor captured better details especially with objects in the far background with the S400 and S45. Distant shots of Fenway captured sharper details on the S400 and S45 as well. Nighttime shots were best captured on the S45... although not by a great deal over the S230 and S400. The range of manual controls were without a doubt better on the S45 and that allowed me to take better twilight landscape photos than the other two digital cameras. The surprise was that the S400 seemed the fastest to display the picture in the LCD after the shutter button is pressed and the continuous shot modes were also considerable faster to me than the S230 and S45.
