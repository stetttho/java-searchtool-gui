 Pros: Makes transferring pictures from camera to computer a snap Cons: Have to drag it along to recharge the batteries, price Summary: By using the Kodak EasyShare Camera Dock as storage for my camera, I never have to worry about the camera getting lost in the clutter and shuffle of our house. I always know my batteries will be completely recharged before I remove it from the Kodak EasyShare Camera Dock.  When I go on an extended vacation, I can unplug the dock from my computer and take it with me to leave in my hotel room. If you chose to, you could download images to your laptop while away. In our case, I will just use it for making sure my batteries are 100% each day. In some ways this is a hassle; I can't just use a power cord to recharge the batteries off of a wall outlet.  I also feel that the price tag is somewhat high for a computer peripheral that only serves one function. However, after buying my daughter a digital camera with only a cord between the computer and camera, and seeing the hassle she has had with it, I am glad that I opted for the Kodak EasyShare Camera Dock.  If you want to download pictures with no hassle, then the Kodak EasyShare Camera Dock makes it easy. It also works with all of the cameras in Kodak's EasyShare line.  Although a bit pricey, this peripheral by Kodak makes transferring images practically foolproof.
