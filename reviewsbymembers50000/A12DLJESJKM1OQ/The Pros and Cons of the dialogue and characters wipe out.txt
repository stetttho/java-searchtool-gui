 Pros: Michelle Rodriguez, Sanoe Lake, some killer surf sequences, Beautiful people, beautiful cinematography, fun, humorous, interesting, brilliantly shot, good cast, refreshing ending, great story, nice subplots, an easygoing sense of exuberance, inspiring in-the-wave sequences, one feels he or she is actually THERE, formulaic plotting and drama, original location/setting in Hawaii, attractive women with goals other that being attractive, Cons: The romance, the little sister, time taken away from actual surfing, story dwells too much on failure and loses steam on land, familiar territory, some corny teen events, more time on land than on the water, some of the acting is pretty bad, occasioanl cliches and underdeveloped characters, not enough actual surfing, unfathomable romance, predictable moral-of-the-story, lack of originality and plot, middle drags on, no story line, and the sex scenes took away from the movie
