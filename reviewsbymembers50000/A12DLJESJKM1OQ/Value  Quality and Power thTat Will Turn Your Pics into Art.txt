 Pros: Larger LCD screen with enhanced resolution, loads of manual/creative photography options, AA Batteries, terrific ergonimics, outstanding picture quality, versatile controls, Price vs. Features/Quality is unbeatable.   Cons: Some minor chromatic aberration (purple fringing) and very high noise levels at ISO 400, no RAW mode, the camera eats batteries (with LCD use); included flashcard is too small for enthusiasts.  Summary: The A95's 3X lens exhibits some minor barrel distortion at the wide-angle end of the zoom range, but no visible pincushion distortion at the telephoto end. There is also some noticeable chromatic aberration in high contrast color transition areas, but that is pretty much par for the course with all digicam zooms. My only real complaint with the A95 is the horrible noise levels at ISO 400, noticeably worse than the noise levels of the A80 at ISO 400. My friend says he's heard that the A95 has significant redeye problems, but we didn't shoot any portraits and only used the flash in fill mode so I can't address this issue. Basically, the A95 is a truly worthy successor to the nifty little A80. At this point in time, the A95 is an almost ideal digital camera, so if you've been searching a "does it all" general use five megapixel digital camera, the A95 is probably your best option.
