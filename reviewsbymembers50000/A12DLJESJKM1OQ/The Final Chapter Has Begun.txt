 Woo-hoo...after looking at this, I feel so hyped up of the new release of 'Roswell Season 3' on DVD. I've been waiting for  this release for soo long, and it's finally going to happen on August 9, 2005. All I know is that the collectible five-disc box set includes all 18 episodes from the third and final season of the cult television phenomenon, following the alien trio and their handful of loyal human friends as the Air Force and FBI close in. The main cast of season 3 is Max, Isabel and Michael. As they prepare to leave Roswell behind, Liz has a shocking vision which makes everyone realize that it is not only the aliens who are in danger but their human friends as well. Some bonus material includes select episode commentaries, "Class of 2002" featurette, "Shiri Appleby's DVD Tour to Japan" featurette and new cutting-edge songs selected by the original Roswell music team. All I know is that we can preorder it on Amazon beginning July 13, 2005 for $59.98. Anyways, I can't wait!!! Let the journey continue....
