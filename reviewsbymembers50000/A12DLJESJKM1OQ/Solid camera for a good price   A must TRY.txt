 After searching for months and reading many reports I purchased the Sony DSC-P72. The camera was a snap to use for this first time digital owner. Menu is excellent, focus does a terrific job, and the download to my computer was instint. Picture quality after I enlarged to 12 by 14 was superb. Sony supplies you with ni-mh batteries and charger, plus can use regular AA batteries.With Optical zoom, 3.2 megapixels, charger the $329.00 was normal but with sony quality. Memory stick media is getting cheap too, I purchased 128 m for $40.00 and 256 is available. I don't need more functions or 4 or 5 meg after using this camera!  I also compared with our Canon A-70 to her Sony P-72 and I still love my A-70 though. Her P-72 was the same price and takes great shots as well. It just lacks manual aperature control and shutter control against the A70's ability to do so. However, the P-72 takes sweet shots too for the person who just wants the camera to do all of the work. Sony is top quality as well. But hey, this is a camera, not a camcorder! What are you waiting for? Get it now!
