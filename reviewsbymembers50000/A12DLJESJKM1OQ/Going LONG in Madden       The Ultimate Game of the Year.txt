 After playing the game from a friend of mines at the EA Sports studio, I must admit that this is one of the best football game ever made in history. The changes of the game from Madden 2005 to Madden 2006 has significantly improved; however, the changes are not that extensive. The only thing new in Madden 2006 are the improvement in hand, new roster, new and better music, improved graphics, better gameplan and playbook, more action on offense and defense, formation specific audibles, better tackles, import players from NCAA Football and NFL STREET 2 player into NFL Superstar Mode, brand new Superstar Mode single player game, and the biggest new thing is the 'QB vision' - which allows the player to have better awareness and vision to pass the ball. Basically, go get this game because you will enjoy playing this game with your friends, families, or colleagues. Would definitely recommend!!! Overall, 9.5/10 = A!!!
