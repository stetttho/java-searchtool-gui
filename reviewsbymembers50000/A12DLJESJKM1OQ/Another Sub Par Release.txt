 Pros: - Few moments of true excitement ("Remember When It Rained")  Cons: - Arena rock atmosphere definitely not appropriate  Summary: After his debut CD and initial live CD/DVD, I was expecting better things from Josh Groban... perhaps some more refining of his voice and interpretations, perhaps more strengthening of his high notes, and the continuation of suitable material to perform. But "Closer" was a wrong turn due to lack of compelling songs and an often unfocused vocal delivery... and now we have "Live at the Greek", a second DVD live recording which for me, is about 3 steps backwards from his first concert DVD.   The people who manage Josh Groban should understand exactly which musical setting best showcases his unique abilities. It seems to me he is best suited to medium-sized intimate type theaters. The quieter the better... a calm and intimate setting where the music can breathe naturally. It's in this kind of close atmosphere where he can really create some vocal magic few other pop singers today can manage. Refer to his first live DVD, this is the right type of setting in every sense.   Instead, The Greek is an open air theater and was filled with some loud instrumentation (common for this venue)... I noticed right away from the first few sung notes of "Oceano" that Groban had adjusted his delivery and geared it more towards power instead of gracefulness. It gave me an uneasy feeling that Groban was going to fight to be heard above both the symphony instrument section and electric amps. Groban's voice has many good natural qualites, but strength and power are not among them. Once above a certain level, he must squeeze and strain his voice for more volume and compromise his sound. In the studio he can disguise this a bit, but not live.   Basically, if this is the first time listening to Josh Groban, go back to the first live DVD for a better representation of Josh Groban than this one.
