 As a newbie video enthusiast, I'm really pleased with the TRV38. For under $1000, you get a great camera with a bunch of features. I just bought mine, so I'm still playing around with it to see what it can do. From what I can tell, the image quality is pretty good indoors, but when you get into lower light levels (like a dim room) the image seems to turn a little on the gray side. Out of the box, the camera feels good in the hand with most of the essentials at your fingertips. There are two features I'm not too fond of with the TRV38. One is the bottom-loading tape. If you're using a tripod, changing tapes can be annoying. The other item is the touch screen. It seems durable enough right now, but how will it stand up over time? it would be nice if there was a stylist (like a PDA) to help reduce the wear grubby fingers can have on the screen. Other than those two things, I'm really happy with the camera
