 Pros: Adaptiq automated system setup; exquisitely tiny sats; curvy receiver/DVD player; multiroom capability; point-anywhere, radio-frequency remote. Cons: Expensive; bass-heavy sound; no progressive-scan video outputs. Summary: For those with limited space this is a fair system. But, there are clearly better choices available; Onkyo, Klipsch, and Paradigm, to name a few. But, if you must have a Bose, Dont forget the "tiny cubes" need to be accompanied by a rather imposing "BASE UNIT". Bose calles it "non-localized", I call it BOOMY. This channel separation should make for good delivery of highs and lows. But it is the lows that stand out. Boy do they stand out! The LS35 produces a rather muddy sound. This system also lacks progressive scan, a common feature even on far less pricey systems. Yeah, I know, Bose speakers are found in high-end automobiles, etc. But, the reality is, Bose sound reproduction is not the best available. After all, when is the last time someone was bragging about their "Klipsch system". Think, listen, and you just might realize that you can get alot more for alot less $$$$. Unless, of course, image is of the utmost importance to you in making a purchasing decision.
