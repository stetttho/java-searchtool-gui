 Pros: Good cinematography, competent acting, script, ending, plot twist, smart, Katie, Zooey, the music, underlying intelligence, Strong performances by all involved and some very exotic directing, Hot guy, Oh My God! Chris Hunnam is gorgeous! Cons: The ending is expected and many characters/plot points convoluted, slow, tame, Only Katie Holmes, the detective, and the old boyfriend seem rooted in the story, No Plot, Really not that easy to get it into. Summary: Abandon is a poor excuse for someone who is trying to make a movie scary. The story line tries so hard to be scary with dark scenes and mystery but it just doesn't cut it. It does although have a few good twists and a little humor that makes Abandon slightly bearable. I found dissatisfying about this movie was Katie's character. I found that Katie Holmes is a good actress but no person can act well when their character is severely undeveloped. Katie seemed not to have any deep thoughts through out the whole movie. She seemed to rely on everyone else to do her dirty work for her. The main thing I didn't like about Abandon was the fact that it had many scenes that were trying to be dark and mysterious. However there were so many that it just wasn't scary anymore. As well, Embry was rather dark and mysterious himself so you really only expect that he would like dark places. All in all I didn't like this movie. The characters were undeveloped as well as the plot and it just wasn't scary even if it was trying to be. I encourage you not to spend your money on it and not to get abandon to this movie.
