 Pros: Fast processor; built-in keyboard, Bluetooth, and 2-megapixel camera with flash; large, sharp display; removable battery; precise battery meter. Cons: Bulky; camera is slow to start up and shut down; no built-in Wi-Fi. Summary: Sony's NZ90 is significant not because it's going to be the world's greatest handheld (though it might be) but because it raises the bar. A built-in 2 megapixel camera with flash, Bluetooth, mpeg movie record and playback, MP3 playback, voice recorder--these obviously are way beyond the basic to-do list/address book/calendar. If you buy an MP3 player, a 2MP camera, a voice recorder, and a color PDA, you may very well spend [a lot of money]. Having it all in one is nice. Sony's not perfect; they need to kick the memory stick habit and support CF/SD cards, which are much cheaper and more versatile. As others point out, the onboard RAM seems a bit stingy, though PalmOS doesn't require as much as PPC. Anyway, I'm excited to see this happening and I hope a bunch of other companies copy Sony. Competition is good for everyone!
