 Pros: Real 24P at an affordable price for serious videographers; produces filmic look; professional controls; phantom power and two-channel audio control. Cons: High-contrast artifacting; noisy zoom and autofocus mechanisms; lack of gain adjustment and autofocus in progressive mode; only 10X optical zoom. Summary: I just got the camera two weeks ago. It is my baby. I have already shot a short film and it looks darn near close to film. There are so many tricks this camera has it is insane. I love it way better than the XL1 or the Xl1s' frame movie mode. This is the ultimate DV camera. It's pixelation is 410,000, the Xl1s only has 210,000. You do the math.  What I didn't like was after using this camera and trying to edit the finished material I found that there were flash frames on edit points. The problem comes from the camera converting 24fps to 60 field which is what your data is when its put to a non linear to edit. Whats wrong with this camera is its trying to ride the 24p/1080 excitement that Sony's created with the HDCam product. This is not at all the same although some advertising is eluding to it. But other than that, it is a must try!!!
