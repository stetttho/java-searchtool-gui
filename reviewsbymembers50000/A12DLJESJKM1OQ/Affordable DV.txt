 Straightforward camera that gets the job done. Great value. USEABILITY: Slight downside on ergonomics. The layout with the screen on the back is useable, but a bit akward. You have to use the same finger (R thumb) for both zooming and rec/stop. More importantly, you generally have to use two hands, unlike the typical one-handed strap designs on most cams. So don't expect to use it while bike riding unless you like to ride no hands. STILLS: The still capability is cool but don't expect to use it for more than email-grade snapshots. DV cams are designed for motion, and the resolution on most is generally only around 0.3 megapixels. BATTERY: As with many cams, the supplied battery is small, so I purchased an OEM double-capacity ... The VL-NZ150 and 155 come with an extra battery (double-capacity). I am happy with the VL-NZ105 and am satisfied that it was a good value.
