 Pros: Light weight, large LCD, many extras, fast focus and negligible shutter lag, wonderful picture quality, auto-lens-cover, SCHNEIDER-KREUZNACH VARIOGON lens, fabulous color, excellent detail, price, built in memory,video, sound, great low light photos.  Cons: NO neck strap, NO image stabilization, NO web cam features, would be great if it had a manual zoom in lens  Summary: I must admit that the Kidak EasyShare Z730 is really designed for "zoom seeking" picture takers. With the advance features and outstanding performance, I have been able to get in-depth close up shots that is mind-blowing and impressive. The professional quality Schneider-Kreuznach Variogon 4X optical zoom lens (33-132 mm equivalent) allows me to have a greater photography experimentation than with a comparable 3X optical zoom. In additional, I really enjoyed the 2.2-inch high-resolution LCD screen that can be used to preview and instantly review shots. The auto-focus also delivers a rapid click-to-capture that precisely freezes action at a desired moment. The best part is how quickly I can print a Kodak 4 x 6-inch picture with just one touch in less than 90 seconds using my new Kodak EasyShare Printer Dock Series 3. This version is the first to support the new IMAGELINK print system that allows any cameras to print pictures. Other than that, this is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR FIRST TIME USERS!!!
