 Pros: Starts well, ends decently, the middle, though, is a big mess, Kiefer Sutherland, Penny Johnson, Dennis Haysbert, Sarah Clarke, and maybe Elisha Cuthbert, Amazing show, Beautiful Audio/Video transfer, Highly suspenseful, intelligent, and engrossing show. The acting and writing are both terrific. Novel idea, suspenseful plot with interesting and realistic characters, beautiful transfer, sound. Cons: Loses focus, badly cast supporting roles, not enough ideas to go around, Plot holes and side tracks! I want Alberta Green BACK in this series, Could have had more extra's, A few stumbles, complete lack of extras is frustrating, no chapter searches within episodes, the time laps seems impossible such as jack and many characters doing many things in 1 hour, which is impossible in our real society today. Overall, I would give it a 4.5!
