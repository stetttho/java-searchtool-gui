 This is no boring, run-of-the-mill theology book, it is an eye-opening look at what makes Christianity such a beautiful religion.  A religion of peace and comfort that has affected millions of lives over the centuries.  Luther's life was so amazingly simple and yet his thoughts so complex!  His theology was for the layman and not for the theologian.  Easy-to-understand with practical applications, this book is a must-read for anyone who loves the Christian faith.
