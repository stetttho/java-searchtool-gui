 The Bataan Death March left very few survivors, but the ones it did leave, like this author, were strong, brave heroes!  The author shares the heartaches of war along with the joys of returning home to family and friends whose prayers were answered.  I'm so glad I have this book, it is a genuine treasure trove of inspiration!  God bless the memory of every man, woman, and child who suffered the horrors of World War II.  We are indebted to them for their wisdom and their courage.
