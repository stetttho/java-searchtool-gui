 I like Thomas Moore's work, but find him difficult and sometimes impossible to follow.  He rambles about things that are not connected to his subject.  He has much to say but doesn't always say it succinctly.  He floats from idea to idea without any real practical application for daily life, at least for this average Jane.  This is definetly not one of Moore's better works.
