 In high school we were required to read a small book of Rossetti's poems.  All I can say is that from the first page I was hooked and fell in love with this woman's classic work!  She weaves images, ideas, deep spirituality, and drama like a spider weaves webs.  Her skill was sharp and prolific, my only regret is that she did not write more poetry, for she was extraordinarily gifted.
