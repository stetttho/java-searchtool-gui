 I am a great fan of Hopkins.  His work touches not merely the intellect, but the soul with its depth of insight and tenderness.  There is a richness to his work that many of the poets who were his contemporaries lacked.  There is faith, hope, love, and a respect for the universe and its Creator.  Another beautiful Penguin Classic collection.  Every library personal and public should have a copy.
