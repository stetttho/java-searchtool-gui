 I could not put this book down and am happy to report that it is one of the finest books about Russia ever written.  No details, no personalities were left unexplored by this incredibly talented author.  The ideas I had of the USSR were sharpened and some of the myths I had believed dispelled.  An extraordinary historical work!
