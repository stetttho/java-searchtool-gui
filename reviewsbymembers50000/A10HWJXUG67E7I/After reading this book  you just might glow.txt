 I had to come down off of the mountain after reading this book!  The spiritual high that it produced was nothing shy of immaculate.  I was so impressed with this woman's perspective on the Christian life, especially coming from the Atheistic background that she did.  One would not expect such enlightened 'Christian' thoughts from a woman who at one time, hated all things religious.  This book changed my outlook on a number of issues and really touched me.  I recommend it to anyone who wants a fresh new look at the 10 Commandments.  Beautiful, bold, and truly as classic as anything her husband, C.S. Lewis wrote.
