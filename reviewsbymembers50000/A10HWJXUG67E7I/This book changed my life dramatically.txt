 I have never read a Christian book that so intimately showed me the path to peace.  R.T. Kendall touched my heart and my life so deeply when he reminded me, through his book, that the life of every believer is lived by FAITH and faith alone.  It is in believing God that we find direction and fulfillment.  A better book about this life-changing subject would be hard to find.
