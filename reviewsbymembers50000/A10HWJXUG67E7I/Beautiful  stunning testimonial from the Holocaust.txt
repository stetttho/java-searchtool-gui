 This book will touch your heart and shock you at the same time!  The young man survived to tell his story and an amazing story it is.  I could not put this book down and was moved to tears at one point.  The atrocites of the Holocaust have been well-documented and it is humbling to realize that most Germans thought of themselves as "modern, respectable" citizens while gassing, torturing, and executing Jews.  A beautifully written, astonishing book!
