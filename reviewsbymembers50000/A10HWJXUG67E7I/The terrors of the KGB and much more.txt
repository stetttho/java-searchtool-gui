 This book is an excellent expose of the terrors and tortures of the Russian KGB.  One marvels at their tenacity, brutality, and animal-like ruthlessness in hunting down their prey.  Prey that included innocent and harmless religious groups, student groups, and just about anyone who disagreed with the Communist Ideology.  America could learn much from the terrible living history of Russia.  Americans have adopted similar tactics in dealing with those who disagree with the politically correct movements of our day.  These are scary times we live in, and Russia should be a lesson to us all.
