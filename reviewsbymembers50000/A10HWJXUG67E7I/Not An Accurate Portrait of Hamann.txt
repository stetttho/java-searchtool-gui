 Read the delightful and uplifting book about J.G. Hamann called, "J.G. Hamann: A Study in Christian Existentialism" written by Ronald Gregor Smith.  It shows the real man behind the mystery and the beauty of his faith in Christ.  This book is not worth the time or struggle to get through the author's most lengthy discourse about absurd and ludicrous associations between what Hamann wrote and the Nazi oppressors!
