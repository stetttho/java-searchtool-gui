 I love to read books about real-life EMT's.  This book was more like a history lesson on the Emergency Medical System.  Boring!  I don't want the hisoriography of the entire profession, any textbook can give me that!  I want a close-up look at the lives of the men and women who work in the field.  This book was fairly tedious and predictable.  Nothing like some of the more exciting EMS books on the market.  Be sure and read "Emergency!" which is much more interesting than "Into the Breach."
