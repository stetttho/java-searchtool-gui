 Solzhenitsyn is an extraordinary man of courage, depth, and insight!  This book is his all-time best and will challenge every mortal with his look at the horrors and brutality of Communism.  A better book on the state of Russia from 1918-1956 has ever been written-period!  This book takes time and patience to get through but it is well worth the effort.  If you are interested in the history of Russian Communism, seen through the eyes of a staunch-supporter-political-prisoner-turned-dissident, then this is the book for you!  You will not regret reading this amazing, extraordinary, fascinating, heart-breaking book.  It has all the elements of the world's greatest novel but it is FACT!
