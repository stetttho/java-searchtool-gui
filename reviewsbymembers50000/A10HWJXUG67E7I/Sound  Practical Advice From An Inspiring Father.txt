 If James Dobson's kids are any example of the kind of father he preaches about, then he truly practices his religion.  His Strong Willed Child changed the way I parented my children and they have turned out beautifully!  His children have done remarkably well and are living testaments to his credibility.  I know a woman who used to work for Dr. Dobson and she said that he is a truly humble, comical, and compassionate man.  I believe that and I believe what he writes about strong-willed children can change the way some parents deal with tough kids.  Dr. Dobson isn't perfect (what parent is?!) but he sure gives practical, user-friendly advice and ideas about parenting difficult children.
