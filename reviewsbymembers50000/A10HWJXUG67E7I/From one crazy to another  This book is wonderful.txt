 I have so often experienced some of the feelings, thoughts, and ideas that Nola and her brother Robin Hemley share in this touching book.  Robin shows us sides of her that are at turns comical, beautiful, and eventaully tragic.  She was a beautiful person who died young, but should not be forgotten.  Her memory will live on in this powerful and penetrating biography.
