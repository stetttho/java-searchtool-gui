 I give this book 4 stars due to its extraordinary characters and great ideas.  However, it is not the 'greatest' mystery ever, I think there are so many other books in this genre that are even better.  Wilkie Collins was a bit long-winded, as many mystery writers are apt to be, but he excelled in creating an unforgettable, haunting story.
