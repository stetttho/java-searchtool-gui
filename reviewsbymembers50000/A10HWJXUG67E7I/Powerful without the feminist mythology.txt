 I'm a woman and I'm all for female heroines, but so many of Joan's biographers err on the side of feminism.  John Beevers does not.  He shows her as a real, solid, Christ-centered young lady who led a nation in a time of peril.  She was called for a specific purpose and this book gives the most realistic, unfabricated version of her life.  One of the best biographies I have ever read.  I couldn't put it down!
