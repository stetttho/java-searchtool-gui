 This woman's writing and life are so incredibly powerful and uplifting, it is a shame that her books are no longer in print.  I own her entire collection and can't imagine not having them to pore over from time to time as a reminder of God's majestic power and grace.  Glaphre is awesome and will touch you in dramatic and fresh ways with her unique experience of God's leading hand.
