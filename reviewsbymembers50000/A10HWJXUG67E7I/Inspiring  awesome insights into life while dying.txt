 A beautiful book full of spiritual and emotional suprises.  While Noll was dying he found strength and support in places he would not have looked to before.  He starts out quite sarcastic about his bladder cancer but ends up with an open heart and an open mind.  I was deeply touched and challenged by this delightful book.
