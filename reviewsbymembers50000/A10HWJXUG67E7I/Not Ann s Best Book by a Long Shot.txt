 I love Ann Rule, but this book does not showcase her talents.  It is rather lifeless, dull, and far too easy to put down after a few pages.  I just couldn't get interested in these musty old cases.  I'm sure they were newsworthy in their day, but they make for boring reading in this volume.  Read some of Ann's earlier works, they are much more rewarding than this one.  Sorry, Ann.
