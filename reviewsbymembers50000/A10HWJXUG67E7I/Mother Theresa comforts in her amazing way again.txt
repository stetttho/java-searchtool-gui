 I never tire of hearing the words of Mother Theresa and hearing them on this audio book was like being touched by God himself.  This little bitty woman touched so many in her life.  One has to fight the tears when listening to her stories and true life accounts of suffering.  Yet, in the suffering she always points to the Cross of Jesus and the love of God.  The Hope of God never ceases in those who come to him.  She offers this hope to all who listen.  A beautifully-written, compassionate, and endearing book.  The author of this book brings Mother Theresa's words to life!
