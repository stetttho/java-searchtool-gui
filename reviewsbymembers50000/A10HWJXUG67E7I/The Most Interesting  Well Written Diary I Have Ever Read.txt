 I have always been a big fan of C.S. Lewis and this book is just one more glorious example of his skill and his intuitive writing.  In fact, his diary gives us a clear picture of the man he was, and the man God was to make of him in later years.  God's gifts are irrevocable and this book is a testament to that reality.  C.S. Lewis was given an amazing talent to write and in his diary I can see the shaping of his mind and his heart, long before he professed to be a Christian.  There is something so humble and unassuming about Mr. Lewis' writings.  He was, in essence, a very simple man who led a complex mental life.  I finished this book with a sense of amazement at the grace of God, who used an atheist to give the world a clearer picture of Christianity and all that it stands for.  C.S. Lewis' words are always encouraging, even in his days as an unbeliever, he still managed to write reflectively and with an imcomparable sincerity.  This book/diary is worth its weight in gold!
