 The author has a fantastic ability to draw us into the lives of some of America's most destitute workers.  He is very passionate about understanding their plight and offering them hope.  Unfortunately, his plan of hope is to engage the government to place even more restrictions on private industry and tax them more than ever before.  How in the world is that going to help things?  That is exactly why so many of our jobs are leaving this country and heading to Asia, Europe, and even Africa.  Companies cannot afford the enormous taxes and restrictions, certainly they can afford to pay American workers more than $6-7 per hour, but only if they are not required to meet every federal and state standard that's out there!  Good book but the author forgets that companies are trying to make a profit in a society that punishes the rich and robs the poor.  I have never earned more than $6 an hour, and though I hate this, I don't blame individual companies for it, I blame too much government involvement in the private affairs of businesses nationwide!
