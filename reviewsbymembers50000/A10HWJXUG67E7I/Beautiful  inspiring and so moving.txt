 Your life will be changed if you read this book from cover to cover.  My husband and I read it and cried, laughed, and fell in love with Pastor Wurmbrand (now deceased).  What a powerful ministry he and his wife, Sabina had on this earth!  The Communists were powerful enemies but not as powerful as Christ's redeeming love!  Wonderful little book, I have read it time and again and refer to it often for inspiration.
