 Blakelock's life is beautifully portrayed in all its glory, madness, and sadness.  There is something so haunting about this biography, it leaves one feeling very sorry for this poor man.  I had never heard of Blakelock but now have a deeper respect for his work, and more importantly his shattered life.
