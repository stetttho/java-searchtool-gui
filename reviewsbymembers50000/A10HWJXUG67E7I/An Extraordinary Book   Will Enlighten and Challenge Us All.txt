 I could not put this book down.  The author explores the various sides, themes, and politics of the Balkan crisis.  No voice is silenced but all voices are given time to speak.  It is fair, accurate, and unbiased in its look at the terrible crimes perpetrated on the Bosnian people.  Beautifully written and full of compassionate insights.
