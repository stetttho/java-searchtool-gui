 This book touched me in ways I had not anticipated!  The author brings Solzhenitsyn's life to the lay man in easy-to-understand terminology and fascinating facts.  I could not put this very thick book down; from the moment I got it I was enthralled.  The rich characters and cultural reflections given in this book are enough to make any Russian history buff salivate!  I was inspired and truly blessed by this amazing biography.
