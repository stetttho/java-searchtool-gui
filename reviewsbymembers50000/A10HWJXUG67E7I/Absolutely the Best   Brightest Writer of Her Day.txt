 Mme. Guyon's spiritual writings are simple, clear, and beautifully Christ-like.  Filled with love and faith, she wrote things that so many of the Christian leaders of her day failed to see or understand.  Hers is a voice for Christians today, Protestant and Catholic alike!  She loved Jesus with a passion and it flows from her pen and from her heart.  This book is a classic that should be read by anyone interested in the life of faith.
