 I read this book with amazement at the suffering the Jewish doctors, in particular dermatologists.  This book is written beautifully, almost like a poem.  There is no over-dramatization of what actually happened.  The story of these doctors is dramatic in and of itself.  No embellisments here, just unadulterated history.  An eye-opening, heart-wrenching book.
