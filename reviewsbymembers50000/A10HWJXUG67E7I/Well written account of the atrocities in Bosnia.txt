 I couldn't put this book down.  Every page, every line tells the truth behind the Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian conflict.  All wars are complex and difficult to comprehend but Mr. Cohen helps us understand what happened just a few years ago.  An accurate and eye-opening account.  Some of the atrocities committed are so heinous, so vile as to bring us right back to images of the Third Reich.  This is a very important work by a man who knows what he is talking about.
