 This book helped me to realize my potential in simple areas rather than always striving to do the impossible every day and never achieving anything.  It is far better to do one thing very well than to do a thousands things haplessly.  This book's message is simple, direct, and very practical.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a strong motivational book that does not place unrealistic demands on the reader.
