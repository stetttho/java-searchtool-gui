 As usual, Philip Yancey explores the issue of church worship in detail.  He boldly surveys the subjects of corporate worship, fellowship, rejection, acceptance, Biblical studies, etc.  He is one of the best Christian writers of this generation and continues to amaze me with his profound and prolific insights.  A very interesting book to say the least.
