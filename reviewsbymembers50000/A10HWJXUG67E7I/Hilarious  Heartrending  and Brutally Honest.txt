 I loved this book better than all the cop story books I've ever read because Officer Hunter keeps it simple and direct.  His old fashioned values, positive attitude towards people, and terrific sense of humor make this book a fantastic and easy read. Hunter has a way of grabbing your heart and making you think about life in a new way.
