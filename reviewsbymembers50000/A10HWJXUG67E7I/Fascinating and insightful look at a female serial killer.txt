 Schechter is one of the best true crime writers of our generation, along with Ann Rule.  He lacks emotional depth, however, and for this I give this book 4 stars instead of 5.  He is an awesome writer to be sure, but he doesn't "get inside the heads of his murderous characters" as other true crime writers do.  I wish he would, then his writing would be absolutlely perfect!
