 I realized how lacking in trust my Christian faith was until I read this book and began truly practicing the presence of God.  The remedy for every anxiety is contained in the Bible and this book.  As an anxious person by nature, I was calmed, comforted, and encouraged by this book. I own a copy and refer to it weekly for strength, insight, and reminders that God loves us deeply and wishes to be united with us at all times, in all the tasks we are obligated to fulfill.  Nothing is too small for the Lord and our time is made holy when it is spent communing with Him and His people.
