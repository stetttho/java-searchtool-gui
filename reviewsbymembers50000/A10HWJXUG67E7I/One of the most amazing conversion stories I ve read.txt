 This man was a thief of the worst kind, a prisoner for much of his youth and adult years, and yet God reached into his heart and changed him.  I recently read the book and was moved by his heartfelt, and extremely well-written biography.  He writes like a poet, not a prisoner!  You can read this small volume in one sitting due to its brevity.  It is short on pages, long on inspiration!  One of the most fantastic Christian bios I've read in years!
