 I could not put this book down there was so much wisdom packed in it's pages! Every famous writer or preacher who ever lived seems to show up in this handy book. Sermons from Martin Luther, C.S. Lewis, Jonathon Edwards, and many, many more! The subjects are broad and interesting, and the collective knowledge of these saints is useful in our own turbulent times. A fabulous reference book for pastors, teachers, and laymen!
