 This book should not be listed among 'Christian' books as it is clearly not of Christ.  The theology of the book stems not even from Quakerism but of Universalism which teaches that God will save all men, even the devil himself at the end of time.  Madeline L'Engel and authors like this have fashioned for themselves a happy, grandfather-in-the-sky who only wants all men to have a good time and feel good about themselves while they are doing whatever it is that pleases them.    According to this controversial book, Jesus' teaching on hell is essentially 'fire-and-brimstone fundamentalist doctrine' fit for the crap pile.  It is sad to think that they are searching for the God who is made in their own image rather than the one revealed in the Bible and the Torah.  This book is not original as men have always hated God and His Perfect Mediator.
