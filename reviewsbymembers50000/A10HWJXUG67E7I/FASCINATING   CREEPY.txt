 I couldn't put this book down.  It is a must read for anyone interested in science, death, anatomy, or just the bizarre aspects of decomposition!  Really interesting stuff in here and the writer is at turns witty, serious, and altogether a prolific story-teller.  A definite favorite in my own collection of books to read and re-read.  GREAT!
