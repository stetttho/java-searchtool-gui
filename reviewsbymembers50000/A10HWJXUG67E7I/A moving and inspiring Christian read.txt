 I read this book when I was a teenager and it changed my Christian life; it sharpened the things of the Spirit and gave me a perspective that focuses on service to others for the Kingdom of Christ.  Hudson Taylor and his wife were humble vessels in God's hands and their lives were glorious testimonies to Christ's grace, mercy, and love.  A profoundly moving little book!
