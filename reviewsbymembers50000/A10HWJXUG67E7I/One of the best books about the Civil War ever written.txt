 This book is so engrossing that I hated putting it down in order to go to sleep!  The author is an absolute expert on the undoing of America that led to the bloody and tragic Civil War.  He writes imaginatively about a factual event.  There is no hogwash or political correctness in this volume, just the facts plain and simple.  Beautiful book that should be required reading for anyone taking American History or interested in the subject.
