 The author shows a conversation that might have occurred between the two religious leaders.  Of course Buddhists will not like the deep Christian convictions of Zacharias, but that is to be expected.

We are all protective of our religion, and Zacharias is showing Christianity as the truth that it is in a world that says many paths to God are possible.
