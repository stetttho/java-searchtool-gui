 I could not put this book down.  The poor were fairly and honestly represented and the author treats them with such dignity and kindness.  One is hard pressed to find any fault with a man or woman who ministers to the poor.  They are often a light to us and Mother Theresa made this blatantly clear through her life and work among them.  A magnificent text; worth reading and worth living!
