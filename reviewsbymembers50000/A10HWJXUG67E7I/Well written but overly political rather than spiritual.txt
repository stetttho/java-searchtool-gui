 The Booths were certainly a very interesting social couple during the mid to late 1800's.  The things that they did to reform the church were noteworthy, but not always positive.  However, the legacy of the Salvation Army deserves the respectful and compassionate overview.  The author does wax political and/or socialist at times, but mostly sticks to the fascinating lives of William and Catherine Booth.  Written with heart and soul, this book is a rewarding read.  This couple should be remembered more often than they are in secular circles for the enormous contribution they made to British society, and the continuing service the Salvation Army renders to the poor and jobless.  A beautiful book!
