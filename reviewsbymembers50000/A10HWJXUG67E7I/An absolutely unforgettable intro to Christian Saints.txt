 A stunning, beautiful compilation of all the lives of those Saints who have inspired millions for centuries!  I was simply going to refer to one or two chapters in the book; I ended up reading the entire text!  A gem in the world of Christian History and literature.  Should be read by everyone interested in the life of faith and love of Jesus Christ.
