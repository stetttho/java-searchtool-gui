 This book is a treasured item in my personal library.  For anyone interested in how God still works through his people, this book is powerful testimony of God's care.  The author does a marvelous job of portraying the couple as they really were.  There is nothing pretentious or superfluous about this book; it convicted me and gave me an even greater love for my brothers and sisters in Russia and other countries where the Bible has been, or is currently treated as 'hate literature' or illegal reading material.  A wonderful gem of a book!
