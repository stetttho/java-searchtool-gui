 I am not usually all that interested in the American Civil War, but found this book compelling, insightful, and endlessly interesting.  The author shows us the man behind the many myths.  Jackson was at heart a devout Christian and a good man who wanted to do the right thing, although like any other mortal he made mistakes along the way.  Jackson's life is treated with the utmost dignity, respect, and praise that it so deserves.
