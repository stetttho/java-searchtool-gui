 I have tried to read about Luther from various authors and they seem to come up short.  Their is something very enriching about this particular bio.  The author does not superimpose his own viewpoint onto the revolutionary church reformer.  Here I Stand is a classic piece of literature and is easy for the non-theologian, even the unchurched person to read.
