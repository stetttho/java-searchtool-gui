 This book is thick but worth reading every last page!  I could not put it down there was so many fascinating facts and so many tragedies!  The Russian people suffered a terrible fate when they turned to Lenin's Communist Ideology.  It proved to be the death of some 60 million people!  Russia is still reaping the 'terrors' of Bolshevism/Communism.  Most Russian people are fearful, haunted, dejected, and extremely poor.  Communism was no god but a losing ideology.  It only helped those at the top and even they were hunted, fearful, killed off or put in labor camps.  An excellent, information-packed book!
