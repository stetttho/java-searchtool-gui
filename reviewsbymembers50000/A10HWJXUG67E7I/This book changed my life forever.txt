 I cannot recommend this book highly enough! The author lived long ago and yet his Christ-centered words ring out beautifully for us modern mortals.  I was so moved by his humble approach to God and his deep love and surrender to Christ.  A profoundly spiritual and moving experience awaits the reader of this book!
