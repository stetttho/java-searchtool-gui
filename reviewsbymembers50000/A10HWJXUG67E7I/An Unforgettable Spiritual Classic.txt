 John Donne's poetic words pierce the heart and ignite the imagination.  He speaks food for the soul, not just the heart.  I have read and re-read his books for many years and cannot tell how deeply they have moved me and inspired me to be a better Christian.  He was a profound writer, almost mystical and yet so very down to earth.  A beautiful book that should not be missed by anyone interested in the life of faith.
