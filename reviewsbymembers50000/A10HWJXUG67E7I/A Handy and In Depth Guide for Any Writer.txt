 This book showed me things that I had never anticipated in a Christian writing book.  I expected another boring textbook on the craft of writing, but I was taken by surprise!  Ethel Herr's thoughts are deep, original, and honest.  She provides an excellent foundation for writers to build on.  This book is a must for any Christian writer!
