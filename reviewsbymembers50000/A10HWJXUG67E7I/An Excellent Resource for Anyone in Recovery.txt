 I picked up this book and was surprised at the breadth and depth of insight.  The authors are all well-respected in the field of psychology, mental health, and recovery.  There are excerpts from people who know what they are talking about and share from their hearts, not just their brains.  A terrific resource for people needing inspiration and blessings on their journey to spiritual and mental wholeness.
