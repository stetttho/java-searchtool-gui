 O'Neill has revealed truths about John Kerry that people need to know, no matter what side of the political fence they are on.  He writes with conviction, objectivity, and delivers a fine expose on this presidential nominee.  When your own company says such negative things about your character, military, and personal performance, there is a lot of room for doubt.  A president SHOULD be trustworthy!  We expect integrity from WalMart employees and waitresses, why in the world would we not expect our president to be an honest man, regardless of his political party or religious beliefs.  I am an African American who believes in integrity and honesty, and it behooves John Kerry to come forth with the truth about his combat experience.
