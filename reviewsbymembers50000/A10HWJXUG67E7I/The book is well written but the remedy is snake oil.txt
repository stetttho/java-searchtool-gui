 I followed Dr. Paul Amand's fibromyalgia treatment plan for a year and it did nothing to alleviate the intense muscle pain.  I was outraged at the notion that an ingredient in cough syrup (Guaffenisen) can cure people of FM.  Perhaps some believing sould have been cured, and thank God for their healing, but for me it was just one more book touting the awesome curative powers of snake oil.  Spend your money on a deep-muscle massage or a nice dinner our with friends or family.
