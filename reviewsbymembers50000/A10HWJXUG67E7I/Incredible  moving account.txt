 I could not put this book down!  The reader is drawn into the horrible Nazi atrocities and yet the author keeps his perspective fresh and clear.  Every holocaust account is a mortal tragedy but this one ranks high on the scale and should be required reading for students the world over.  A beautiful, touching, and heart-breaking account!
