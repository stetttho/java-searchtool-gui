 I could not put this book down!  If you have any interest in the treatment of Allied soldiers during their stay in Japanese internment camps, just read this book.  From the introduction to the final page, this book will shock you, horrify you, but amazingly, it will inspire you and leave you with a good feeling about what Ernest Gordon did and became before he died in 2002.  Bless his memory and may this book live on forever!
