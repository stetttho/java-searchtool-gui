 The author is a wonderful speaker and has written equally as well in this book.  He is fair and shoots straight from the hip regarding fundamental Islamic beliefs and creeds.  He uses the very Koran to back up his writing, which gives this book credibility and makes it a powerful tool for Christians to understand where Muslims are coming from.
