 I struggled with bulimia for years and this book was one of several books which helped me on my road to recovery.  The author is sensitive and cares deeply about men and women struggling with eating disorders and she delves deep into the causes as well as treatments.  Another book that helped was the Minirth-Meier Clinic book on Eating Disorders.  Fantastic resources for anyone dealing with this often deadly disease.
