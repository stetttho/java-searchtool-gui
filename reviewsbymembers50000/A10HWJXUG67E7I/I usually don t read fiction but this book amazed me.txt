 As a non-fiction reader I find it hard to stick with a novel, even if it is very good, but this book had me after the first page! Jane Jensen writes with such a unique perspective, clear insight, and imaginative presence! I cannot say enough good about this book and how it makes the reader look at his world through a different lens. There are very few novels that I can muddle through but this novel captured my attention all the way to the conclusion! Excellent and distinguished writing!
