 Dolgun's many years in the Soviet Gulag makes his story very unique.  This book will change your life and your view of modern history!  An absolutely shocking and disheartening look into life in the Soviet Union before perestroika.   This memoir and Varlam Shalamov's book "Kolyma Tales" are the best books I have ever read about the Gulag!
