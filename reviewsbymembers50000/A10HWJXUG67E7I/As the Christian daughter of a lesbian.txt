 I can safely say that this book makes an honest effort to approach the subject kindly and treat homosexuals in a loving way.  I do not agree that homosexuality is just another lifestyle.  I have watched my own mother go from lover to lover, never satisfied.  She has had at least 13 lesbian partners in the past 14 years.  She has finally found a woman that she is content to stay with but she is just that, "content," not necessarily happy.  She left the church years ago and has no use for religion, but she and I get along beautifully.  We have learned to love in spite of our opposing views on her sexuality.  I love my Mom and I know that the environment she was raised in was one of maternal loss (her mother died when she was 18 months old), profound loneliness, and verbal abuse from an unaccepting, often cruel grandmother.  Jesus encouraged compassion for every mortal, lesbian or straight, conservative or liberal.  I leave the judging part to Him.
