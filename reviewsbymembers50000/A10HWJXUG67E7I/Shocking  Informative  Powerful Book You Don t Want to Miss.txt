 I could not put this book down and found the information extremely valuable and frightening! Forget reading a Stephen King novel, pick up this book and you will be horrified at the number of killer viruses, bacteria, and even prions (the substance responsible for Mad Cow Disease.)  The authors have done an excellent job of showing the path of the newest killer diseases! A prolific book on the subject of newly emerging diseases!
