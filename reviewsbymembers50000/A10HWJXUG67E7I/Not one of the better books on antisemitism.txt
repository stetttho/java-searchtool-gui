 Though this book had some insights into the problem we Jews face, it did not offer any hope.  Antisemitism is not merely a 'Social Problem' it is an international, religious, and political problem that has spanned the centuries.  The author condemns antisemitism, yet bashes African American Christians and Muslims.  It is exactly this attitude of intellectual elitism that destroys the peace process.  Martin Luther King, Jr. preached a much more desirable gospel than Marvin Perry.  He called on his people to walk in love and not return hatred for hatred, violence for violence.  Essentially the doctrine of 'do good to those who hate you' is a far better approach than anything this author suggests.  He does not have a complete, or even clear understanding of the 'Jewish Problem'.  I doubt that any of us, Jews included, understand the monster that is antisemitism.  It is an emotionally and spiritually complex issue that may never be fully resolved this side of the New Jerusalem.
