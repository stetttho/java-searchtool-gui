 A true classic in Christian literature.  The man was truly a saint and a sinner who knew his need of forgiveness.  His life was shaped by many early experiences and he shares them openly in this extremely well-crafted autobiography.  Deeply encouraging and inspiring, it left me wanting to read everything he ever wrote.  A passionate, sensitive, and powerful autobiography.
