 This book screams out, "Please God, I want to believe in you but I can't!"  Armstrong was a nun and now doesn't know whether she is Buddhist or Muslim, so how can she be objective about the major religions?  She is writes with very little insight.  She presents an evasive, ambiguous, and confusing theory of religion.  Not a good book to read if you are interested in any of the religions she discusses, or should I say dissects and rips apart?
