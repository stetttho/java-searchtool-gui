 I picked this book up a long time ago and have read it over and over again.  I never tire of the parables, insights, and mystery that surrounded the life of Richard Wurmbrand.  What a mighty man of God who gave all for his love of Christ.  A Messianic Jew who knew intimately the sorrows of this world.  Yet, his faith in Christ sustained him through some of the most brutal, horrific trials on record.
