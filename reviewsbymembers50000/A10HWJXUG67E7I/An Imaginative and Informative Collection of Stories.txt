 I love true crime and cop stories, and this book is one of the best ones I've read in many years.  The author lets the cops tell their stories in their own words, and with all the quirks and nuances that make them unique as individuals.  The story about the G.I. Joe doll really touched my heart, and renewed my faith in good cops.  Most cops want to do their job with care and kindness, and this book shows the best and brightest of our generation.  The good guys and gals are still out there, serving and protecting.  God bless America's police officers, these men and women should be honored for their part in making the US a great place to live and work.
