 I have believed in eternal salvation for a long time but it is very hard to find books about the subject.  So many evangelical and Protestant churches teach that Christians can "lose" their salvation. What a terrible thing to teach people when it is not true!  This book reminds us that God gives the gift, the Holy Spirit guides us, and Christ redeems us for all eternity. A message that needs to be restored to the church during these uncertain times.
