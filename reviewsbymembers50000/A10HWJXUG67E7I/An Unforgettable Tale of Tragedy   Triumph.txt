 God's miraculous powers are often seen in the most desperate places on earth.  One of those places is still North Vietnam where thousands of Christians are persecuted for their faith in Jesus Christ.  This book is a powerful testimony to their unyielding faith and their triumph over the forces of evil all around them.  They pray for their enemies with love and courage that no army can match!  I couldn't put this book down until I finished the last page.  It will touch your heart deeply.
