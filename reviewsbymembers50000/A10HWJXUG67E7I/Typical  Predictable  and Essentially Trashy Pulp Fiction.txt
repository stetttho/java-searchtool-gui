 George is popular but for what reason, I do not know.  She is trite, uses lots of cliches, and expresses an intolerance to anything other than self-interest in her characters.  Lack of depth or insight is an understatement with this author who has literary potential but has yet to achieve it, in my opinion with her many novels.
