 Their walk across America book was a sensational item and was on the best seller's lists for a long time.  This book delves even deeper into the hearts and minds of the Jenkins.  They are candid, refreshingly honest about God, life, faith, and other mysteries, and they explore their feelings in ways most people never experience.  A beautiful book that should be read by anyone interested in the "life unseen."
