 This cop has an awesome story but he drones on endlessly about things that have no importance to his personal story of life as a cop.  This book has so much potential but needs to cut about 150 pages out of itself!!  Conlon is not really good with words, he is a good cop, though, and for that he deserves 5 stars, his book does not.
