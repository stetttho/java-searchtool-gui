 I read this book and felt so encouraged.  I have suffered with debilitating chronic pain for more than 4 years.  Marni Jackson knows what those of us who suffer are going through.  This book is a real page-turner for those interested in this ambiguous subject.  Pain is such a vague, subjective experience and the author points this out through stories and anecdotes.  Her witticisms and practical insights are true gems.  I felt less alone in the world of chronic pain after reading this book.  If you need a little encouragement, or know someone who does, please read this book.  It is well worth the investment!
