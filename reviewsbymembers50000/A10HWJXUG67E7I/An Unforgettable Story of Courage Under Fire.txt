 The author is comical, insightful, and witty.  She minces no words in telling a delightful, though often tragic tale of her mission in Burma.  The characters in this book are so inspiring and left me wondering what I could do to help people like them who suffer so much at the hands of ruthless governments.  This book should be better publicized than it is.  I had never heard of it, I just happened to see it at a local book place.  I'm so glad I found this treasure of a book, it is absolutely beautiful.
