 I couldn't put this book down and I don't usually have little interest in WWI.  I tend to read more about World War II and the Holocaust of Nazi Germany, but this book grabbed me and did not let me go until the last page!  I wish more people knew about this rich and engrossing book.  It has so much to say to us moderns about life as it was in the early 19OO's.  A spectacular read for anyone interested in history.
