 I hope that Louis Zamperini's story becomes required reading for our children one day.  This man's amazing story of survival against all odds during WWII is truly miraculous.  To describe Louie as merely "lucky" misses the mark somehow.  He should have died many times over before and during the war, but through God's grace and Zamperini's formidable willpower he survived to tell his story.  And what an incredible, page-turning saga it is!  I couldn't put this book down and after reading it, I was a changed woman.  I had a new respect for my grandfather, and the men of his generation who suffered unimaginable horrors on the battlefields of Europe and Japan during the 1940's.
