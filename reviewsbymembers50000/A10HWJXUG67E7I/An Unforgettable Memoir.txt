 I couldn't put this excellent book down.  From the first page I was hooked!  The author is humble, courageous, and maintained his dignity through some gruesome torture and confinement in a North Vietnamese prison.  Exciting and inspiring was his faith in God also which kept his spirit uplifted during his imprisonment.  A must read for anyone interested in Vietnam and the harrowing aspects of that awful war.
