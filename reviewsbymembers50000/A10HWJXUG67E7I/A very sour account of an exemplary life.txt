 Richard Marius has written a biography chock-full of untempered, atheistic fervor.  Martin Luther was an extraordinary man and his legacy, and theology live on in the hearts of millions of followers.  Why would a biographer choose a subject he seems to care so little for?  The seething sarcasm and anti-religious sentiment in this book make it difficult to read.  This book is more a presentation of the author's atheism than the life of Martin Luther.  I detect hypocrisy not from this departed Christian man (Luther) but his biographer! If you are an atheist, then by all means, stick with subjects who share something of your lifestyle and beliefs (or lack thereof).
