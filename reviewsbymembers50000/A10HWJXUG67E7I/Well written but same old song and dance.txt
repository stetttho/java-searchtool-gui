 This book quickly draws you in with its enticing portrayal of anorexia but then drops you 15 pages later.  The writing is lyrical, even poetic, the message is hackneyed and over-used.  Men, society, teachers, traditional values, etc. are all blamed by the author for the horrifying statistics on eating disorders in our generation.  Admittedly some of the things have put pressure on women to be thin, grotesquely thin.  However, where and when will women be allowed to accept responsibility for their own bodies?  The shape of our bodies, the color of our hair, and the size of our shoes is our business, not the business of know-it-all feminists who sit in their cozy little university offices writing books about the terrible pressures men put on us women to be skinny.  Live and let live.  Men have their own set of problems to deal with, and though they can be oppressive in their treatment of women, they also have shown increasing support and flexibility in their attitudes toward us.  Men, in general are not to blame for anorexia nervosa, women must learn to treat themselves with compassion, patience, and respect.
