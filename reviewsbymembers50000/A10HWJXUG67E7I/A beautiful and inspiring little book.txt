 This book was written by a spiritual giant who takes long, prayerful walks among us!  I was so inspired and so refreshed in my own prayer life after reading this book.  Truly an original among Christian works.  Put the thoughts of this book into practice and you will find yourself amazed at how God works in your own heart and life!
