 I was very skeptical of this book when I first got it but after trying the suggested foods (made very simple for those of us who are nutritionally-challenged)for only 7 days I have lost a whopping 6 pounds!  I didn't even lose that much while fasting for 7 days!  How exciting!  I feel almost manic, I am so happy and healthy.  All I can say is this diet works!  Buy it, believe it, and see the difference in your weight.
