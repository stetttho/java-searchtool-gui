 THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN IN A SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT STYLE, BUT IT IS READABLE AND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ITS RICH AND INSPIRING CONTENT.  THE AUTHOR IS SOLID IN HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE BIBLE AND THE PRAYER LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.  I WAS ENCOURAGED AFTER I READ THIS BOOK TO PURSUE PRAYER IN WAYS I HADN'T CONSIDERED BEFORE.  AN EXCELLENT BOOK IF YOU CAN ADJUST TO THE WRITING STYLE.
