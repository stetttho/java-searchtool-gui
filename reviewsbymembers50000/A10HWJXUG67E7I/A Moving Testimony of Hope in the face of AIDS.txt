 Rozar tells his story from the perspective of Christian faith and hope.  His battle with AIDS has not kept him from living life to the fullest and trusting God for the outcome.  I was so touched by this book as I know 2 people (one of them a Christian) suffering with AIDS.  It is a disease that no one can ignore as it now afflicts so many people across all socioeconomic levels and not strictly foreigners and gay men.  A beautifully written account of this terrible virus.  Read it and be inspired!
