 This book is my first experience with pixel puzzles and I have to say that they've been challenging, interesting and totally addictive. The book gives a good foreword for beginners, giving some tips to start you on the way to solving the puzzles correctly and then throws you around a hundred puzzles with varying levels of difficulty for you to work through. Some are pretty difficult but all are manageable and satisfying at the end. This is definitely a good way to spend a few hours on a rainy (or snowy as it might be here in Canada) day or in spare moments of boredom. Definitely a good way to keep the mind sharp and keen. Anyone itching to exercise their problem-solving arm will appreciate this book.
