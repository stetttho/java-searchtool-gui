 Anyone who has the privilege of watching the ingenuous Mamma Mia! musical (especially ABBA fans) will adore this soundtrack. With all the amazing hits that were woven into the play, the vocal talents on this CD are every bit as brilliant, captivating and dynamic as they are on stage. If you haven't seen the musical yet - go see it... it's worth it, and something real fun to take the family to!
