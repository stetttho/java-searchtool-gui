 I have never really paid much attention to the many "Solitudes" albums that are out on the market now, but this one caught my eye particularly because I was intrigued by the thought of music being created to suit an animal we know so little about. After acquiring this album I was suitably amazed and awed by the scope and insight of Gibson's music inspired by this truly majestic creature. Wolves have played a prominent part in myth and folklore, and Legend of the Wolf is a rare piece of work that manages to capture the ghostly, haunting presence of these legendary creatures. Gibson grants them the ethereal, magical status that they have been given throughout history, without forgetting to tie their roots to the very Earth with whom they live in a harmony far more perfect than that attempted by human beings.  The opening track, Silent Runner, is a jawdropper to begin with, and the rest of the album carries the same natural energy and beauty inherent within the song. There is no doubt that this is an accolade of the highest to these creatures who have inspired so many just with their simple existence.
