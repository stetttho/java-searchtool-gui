 I have to admit I was first attracted to this book by the shiny red bar that boasted "the fantasy novel of the year!".... and after having read it over 7 times I have to say that I was not let down at all. This book will surpass the expectations of any fantasy reader. It steps away from the traditional storytelling of the genre and enters an extremely complex and intriguing realm that always keeps you guessing. All of the characters are captivating, grounded and real, be they 9 years old or ancient. This book is centered on a realm dominated by the weaknesses of human kind, and the plot is at once compelling and destructive. It will bring you to fear, to tears, and always leave the fleeting hope of the peace and human salvation to loom tantalizingly in the horizon- but leaves you questioning if it is reachable.  Do NOT expect a traditional "happily ever after" ending from this unique series. This is definitely not a book for the faint-hearted or fastidious, and is not a novel for those seeking a fairytale realm where goodness always prevails. Martin manages to draw out the many aspects of human nature that characterize human failings and fallibility. Rather than prominently display darkness and light in the fashion of Tolkien, Eddings, Jordan, and other fantasy writers, "good" and "evil" are never distinctly defined in Martin's novel. Instead, he writes it as it is in the real world, where good and evil are two intertwined capacities inherent in unpredictable human behaviour.  This is an extremely enthralling saga whose philosophy does not allow readers the chance to clearly believe "that there is still some good left in the world, and that it is worth fighting for" (a la Samwise Gamgee), but instead invites us to a critical reexamination of the many different shades of human nature.
