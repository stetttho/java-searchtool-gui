 As an almost fanatically devoted fan of the Belgariad, the Mallorean, the Tamuli, and the Elenium, I was incredibly excited for the release of the latest Eddings book. However, I was sorely disappointed with the character and the plot. In fact I bought the book when it first came out and have not yet finished it- my bookmark is still on the 100th page. Eddings' previous characters (e.g. Belgarath the Sorcerer, Belgarion, Polgara, King Rhodar, Sparhawk, Kalten, Sephrenia, etc. etc.!) have all been well rounded, likable, amusing, witty and fairly deep characters. You could get to know them. With Althalus, however, it is difficult to even summon a shred of caring or interest in who he is and what he does and what the consequences of his actions are. He does not strike as one with remarkable intelligence or wit (though he does attempt to appear so, failing miserably) and is only surface-deep. The same goes for other extraneous characters in the book (who I can't remember anymore) and even the setting that the story is carried out in.  As one who has shared many chuckles and yes, even tears, with the previous characters of Eddings' books I am content to put Althalus away into recycling and concentrate on rereading the aforementioned beloved series. I don't mean to be so critical of the Eddings, I am still a tremendous fan who owns every single book they have ever written. In fact it may be because I loved the old series so much that in my psychologically biased view this latest book has been a major let-down. As far as I'm concerned, Althalus has NOT been redeemed.
