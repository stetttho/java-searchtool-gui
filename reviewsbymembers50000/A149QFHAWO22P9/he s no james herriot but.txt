 Gutkind presents to us an extremely realistic view of veterinary practices in the present day, documentary style. While his stories do not possess the same inspiring charm and warmth of the beloved author James Herriot, he gives us an interesting presentation of veterinary medicine. I have to admit that while James Herriot has inspired the pursuit of veterinary medicine, Gutkind forces one to re-think whether that is the career choice that you're looking for. He provides us with a this-is-how-it-is attitude that does not lace the profession with perfect-world ideals but instead allows us insight into veterinarians who have conflicted opinions (even regrets) on their career choices.  My greatest respect still remains with James Herriot, who intensely portrayed the image of a man who truly and absolutely loved his profession, no strings attached- one of the rare, ideal veterinary practitioners the world has yet known. However, I also respect Gutkind for his portrayal of veterinary medicine as well. His book is a realistic in-your-face reminder that you must, must properly consider all your options before committing to a career choice, because what you pursue may not be what you expected it to be.
