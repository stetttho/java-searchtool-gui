 This is the first album by LAGQ that I bought, and actually they are the reason that I got onto Amazon.com- I couldn't find their album anywhere here in Canada. They are truly an amazing group, and they bring out the passion and vibrancy, the energy and life, and the mystique that is possessed by the relatively simple-looking guitar. The African Suite and Farewell to Stromness are by far my most loved tracks on this album. They have crafted masterpieces that any fan of classical music will be able to appreciate. This is a listening experience you won't regret!!
