 "Hero" is written like a poem and sung like a ballad. It is at once simplistic yet complicated, dark yet dazzlingly beautiful. Far before Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was introduced to the Western theatrical world, a multitude of martial arts films abounded in SE Asia. "Hero" is the embodiment of the strength, savageness, and unsurpassed beauty that comes from the harmony built by body, mind and soul through years of practicing martial arts.   Jet Li steps back from his stereotypical Hollywood bash film to execute an unparalleled work of art. Combined with the commanding presence of Maggie Chung, his female counterpart, and the talents of Tony Leung and Zhang Ziyi, this is a fiercely acrobatic ballet only tangibly supplemented by a barely necessary sparse dialogue. Though set in Ancient China, the film is laced lightly over with distant facts which are used as the mere backdrop for the retelling of an epic.   The cinematography & choreography of this film are amazing. With every retelling of the story, the vivid color changes and panaromic sweeps inherent in each scene speak a thousand words on their own, giving the actors a masterful stage to play on. The fantastical and somewhat spiritual, supernatural tone of each scene is accentuated by the trademark Chinese martial arts wire work, giving the impression that the four main characters are no ordinary people, but fine artisans and such masters of their craft that they have transcended normal physical laws.   To fully appreciate this movie one has to recognize that "Hero" is about one thing: story telling. Any legendary story in any culture holds elements of the fantastical, the mythical, the unknown. "Hero" encompasses all of these elements and demonstrates the depth of human imagination.
