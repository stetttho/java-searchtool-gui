 Anyone who has gone to a GBS concert knows the energy, charisma, lyrical and purely East Coast sound that embodies this incredible group.   This CD is just a taste of the liveliness that embodies any GBS concert. With all the great classics, my favorites being "I'm a Rover", "The Night Patty Murphy Died", and "Lukey", this is a CD that promises a brilliantly joyful time. This CD does them more justice than any of their other studio recorded discs... it is but a taste though, of the powerful essence of GBS that you capture with each and every concert.
