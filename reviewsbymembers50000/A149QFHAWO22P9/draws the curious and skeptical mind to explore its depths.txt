 I'd heard a lot about this book and seeing it sitting on my brother's desk obviously meant that I HAD to pick it up. 9 hours later, at 2am in the morning I finally finished the Da Vinci Code and it was good to the last word.   The Da Vinci Code brilliantly collects together many facets of art, historical, theological and modern day symbolism and weaves them into the mysterious European setting. Many beliefs, 'facts' and theories that have been floating around for years crop up in here - from the mischieviousness of Leonardo Da Vinci manifesting in his famous paintings like the Last Supper, Madonna on the Rocks and the Mona Lisa to the multitudes of Grail Quests, origins of words like the Roman sub rosa... and even to symbolism in the Little Mermaid!!   I felt that though quite a few of the little factoids Brown throws together in his book ought to be taken with a grain of salt, they're nevertheless intriguing enough to have the curious and skeptical scrounging the depths of the internet and literature to uncover their truths (and un-truths).   The Da Vinci Code is ingenuous in that it is a work of fiction that for the often SEEMS to be written with the intent of being a non-fiction. Being raised a Catholic myself it's obvious that it was inevitable that the book would cause some degree of outrage and 'scandal'; but I don't doubt that Brown wrote it knowingly (perhaps a parallel to Langdon?). This book is definitely one of the best I've read and it's pages are rich with depth and knowledge, woven through with hints of the intangibal supernatural and mystique - enough to keep your mind occupied and constantly searching every time you re-read it.
