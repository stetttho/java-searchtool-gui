 This is the first book that I read by Sidney Sheldon and I was completely in awe of the scope of this story. Every twist in the plot had me turning pages late into the night simply because I was unable to put the book down. I was quite simply, riveted to the spot. The main character, Tracy, is someone that you come to care about and respect as she leads you a series of wild and unexpected adventures. Sheldon has created an intelligent, witty and captivating tale that will keep your jaw on the floor for days to come.
