 I've been a fan of cryptograms since I stumbled across them in my local newspaper - this book is a great collection and a good way to occupy your time and mind whenever you're bored or just feel the need to solve something! I really liked it because the cryptograms are for the most part lovely quotes by many famous people - you'll be treasuring the quotes long after you've solved the puzzle. The only thing about this book is that - the title isn't true - once you buy it you won't be able to limit yourself to just one cryptogram a day, that's for sure! Definitely a great catch and one to look into.
