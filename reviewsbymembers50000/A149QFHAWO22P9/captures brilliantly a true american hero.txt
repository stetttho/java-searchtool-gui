 Seabiscuit is a film that goes beyond any moviegoers expectations; it holds none of the Hollywood glitz and glamour, none of the cheap plot lines that are made for one sole reason- to get the buck.   This is a film that has heart, strength, hope and courage, all borne on the hooves of an unlikely brown colt who defied the expectations of a nation. With only three people who truly believed in him; a father who lost his son, a cowboy who lost his freedom and a jockey who had nowhere else to go, all of whom were brought together to bring out the glory in this broken-down and mis-used horse, this is an inspirational story that will touch anyone's heart, 'horsey' or not.   The race scenes are magnificent. The thrumming of hoofbeats seem to thunder off the screen and into your blood, and you can't help but get caught up in each and every victory, each and every failure. For anyone who has ever seen one of the big races live, you can truly appreciate the excitement and energy that comes with the horses pounding down the backstretch. It only takes less than two minutes to raise a nation to its feet; even when those few precious moments come through on an unlikely horse that had more speed, more heart and more game than any other horse that set foot on track with him.
