 I stumbled across this book in the humour section in my local bookstore and had to buy it as a joke for a good friend. This meant I got to read it before hand, of course. As one who has a stupid curiosity about the most inane and obscure things from time to time (e.g. the origin of matchbooks or the chemicals they use to make the ink in ballpoint pens), I found this book to be pretty funny and interesting all at the same time. Just as the title proclaims - this book is totally 100% freakin useless. A good choice for anyone interested in trivia or for anyone who just feels the need to satisfy that annoying curiosity that drives you to learn even MORE stupid known facts.
