 I have this book along with "Adopting the Racing Greyhound" by Cynthia Branigan and find having the pair of them complement each other quite well. This book is a very good read when it comes to deciding whether a greyhound is the right companion for you and also gives helpful training and behaviour tips. I felt though that at times it could get a little draggy with the training element but this again can be supplemented with Branigan's book. This still was an extremely helpful guide and reference to look into when I adopted my beautiful greyhound and has proved useful in housebreaking my sensitive boy. I would definitely recommend it to any new or prospective greyhound owner!
