 When I was a child I picked up my first Ruffian book off a dusty bookshelf in my public library and since then her story has never failed to move me to tears. With this book Schwartz has managed to capture the true essence and beauty, the courage and the tragedy of the greatest filly that ever drew breath. Schwartz carefully crafts every facet of the filly's short life to her untimely death through the people and events surrounding Ruffian, and how she won the hearts of the world through her own unfailing heart and undefeatable love of the track she owned. This is indeed a superbly written book and is one of the greatest tributes that could be paid to Ruffian, the filly who broke the records and whose tragic, triumphant finish will continue to break our hearts for decades to come.
