 As a hardcore fan of Kitaro I was as always impressed with his work on this album, but it somehow didn't capture the same magical essence for me that his other albums have (e.g. Kojiki, Mandala). Still I consider this a worthwhile buy simply because of some of the intriguing and poetically beautiful works on this album that I would have otherwise missed. There is no doubt that A Passage of Life, Island of Life and A Drop of Silence are astounding pieces crafted by Kitaro's artistry.
