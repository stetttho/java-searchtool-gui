 Chorus: Why do you cry out thus, unless at some vision of horror? Cassandra: The house reeks of death and dripping blood. Chorus: How so? 'Tis but the odour of the altar sacrifice. Cassandra: The stench is like a breath from the tomb. -Aeschylus "Agamemnon" The FIREBRAND is by far one of the most unique and compelling retellings of the fall of Troy. This is a book that captures your attention immediately. There is without question mythic overtone to the story (the book wouldn't be what it is without it) but yet it is at its very core humanistic and revealing. The well-known anthropomorphism of the patriarchal deities figures prominently and we see they are prone to the same weaknesses and desires as the mere mortals.  As in the style of many of Bradley's books, the FIREBRAND centers on a prominent female main character. It leads us through the bitter-sweet trials and tribulations of Kassandra, the doomed prophetess of Apollo sungod and the princess of Troy.  Victim of retribution from the very god she loves, Kassandra exists to foretell the future but never be believed.  We are from the first page at once taken on a staggering journey through a world that is home to both human and gods, and find that the fall of the once-proud Trojan empire is not the result of a sequence of destined events (i.e. events leading up to and during the romantic feud over the renowned beauty Helen of Sparta) but because it existed as one of the major players in a mind-blowing battle between the gods. The FIREBRAND carries with it the workings of a masterpiece. One cannot help but be caught up with the drama and compelling power created by Bradley's artful storytelling.
