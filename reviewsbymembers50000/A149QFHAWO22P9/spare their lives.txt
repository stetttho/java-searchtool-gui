 As an extremely patient, devoted fan of WoT, I have painstakingly spent hours of my time poring over each page of this series... however where my enthusiasm once was is now a lackadaisical glassy-eyed apathy. I cannot fathom how a once-great author could possess the propensity to completely butcher a previously riveting work of art.  CoT provides no real depth or development anywhere. I have reread previous books (particularly books 1-6) in the series more than a dozen times, but this series has lost its previous shine and the last few books seem consigned to a fate of collecting dust in the lower reaches of my shelves where I keep my less-than-liked books.... if they even find their way there. As a reader determined to stake it out until the end though I will most likely slog my way through the series' meandering and hope that it reaches a conclusion that will not be robbed of its glory by the torturously long journey required to achieve it.  I do hope however that RJ will finish this series off soon and take on new challenges, or just call it quits.... at the moment he is only taking the lives of innocent trees and wasting away in the same capitalistic manner that has come to dominate much of society today.
