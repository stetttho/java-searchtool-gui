 For anyone who has fallen as deeply in love with the Belgariad and the Mallorean as I have will truly cherish and enjoy this book. Told from the straight from the heart of the centuries-old, wise, witty, overdramatic and altogether lovable sorcerer Belgarath, the Old Wolf, this novel is a captivating and entertaining novel that expands on the beginnings of Eddings' world. Throughout the book we are introduced to the first people, and the first gods that roamed at the beginning of time, and the marvelous events and prophecy that lead up to the stories of the Belgariad and Mallorean. We finally are given a history of Belgarath's remarkable beginnings, from the small vilage of Gara, to his first encounter with Aldur and the other disciples, to the Breaking of the World, and onwards, following his footsteps in all the adventures and exploits that he experienced even before Garion was born. We finally are able to appreciate and realize the depth and intellect of the often shabby Old Wolf through his experiences and dialogues, and are able to hop right into his shoes and personally get to know the other characters whose presence is pivotal in directing the flow of time. Eddings ties together many loose ends and allows us to understand the many facets of Belgarath's life, from being the shabby old story teller to being the most powerful sorcerer in the world, able to instil awe and fear in so many ('Grat is not nice!). This book lacks nothing and is rich in depth, articulate and descriptive writing, and is peppered with the classic dry humour and penetrating wit that Eddings has mastered, and will keep you enthralled and laughing for ages.
