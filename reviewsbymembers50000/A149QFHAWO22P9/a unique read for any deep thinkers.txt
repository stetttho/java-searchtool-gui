 I first encountered this book when I was looking for an author to do a high school english project on, and I was immediately drawn to this little-known author through the expressive style of his writing and the deeply unique philosophy inherent in every piece of work. Eiseley was not just a talented writer but a deeply emotional naturalist and his profound respect for all things living is apparent throughout his works. As he walks us through his close brushes with nature we are allowed a glimpse of the vast poetic world that we so often ignore. Eiseley writes intimately of his natural encounters, and we get a feeling that he is a rare man who felt somewhat out of place in the busy, fallible human world, and dwelled more along the indistinct boundary whose edges blur first into the natural world and then into the world we have made our own. An old adage has often gone "Every minute is precious" and Eiseley holds to this with an energy that turns every second, be it spent on a balcony bathed in early morning sunlight, or watching the jeweled webs of a spider into an infinitely precious memory never to be forgotten. This is without a doubt one of the most lyrical and insightful works on nature that you will ever read. If you are an avid naturalist you will be even more appreciative of all things that grow when you have finished reading this book. With a flourish of his pen, Eiseley reminds us that there is another life we may live, one where money, which has come to be central to our societies, and the essential human weakness, has no place beside the whisper of leaves drifting to the forest floor and the silken flow of crystal waters.
