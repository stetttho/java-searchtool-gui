 I heard Joel Plaskett's "True Patriot Love" through a CBC radio programming and immediately checked out his CD. Although Joel Plaskett is a relatively unknown band, their music is a unique, expressive mix of genres that is lyrically heartfelt. Each song is a refreshing change from current radio hits. As their music is very much not mainstream it is not suprising that they haven't gotten much recognition from the music industry, but I sincerely enjoy their music and hope to see their music become more popular in the future. Great tunes, from an all-Canadian band!
