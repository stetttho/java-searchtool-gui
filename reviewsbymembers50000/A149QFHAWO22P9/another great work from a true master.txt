 I have owned the Fall of Atlantis for a long time now and everytime I pick it up Bradley never fails to draw me once more into the intricate depth of the story that lays down the heritage of her exquisite Avalon novels. The heartache and pain that the characters in her book go through (from Domaris to Deoris, from Micon to Demira), constantly has your emotions at a boil.  Bradley has a gifted ability to weave intrigue and magic into the complex web of her stories and the Fall of Atlantis is a clear expression of her talent. Every detail concerning the Atlanteans is so perfectly thought out that the reader is easily immersed in this strange, spell-bound realm and its tragic destruction.  The women again figure prominently in this story and through their loves and losses, their actions and consequences, we see again their femininity is laced with a strength and determination that inarguably turns them into the heroines of an epic saga. Despite the dark overtone of the plot, the Fall of Atlantis is a enthralling, enduring story that captivates from the first page to the last.
