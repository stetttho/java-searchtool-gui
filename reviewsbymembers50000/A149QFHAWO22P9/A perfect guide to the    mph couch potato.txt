 Anyone who's ever seen, fallen in love with and now owns or is thinking of owning a greyhound will thoroughly enjoy this book. With practical tips on training, behaviour/disposition of the breed, sporting, and critically adjustment to home life, Branigan has written an extremely illustrious and informative, well-researched and thought out book describing the life and ownership of a retired racer.  I was touched most by the quirky 'urban legend' Branigan writes about the gratefulness shown by these magnificent dogs. Told by greyhounds at the track to their puppies and their puppies' puppies there was a secret place called "home" where everything was warm and soft and comfortable...   I loved this book and am overjoyed to be bringing my greyhound to his final home soon in December, a home filled with light and space and love. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who owns or is considering owning one of these special animals. There truly is no breed more remarkable than the greyhound!
