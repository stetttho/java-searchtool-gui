 I have been a fan of Kitaro's since I passed by the New Age section in my local bookstore when I lived in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and decided to buy one of his cds to try it out. I was not disappointed. Kitaro has revolutionized the world of music and his compelling style brings out innate mystical qualities that are dramatic and a-flourish. He has the unique talent to storytell through a single note, and in this album he has created a masterpiece that verges on near-perfection. I have since listened to many other New Age works and none have managed to inspire and astound as much as Kitaro has.
