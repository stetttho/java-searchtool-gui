 I was recommended this book by a friend who is heavily involved with dog training - she swore by it and stated that it was practically the bible of dog training. I went and got a copy - and haven't been disappointed so far.   I have fostered 2 dogs (a foxhound and a walker hound cross) and now own a greyhound - all three were rescues that arrived at a veterinary hospital here and had very specific behaviour problems when they came to me - fear (most of all), aggression, uncertainty, separation anxiety, and for the most part complete lack of basic behavioural/ house training. They had all been abused in the past, neglected and poorly socialized, but each had a willing spirit and desire to form a trusting relationship. I used Kilcommons' book often to help lay the groundwork with each of these dogs to address their issues, socialize them and establish a loving, lasting bond. My foster dogs are now happily adjusted with their forever families as is my greyhound (who spends the majority of the day sleeping and dreaming).   Kilcommons' book is a must-read guide for any dog owner. His patient, understanding and sensitive narrative dictates a very gentle and overall humane approach to training your dog or puppy. The pages are richly illustrated with helpful pictures which instruct you visually on various training techniques. Though a lot of it caters towards new puppy owners, dog owners who have acquired an adult dog with behavioural issues from the shelter or rescue organizations will find that they can use many of these techniques as well.   All things said and done - this is an amazing book that will help you through many bumps in the road with your new dog. Any owner will be deeply appreciative and so will your dog... from new puppies to the many rescued dogs, who may have once thought humanity had given up on them, but have finally found a loving, understanding home with you.
