 I was skeptical at first when I bought this CD (mainly due to my then-obsession with anything related to the Arthurian saga) and was unsure what to expect. I wasn't sure whether simple instruments and vocals would be able to capture the essence of the famed Merlin and the tragic tale of King Arthur, but I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and power inherent within this CD.  The girls of Alkaemy have managed to create a resounding, enchanting sound that carries with it all the fabled storytelling power of the ancient bards, who's stories have captivated audiences throughout the centuries with their lyrical expression and tales of gods and heroes. Le Morte D'Arthur, Faerie Entertainer's, Nimue's Lament and the Mystery are four of the most compelling tracks on the CD and through them many facets of the Arthurian saga are brought to life. The rest of the CD is just as good, but those four songs are the ones that clearly stand out in my thought. The Merlin Mystery did not let me down, and it certainly will not let any other listener down, either!
