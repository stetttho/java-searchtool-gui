 This is an incredible game. The graphics are stunning. The game play is fast paced. The stories are sweet. The Multiplay is awesome. Graphically, as you roam the land, you see deer running around, birds flying in the sky, and other creatures roaming around in the stunning environment. During scenarios, you don't hve time to mess around on alot of these as the enemy seems to find you rather quickly. Some of the battles are very intense and killing your enemy is no easy task. The stories are wonderful as you have the opportunity to play some of the greatest leaders that ever existed. Ghenghis Khan and Joan of Arc are just 2 of the 4 stories you get to play. It's like a history lesson while your playing as you learn their story and then fight their battles for them. The multiplay is awesome as far as I have seen as I have not had much time doing this. If you like real time games, this is a keeper.
