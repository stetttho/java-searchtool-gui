 In my opinion, this is Bon Jovi's best Cd. They have some rockers in Let It Rock & You Give Love A Bad Name plus a slew of other songs that just make you wanna put on your torn up jeans and crank up the stereo. this is one of the albums me and friends used to crank all the time (I finally got the CD cause I wore out 3 tapes). My favorite song is Wanted Dead Or Alive. As the song plays it continues to gain momentum and build with sense of power that gives me chills to this day. This may be the best song they have ever written (although it's too hard to choose just one). If you like Bon Jovi and don't have this Cd, get it. It's probably their best.
