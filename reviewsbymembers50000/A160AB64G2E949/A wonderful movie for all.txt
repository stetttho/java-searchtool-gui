 This is a very nice DVD collection. I haven't watched all of the special features yet, but I thought it was pretty cool watching all of the original characters (now grown up) talk about the movie and show some clips of things that happened on the set. Both versions are here (I still prefer the original from 82) and both are great. The newest version done in 2002 has the guns replaced with walkie-talkies and have even added some new scenes that are pretty cool. This is definitley the "family" movie that can be enjoyed for a lifetime.
