 Time and time again, the Command & Conquer series keeps getting better and better. And Firestorm does not disappoint.       The only slightly disappointing thing was the units which I didn't think were that great (you  hardly ever got to use them except for the Juggernaut and it's aim was  poor).      The missions and the story were both very good, especially the  last mission for GDI. It was very tough to get started with missile  launches and units continually attacking you, and once you met the  objective, the towering (and I do mean towering) robot you had to fight was  super cool. And you weren't done with that mission even after you destroyed  the robot.       If you have Tiberian Sun, Get this expansion pack, you  will not be disappointed.
