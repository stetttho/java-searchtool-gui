 This is about as close to a perfect album as you can get. With Ronnie's voice, Vivian Campbells guitars, and awesome drum work Vinnie Appice (the bass [playing is good also, but I can't remember his name although I believe it is Jimmy Bain). I truly believe Vivian Campbell is one of the best guitarist around and that Vinnie Appice is one of the best drummers you never hear about (just listen to The Last In Line cd and you'll understand). Holy Diver, Stand Up And Shout, and Gypsy are awesome songs, but I believe the cream of the crop is Rainbow in the Dark. Everything comes together on this song as it explodes with power and intensity. An incredible debut album. A must for any metal fan.
