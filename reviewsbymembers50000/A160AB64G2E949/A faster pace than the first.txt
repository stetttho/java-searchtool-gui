 Roland is back, but this time he has drawn 3 people back into his time with him who are chosen to help him with his task which is reaching the Dark Tower. Interesting reading as he draws the 3 in and teaches them some of the knowledge of the Gunslinger, you learn about each persons past, and they have a showdown with a pretty incredible "monster". A definite read as you move a step closer to the ultimate goal: The Dark Tower.
