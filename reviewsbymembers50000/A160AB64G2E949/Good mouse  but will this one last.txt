 I give this mouse a 4, but may adjust later if this one doesn't last. I had one similar to this (I'll explain the diference in a minute) and it only lasted 4 months, but like a dummy I lost the receipt and couldn't get it exchanged. So far, this one has lasted much longer. I like the size as seems to fit perfect in my hand. The only thing I don't like about this mouse is where the buttons are. There is a button on each side of the mouse and when I'm playing a game or surfing the net that my finger will touch one of the buttons and will do something I don't want it to do. The model before this one had 2 buttons on one side and I liked that alot better (maybe they did it for left-handed people). Other than that, this is a good mouse. The wheel in the middle is great for scrolling up and down documents. The mouse moves nice and smooth and without having a ball on the bottom of your mouse you don't have to worry about cleaning it. You don't even need a mouse pad as long as you have smooth surface (as long as it's not clear) to use it on. Definitley a good mouse to have.
