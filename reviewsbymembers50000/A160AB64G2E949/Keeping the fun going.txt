 I thought that this was a pretty cool expansion pack for an already cool game. You get 2 more campaigns covering 14 total missions. With more units, buildings, and upgrades available, this game is getting better and better. A few of the campaigns are pretty tough, especially getting started which makes for some pretty long battles. The only real bad thing about this game and the expansion is how weak the air units are. If you have a couple of anit air turretts built, you can take out 8 or 10 air units pretty easy without losing a turrett. And for the expense of building air units, it just isn't worth it. Other than that, this is a very solid game with good graphics and some pretty awesome battles. I recommend this all RTS fans. To me, this is the best computer game based on Star Wars.
