 I must say I had my reservations about purchasing this CD. Dokken without George Lynch? Theres no such thing. I think Goerge Lynch is one the best guitarists out there. But then there was Reb Beach taking his place whom I  also thought was great. This CD clicks without missing a beat. I have been  a Dokken fan since their first album, and this ranks up there with my  favorites. This is way better than their last 2 albums they released. This  still has the pounding Dokken rhythm from their earlier work, but when the  guitar solo spots come up, they are all Reb Beach which gives this a  totally different sound. And it is AWESOME! The album title hits it on the  head. They have defintely erased the slate and this is a great new start.
