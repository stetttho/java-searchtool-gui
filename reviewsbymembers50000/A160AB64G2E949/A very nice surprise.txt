 This game was a nice surprise. The cut scene movies they had were very cool and the game play was pretty fast paced. From training you guys to throw fire to flying around in a hotair ballon, this game offered alot of different was of reeking havoc. Especially your Shaman. Once powered up, the Shaman can unleash many spells such as earthquake, tornado, and volcano eruptions and believe me, these are very cool. You can garrison towers to use to your advantage as extra defense while you are attacking. Lots of cool features. You have plenty of battles to fight to get to the final confrontation and this is a very challenging game as it seems like every time you turn around, you are getting attacked again. And when you get to the final battle, well, you'll just have to see for yourself. Very cool. Probably closer to 4 1/2 stars.
