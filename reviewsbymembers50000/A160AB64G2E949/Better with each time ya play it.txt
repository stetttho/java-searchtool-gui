 The first time I heard this, it didn't really knock me off my feet. This CD is a little more laid back than usuall except for It's My Life. But as I listened to more tunes like Captian Crash... & I Got The Girl, I like this one more and more. With songs like Thank You For Loving Me & She's A Mystery they solidify themselves as one of the best ballad bands ever. This CD won't blow you away or make you forget the Slippery When Wet or New Jersey albums, but this is a keepr.
