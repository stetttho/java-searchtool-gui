 I have played every PC Army Men game released and though this isn't the best, it is a very solid game. The graphics are good, but not great. The music is good, but not great. But the gameplay is very good. The AI is very good also as any of the med trucks close to a building and/or your units automatically goes and repairs it. The dump trucks collect what you need most whether it is plastic or electricity. And each campaign you play has 2 other objectives to achieve. If you achieve those 2 and beat that campaign, you get a gold medal. Miss one you get a silver medal. Miss 2 and you get a bronze. You need to get all gold medals (and that ain't easy) to open bonus missions underneath the Great Battles option ( make sure you play this on hard because that is the requirement for 3 or 4 missions). If you don't, you will miss out on a couple of Great Battles. There are some cool features like the radio operator who can call in an air drop of 5 extra machine gunners, a bombing run, and even a magnifying glass to melt a building down. There are robots with firecrackers on their backs, minelayers, tanks, helicopters, and many more units to choose from. The cutscenes are pretty well done and there is some good comedy (though sometimes cheesy). You also get to fight ants and other various bugs and you fight on many different landscapes from the front yard to the basement to the kitchen counter and more. I really enjoyed this game though it will probably never be a classic. Just straight forward and challenging fun. The worst thing about this game is the lack of being able to fight against the computer on a map of your choice. Other than that, melt away.
