 I read the title of the album and thought maybe they retooled and were ready to kick it back into high gear. What I got was another pop driven album with some good rockers mixed in. I would give this album 4 1/2 stars as I thought it was better than Hysteria. Tonight is probaly one of my favorite tunes these guys ever did and Lets Get Rocked is another good positive rock album for all to have a little fun to. But this album also was marked with tragedy as Steve "Steamin" Clark died while making this album. That was why it took almost 5 years to get this album done. Clark plays and writes some of the tunes on the album, but this band can't seem to catch a break.
