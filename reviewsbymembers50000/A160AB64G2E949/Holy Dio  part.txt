 They have done it again. This is the second and last time this group plays together again with this lineup which I consider to be a perfect fit. Dio's albums have never sounded as good as they did with Vivian on guitar, Vinnie on drums, and Jimmy on bass. The power is here with songs such as We Rock, I Speed At Night, and Breathless. Dio's voice has never been better than on The Last In Line. These guys are on the same page, and unfortunately, Vivian Campbell left after this album to form his own band (Riverdogs which turned out a pretty good album, but lacked any fire power as it was much more acoustical). A definite for any Dio fan and any metal fan.
