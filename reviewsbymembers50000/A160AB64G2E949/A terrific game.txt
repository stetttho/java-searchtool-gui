 About the only thing that disappointed me about this game were the cartoonish graphics. It's not that they were bad because they were actually pretty good, but other RTS (or whatever you consider this game to be) have better graphics and after having played Diablo II, I guess I was expecting a little more eye candy. The single player mission was very long, so there is definitely alot game time to spent here. The story was solid, you get to play about every side of the battle, and challenge was pretty tough for the most part (especially at the end of a chapter). The cutscenes (which usually happened at the beginning or end of a new chapter) were absolutely amazing (as good or better than Diablo II). I felt complete satisfaction to having beat this game. You also have the option of playing 1 on 1 against the computer which to me was extremely tough (was I the only one wondering how the computer gets so much gold when there were only 2 gold mines and you controlled 2 of them?). Seemed like as soon as I got 10 or 15 units done (no upgrades and no specialty units), the computer would attack with 20 or 30 units, then attack again 5 minutes later. It was very tough to beat these. As for the on-line play, I quit that pretty early on when it became obvious that most the players on there just wanted to cheat. That turned me off real quick. But the single player mission is definitely worth the money plus you get a DVD with the cinematics from the game, the soundtrack (which is quite awesome), and a complete book with Warcraft artwork which was pretty cool also. Well worth the money. PLus it has the Blizzard name on it and they have never dissappointed me.
