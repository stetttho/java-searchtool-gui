 If you played Earth 2150, you should be able to pick this game up and play it right away. Almost disapointingly not much has changed from that game. This game is visually stunning with better graphics than C&C: Red Alert2, but not quite as action packed. You get to play all 3 factions which have about 10-13 missions for each faction. The one cool feature is you can build a tank, plane, or turret and put whatever weapon you want on the unit and there are plenty to chose from. The unfortunate thing about this game is it is too much like Earth 2150 and they didn't improve the graphics or the game play. I had a little trouble with the game getting choppy if you tried to zoom out too far (I have a P1000mhz, 64meg video card, 256meg rdram)that gets alittle annoying because you can't see much of the battle field. The music wasn't that great either. But it still a cool game with a lot of good battles and many hours of playing.
