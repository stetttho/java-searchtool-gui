 This movie is hilarious. David Duchovny plays scientist Ira Kane. He used to work for the government but was kicked out because of an incident he caused. Orlando Jones is scientist/vollyball coach Harry Block. Together they investigate a meteor that crashed into the earth. Upon taking a sample, they realize this isn't just old meteor. Eventually the government shows up and the battle begins. Jullianne Moore is a clumsy scientist who works for the government has her funny moments and Sean William Scott of American Pie fame wants to be a fireman is equally funny.With some pretty good special effects and some hi flyin' fun, this movie is a blast. There are some behind the scenes stuff and a replay of the movie with commentary from Ivan Reitman, Duchovny, Jones, and Scott that is almost as funny as the movie. Get this movie. It's alot of fun.
