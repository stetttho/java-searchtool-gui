 This was dubbed the Star Wars for the 90's and it fell short there. But this movie has excellent special effects, great action, and some nice comic moments. The story was very good and very well thought out. The special effects dazzle the mind with the way the city looked, the vehicles, and the weapons. About the only thing that annoyed me was Chris Tuckers character. I just could not stand listening to his annoying high pitched voice and continual wining. He wasn't always annoying, just 90% of the time. Other than that, the movie maintains a pretty fast pace with some awesome battles. A highly recommended movie.
