 The Road to Rome offers new maps (6 of them I believe), new veicles and a few new weapons. These maps are harder to play in instant battle mode than the original give you something new to do when your not on-line. Most of these maps though I have yet to see on-line as it seems the originals just have less lag. But with a whole slew of new things, this will keep you entertained for a while. I wish they had added a campaign mode similar to the original where you played each side on each map, but oh well. What I like are some of these maps play like King of the Hill. You can capture the flag spot, but you can't spawn there. I noticed that some of the other reviews on this page were not for this game but the other games. My suggestion is, if you don't have any of these games, buy the Deluxe Edition. If you have any of these games, buy the expansion packs. On-line, there are over 2000 servers I can connect to and on the weekend, over 13,000 people are on at on time or another. So you can play for a long time on-line and I am sure somewhere you can find a game with these new maps. Happy hunting.
