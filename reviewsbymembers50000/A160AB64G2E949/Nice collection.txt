 All 3 movies at a very nice price. The only thing that really annoyed me was there weren't more special features to view. There are alot listed, but they are very short. I've also read some things about the widescreen format being wrong. If it is, I sure didn't notice a difference. I have recently watched the VHS version and to me it seems like your getting more picture than the VHS version. I didn't buy this because it was widescreen, I bought it because I really enjoy all 3 of these movies. And is rating it lower gonna effect Universal? Not here at least, but I do think more material should have been added to these DVD's. But if you really liked the movies, I would recommend this to anyone, especially becuase the price is right.
