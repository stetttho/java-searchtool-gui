 Secret Weapons is the second expansion pack in this popular series. I believe this one is better than "The Road To Rome". You have more new maps, more weapons and more vehicles. There are 8 or 9 new maps you can play on instant battle or on-line, though it seems 2 or 3 of the new maps are quite laggy when your not playing on-line. But the new maps are very cool are harder to beat than the original maps. and some of these maps have an awesome feel to them. A couple of maps take place at night, and when you are coming up on the battle from a distance and see mortar shells lighting up the night sky and here the Stealth Bomber but can't see it until it passes by a moon lit cloud, it is absolutely awesome.There are only a of things I don't like. One, you can hardly ever find these new maps in an on-line game. Two, some of the new vehicles (like one of the new allie tanks), you drive and have turret to fire from, but the other guy rides in the top of the tank gets unleash a barrage of missiles and only he gets the credit for it. Three, I still don't like when your reinforcement ticket counts down because you don't have half of the flags covered. I can see it counting down if you own all except the main flag, but not for half. Other than that, this game offers more to this fun game. And with the release of new patches (it has become easier to download them finally), they give you new maps. The most recent new map, Attack of The Phillipines, is very cool. There are at least 4 new maps I have seen, so hopefuly they keep releasing new ones (though you can only play these on-line), So buy this and enjoy.
