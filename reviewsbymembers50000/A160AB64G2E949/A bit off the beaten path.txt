 Being off the beaten path is not always a bad thing, but this wasn't what I expected of a Dio album. It has the typical good writing, but the music just isn't there. No songs on this album blow me away although there are many that sound good. When I heard this album, I just couldn't believe the difference between albums with Vivian Campbell and the first one without him. I checked the label to make sure it said Dio on the front. Don't get me wrong. This album is pretty easy to listen to, but it's just not a great album. It's just OK.
