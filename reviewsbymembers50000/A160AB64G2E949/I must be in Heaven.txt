 I bought their first album several years ago. It was one of the best albums I have ever heard. Then, nothing from them for years. About a month ago, I typed in their name and much to my surprise, heres another one. I bought it that day. What a terrific album. These can jam and play excellent ballads. I hope this isn't the last album they put out. They truly no what they are doing. If you want some excellent music, pick this one.
