 With Spielberg and Cruise together, you can't go wrong. And they didn't. A very cool idea about crime fighting. It is the year 2054 and there is a new kind of law enforcement in D.C. called "Precrime" law enforcement. With the help of what they call "precogs", they can see a crime before it happens and stop it, and then they can arrest and put away the assailant. Tom Cruise is Captain John Arderton. Using the precrime system, "wooden" balls are formed with the victims name on it. Holding these balls in his hands using a virtual reality type system, he can see what the precogs see and determine the time, place, and who the killer is. During one of these runs, he see's himself comitting a murder. He starts running to keep out of prison and to find out who set him up, if he indeed was setup. Along the way, he finds out about something called the "Minority Report" which is a report that is filed when one of the three "precogs" has a different image of the crime than the other two. And the only way to get this report is to back to the police station and download it directly from the "precog" that had the other image. The problem is, all over the town and in almost every building, there are eye scanners that track everyone and can alert the authorities as to where any person is. The storyline was very imaginative and very well done. The special effects and action are awesome. This movie will take you on one hell of a ride and keep you on the edge of your seat as you can't wait to see what happens at the end.
