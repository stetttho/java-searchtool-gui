 Being a King fan, I was fairly disappointed in this book. Though he has the ability to capture what could go through a persons mind in a situation like this, I found this book a little slow without much happening. Just alot of walking around in the woods. So if you are looking for the bizarre and something with action that will capture your imagination, this is not it.
