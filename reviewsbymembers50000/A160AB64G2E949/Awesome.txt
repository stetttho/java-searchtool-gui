 This is a truly awesome movie. From the dynamic beginning the surprising ending, this is a terrific movie all the way through. The main character, Maximus, leads his troops into battle in fantasticly setup and executed fight scene like no other I have seen (not even Braveheart). After he is betrayed, he ends up a Gladiator fighting from arena to arena until he finally gets back to Rome. Once in Rome, well, you'll just have to watch for yourself. This is one of the best movies I have seen and definitley the best of 2000. Get this movie.
