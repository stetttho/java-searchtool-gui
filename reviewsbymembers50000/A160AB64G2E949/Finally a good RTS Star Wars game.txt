 I've been waiting for a good Star Wars RTS game and this one is it. And it's a very challenging game. There are many units & structures to build plus plenty of upgrades to strengthen your units. The story was ok, but there weren't any cutscenes and no music was playing while you were playing the game. It made it a little dull. The great thing about the game is for anyone who has played Ages Of Empires II, this game looks and plays alot like AOE2 and also keeps score the same way. That was good and bad. Good because the game was very easy to get the hang of and bad because I felt like I was playing AOE2 again, but just set in the future. But the game looks good and plays very well. And with all the different units to build, this game will give you many options in how you can go about trying to win. There are also some bonus maps where you can change the outcome of previous battles that were lost. Theses battles are very hard and are worth the challenge. And the whole gang was here. You get to play Darth Vader, Luke, Han, Chewie, Obi-Wan, and many other characters. As far as RTS games go, this didn't bring anything new to the genre, but it didn't take anything away either. It is definitley a worthy game and it will take you a while to beat it. Some of the battles are ferocious and will take a long time to beat. Others are lame. But all in all, this game is very solid. May the Force be with you.
