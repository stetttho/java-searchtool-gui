 This game rocks, no if, ands, or buts about it. The graphics are the best I have seen on a first person shooter (Only Half-Life and it's add-ons compare graphically). The cut scenes and the story are excellent. Everything is basically dark in color, but it gives you that WWII feel. The AI is very good as the soldiers duck behind barrels or walls when being fired at. And if you shoot someone in another room they come in with their guns ready. The game is fast paced and runs very smoothly. The on-line play is different from any other. You attack from a beach and try to make it to the objective. Sometimes yu only capture flags. Other times you have to blow up a building and steal gold which you must then take to truck while many opponents try to stop you. This is the best team oriented on-line play I have ever seen. You have 4 choices of characters and each has it's own specialty i.e. an engineer is the only one who can set dynamite.It's the best first person shooter since Half-Life. If you love first person shooters, this is the one for you.
