 Tesla is back. And this is not as good as their other albums, it is still better than alot of what is out there today.  Most of the songs have solid beats and keep you thumping throughout, but what is missing is the classic guitar and dual guitar solo's that really got me in to them back in 1987. Their album Bust A Nut was kind of the same way this one is. I would probably rate this album closer to 3 1/2 stars than 4, but still a good solid album though most Tesla fans probably won't enjoy it.
