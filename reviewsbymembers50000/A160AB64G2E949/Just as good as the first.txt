 I was reading an article updating the movie that is based on Steve Alten's first book "MEG" when I clicked on a link to the website and found that he had a sequel out called "THE TRENCH". I bought the book that very day and what a thrill ride. "THE TRENCH" starts out a few years after the first novel with Jonas Taylor now watching over Angel, the baby shark born at the end of the first book. But Angel has grown significantly larger than her mother. She is 72 feet in length which is 12 feet longer than her mother and weighs several tons more. She is the main attraction at an aquarium owned by Masao Tanaka who is now his father-in-law. After repeated warnings about the shark banging her head against the steel doors that kept her from the ocean, she finally breaks free and goes on quest to return to her home in the trench. His wife Terry and her father Masao take his place aboard a mission in which subs plant mechanical type robots in the ground at the bottom of the oecean in the trench to record any activity that might alert them to a coming monsoon or earthquake. But there is secret plot involved in this. With much suspense, action, and mystery, this book will not let you put it down until you find out what is really going on in the trench.  Just a wonderful book that will keep you wanting more, which you will get when the sequel comes out later this year or the next.
