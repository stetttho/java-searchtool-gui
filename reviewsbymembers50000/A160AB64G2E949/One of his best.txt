 This is definitley one of his best movies. This one is far different from Ace Ventura and The Mask. Jim Carrey plays a man named Bruce Nolan who is a TV reporter in Buffalo. Along the way, there are a few misshaps that lead him to meet GOD played by Morgan Freeman. GOD gives him his powers after Bruce makes a few bad comments about the way he is doing his job and tells him to see if he can do better. He starts off righting some wrongs in his own life and forgets about other's prayers. There are many misshaps and struggles along the way as he tries to figure out what he is supposed to do. With everything that is happening, there are many jokes and funny scenes that make you laugh throughout the whole movie. For me, only Ace Ventura and Liar Liar are as good as this movie. A must for any Jim Carrey fan.
