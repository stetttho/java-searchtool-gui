 Yes. Kate Walker is back. And what a ride. This game has excellent graphics, and good story (although some of the dialog is lame), many different places to go, and a great feel to the game. Syaberia 2 picks up where Syberia left off (there is a button you can click to refresh your memory about the first Syberia game though if you haven't played it, I would play it first before this one because they are both great). You start off in a small town called Romansburg. You have many different things to do before you can go and it is the same with most every place you go. Alot of the puzzles are pretty much common sense but there are a 5 or 6 puzzles that are very hard. It can get to be very tedious and frustrating, but it is very satisfying to solve it and move on. I thought the story was very good and the message that it brings is a good one that most of us should try following. The little cutscenes are well done and the movies are great. There many of these in the game and it is amazing to see them. Especially the last 2. They are pretty incredible. And the sound of the wind blowing and other sounds in the game give it a great feel. When I had my earphones on, I felt like I was actually there. It was great. If you played the first one, you definitely have to have this one. And if you like puzzle games and didn't play the first one, I reccommend you get the first one also and play both. Either way, this game is great.
