 This expansion pack probably made TA: Kingdoms better. This expansion pack has a better story and a new faction that is pretty cool. With alot of new maps, units, scenarios, and a free on-line game mission, this is a great deal. The only problem is this is still a slower paced game in the line of the Command & Conquer series. A shame this game had to follow in the foot steps of the original TA as TA was very fast paced game. If you already have TA: Kingdoms, get this expansion pack and you won't be disappointed, especially the last battle.
