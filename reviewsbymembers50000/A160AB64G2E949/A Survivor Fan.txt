 I am a fan of the Survivor Series, but this game doesn't do it justice though it's not as bad as advertised. You have your choice of which tribe you want to be and which tribe you want to play against. You can either play as one of the Survivors from the TV show or you can make your own custom character. When the game starts, you see some pretty good shots that are from the TV show and you see the real characters when they go fo mail and stuff like that. But then the game gets a little tough too swallow. You have around 3 1/2 to 4 minutes to "talk" to the other characters. It's basically the same questions over and over. Then you have the reward challenge. Some of the challenges are Ok, but most are just stupid. After that, then you go back to "talking" again. Then you do the immunity challenge. If you lose, you vote someone off. There is no way to speed up any of these processes. You have to suffer through some very tedious and boring aspects of this game. The graphics of the characters and of the landscape around you aren't very good and the AI (artificial intelligence) in the game is horrible. I had 3 people in my tribe that I gave weak emotional energy to and talked bad about them and they still thought we had an alliance. A tribe member will say that you should watch yourself and you ask what have you heard and they say not much. That's it. And during the challenges, you can't even see what the other tribe scored or how close to winning they are in most of them. And the internet play, you might as well forget it. I thought it would be fun to play over the internet but because the game doesn't have anyone supporting it, it's nearly impossible find anyone playing it. Now, this game isn't a total waste as it was amusing for a short time and the price is respectable, but they should've put this game together alot better than they did. I'm dissapointed, but at least it amused me for a few hours.
