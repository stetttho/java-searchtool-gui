 Maybe. But the graphics are excellent. Best RTS ever? No way! While it has its moments, it also has its problems. Again, graphics are terrific. Some of the units are cool, but some of the air units they have can't attack anything, so why have them! The missions are a joke for the most part. I played this game for 3 days totaling about 8 hours and beat 14 missions. A little too easy if you ask me. The screen movement is alot like Myth, it ... . Its tough to find a good line of sight and you can't get a good look at the battles going on because if move in too close, then you miss getting attacked somewhere else. Plus they have a bunch of icons all over the screen that block your view. The music is also good. The cinematics were good as was the story. I expected a little more from a Sierra product especially after Half-life. Overall, I did enjoy the game. I would have liked it more if it was a little harder. Kinda of stinks to spend that kind of money for such an easy game.
