 Awesome. That's what best describes what I think of these 2 movies. Not only do you get 2 great movies, but there are many behind the scenes features, deleted scenes, alternate endings, and music videos to keep you laughing for weeks. This has to be the funniest DVD package out there to date. If you loved the movies, then your gonna love this collection. Yeah Baby!
