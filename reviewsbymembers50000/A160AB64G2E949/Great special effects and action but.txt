 ...the plot was defintley lacking. Not much acting going on here. The special effects and action is the only reason this got a 3. When this movie came out, they gave it 3 of 4 stars because of the action and special effects and said it had no plot. They said the same thing about "Gone in 60 Seconds" and gave it 2 stars. Of the 2, I liked "Gone.." better than "Mission...". A big part of why this didn't do it for me was there were too many dead parts. It needed more action. Also, the widesreen really took away from this as about a third of the screen was taken away from top to bottom. I couldn't believe just how narrow it was. Though I did like this movie, if #3 comes out, they better make it more like the 1st one, or it's gonna flop.
