 In comparing The Rock with Vin Diesel, The Rock can at least not embarass himself with his acting. He does a pretty decent job of acting. The only that worried me was the beginning of the movie. Though action packed, I was scared this was gonna be corny. But it turned out to be a decent story with great action and some super stunts. This movie gets rolling and never quits. The action gets very intense, there are some very funny moments, and a little romance. Overall, I think this movie is very cool and will keep your attention throughout.
