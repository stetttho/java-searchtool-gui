 That song alone describes what this album, and more specifically the songs She Don't Know Me & Runaway, did for the career of this band. If you listen to this CD, you will recognize a format that they have used on many subsequent albums. On the song Shot Through The Heart (which is my fav on this one), those are the same words you hear Jon sing at the beginning of You Give Love A Bad Name from the "Slippery" CD. It's amazing to hear how well played and written this first CD is. Especially given that Runaway & She Don't Know Me were demos done at his uncles club (which I believe were redone when the band formed). An Amazing start to what has been an amazing career. Rock On!
