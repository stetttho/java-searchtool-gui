 I think any Koontz fan would enjoy this book. 622 pages long, it could have been cut down. The villain in this book lives his life according to books written by Cesar Zedd. Every time the villain is mentioned, there is  always some kind of reference made to Cesar Zedd (too often and sometimes too long). That got very annoying and took away from the story some.  There are many, many characters involved in this book, but the main character seems to be Barty (Bartholemew), who was born after a tragic event. Most of the events take place when Barty is 3, and it had been discovered very early in his life that he is a prodigy, someone destined for much greater things. At the same time he was born, a little girl is born during another tragic event, and she has ties that are yet unknown to some of the charcters in this book. On that same day, you find out who the villain is and meet another character, Tom Vanadium, who has connection to some of these other characters as well. The story basically strolls along for the first 400 or 450 pages or so with a few suspenseful moments, some surprises, and some sadness as the story begins to bring all that you have read together brilliantly with even more surprises, more suspense, and more sadness. But reading those last 170 to 200 pages is why I gave this book as good as review as I did. This book makes you think & wonder if some of what you read is possible or not. If you get this book, be prepared for a long read, but when you finally get to the end, well, thats for you to find out.
