 This is a game any CSI fan will enjoy. It is fairly challenging and has some pretty good mysteries though they needed more than 5. The graphics are solid and you hav many tools at your disposal to solve each murder. The only problem's (other than too few murders to solve) is that you don't get alot of places to go for each murder and you have a bonus thing you get at the end of each murder you solve when Gil Grissom evaluates the job you did. No matter how many times I played, I couldn't get a 100% on a couple of the murders I solved. I found out that you need to download a patch that fixes that bug. I got to see all of the bonus stuff, but it really wasn't worth it. The game could have been better done, but all in all, I enjoyed the game and it had some pretty good graphical cutscenes. Most puzzle solver game players will enjoy this also.
