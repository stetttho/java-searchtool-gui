 C&C Generals is definitely one of the best RTS games there ever has been. And with the low price for the game and the expansion, this is a great deal. Generals was a very solid game. A good challenge with excellent graphics and gameplay. the only problem I had was the difficulty settings. If you play this on easy, it was too easy. It you played it on hard, it was extremely hard. Other than that, the only other thing would be that I wouldn't reccommed this game if your computer is below the following: P3 1000mhz, 256 ram, 64meg video card. It was quite laggy, but playable. I upgraded to a P4 2.8mhz, 256ram, 128meg video card and this game played great on the highest settings.  You also get the expansion pack Zero Hour which I believe is the second best expansion pack ever (behind only Warcraft 3). You get 15 more missions that are pretty challenging with more units, maps, and just plain fun.  There is also something called the Generals challenge which allows you to choose 1 of 9 different generals and you play against the other generals in 7 different battles (they mix them up depending on which general you choose). And this is quite challenging (again, don't play this on easy as it is too easy) and very fun. You can also use these generals for games vs the computer opponents or for on-line/LAN play. The generals give you more units and buildings. this expansion pack is what really makes this game rock. Alot of replay value here.  If you haven't gotten any of the C&C Generals games yet, here is your chance to get the  whole thing at a great price and enjoy a great game.
