 This is the first game Blizzard released that I bought, and boy what a choice. The grahpics are wht got me to keep checking out this game, but a guy I worked with kept telling how awesome this was and how awesome the on-line play was. And I tell you what. This game was awesome all the way through. Turning every corner, not knowing what was there and then being attacked by horde after horde of every kind of monster imaginable, this game continually kept my adrenalin pumping. The final fight with Diablo in the end was alot tougher than the one in Diablo2 and was a very challenging game. 3 character classes to choose from and many weapons, magic items, and shields to choose from. This is one of the best games ever released and a must for any gamer.
