 I have been a fan of Command and Conquer since the beginning. And I look forward to every game they bring out. This is by far the best looking game in the series. You can zoom in on the veicles and buildings and the detail come in view without being fuzzy. I run this game with everything set on high and runs very good (I have Pentium III 1000, with 256 ram and a 64 meg video card). I was a little dissappointed when I first started playing the first set of missions China) as it seemed too easy and they were almost all short missions (except the lsat couple), but as you moved on to the the other 2 factions, it kept getting harder and harder and I started liking this game more and more. A couple of things I don't like is playing skirmish mode. When playing a skirmish, it seems the balance is off in favor of China. You can build bunkers (that will hold 5 guys, I like putting rocket launchers in them) and machine gun turrets) if I get those built quickly, the defense is too strong to get through, but the GLA and USA don't have those type of defenses and it's not easy (depending on the difficulty level you choose). And the difficulty level is touchy. If you play normal, it seems pretty easy ( I was winning with China playing against 5 computer opponents and only losing less than 10 units every game). But if you move up to Hard, and play against more than computer opponent, you get mowed over (unless you are playing as China). A little bit of balance issue I think, but this is still a very fun game. I you want more of a challenge, you can also go on-line, though you have to wait for a while sometimes for games to end so you can join. It is still a worthy effort, but I miss old but scenes they used to have. Any fan of this series will definteley enjoy.
