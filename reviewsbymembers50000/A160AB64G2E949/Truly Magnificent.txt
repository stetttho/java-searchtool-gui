 This is one of King's best books. It is called a haunted love story, and for the most part it is. It covers almost every aspect including a little "wierdness" that usually accompanies a King novel. The main character, Mike Noonan, is a best selling novelist who's wife passed away suddenly. While finding little clues about what his wife was hiding from him, he a dilema of his own: writers block. To solve this problem, he returns to their place at the lake they called Sara Laughs and tries to write. But while their, he starts seeing shadows and items shuffling around the cabin. Then he meets a much younger woman who's husband was killed and has young daughter. He finds out that they are having trouble with her father-in-law. Many many problems to solve and only one book to solve them all. A must for any King fan and those who are not will be very surprised at how well written this is. I read the last 325 pages in one night and it gave me chills.
