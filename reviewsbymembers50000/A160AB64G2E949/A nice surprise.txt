 If you love sharks and/or dinosaurs, this is the book for you. What can be better than a 60 foot white luminescent shark wreaking havoc on anything that gets in it's way. Jonas Taylor is the main character of the book as a scientist who 7 years earlier had killed 2 other men when he surfaced their submersible too quickly while panicking saying he saw a Meg in the dark depths of the ocean. Now, hired by Masao Tanako, who owns a large "water park" (for lack of a better word at the moment), to capture the Meg in the trench. Upon descending, a Meg indeed shows up and gets caught in the cables. As they try to escape and free this beast, another Meg, a pregnant female, shows up and kills the male and follows the warm blood trail to the ocean surface. Thus begins many great chases, near misse, and as much suspense as one can take in reading this book. Many will think "Jaws" when they look at this, but Jaws is a baby compared to this. This is a fast paced book that you won't be able to put down and with a surpise (well, maybe not surprise) ending.
