 This is the first PC game I ever bought. With it's awesome graphics and compelling story, it's easy to see why this is the top selling game of all-time. In it's time, this game and The 7th Guest changed the way gaming was to be. Most point and click games you see today are following these 2 trend setting games, but it's very hard for them to match up to what these games accomplished. It has some very tough puzzles and about the only lacking was there isn't much going on when you click on an area except for sound which is a key for most of the puzzles you will be solving. If you like point and click games with puzzles to solve, this is the game for you. A thoroughly enjoyable game that I have played close to a dozen times.
