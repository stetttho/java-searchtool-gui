 but this game just doesn't have enough content. Only 9 new missions and some of them are very short. You do get 12 new multiplayer maps, but most of them are very small which has resulted in alot of spawn killing which tick off alot of people and a couple of the new maps have so much stuff going on that it lags like crazy, even on a cable modem which is what I have. But I really like some of the new maps better than the most of the old ones (too bad they don't do what Half-Life did and give you a map maker. I had over 200 maps on that game and it kept the game fresh for me for over 3 years). As for the single player mission, though it is short, it is also very intense and actually pretty hard. Overall, I thinks this is worth it, but maybe not for the price it started out at. There just isn't enough here to warrant that.
