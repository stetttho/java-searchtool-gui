 For me, this album seemed to have a little more kick to it than the previous 2 albums. With Riding Into The Sun, which was actually a B-side from Hysteria, to Fractured Love & Ring Of Fire, these guys show they can write some excellent tunes and play very catchy riffs. Also the tunes Two Steps Behind & Miss You In A Heartbeat solidified their ballad capabilities. With From The Inside, this is an off the wall totally different tune that I have ever heard from these guys.  Basically, this album had a better feel to me and looked like they were headed in the right direction to make another Pyromania (if that is really possible). But, whatever these guys put out, one things for sure. I will be in,line to purchase it.
