 It's been a long wait, but finally it is here. Indian Jones on DVD. 3 great movies plus an extra DVD with behind the scenes stuff from all 3 movies. Raiders of the Lost Ark is probably the best story of the three and is one incredible movie. They even fixed the scene where Indiana falls in front a snake, but you can see it's reflection in the window that seperated Harrison Ford from the snakes (VHS version). You can't see it now. The Temple of Doom was a very good movie though not as good as Raiders. It was funnier than Raiders, but something about the story just didn't captivate me like Raiders. The Last Crusade is my personal favorite. It is probably the funniest of the 3. After changing lanes in story for Temple of Doom, they returned to the religious roots of Raiders with an exceptional story packed with action. And the behind the scenes stuff on the extra DVD is excellent. There is plenty of content here with new information that you probably haven't heard before. This is a must buy for all Indian Jones fans. You won't be dissappointed.
