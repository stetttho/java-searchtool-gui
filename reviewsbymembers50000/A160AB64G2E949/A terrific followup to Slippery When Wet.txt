 After the awesome success of Slippery When Wet, the band had to be intimidated by thought of following that album up. But if they were, they don't show it as this album blisters. These guys aren't your let your hair grow to your ass musicians who can't really play and just got where they were because of the way they looked. These guys can play. Bad Medicine, Lay Your Hands On Me, & Living In Sin are killer tunes and Richie Sambora is underated as a guitarists. They right terrific lyrics and add fantastic instrument playing to make truly awesome and unforgettable songs. No Bon JOvi collection should be without this one.
