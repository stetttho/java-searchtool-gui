 Was this game very challenging? No. But it was a blast to play. The puzzles were very "real" and by real I mean that you would find an item and you pretty much knew what you were going to do with it. The puzzle got a little harder once you got to the Castle, but this game only took me about 6 or 7 hours to beat. But the graphics and the cut scene were excellent. The music set the tone for every area you went to. It was very eerie and creepy. I would rate this game closer to 3 1/2 stars because it just wasn't a serious challenge, but for the price it was well worth it.
