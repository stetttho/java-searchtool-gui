 I have liked every game Dreamcatcher has ever released, but this one was a little tough to swallow. In typical Dreamcatcher fashion, the graphics are wonderful and the music is very relaxing and laid back. I think the reason for the calming music was the fact that this game is very annoying. Now. I consider myself to be pretty good at solving puzzle games, and if I get stuck, I call a couple of friends and we work these out together. But neither of us liked this game very well. the clues aren't detailed enough and many of these puzzles are repititious. You don't know if you have done the puzzle right until the end of that sequence. Very annoying. when they speak to you, it's like your speaking to Confuscious. Very hard to discern the clues they are giving. My suggestion is spend your money on another Dreamcatcher game: Traitors Gate. That is a game worthy of all point and click puzzle solving game players.
