 A typical Dio album with good songwriting and good music behind, but if you heard Dio's first 2 albums, you get a sense something was missing: Vivian Campbell. Craig Goldie is a good guitarist, but Vivian can just out and out wail on a guitar. My favorite on here is Overlove and overall, this is a very good CD. Worth any Dio fans money.
