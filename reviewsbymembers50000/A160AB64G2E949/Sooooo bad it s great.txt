 This is a cool album. While Jake E. Lee was never really excepted by many Ozzy fans because he had to follow Randy Rhoads, he has done excellent on his own. He has his own distinctive way of playing and the guitars on here are raw and scorching. With Ray Gillen singing, these guys fit like a glove together. The last time, Whiskey Dust, 3 Day Funk, and Silver Horses are just my favs and they smoke. This is a truly awesome album. Definitley as good as the first without sounding like the first one. It has its own sound and definitley rocks. Get this one.
