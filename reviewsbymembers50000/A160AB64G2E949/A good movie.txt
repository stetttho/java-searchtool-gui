 No this is nothing like the TV series. But this is a very good movie. It did take too long to get to see the Hulk, but once you did, it was pretty incredible. I didn't like the jumping thing the Hulk did throughout the movie, but aside from that, I thought it captured the comic book side pretty good (though he doesn't speak excpet for one little line). The extra DVD has some pretty incredible stuff and even gives you the dimensions of the Hulk based on his anger level. Overall, this was a pretty good movie and once the movie got rolling, it didn't really slow down (the dog fight scene was very cool).
