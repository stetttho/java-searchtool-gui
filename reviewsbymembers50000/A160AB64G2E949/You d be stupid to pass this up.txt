 Only**** for 2 excellent games. Fallout won Role-Playing game of the year back in 1997. With fantastic graphics, a good story, and good game play, this was very enjoyable to play. In this game, you learn about the Vaults that were built when nuclear war became imminent. Years after the war, you are sent out as many others were to find a water chip as your supply depleting. You have a time limit to find the water chip, but when that task is done, the game is not. There is much to do in the Fallout world where you will find friends to help you out and will have many weapons at your disposal. Fallout2 take place 80 years after the first. You are the Chosen one. A descendent of the original character from the first game, you are sent on a mission to find the Garden of Eden Creation Kit which will restore the land in your village. This is a very large game. More area to cover, more missions to accomplish, more weapons, and more enemies to thrash. The gameplay and graphics are slightly better than the first, but this is also a very enjoyable game. Both games are turn based when fighting and you can create your own character. There is lotsa blood and very graphic when killing an enemy and there is plenty of adult themes and adult language, but you can tone it down with the adjuster. Overall, you will not find a better value and will be hard pressed to find games that are much better than these.
