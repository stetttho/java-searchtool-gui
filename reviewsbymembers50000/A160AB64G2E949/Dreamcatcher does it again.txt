 They again have created a game with great graphics, great music & sound, and a solid storyline all for an affordable price. This is probably more like a 9 stars out of 10 game (I just couldn't bring myself to only give this a 4), but this adventure is uite awesome. I only have a few complaints. One, you have a cell phone that only helps you 2 or 3 times throughout the game. You get all of these calls and it is nothing but a bunch of annoying gibberish. Two, the story starts to fade the deeper you get into the game until you get closer to the end. And 3, some of the things are repititious and that gets annoying (though this is typical of most puzzle games). The places you visit are just awesome. Everything is done in high detail and the cutscenes are very well done (the same software used to make Diablo & Warcraft III's cutscenes is used for this game). The sound effects are so real and the music sets the tone for every place you visit. The only other complaint I have are that the puzzles weren't very hard. Everything you find in the game becomes pretty obvious as to where you will use it. The only suggestion I have is to make sure you look at every area or you just my miss something. They seem to like to have alot of activity going on in a room just to distract you from finding an object that you will need to continue. The ending left a little something to be desired, but from what I have read on some gaming sites, a sequel to this game is already on the works. After you beat this game, you can gon back and watch all of the cutscenes over and over again if you want. This game is no doubt worth the time and the money and it is a very large world with many things to look at and many things to do and many many hours of gameplaying fun. Good luck on your adventure.
