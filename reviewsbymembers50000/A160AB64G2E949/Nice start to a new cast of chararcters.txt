 A good fast read. Very hard to put down. I'm guessing the reader who gave this 1 star is against women being the lead character or something becaue I enjoyed this book and can't wait for the follow up. Four women (a detective, coroner, reporter, and a prosecutor) form the Women's Murder Club. The book focuses mainly on the detective, Lindsey, as she is the who formed the club and chose it's members. After a series of horrible murders of newlyweds, they can't seem to solve the case and she takes to working with these other 3 ladies to try and figure it out. As typical with Patterson, there are many twists and turns, and just when you think you know the answer, it turns out your wrong. The only thing I didn't like, and it seems to be the case with about every novel like these, is that the lead character is single and doesn't trust dating or love, but falls in love quickly and eventually sleeps with someone too quickly. Other than that, this book pleases very much. A must for Patterson fans.
