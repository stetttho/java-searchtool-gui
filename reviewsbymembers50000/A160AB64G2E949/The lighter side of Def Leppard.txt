 This band will always be my favorite. But every since Pyromania, the have gotten softer and softer, and every once in a while they crank it up a little. Though this will never be my favorite album,I will remember this as probably their best written album. The more I have listened to this, the more it grows on me. The songs Now, Scar, & Four Letter Word pack some punch. But for the most part this is a mellow and very deep thinking album. It covers every aspect of love from the pain to the cheating heart to pure love. I have heard this CD at least 100 times since I got it 2 weeks ago and I can't get enough. If your looking for Pyromania, High & Dry, or even Hysteria, this aint' it. This completley different from anything they have done before, but it still has the Leppard touch. I highly recommend this CD.
