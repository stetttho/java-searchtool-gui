 This is probably the best animated Christmas story of all and definitely one of the most remembered. Who can forget about Sam the Snowman, Herbie (I want to be a dentist), Yukon Cornelius, the Abominable Snow Monster, and of course, Rudolph. I have watched this every year for at least the last 25 years. But now I don't have to check the TV Guide to find out when it's coming on. I can watch it whenever I want. When I was young, I used to wonder if my toys talked (wonder if this is where Toy Story got their idea). A perfect family movie that will make you laugh, cry, and be a little frightened. Excellent is all I have left to say.
