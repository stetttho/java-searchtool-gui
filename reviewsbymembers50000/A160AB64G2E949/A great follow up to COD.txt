 I really enjoyed this game. What made COD so great is also found here in this game.  You have very intense action, great graphics and sound, and pretty good missions. The action was so intense at times that it almost wasn't fun because you couldn't really enjoy the scenery.  I see some reviews talking about how they don't like it because it is scripted. News flash: Every game is scripted. Only the games that are coming out now (though not released yet) like Half Life 2 and Medal of Honor Pacific Assault are not gonna be scripted. As for all other like RTCW, MOHAA, and Doom 3, they are scripted. So don't let that deter you because this games action never stops.  My only real complaint is that the SP is too short. You have 13 missions, but no mission last much more than maybe 30 minutes. You have maybe 6 hours of game time here not including the reloading you will have to do when you die. And this game is hard. That is probably why most don't like it. It is hard on every setting.  As for MP, it is a little better now. The aiming of the gun for SMG's still sucks, but the maps are better designed and a lot better to play. Some of the new weapons are cool too. They also have a sprint key you can use now to run quickly for a few seconds until you are "rested". The new modes aren't anything great, but are still fun. If they would have just fix the aiming, this would be even better.  Overall, this expansion pack rocks. If you haven't gotten the origianl COD yet, wait unitl they put both COD and this expansion together and buy it. It will be worth the money. If you have COD, get this expansion. You will only be dissappointed in how short the games is.
