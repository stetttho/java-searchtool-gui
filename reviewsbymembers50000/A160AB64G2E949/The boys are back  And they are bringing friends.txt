 This had me so caught up, I quit playing Medal of Honor: Allied Assault on-line for 2 weeks because I couldn't enough. Compared to the original Commandoes, this was easier, it just took longer. But don't let that fool you, this game is tough. There are lotsa new features added to this version, so let me list a few: 1. New characters. There are 3 new characters in this one: Natasha (the beautiful distracter of men), Lupin (the thief), and a dog (that you can use to distract the enemy or transport items back and forth) 2. New battle areas such as under water, in planes, boats, and destroyed villages. 3. New enemies. This time, you have to fight nature a little bit in the form of sharks and alligators & pirahna's. 4. A new bonus map system. If you find all of the bonus pieces, you get to try a bonus map after you complete the mission you are on, and some of them are tough too. I believe mission 9 is the only that doesn't have a bonus map. The graphics are great (except when you zoom in) and the cutscenes are awesome. They almost look real. It will take a long time to beat these missions, so be patient and be ready for the long haul of a great game that gets real intense.
