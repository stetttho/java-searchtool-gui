 Having been a huge Dokken fan, it has been tough with the on again off again relationship of Lynch and Dokken.  But with this album, Lynch and Pilson have put together an album better than Dokkens last 4 albums.   With Pilson's voice sounding alot like Don Dokken, this album sounds more like the Dokken of the mid to late 80's than the Dokken we have now (though I have liked the Dokken albums too). Great lyrics, musicianship, and just plain rockin', this album is very good. I like every song here and some of them really stand out. Lynch can still play a mean guitar and that was what was missing from the last 2 Dokken albums that Lynch played on.  If you liked Dooken or Lynch Mob, oyu won't be dissapointed in this very well done album.
