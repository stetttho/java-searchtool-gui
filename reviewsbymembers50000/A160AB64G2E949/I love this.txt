 I loved this mouse from the first time I got it. It may be a little big, but you get used to it. With the other mouses I have used, they were all a little too small. When I used them, my wrist used to touch the mouse pad or table and I have spot that is callused up on the bone by my wrist. This is a little bigger and I don't have that problem. Also, this is a great mouse for gamers (I use this for Half-Life all the time and it's great). You have 2 buttons on the side, 2 on top, and a spin wheel that if you push it down, it is actually a fifth button. With no cleaning necessary because of the laser light and no mouse pad necessary, this mouse just glides. When surfing the net, you can use the wheel to scroll web pages with ease. This is the mouse for you if you want something that makes the little things in life a little easier. Enjoy.
