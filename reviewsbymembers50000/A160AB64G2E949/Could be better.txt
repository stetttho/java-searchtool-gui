 Being a large C&C fan, it was great seeing the buildings, the vehicles, and the NOD forces from this perspective. All in all, the game was fun to play and have faster paced action tha MOHAA. But this game misses on a few things: 1. The AI is the worst of any recent FPS game I have played. 2. The on-line game play is very laggy and with everyone just building vehicles, it was boring 3. The cut scenes, though pretty well done, looked like they were painted on 4. The end bosses (there were only 3 or 4 thank god) were terrible. You can't out run or out manuever them. All you can do is stand there in front of them and keep shooting till they die. Here is what was good other than what I have already mentioned: 1. The graphics were better than some of the reviews were saying (If your graphics aren't very good, its time for a better video card) 2. The music is awesome 3. Nick Havoc is a very cool character 4. The weapons were pretty cool. Got to use every weapon more than once. Some games like RTCW & MOHAA, you were able to get through the game only using about half of the weapons available. 5. Driving many vehicles. You get to use many different vehicles and fight other vehicles Overall, I liked this game alot, but compared to RTCW & MOHAA, something was missing. A little hint while playing the game. If you find some of your other weapons running low on ammo (and you will because on different levels, enemies only use certain weapons), use your little pistol and aim for the head. You would be surprised at how quickly some enemies will die with one pistol shot to the head. I would recommend this game unless you are looking for good on-line game, then I would tell you to look elsewhere. Happy hunting.
