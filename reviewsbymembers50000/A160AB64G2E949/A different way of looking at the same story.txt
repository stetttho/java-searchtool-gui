 For those of you who have read Koontz novels before, you will recognize the same formula, only told differently. The characters, Marty, Dusty, and their dog Valet are great. The only question I had was how were they so wonderful when the families (mainly Dusty's) are stuffy and just plain not nice people. The story was good enough to keep me interested until I got to page 180 or so. Then I was totally sucked in and could not put this book down. That was roughly when the story started to fall into place and make sense and you found out who the villain was. Many of the other characters in the story were enjoyable and interesting and the story really started to pick up speed and keep you at the edge of your seat. The villain was definitley interesting, especially as the story reflected back on the past as to what the villain had done and how he came to be.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
