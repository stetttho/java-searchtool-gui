 This another solid effort by Godsmack. I keep hearing and reading that this album sounds too much like the first one. Well, it does. But what's wrong with that. My friends have every ACDC album and all of them sound the same, so why should this matter. If it works, why change. And this definitely works. Very solid beats with some pissed off lyrics thrown in for good measure. You can crank this up and shake the windows non stop if you want. Awake is a very good song as is Vampires which has  no lyrics (just some talking in the background) and it just thumps. If you can't quite get into Creed because they are a little too mellow, then try Godsmack on for size. They guys have a kick that sounds soooo sweet.
