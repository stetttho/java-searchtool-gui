 It had some funny parts. It had a couple of hilarious parts. But all in all, this movie was just average. I loved Ben Stiller in Something About Mary, and I'm sure everyone who saw this was looking at that movie also. But something was missing. Deniro trying to be funny was only funny in spots. Owen Wilson did a good job as usual, but the rest was just blah. So far, I have found only a handful of people who have enjoyed this movie thoroughly. It had the potential but just didn't click. Stiller spent most of his time in this movie either breaking something, catching it on fire, or just saying the wrong thing. Could anyone really blow it this bad?
