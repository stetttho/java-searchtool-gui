 I never played UT, so this is very new to me, but this game is a blast. I keep hearing how awesome the graphics were, and though they are very good, I think Wolfenstein & MOHAA are better. What seperates this game from them is the fast paced action. And I do mean fast. This may be the fastest paced game I have ever played. There are several cool maps, unique weapons, and tons of action. The single player mission isn't very hard. It seems to me that this was made just to teach how to play, but it was still very fun. The last match is incredibly tough. You also have instant action which places you on one of the maps against 4 or 5 computer players. It is fun, but not very hard. The hardest thing for me is figuring out the secret moves you can do after you have collected some adrenalin. I'm still having trouble with that. The multiplay is really good. I was surprised how little lag there has been. I have not had trouble getting into a game yet and it hasn't gotten so laggy that I had to find another game. There's alot of gore & bad language and the music and sound effects are very solid. You can play deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag, and bombing run (I don't understand that name since you are trying push some kind of ball through a portal of some sort. Kind of lame if you ask me) so there are plenty of playing options and there are already new maps coming out. If you want plenty of action to get your adrenalin pumping, this is your game.
