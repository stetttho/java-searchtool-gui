 I had read on Gamespot that this game was more of the same and that you should spend your time and money elsewhere. To a point I agree with them. You do some of the same things as you did in the other games like stealing papers to get by guards and having to ride in a vehicle and shoot the targets and hope you have any health left. But I like all of these games and the familiarity keeps me wanting more. The single player game is longer than Spearhead and you get 9 more multi player maps and a new mode, liberation, for on-line play. The only problem is that most of the new maps were too laggy (I found that only about 3 of these maps were not laggy, and I have a cable modem) though they were all done very nicely. Liberation was pretty cool in the fact that when you were killed, you were put in jail and had to hope that your teammates could get you out of jail, which made for some tremendous battles. Except for some of the things I mentioned earlier, there wasn't much else I didn't like about the game. Any true fan will enjoy the new maps, weapons, and modes this game has to offer. A worthy eaxpansion.
