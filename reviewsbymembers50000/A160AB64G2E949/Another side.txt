 This album has a different look and feel from their other albums. This is also the first album in which Vivian Campbell (Formally with Dio) actually wrote a couple of the songs and played some guitar. This is a fairly mellow album with alot of slick smooth beats and very well written lyrics. Truth?, Breathe a Sigh, and Deliver Me hi-lite this album that while not quite what most Leppard fans expect is a rather well played and put together album. I'm alot of fans (I know alot critics put this album down, but what do they know) probably stayed away from this album, but I guess that's their loss.
