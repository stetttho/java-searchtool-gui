 I reviewed this once (I even named the game wrong), but I have upgraded my computer and tried again. And what a wonderful game I have found. There are many levels with many different objectives to complete. And they are very challenging. The AI is pretty solid and once you are found, they will chase you almost to the death. The graphics are still pretty solid and sound is still pretty good. Though my first experience wasn't very good, I am glad that I kept this game and tried it again many years later. I was totally drawn into the game and the story and can't wait until Garrett comes back in Thief 3 (which I beleive is already out.) Though the game is slowed paced and tedious at times, it was still very enjoyable and very challenging. I don't think I could take too many games like this (Thief and Commandos series are probably the only 2 I will get into), but I will definitely get every sequel they release for this series unless the really screw up and ruin this series with a lame game (it has already happened to 2 other series I really enjoyed: Lord of the Realms and Commandos). This is a must for Thief 1 lovers and anyone getting into this genre will want to start with Thief 1 and 2 before getting Thief 3. A very good game.
