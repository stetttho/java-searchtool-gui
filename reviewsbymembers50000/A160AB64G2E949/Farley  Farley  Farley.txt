 Pretty awesome if you ask me. I'd give this 4 1/2 stars if I could. With his screaming and yelling till his face turns red and belly flopping on furniture, this is a hoot. Just wish some of the segments went on a little bit longer. A great tape to remember Chris Farley by. If you think he's funny, buy this. It'll keep you rolling with laughter throughout.
