 This Cd is definitely better than Native Tongue. The original Poison lineup is back together for this one. And there are quite a few songs that have the old Poison feel like Devil Woman, Hollywierd, & Wishful Thinkin', but with a heavier beat. And there are plenty of rockers like Sqeeze Box, Shooting Star, & Wasteland. Emperor's New Clothes rocks, but has a different sound from any song they have ever done. Livin'In The Now is even more kickin' and sounds nothing like Poison, but it may be one of the best tracks. The only thing missing here is a ballad that Poison again & again have shown the excel at. There is not a ballad to be found here, but what you get are 13 rockin' and adrenalin pumpin' songs that show Poison can still crank it out with the best.
