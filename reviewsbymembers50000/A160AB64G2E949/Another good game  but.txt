 I love the Medal of Honor series. And I could not wait to play Pacific Assault.  The graphics were very good. The main problem though was that I couldn't turn everything up (I have a P4 2.8, 1gb ram, 128mb Geforce fx 5200 video card) or this game was extremely laggy. It was even worse on-line. I can only imagine what it would look like with everything turned up.  The sound was very good. Everything sounded life like and with headphones on it was eveb better.  The gameplay was excellent. I did hate the levels trapped in forest. It seemed like a  1/3 of the game were levels like this. But it also made it different from all other WWII FPS games. It looked nothing like those other games. And when the Japanese soldiers started losing, they would banzai charge you. There were a couple of levels where they just kept charging and you wondered if it would ever end. And you didn't pick up health on the ground like the other games. You had to wait for a medic to heal you and your buddies, but he could only heal you so many times. The levels outside of the jungle though were the best and most of the missions were solid, action packed, and very intense. This game was almost as intense as the Call of Duty games.  As for the on-line side, it wasn't very good. The choice of servers isn't very good and there weren't alot of those that seemed to have people playing. Some of the maps I had seen weren't designed very well and I couldn't find anyone playing the objective based servers. It was all deathmatch. I haven't really spent much time playing it (been playing Counterstrike Source, Half-Life 2 death match, and Tribes:Veangeance), but hopefully more people and servers will show up and there will be chances to play it. But then the game is also very laggy (I have a DSL connection at 3Mbps). I guess I will have to get a new cpu to keep with next generation of games.  Overall, I give this game a good rating as I was really wound up playing this game.
