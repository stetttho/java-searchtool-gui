 Having already reviewed this game earlier, this is an update. I recently downloaded the second patch for this game, and there wasnt any change. So I deleted this game completely from my system (this is another story because when I tried to reload the game, the option to install wouldn't hi-lite. What a nightmare) and reloaded the patch. It definitley played alot better.  The graphics are still worse than Battlefield 1942 (I am playing this game on Dell system, 2.8mhz processor, 512 ram, 128meg video card, and DSL). I have turned up all the graphics to the best and the worse and this game still has some lag, though it is no where near what it was. Before my guy would barely move if at all. Now I can at least venture out into the map and do some things. But the fact that my ping says I am running around 50 or 60 (which is usually better than half the people playing), I should be able to get around better than that. It also still takes an extremely long time to load a map. Sometimes, it takes around 5 minutes. Thats way too long. but as I stated in my earlier review, the soundtrack is cool and the idea is cool. It just doesn't all come together. I read one review that he loaded this on all kinds of different computers that were low end and they all played the game fine. I don't believe that for a second. Just reading a bunch of the reviews from BF1942 fans saying they had problems was enough for me to believe there is something wrong. I also read a review that said they had the same problem with BF1942. I looked at reviews for that game and didn't see any complaints that resembled what people are saying about this one. All I do is keep waiting for the next patch with the hopes that they fix all of the problems they have right now. Until then, I will continue to play Medal of Honor and wait for the next FPS games to come out which will be very soon.
