 Though I like this game, it could've been much better. The graphics aren't good on some things like the explosions. They look cheesy. You blow up a turrett and all you see is pieces flying. The ground has no detail and the bushes are generic. One of the good things from the first to the second is that the machine gun hits a little better, but only a little. The jet pack doesn't have enough energy, especially when your plasma gun pulls from that. The connection isn't that great either as you seem to constantly get a slow connection (and mind you I have a PIII 1000mhz, 256 rdram, 64meg video card, and I have a cable modem).Some of the other weapons are just stupid, but there are some cool features. You can play3 different warrior classes. And I love the team play function (Though some people who play this have no clue about team play). They could have made this better on many levels, but it look like they were trying to beat the rush of new games coming out like Half-Life: Blue Shift, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, & the new Duke Nukem. They should have taken their time and made this better (which is probably why sales haven't been very good). It's still a fun game, but it coudl've been better.
