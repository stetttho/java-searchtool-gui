 What was wrong with this book? Only one thing I don't like about her books is she constantly covers the past of all of her characters in almost every book. It's probably good for new readers, but for readers who read her since the beginnng, it gets a little annoying. I thought this was a very cool story.From the start this book just keeps on gaining momentum in the classic Scarpetta tradition. The book opens with a body found in a shipping cargo box on the docks. Then Scarpetta's neice, Lucy, is involved in misshap down in Florida when one of her undercover operations goes bad. In her office, her staff members keep complaining of missing items, wierd e-mails from her, and her not getting back with people. And with Christmas around the corner, thoughts of Benton are stil fresh in her mind. To top it all off, there is a new Chief in town, Diane Bray, and she is looking to get rid of Scarpetta after she has already demoted Pete Marino from a detective. With the murders in Richmond piling up, she gets summoned overseas to discover the same MO over there. Alot of stuff going on at the same time that eventually leads up to alot of surprises and an exiting ending that doesn't really end as you will find out when you buy "The Last Precinct". This is basically a 2 part story (so far as I know right now). If you miss out by not reading this, you are really missing out.
