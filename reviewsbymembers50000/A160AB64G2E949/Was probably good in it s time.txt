 I have enjoyed the Kings Quest series very much, but I didn't get started until Kings 5. I got this set, but the gameplay and graphics, though a head of their time in their day, was real tough to play in this current day and age. While these all have great stories, graphically and challenging wise, Kings Quest 6 & 7 are the only 2 that are really playable now. Kings 7 is graphically very good and the story and gameplay is pretty cool. The only thing missing from this set is The Mask Of Eternity which is actually Kings Quest 8. Graphically, it's a stellar upgrade over these and the gameplay is faster paced with alot less puzzles to solve. Roberta Williams was definitley ahead of her time and I hope she continues to create these Kings Quest games(go to gamespot.com and look for an article on Roberta Williams. It was an excellent story).
