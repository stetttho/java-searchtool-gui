 I thought this was an awesome movie. Not only did they keep the main characters from first movie together, but they had better and cooler special effects and tied the this movie together with what happened in the first one. This movie had alot more action in it and more special effects. Also on this DVD is many many special features like interviews with just about everyone and an egyptian type dictionary. This DVD is packed with hours and hours of fun and interesting entertainment. But this DVD and enjoy the ride.
