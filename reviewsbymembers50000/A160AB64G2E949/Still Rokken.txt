 Dokken can still rock with the best. I was a little disappointed with alot of the guitar work on this album as it always seemed to be more powerful. I have always been a George Lynch fan and have missed him the last 2 albums, but the previous album, Erase The Slate, was done excellently with Reb Beach. Now with John Norum at the helm, it definitely has a different sound, but that is not a bad thing.The lyrics seem a little dark and depressing on most of the songs, but Don's voice still remains. And this album rocks pretty good.Sunless Day, Under the Gun, and Magic Road are 3 good rockers and the song I've Found is a great ballad. I'd say there isn't a bad song on the CD.I didn't like this one as much as Erase The Slate, but it's a definite buy for any Dokken fan.
