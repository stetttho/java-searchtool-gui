 This is a visually stunning film. And yes, this is geared toward children. But there are a few scenes (i.e. violence & death) that aren't exactly appropriate for young kids, but given Disney's past movies, this shouldn't be a problem as they all have their "scary" moments. As for the story, it's basically a bunch of dinosuars that were forced to move in search of a new home after a meteor struck the earth. The main character, Aladar, and his "family", which are prehistoric monkeys that raised him after they stumbled across his egg, happen across these dinosuars and join up with them. I like childrens movies, and this one was  very good. It was funny, sad, and entertaining.
