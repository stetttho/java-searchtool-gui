 I remember reading reviews about how this game was gonna save gaming. Whatever! Great graphics? Yes. Solid Gameplay and control? Yes. Good story? Yes. Multiplay and depth? NO.  The game was too short and no multiplayer (although they have released it free from what I hear on the internet and are selling a newer version of this game with multiplay included), but it is too late for me. I loved the graphics and enjoyed the characters and the enemies were all very cool, but this game is not even close to saving gaming. That will be the job of Half-Life 2 and Doom 3.  For the price this game is selling at now, it would be a worthy buy.I Payed full price expecting more, and when I found out there was no multiplay, I knew I wasted my money. Oh well. Life goes on.
