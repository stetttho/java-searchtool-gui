 I really couldn't wait to see this movie. Couldn't wait to see how it ends. With all the questions being asked, I wanted answers. While some of the them were answered, some left you wondering what just happened. i have watched this movie 3 times and I still don't get the ending fully. I understand part of it, but the ending was a big let down. For the most part, this movie was full of great special effects and heart pounding action, especially when the machines finally arrived at Zion. That was an awesome fight scene (and a long one). I saw one reviewer here that gave the movie one star but raved about the fight scene. So why only one star from him? Oh well. For the most part, the movie does what it was intended to do. But you can't blame movie reviewers too much as it was the fans who let this movie down. More than likely it was the ending (I remember reading close to 100 reviews made by people who saw the movie when it first came out it wasn't good about the ending amongst other things) that threw people off. Either way this was a very good movie. Not what I was expecting or hoping for, but it was a good movie.
