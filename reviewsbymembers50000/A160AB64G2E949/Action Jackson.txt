 Samuel Jackson just seems to get better and better. And Shaft is just another example. Jackson plays a rough & tough detective trying to put away a rich kid who thinks he can get away with anything. After he jumps bail, Jackson leaves the force and becomes a private eye trying to track down the lone witness. Lots of smash mouthin' and head bashin' and gun fightin' for all. This is a very fun movie and Samuel Jackson plays the "badass" perfectly. Fun movie with a lot of action.
