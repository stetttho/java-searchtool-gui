 I love all 3 of the Jurassic Park movies, but this one beats The Lost World out pretty easily. From start to finish, this movie is the fastest moving one of the 3 and it adds a few new dinosaurs to the mix. Sam Neill reprises his role as Dr. Grant and there are few picks at Malcom, but this is a wall to wall action and suspense movie. The special effects are excellent as always. There are few things that don't make sense in this movie, but overall this is an excellent fast paced enjoyable movie.
