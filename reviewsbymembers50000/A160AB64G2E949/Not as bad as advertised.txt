 I remember reading reviews about how bad this  movie was. I remember reading how the distributing company was hated this movie so much that they shelved it for a year or 2 (depending on where read this at). I also remember reading that Eddie himself hated the movie and didn't want it released. How much of this you wanna believe, believe this: This is a pretty good movie, especially if you are an Eddie fan. Eddie plays Pluto Nash. He owns a very popular bar on the Moon. Their is a rumor that gambling is gonna be made legal on the Moon and now someone is trying to buy all of the bars so they turn them into casino's, but Eddie won't sell. His is evetually blown up (they were hoping he would still be inside)leading him on a big hunt to find out who is out to get him. With an all-star cast, this movie has plenty of verything a movie should have: Action, cool special effects, and some very good comedy moments. All of this leads up to a pretty surprising ending. Definitely and enjoyable movie.
