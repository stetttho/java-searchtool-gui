 I had seen this game was made by Chris Taylor who made one of my all-time favorite games (Total Annihilation) and had to have it. And I wasn't dissappointed. To me, this was a combo of Diablo and Icewind Dale as it incorporated alot from each game while be different from both. It was also alot easier to play than Icewind Dale. And there is alot less management in this game. With the click of a button, your inventory is automatically rearranged so you don't have to try to make room for something else. Also, anything that is on the ground lights up so you know where it is to pick it up. Another nice feature is the potions. You only drink what you need and the rest is left in that bottle until you need it. While on your journey, you meet many new people who want to join you until you reach the max limit of 8. And trust me , you need them. Some of the levels and end bosses are very tough. There are plenty of weapons, armor, and spells to be bought here and plenty of monsters and bandits to kill. And this is a very large world. That is what amazed me the most, just how big this world was. And each new dungeon, town, and forest was very different from the next. The graphics are very good, the gameplay is fast, the sounds were excellent, and the challenge was very good. I believe this game had some of the best landscape views of any game I have ever played. And when you are in the woods hearing the wind blow and the bugs making their noises, you almost feel like you are there. It took me a little over 32 hours of actual gameplay time (not counting having reload when I died) to beat the singl player missions. I recommend this game for RPG fan and for anyone looking for a well put together and thought out game with excellent action.
