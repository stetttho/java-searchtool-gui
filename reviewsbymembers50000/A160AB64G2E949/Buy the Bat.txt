 Another fanatastic DVD collection. The first 2 Batman's are truly works of wonders. I thought Jack Nicholson as the Joker and Danny Devito as the Penguin were excellent choices for those particular villians. I wasn't very sure about Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman but she pulled it off quite well. I thought Val Kilmer did a good job in the 3rd film, but Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey were absolutley a riot and the addition of Robin (Chris O'Donnel) was a cool also. The first clue for me that the 4th film had some problems was that Arnold Schwarzenegger got top billing. Clooney just couldn't pull it off The way Keaton and Kilmer did. But they surrounded him with a super cast that included Alicia Silverstone and Umma Thurman plus Chris O'donnell returning as Robin. When this movie started off with Batman and Robin on ice skates (or batskates, your choice), I thought I was watching the old TV show. I was just waiting for a "Kapow" or "Boom" to show up on the screen. Still, for the most part it was entertaining to watch and not a bad movie, just had alot to live up to. The most amazing thing was probably the fact they always had great casting and every actor/acctress they chose to play the villain was right on the money. This DVD collection is definitley worth the money, especially those who are Batman fans.
