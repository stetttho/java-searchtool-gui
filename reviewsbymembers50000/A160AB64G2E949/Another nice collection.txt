 This is another wonderful collection of DVD's. They have added many deleted scenes to these movies which makes a few things a little clearer about what was happening in the movie. Some of the scenes are actually pretty cool. There are tons of extras in regards to interviews and behind the scenes stuff to keep your attention for hours. If you are a fan of the Slien series, then don't miss out on this wonderful collection.
