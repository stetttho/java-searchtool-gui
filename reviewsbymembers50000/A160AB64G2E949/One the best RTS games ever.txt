 I really liked this game from the start. The graphics are very good, the cutscenes are well done, and the sound effects are great. You have many different major gods you can choose from and several minor gods also. Each god gives you a different god power (though you can only use it once) and a different myth unit you can create for battle. The single player campaign has over 30 missions and you play against or team up with as many computer players you want in the random map play (This very tough but has a lot of good battles). Some of the cool myth units they have are Cyclops (which pick up other units and throw them to the ground), Medusa's (which turn most units to stone), and my personal fav, the Fire Giant (who throws flaming fireballs). Some of the god powers are a Tornado (which does the most damage of any of the god powers) and Meteor (which has very cool explosions that send units flying through the air). With all of the units and god's available, you can replay over and over on different maps, and you have internet capabilities which I haven't tried yet.  Microsoft also has just released a free campaign that has 4 missions that you can download from the Age of Mythology website. And coming later this fall will be an expansion pack that will add more fun to an already fun game.
