 This is without a doubt one of the great expansion packs ever released. You get an American and a Russian story consisting 7 or 8 missions for each side. The American missions are pretty hard, especially the last one and the Russian missions are a little more fun with extra surprises that really make this game a blast. You also get the Yuri faction which is a completly new group you can play as in multiplayer mode with a complete new set of buildings, weapons, and units. The cutscenes are very cool and the story is solid. the only thing I did not like was when trying to load the next mission or load a saved game, it took a very long time. But it is definitely worth the wait. This makes a great game even better. If you already have Red Alert 2, then you definitely need this expansion pack.
