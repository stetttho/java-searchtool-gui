 After playing Dracula: The Ressurection, I was excited to see that there was gonna be another one. Dracula 2 didn't quite live up to what I was expecting. The graphics for the most part were still solid, but some of them were pretty crappy.  Here are some of the pros for me: 1. This game was harder and more challenging 2. A good story 3. Cool cut scenes 4. Much cooler puzzles Now the cons: 1. In the first game, most all of the puzzles were like things you could do in real life. In this one, alot of them mad no sense at all 2. Tedious gameplay. you had to do many of these puzzles over and over 3. The sound. The monsters sounded the same. And the sound they had, they sounded like a cat with a hairball. Very bad But the overall play was very good and there are many places to explore and many fun puzzles to solve. If you got the first Dracula game, then this is a must.
