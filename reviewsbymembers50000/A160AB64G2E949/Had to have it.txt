 I had to have this game. The graphics are slightly improved and the story is pretty cool, but it was definitley too short and no where near as challenging as it's predecessors. I would probably give this closer to 3 1/2 stars, but because it was part of Half-Life, which I believe is the FPS ever, I got it. Reliving some of the things that happened in the previous games was great and brought back good feelings, but it all ended too quickly. Still, the cut scenes and the story carried this one through. If the price would drop, this woudl be a no brainer.
