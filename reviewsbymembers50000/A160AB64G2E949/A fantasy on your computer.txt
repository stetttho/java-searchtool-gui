 This is a very cool set. I tried the first one, but it's not very good when you look at HOMM2 & HOMM3. The graphics, gameplay, and units that are available are much better than the first one. The gameplay is very challenging and if you sit back and try to build up your forces, they are doing the same thing, and since they always have a head start on you, you are just settign yourself up for disaster. There are many scenarios to play and you can also just play a map against the computer if you want. Has map editor so you can make your own maps to play. This game can be replayed time after time.
