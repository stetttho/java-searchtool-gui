 What a show indeed. An awesome collection of Carvey at his best. Is there a better impressionist in world? I don't think so. He's brilliant as Perot, Bush, and Johnny Carson as well as some of his own created characters. A must SNL fans and a definite for any Carvey fan. Side splitting laughter that is as good as anything Eddie Murphy did and better than Chris Farley's (although I loved his also) stuff. Buy this!
