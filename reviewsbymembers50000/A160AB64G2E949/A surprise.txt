 This album really surprised me. I had almost considered not getting it. It seemed with every album after Vivian Campbell, he had another new guitarist. But it's Dio! So I got it anyways and man, it wasn't a mistake. Sure, there aren't any awesome solo's and songs that just plain rock, but it's a well put together album and very worthy effort. This album didn't seem to get much attention, but that was a mistake. It is a very good, but not great album (there will never be a Dio album that compares Holy Diver and Last In Line unless the original lineup gets back together). A must for Dio fans.
