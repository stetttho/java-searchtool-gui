 Though not as good as the 7th Guest, this sequel was still terrific. With another good story and terrific graphics, this has just as challenging puzzles as the first game with an added twist: You get clues after solving a puzzle that lead to an object in the house that you must find. A nice little twist by giving you a puzzle in a puzzle. In this istallment, you are solving a mystery a little bit more in this game that leads to a choice to be made at the end (I recommend saving at this point so you can see all of the endings). It took a little too long for them to release this game and ultimately started their downward plunge as this game  continuosly had it's release date pushed back (go to gamespot.com and somewhere they have a story they wrote about the rise and fall of Trilobyte who originally did this game). Before the company went under, they had started a 3rd game in this series, but the company folded and it was never completed. Oh well. Get this game. You won't be disappointed.
