 The boys are back (or most of them anyways). Even without Tommy Lee, these boys can still play. This has the same feel Of all of their 80's music with a splash of something fresh and new. When Vince Neil left and they released their self titled album in '94, it wasn't the same. And even though I liked "Generation Swine", this album tears that one up and just keeps on going. With my personal favs like "Fake", "She Needs Rock-N- Roll", and "Treat Me Like The Dog I Am", this albums kicks. A must for any Crue fan and something to check out for any new fans.
