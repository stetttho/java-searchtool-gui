 This is the second album I ever got. The first was Pyromania. This album was heavier than Pyromania (it seems as if they started to slow with every album until the got back to the older stuff on Retroactive), but softer than their first album, On Through The Night, but it was definitley better written and played here. Lotsa pounding songs to get your adrenaline up, especially No No No. After listening to albums after this one, it makes me think that guitarist Willis (who was kicked out of the band after this album because of his alcohol and drug abuse) may have been the one behind that. But the success of this album got them on their way and they haven't looked back since.
