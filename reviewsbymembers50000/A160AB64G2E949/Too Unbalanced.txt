 I wanted to like this game because I am a huge C&C fan, but this games "Houses" are not well balanced. The Harkonen are pretty cool and have fast units at a decent price, but their turrets (which is typically a flame thrower) are not very good and get picked off by the simplest ranged attack units. The Atreis have much stronger units and cost more, but they are so slow that smaller quicker units run circles around them before they can target. The Ordos have the best balance, but since the Harkonen can build up faster, the Ordos get run over. And the air units for any of the Houses stink.  The landscape is bland also. Theres nothing to the landscape at all. Just a bunch orangish colored ground with a darker orange color that is the Spice you have to harvest and a bunch  of brown areas where you can build. Not very pretty at all. But not all is bad. In those orange areas where you can't build are sand worms that attack from time (although it seems like they spent alot of time destroying my spice harvesters all of the time) to time. Plus you have tornadoes that do some damage to your buildings, but can sweep away your infantry units rather quickly. The tornadoes look pretty cool. And the units and buildings have decent detail. And last, the cut scenes are very well done, though the story and your mission don't make alot of sense. Plus you get Dune 2000 with this, though this wasn't rated very well and rightfully so. This game definitley needed more work as evident by the poor sales. This was first and probably last (its hard to pass up on a Westwood game) trip to the Dune universe. C&C:Generals anyone?
