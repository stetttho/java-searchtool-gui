 This is definitely their best CD since Dream Evil. This is a CD based on the Book of Magica. A battle of good and evil wages through this CD with excellently written and played songs. With memorable songs such as Losing my Insanity, Fever Dreams, and Lord Of The Last Day, this is an album for Dio and Rock fans alike. Though not quite a return to his old days, this is very close. I even enjoyed the Magica Story he narrates at the end of this CD. A very solid effort. Not too bad for a 60 year old man as he continues to defy all. I hope he continues for many more years if this is what the result will be.
