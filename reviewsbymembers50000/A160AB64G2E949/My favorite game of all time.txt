 A friend of my bought a game at a store and returned it because his computer couldn't handle the requirements. So he returned it but couldn't get money back, so he got this game. After having for a month, he finally started to play it and that was it. In the end, another friend and myself started getting together three times a week playing this game for over 2 years straight against each other. I have probably played over 10,000 battles. And you can download free units and maps over the internet. Very cool. The game is very fast paced with many buildings, units, and other weapons. I still play this game to this day as do my friends. I recommend this game to everyone and I hope that they make the sequel.
