 I thought the story line was excellent. A very different and very clever view of the monster in the closet that scares most every child. This movie has a few scary moments, but for the most part it is just funny with a few sad moments. You have your choice of Widescreen or Full screen plus 2 animated short films, games, and behind the scenes stuff that give hours of entertainment for all. I believe John Goodman (the voice of James P Sulivan) should lend his voice to more of these animated films as he does such a good job. He is able give the right tone for whatever the situtation calls for, whetther happy or sad. Billy Crystal also did a great job as Mike Wazoski. It totally cracks me up when the little girl (Boo) keeps saying his name. And James Colburn was excellent as Henry Waternoose who is the boss. Without a doubt, just a well put together movie for the whole family to enjoy.
