 Very cool set. Total action from some of the best movies ever. Only the Lethal Weapon series on DVD matches this at the moment. Not only do you get 3 awesome movies but you get lots of behind the scenes feaures and other special features that allow you to see what it took to make these movies so good. Bruce Willis has never been better than right here in these 3 movies. Superb sound and picture brings these movies right into your living room.
