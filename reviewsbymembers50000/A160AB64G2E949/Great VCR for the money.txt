 I was just looking for a second VCR and didn't want to spend alot of money since I was just gonna use it to record shows and watch them in the bedroom. I found this little gem and am very pleased with it. My favorite feature is the way it slows down when you are rewinding a tape. This is nice feature to have especially when my last VCR (which cost 3 times as much) ate 6 tapes is a week. The only problems I had were that it was a little confusing trying to get the VCR cable ready and trying to set the timer to record a show. Now that I have done it a few times, setting the timer is a piece of cake. The only other problem I have had is sometimes you have to shut everything off or the VCR gets stuck on wrong channell and all you get is snow. Not sure it does that, but it doesn't happen often. As for any of the other features, I don't know as I just use it mostly for recording and watching what I record, but for the money, it's a great second VCR.
