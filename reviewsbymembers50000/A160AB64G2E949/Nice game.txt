 Not a bad game at all. I never got this when it first came out as I into C&C and many other RTS games But I have been going back and trying to catch up on a few games I missed.  This game reminds alot of Lord Of The Realms 2. You do basically the same things except for a few differences.  This is a turned based game (like Lords 2 and Civilization games)with real time battles. You could either have the Computer resolve the battle or fight it yourself. The thing I didn't like about the battles was it seemed half the time, the other general would run away (a few times mine did and these 3 amd 4 ranked generals with many victories). Some of the generals are your sons. As the game continues, you play through the 4 seasons. Eventually, a son will be born. When he reaches age 16, he is ready to lead one of your armies. Depending on how many years this goes, your leader (Daimyo as they call it) can die. If you have no heirs, your game is over. Otherwise one of your heirs takes over.  There are many buildings you can build and upgrade that affects what kind of units you can create, how good their weapons and armor is, and how much honor and moral they have. Some buildings will only show up once one of your generals is of very high rank.  the resources of the game are Koku (money) from alliances, mines, Koku's pillaged from victory in war, and farming. You have to keep your people happy to stop revolts also.  You also have special units such as emmisaries that spy and offer alliances and Ninja's who are used to spy and assasinate other generals and emmisaries (the cutscenes for this are pretty cool).  Graphically, this game is pretty good for a 4 year old game, the sounds are good, and the music is pretty good. Replay value isn't very good, but there is alot more to this game than what I just told you here.  No that this is over, it is off to start Medieval: Total War. Good luck and enjoy a pretty fun game while it lasts.
