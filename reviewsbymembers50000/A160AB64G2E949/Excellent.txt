 This movie kicks in from the get go. To awesome explosions to technical computer stuff to fast paced action to twists, this movie has it all. There are so many suprises in this movie that you just keep shaking your head in disbelief.  Travolta is excellent as a the backguy as is Hugh Jackman (Wolverine in the X-Men movie) who plays a computer hacker who is not allowed to touch a computer per his parol. He wants to get custody of his kid but doesn't have the cash, and that's where Travolta and Halle Berry come in. Non-stop action and enough twists to keep you off balance all the way to the end.
