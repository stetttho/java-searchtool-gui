 Much in the same line as Simcity, Railroad Tycoon2 offers something different: a little more activity while playing. Usually on Simcity, you build and just sit there waiting for your city to grow. On RT2, you not only have to build track and train stations, but you must set which town and in what order your train will visit these stations. you also must advance to faster and more efficient trains while trying to meet the requiremnets for the task that was set for you to complete. Most of these challenges are hard, but others are even harder, especially when you have a dead line. With beautiful graphics and a little train history lesson, this game is a lot of fun to play.
