 I remember when this movie first came out that critics were saying "How can a good book and good actor make a bad movie? Watch this movie and find out.". What do critics know. I found this movie thouroughly enjoyable. There were so many possible suspects and so many twists and turns that pretty soon you didn't know who possibly did it. Now, this wasn't even as good as the book was, but that's pretty much typical. Theres too much in a book to get it all in the movie and have it all make sense (those who read the book will understand, especially one of the characters in the movie from the book). But they did a good job in this movie with what they did do. How good book and good actor make a good movie. Watch this and find out.
