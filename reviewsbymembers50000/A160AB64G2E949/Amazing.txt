 This is one of the most amazing games I have ever played. This game was originally released in 1992 or 1993 and for it's time, it was way ahead in terms of graphics and story telling. Hell, it still has better graphics than some of the games that come out now. For me, this is the game that made me want to buy a computer which I did less than a month later. It has very challenging puzzles and some comedy along the way as Stauf adds his comments to either the path you choose or your success/failure to do a puzzle. If you like action, this is not your game. If you like solving puzzles, unraveling mysteries, and a game that makes you use your head, this is it. One of the best games of all time and the best puzzle solving game ever. But don't take my word on it. Get this for yourself.
