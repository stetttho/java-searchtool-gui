 For me, this is where it started. My first album I ever asked for was this one back in 1984. The album had already been out for a year, but to me, it was fresh and new. It remains my favorite album of all time to this very day. Every song was great. Every guitar solo, thump of the drums, and pounding of the bass was perfect. Joe's voice fit with the music being played, and what they created was copied by many and started up what was the biggest decade for rock n roll if not the music industry itself. This album eventually sold over 10 million copies (I wore out 2 records, 4 cassete tapes, and now have it on CD myself) and made these guys a top draw eveywhere they played. My favorite is Photograph, but there isn't a bad or mediocre song on the album. This is basically where 80's rock started to kick into high gear, but to see where it started, buy High n Dry also. That's the album everyone started noticing Def Leppard.
