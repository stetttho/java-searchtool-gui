 They look big and bulky and but fit my head just fine. The only 2 things I had a problem with is you can't turn the volume up very loud (although I must say that it is loud enough for listening to music unless it was recorded at a low volume) and if you wear them much more than about 2 hours they start hurting your ears. Each side was adjustable so I had no problem getting them to fit my head comfortably. Not sure about the microphone because I haven't had a use for it yet but I would reccommed these to amyone.
