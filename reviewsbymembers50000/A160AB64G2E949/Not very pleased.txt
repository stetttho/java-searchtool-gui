 This review is mostly for those of you (like me) that don't have a gamepad for your computer. Using the keyboard for this game is just plain awful. I rated this a 2 because the graphics are solid, the sound effects are good, the music is rockin, and the tutorials that help you learn the game from intercepting passes to kicking are great. But the gameplaying is not. Trying to use a keyboard for this game is not a good idea. You can reconfigure the keys, but there are so many different buttons to use that I can not come up with a good solution other than to buy a gravis gamepad. The other thing that is annoying was that on defense, even if I am playing with 8 guys in coverage, the other team always seems to have a wide open receiver. I have never had a wide open reciever yet even when I have 5 guys in pattern and they are playing a run defense. Every receiver seems to be double covered no matter which one I throw too. And there never seems to be running room either. It might just be the control issue which hopefully will be taken care of when my Gravispad comes. If so, I will write another review then. But for right now, I am not impressed with the gameplay.
