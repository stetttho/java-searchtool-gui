 This one took a few pages to get started, but once it got going, it was tough to put this book down. This is definitley something different from the standard King novel. The main character is Roland of Gilead. The last of his breed of the once feared Gunslingers. From crossing the desert in search of "The Man In Black" to his shootout in a not so friendly town, this is the start of the best tale ever written. And the story isn't over yet. One of the first lines of the book is "The Man in Black crossed the desert. And the Gunslinger followed". Hopefully you will pick up this book and follow it's trail all the way to the end at the side of Roland.
