 Seems like everything Blizzard releases sells like wild fire. And Starcraft is no different. An awesome and challenging game with many different units and sructures to make you dizzy. And given they still release new maps for free download on the internet about every week, this game is still going strong. I would actually give this game 4 1/2 stars. The only thing keeping it from a 5 is the multiplay is that when you play someone as good as you are, there were never enough resources. Me and my friend hooked our computers together and played around 30 battles against each other. I won 1 and the other games ended in ties as we ran out of resources and guys to attack with. Other than that, what a game. I can't wiat until Starcraft 2 come out.
