 I really enjoyed this game to a point. Having played the other 3 Commandos games, I could not wait for this to come out. The graphics are better than the other games even when you zoom in. The other games got pixelly where as this one doesn't. If it does, it's time to upgrade (I played this on a pentium 4, 512 meg ram, 128 meg video card). What I liked was the graphics, how challenging the game was, and the way the landscape changed making you change your strategy. What I didn't like was the controls, no cutscenes leading up to the next level, and there wasn't alot of strategy involved beyond what I already metioned. There are no more hot keys to control which weapon you use and other funtions. that really hurts this game more than anything. The cutscenes and other "eye candy" things I can do without (though I really enjoy them), but the based on the other 3 games, the stratgey involved stinks. Not more sneak attacks or thinking before you act. You can go in guns blazing and not suffer like the other games. I did enjoy the game, but with the controls and strategy they took with this game, it really hurt the game. This could have and should have been an awesome game. But all we are left with is an average game with a few really good levels. At this price (and probably lower would be better), I would recommend this game, especially to people who have played the Commando series. But definitely don't pay full price.
