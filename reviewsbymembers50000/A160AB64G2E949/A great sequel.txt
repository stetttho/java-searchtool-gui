 Though I didn't think it would be possible without adding real pictures, the graphics on Riven exceed those of Myst. Every scene is elaboratly detailed and very pleasing to the eye. The sounds and music are much better and sound even more realistic. They also have added more animation. You see more things moving around that makes it seem like you are more involved in the game. They have also added some very cool features such as a roller coaster type vehicle that lets you travel from island to island and a submarine  used to travel underwater. The game play is much the same as Myst, but sometimes you have to go to one area and do some things to complete a puzzle in another area. You also have to learn the Riven math system to solve other puzzles which I thought was a cool idea. Ultimately, all these things add up to tougher game play, but this game is well worth it.
