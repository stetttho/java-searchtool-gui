 When I saw the first single "Women" on MTV, I rushed right out and bought the CD. At first listen, I was a little disappointed. I was expecting another Pyromania or High n Dry and what I got was something that sounded a whole lot popish. the more I listened to it, the better I appreciated how well written it was. They expanded their playing and created an album that reached more than just the average rocker. There are plenty of songs that have energy and get your blood boiling, but overall, this album didn't affect me the way their previous 3 did. But to overcome drummer Rick Allen losing his arm in a car accident and still keep him in the band was quite a story. In the end, his drumming is probably more solid than his early days thoough not quite as wild. But the thumping of the drums along with improved writing, these guys were coming of age.
