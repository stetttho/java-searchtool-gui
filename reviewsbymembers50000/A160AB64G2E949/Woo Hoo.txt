 Awesome! "Jurassic Park" is still my favorite movie of all time. With special effects that were unseen at that time bringing the dinosuars to life was unbelievable. Had great "edge-of-your-seat" action that carried you throught the whole movie. Jeff Goldblum offers up some comedy relief at just the right moment. This is a definite classic and keeper for all-time. "The Lost World" was just as stunning visually, but not quite as good with the story or the characters as the first one. I had read the book first and wished Spielberg would've kept the ending and one other raptor scene in the movie (this is why Crichton refused to take part in the movie). It would've been cool seeing those scenes, but still, the movie is remarkable. The collection also has behind the scenes stuff and a complete encyclopedia of each dinosaur. Very nice for those who have children or anyone who wants any info about dinosaurs. And it's in fullscreen which is much better than the widesreen that most DVD's seem to prefer. I had watched "Jurassic Park" over 100 times and couldn't believe the difference in picture and in sound that the DVD gives you. Awesome. Get this collection.
