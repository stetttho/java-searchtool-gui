 Very cool box set for any horror fan and a no-brainer for any "Scream" fan. Defintely worth the money. It has the gore,the violence, the comedy, and keeps you guessing to the end. Great behind the scenes stuff plus a few extras for any fan. My only bad mark with this is the widescreen format. It takes away too much of the screen. Why?????
