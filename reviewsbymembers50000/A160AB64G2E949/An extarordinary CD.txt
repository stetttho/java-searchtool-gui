 I have been a fan of Yngwie's since 1986 when he released Trilogy. I have every album (except Inspiration as I don't care much for cover albums) he has ever released, and this is definitely one of his best(this also may be the longest name for an album ever). He recorded this with The Czech Philharmonic (w/conductor Yoel Levi) in which he composed and produced all the songs. An what a production. He beautifully blends his guitar playing with the Orchestra. I know what you are thinking. Hasn't Metallica already done this? Yes they have, but this has no lyrics and Yngwie started this project in 1996. As you listen to this album, you will definitley know why they call him (The man with the lightning fast fingers). He just seems to glide effortlessly in his playing and there isn't a bad song on this CD. It's hard to believe he's only 37 since he recorded his first album at the tender age of 19. He's been aorund alot of years and doesn't get the respect he deserves as a true musician and one of the best guitar players ever. Don't let this one slip past you.
