 I bought this DVD mainly for "The Year Without A Santa Claus". I just fell in love with the TV classic. I had never seen this until 6 years ago and I just loved it. And who can resist the antics of the brothers Snow Miser and Heat Miser. They are hilarious. Plus with the other 2 features (though they never were quite as popular), this is a great family DVD. Now you can watch it anytime you want. Worth the money.
