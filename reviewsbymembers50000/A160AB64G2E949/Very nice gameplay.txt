 This may be one of the most challenging RTS games I have ever played, and I have played alot of them. The first 2 campaigns weren't extremely hard though they had their challenging moments, but the German campaign was very tough as is the Russian campaign. Some of these campaigns take alot of different strategy to beat. You can't just build up an army and think your gonna just crushem'. You need to build up your resources and play defense before you go offensive. The graphics on the cutscenes are lacking, but the detail of the units and buildings is quite good. The AI is pretty solid for pathfinding, but the enemy AI is stupid at times, but they always seem to have a surplus of units to attack you with and to rebuild what you took out. And the best thing is there are no cheats codes (at least none that I know of anyways) to help you with the single player campaign. I like the idea of playing skirmishes against the computer becasue you start with men who attack with clubs and work your way up to futuristic cyborgs. The bomber explosions are very cool and there are usually plenty of resources. The best advice I can give you is that if one strategy doesn't work, try something that is completly different. A very good game for all RTS fans.
