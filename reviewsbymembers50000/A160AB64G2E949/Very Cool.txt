 I bought the cassette tape when this first came out, but I hadn't heard it in a while and I came across it on CD here at Amazon. I had forgotten just how good this album is. And even though this was Don's solo effort after Dokken's breakup, this very much has the same soundas almost any other Dokken album. Most every song rocks. Crash n Burn, The Hunger, and Down In Flames are awesome rockers while Stay, Mirror Mirror, and Living A Lie rock, but are very catchy tunes. The only curious thing I noticed was John Norum (formerly of the group Europe) played on this one and also played on the new Dokken CD (Long Way Home). The curious thing is how much different he sounds on the 2 albums. On this one, he rips it up pretty good (nowhere near as good as George Lynch though), but on the new one, he doesn't sound that great. Good, but not real good. Oh well, this album is pretty awesome and I highly recommend it.
