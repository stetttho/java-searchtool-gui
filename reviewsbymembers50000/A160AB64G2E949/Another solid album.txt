 Having been a Dokken fan since the beginning, there have been alot of ups and downs through the years with these guys.  The George Lynch years are still the best, but the last 2 releases were better than the last 2 they did with George Lynch.  On Hell To Pay, this is a very solid album. I liked every song on the album (though i did like some more than others) and any Dokken fan won't be dissapointed, unless you are looking for the rip roaring solo's from the Lynch days. Well written and well played, this album deserves some attention.
