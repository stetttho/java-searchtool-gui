 Seems like every game Blizzard puts out turns to gold. This is no exception. Visually, this game is great to look at. The game play and control are much better than the first one. There are also 5 character classes to choose from and with 4 acts to play, this game is way bigger than the first. The on-line game is a little choppy and laggy at times, but well worth checking out. I loved the first Diablo, then your gonna lust for this game as you get deeper and deeper into the world known as Diablo 2. The next time you look up at the clock, you may not believe what your seeing. Somehow, you lost a couple of days playing. This game is that engrossing. Buy this game and you won't be disappointed.
