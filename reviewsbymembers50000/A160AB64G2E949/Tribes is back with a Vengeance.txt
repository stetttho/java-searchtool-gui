 This the first game in the Tribes series to have an single-player included in it and th SP rocks. I was quite impressed with the way they did it and story was pretty good too. It is also a pretty long one.  In the SP, you play 4 different characters (you also play one chararcter when she was a child) in different times (the story covers something like 4 generations). You go back and forth alot, but the story is still pretty easy to follow. And some of the missions and one on one battles are very challenging. The only annoying thing I experienced in the SP was the trials you had to do later in the game. One of them involved completing 6 laps in the allotted time. I must have done that at least 100 times(I'm not kiiding about this either) before I finally beat it. Other than that, the SP was awesome and very fun.  As for the MP, I am not very impressed. First off, there seems to be very few servers. Not sure if this game just didn't generate enough interest or what, but very few servers and very few people playing it seems to me. But when you get in a server that has a good latency, it is pretty fun. All I have ben able to play though is Capture the Flag.  Graphically, this game is pretty good. The sound effects are even better and you still have 3 classes of armor and there are vehicles you can use plus flying units too.  For the price this is selling at right now too, this is a must buy for any Tribes player, at least for the SP. But you won't be dissappointed.
