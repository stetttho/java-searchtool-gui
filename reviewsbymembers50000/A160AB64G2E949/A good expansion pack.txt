 I had higher hopes for this expansion pack, especially after having played expansion packs for Warcraft 3 and Command and COnquer: Generals. To that point, I was dissappointed. The single player mission was too short. It took me only 10-12 hours to beat the 12 missions. Compared to the afore mentioned games, that is way too short. But that is the only real negative about the game. For multiplay, you have a new race (the Atlanteans), better and more colorful graphics, new gods, new god powers, new myth units, and a Titan unit you can now build. The Titans are pretty cool and there is more than 1 different Titan depending on the God you start with. And if you get one built and no-one else does, watch out because you are gonna cause massive damage. The Atlanteans are also a unique civilization in that you don't have to build nearly as many buildings as they don't have to drop off their supplies. They also have less units for you to purchase which gives you less options to choose from which can be good. But the real strength of this game is all the new god powers and myth units that are available. Some of the new god powers include a portal that you can build that continues to spew demons until the portal is destroyed and Chaos which makes a large group of units fight each other to the death. Some of the new myth units is the Argus which is just a blob with eyes but expells a corrosive slime that melts enemies away and the Promethean which is a powerful clay unit that splits into two smaller versions of itself when mortally wounded and continues to fight. There are many other god powers and myth units available. I would have given this a 5 if the single player mission was longer and/or harder. That would be my only other complaint is this game wasn't too hard. It offered a medium challenge at best. But other than those two things, this is worth the money and I would reccommend it to all who own the original game.
