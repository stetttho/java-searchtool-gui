 What more can be said about this movie that already hasn't been said. When it has Mathau and Lemmon, it's probably going to be funny and written to fit their styles. And boy does it ever.  The laughs start and never stop until the movies is over. Their are even a few bloopers that they show as the credits roll. Other than that, there isn't much to this DVD. Just a great movie with a great cast of characters. And the price i got this for is unbeatable (unless it was free).
