 I really like this game alot, but unfortunately, the AI still lacks in singleplayer mode. Adn usually, if you don't do most of the killing, you lose. But it is still fun and very intense and you get to play both sides. It takes a little while to beat the singleplayer game. The multiplayer game is also very cool. Your basically playing the same maps as in singleplayer. But there are a few annoying things. Like when you are the allies trying to land on the beach, you can control the battleship and shoot the big guns that are on the battleship. Ths problem is you always have someone who wants to drive the battleship around and then you have alot farther to go to land on the beach. Or someone always shooting those guns and when they do that, they typically blow up their own teamates more than enemy. Another thing thats annoying is the vehicle situation. I have a cable modem, but I always seem to have to wait at the beginning of every map to respawn. By then, all of the vehicles are gone. That gets annoying since all anyone does is drive around in the vehicles all of the time. There aren't alot of battles involving man against man. The last thing that bothers me is all of the patches you have download. In the 2 months I have had this game, I have had to download 2 patches just to play on line. One day, I it kept asking me if wanted to update, so I said yes and it froze my computer twice. After downloading patch off the internet, I could play on-line again, but about 3 weeks later, I coudln't get on and had to download another patch. But overall, this game is fun to play once you get in get to play. There are alot of other vehicles you can us like jeeps, tanks, and airplanes (though I cant get the hang of airplanes). I really did like this (despite some complaints I said here) and both the singleplayer and multiplayer are cool. Not the best FPS ever, but definitley a good one.
