 I bought all 3 games as they came out, but if you haven't even gotten one yet, I reccommend you pick this up, especially if you love FPS games.  Allied Assault is a terrific single player and multiplayer game. The single player mission is pretty long with great graphics, sound, and some really awesome scenery. The sound of wind blowing, snow falling, dogs barking in the distance, and, well, everything is great about the game. the on-line side has many different modes of play (especially mods) and is exremely fun. It is still one of the top 5 games played on-line.  Spearhead gives you more maps and skins, and a very good though short single player mission.   Breakthrough is more of the same: Very good (but short) single player mission, more skins, more weapons, and more maps. There is also a very cool (at least i liked it) game mode call liberation where you get put in jail when you die and your remaining teammates try to free you until everyone from one team is dead.  All in all, you can't beat this for the price they are charging. An awesome deal.
