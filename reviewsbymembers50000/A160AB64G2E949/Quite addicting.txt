 If you want a serious challenge with a great story and alot of creatures jumping from all dark corners, then this is your game. The boss creatures in the game are very tough, especially the final one. The graphics were solid, the sounds were solid, and the game was solid. What kept this from being a truly awesome game was there was a little too much story telling. Seemed like every time you turned around, you had another cut scene. And most of the weapons weren't all that good and neither was the magic. But one of the neat features was the Scrye spell. It let you see things that happened in the past. And when you used it while looking at some pictures they looked different. Very cool. You just have to see for yourself. Overall, this was a solid game that had some creepy music to set you up for quite a few good scares. Gave me goose bumps the whole time I played it. Could have done better with the weapons and the spells, but still worth the money and the time. Good luck.
