 This is a quality CD. Not only is the music fresh and kickin', but the lyrics have something good, positive, and real to say. From rockers Achilles Heel & Save Me to wonderful ballads Stone & All I'm Thinking Of Is You that show off his wonderful voice to a couple of very different but very awesome songs I Am Adam & Blue Bleeds Through (this song in particular really shows off his vocal range), this album is SWEET indeed. If your looking for the second coming of Stryper (OZ Fox plays some guitar on this album), this isn't it. Only 1 or 2 songs have the feel of Stryper. This CD is all Michael Sweet and it has a very fresh sound to it. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes to rock and ain't afraid of something a little different.
