 You pick up this book, open it, and start to read the jacket that covers this book.The first thing you realize is that there is no mention of a lawyer. And that is a little scary considering his past books. But don't put this one back. The book starts off slower and milder than his other books but it does start to pick up steam and you can tell this is a Grisham novel. A 7-year old boy, Luke Chandler, is the main character/narrator of this story. He works on a farm in Arkansas with his parents and they get help from other sources to pick cotton. Things start to change when he witnesses a murder. As the book goes on, you notice the boy is starting to grow up and realize exactly what the real world is like. Though this book has familiarity to it, it is like nothing Grisham has ever done before.
