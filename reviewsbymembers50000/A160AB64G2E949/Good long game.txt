 Having just finished Doom 3, I really did enjoy the game. Here are some of the good and bad points:  While the graphics were very good, I wouldn't say they were great. It was just too dark. What you could see of the creatures was very good. The outside and usually when you had to fight an end boss, it was always orangish red. Very little color or detail whihc for me kind of ruined what is supposed to be a great graphics engine.  The sound effects for me were the best. The sound of th weapons was good, but walking around and hearing moaning and breathing all aorund you gave the game great atmosphere. Keot me on the edge of my seat.  There were also too many time where creature would just warp in (why not warp them all in at the same time and obliterate the whole base?). It was very tiring clearing an area only to have something warp in behind you.  Also, the flashlight was a pain going back and forth between the two. And the PDA system sucked too. You had to watch every video and listen to every audio file and read every e-mail or you might miss something to get extra ammo or shield or life. And most of those files were stupid. It was such a waste of time.  The length of the game was very long for an FPS game. Took a ver long time to beat, alot of it seeemed repetitious. And the game was scary as that was there main goal in the first place. But the gane didn't keep me hooked to it. I found myself playing other games and leaving this one alone for for 7 or 8 days at a time.  Compared to Half-Life 2, this game isn't even close. Half-Life 2 had much more outside terrain where in my opinion you could really see some great graphics. This was just too confined, dark, and not very colorful.  Overall, I would reccommend this game as the graphics and sound were very good, the story was ok, but the scares and intensity were very good. I will try the MP when I play the expansion pack.
