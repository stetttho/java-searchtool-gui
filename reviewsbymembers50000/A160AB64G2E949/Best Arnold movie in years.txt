 This is definitley the best movie Arnold has done since True Lies in 1994. I liked movies like The 6th Day and Eraser, but this one is much better. John Connor is now in his 20's and he is off the grid i.e. no phone, internet, ot credit cards. Nothing that can be tracked by computer. And becaue of this, the new Terminator is sent back to kill those who would eventually be his top people in the war against the machines. He is eventually found and tracked leading to a bunch of great chase scenes and special effects that are as good or better than T2. The movie gets off to quick start and the action keeps on coming non-stop. A very exciting fast paced movie with a little bit of humor added. The story on a whole is pretty good and the ending helps improve that even better. A must see for all Arnold fans and anyone who likes the Terminator series.
