 Heard one of their songs, Maggy, in a movie (can't remember which one now) and went looking for their album. What a stroke of luck. I stumbled into one of the more solid bands around. From "Inside OUt", "Take What You Can", and "Come On N Love ME", this is great guitar rock. An awesome album to add to your rock collection.
