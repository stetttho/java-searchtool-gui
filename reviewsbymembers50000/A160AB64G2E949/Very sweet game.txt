 Not sure why some of these reviews that were written didn't like the game. OK, it was a very challenging game, so maybe they couldn't figure it out. The box says (and many reviews I had read before purchasing) that this is the most realistic  game out there. And they were pretty close. The graphics were splendid and the gameplay was extraordinary. You are Raven. A secret agent sent in to get the Crown Jewels and replace them with fakes. You have many gadgets at your disposal and several, several rooms to explore and each room is done in high detail as you have the ability to look around you a full 360 degrees. You will encounter some guards and you will either work your way around them or take them out with your "sleeping" darts. Either way, this game will pull you in and make you really think about what to do next. You will probably die many times and will have to try this and try that, but stick with it. You will eventually figure it out and reach Traitor's Gate.
