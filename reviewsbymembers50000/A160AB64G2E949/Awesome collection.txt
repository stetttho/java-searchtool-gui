 His 2 best movies, Under Siege 1 & 2, make this an awesome collection by themselves even if they were paired with his 2 worst. But to include his debut, Above The Law, which was action packed and Hard To Kill which was my first Segal flick and I believe it was his 2nd movie which was just as action packed. He more recent movies have seemed like he was bored making them and some of the action was lacking (I haven't seen Exit Wonds yet) but these 4 are probably his 4 best (Marked For Death was good also). I would reccommend this to any Segal fan.
