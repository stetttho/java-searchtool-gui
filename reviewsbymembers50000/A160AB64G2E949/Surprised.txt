 After reading many reviews, playing the demo (which I didn't like too much), and looking at bunch of forums, I put off buying this game as it seemed it wasn't as good as the XBOX version and it was about 50 50 that people liked it or hated it.  So now, several months after it's initial release and the price was at $20, I have finally played it and much to my surprise, it was pretty damn good.  The beginning I didn't care for much and I was having a hard time getting into the game, but after each passing minute, I started to like this more and more.  The Master Chief is a very cool character and they have some pretty cool weapons.  The graphics and sound were solid (though the levels that had snow on them, the snow looked crappy) as was the story. The atmosphere didn't do much as you didn't hear the wind blow and the trees weren't swaying like other FPS games that came before it. This was a bit of a hardware killer as I have a P4 2.8, 128 NVIDIA GEFORCE FX 5200 graphics card, and 1GIG of RAM, and I coudln't turn the settings up without it getting too choppy. I had to turn them down some and it ran pretty good and the graphics still looked good.  The enemies were pretty cool (The Hunters were especially hard to kill and the The Elites had something like a re-energizable shield like you had) and the levels were pretty challenging and very intense (not quite as intense as Call Of Duty but close). The Flood was especially cool. Not hard to kill but wave after wave of them just kept coming at you.  You also have many different vehicles and other things you can control in the game.  As for on-line, it reminds of Command & Conquer Renegade. Takes a million bullets to kill someone with a machine gun and there weren't any different kinds of game modes that what is already out there, but it was still pretty fun and I didn't have a problem with lag at all.  Overall, I think it was a pretty good game and I hope they make a HALO 2 even though the game took a bad rap.
