 What a terrific game. Excellent graphics, solid sound, great story, and great characters. You lead Max through his next mystery through many levesl of very intense and very difficult action. On a routine check of a warehouse, shots are fired. As Max investigates, he comes across a cleaning company whose only cleaning is cleaning people out of their weapons. A woman from his past he thought dead (I believe she is from the first Max game) is very much alive. There are many players dealing in weapons. Max doesn't know who to trust. Not his co-workers, friends, and this woman. As the story gets deeper and deeper, you reveal the mystery and solve a few other things from your past. All of this leads up to a few surprises and very challenging final battle. Bullet time is back and there are a few new moves that happen when you activate this. It's very cool seeing the bullets whizzing by you. There are quite a few new weapons and many levels that give you hours of game play plus you have some very strange levels as Max battles his innerself. And once you beat the Detective level (which is pretty hard itself), you open up the other play options like beating the levels before the time runs out and a deathmatch type gameplay where you try to stay alive as long as possible. The longer you stay alive the more bad guys show up to kill you. Every kill adds 2seconds to your score and saves your best times on 5 or 6 different levels. Plus you have even tougher gameplay levels where the enemies skills are even better. WHEW! This all adds up to a great game that you will not regret playing.
