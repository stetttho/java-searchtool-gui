 The acting isn't that great & the story isn't the best, but there is just something about this movie I can't get enough of. Now fighting large insects that take hundreds of bullets to kill is not the greatest idea in the world, but the special effects, sound, and action are quite excellent. This movie moves right along too. The action never seems to stop whether its training to be a Citizen(which seems to be the only way you can do many things like be a politician or have a baby) Oor fighting "The Bug".And not all of the main characters make it through this movie alive. I have only had the DVD for about 3 weeks, but I have watched it 8 times. Would be a five star movie if there was better acting. But for the special effects & action, this is definitely a good movie.
