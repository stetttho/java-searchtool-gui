 I tried playing this game, but right from the start, I knew I was in trouble. No matter what I changed in the video options or on my monitor, this game was just too dark. The first guy I talked to I couldn't even see and the item he left me I couldn't find because it was just too dark. This is the only game I have had this problem with. It could be an awesome game, but I will never know.
