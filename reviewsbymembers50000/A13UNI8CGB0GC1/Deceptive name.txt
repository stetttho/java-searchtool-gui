 Let's get this straight right now: this is NOT pilates.  There may be a few pilates movements incorperated, but it's really more of a low-impact aerobics routine, or a warm-up for something else.  I was given this as a gift from someone who mistakenly thought it was the other DVD called Perfect Pilates (which I have yet to see, and so cannot review) and was so disappointed by how misleading the title is to the actual contents, I will be returning this.  I never return gifts.   But I wanted a pilates tape, and that is simply NOT what this is.
