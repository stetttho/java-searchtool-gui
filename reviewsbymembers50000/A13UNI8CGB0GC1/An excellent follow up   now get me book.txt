 We've been clammoring for this book for years, and it was worth the wait. Harry has changed a lot over the summer, after the tragedies he survived at the end of his fourth year at Hogwarts - he's more assertive, far less passive, and has a bit more of a bitter sense of humor.  Once we get reaccustomed to his maturing, the novel takes off...  more characters, more adventure, more mystery, and one of the most thrilling "battle" scenes I've read in I don't know how long. The lessons in Harry Potter are fantastic ones for anyone to learn - racism/segregation/prejudice is bad, sometimes you have to work with people you don't like for the greater good, and inside us all there's a power we are unaware of, just waiting for us to find it. What will we do after book seven?
