 What an adorable book!  This is a great book for fans of fairies or feng shui.  Its illustrations are colorful and amusing, and it manages to convey some of the more simple feng shui concepts in an entertaining "starter" format - although it's the only book I've seen that mentions chocolate as one of the elements of nature.  Not that I argue with that, mind you! Flo is so charming I immediately ordered her other published books, and await the release of more eagerly!  Flo's stories are fun, simple books that are thoroughly attractive and enjoyable.
