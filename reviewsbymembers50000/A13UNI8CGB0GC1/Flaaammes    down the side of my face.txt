 This is a great movie - some humor that adults will "get" but nothing too risque for the kids, entertaining when you just need a mindless escape, and still has enough twists and turns to keep you counting bodies  (and Body') in every room.  Tim Curry, the late Madeline Kahn, Martin Mull,  Lesley Ann Warren... the casting is perfect! Best scene?   "He had  threatened to kill me in public."  "Why would he want to kill you  in public?" "I think she meant he threatened, in public, to kill  her." "Oh."
