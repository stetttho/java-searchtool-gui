 Annie Modesitt is a truly gifted knitter who is doubly gifted by the ability to describe what her fingers are doing in a way that makes it clear to those reading the book. Probably not for someone who's never picked up knitting needles at all before, just about any knitter anywhere beyond this first step can get something from Ms. Modesitt's book, even if it's just inspiration. Her essays describe her own experiences with knitting, and show her sense of humor that just shines. The technical descriptions are clear, and the projects that she's done are so well explained, one feels as though she was right there teaching over one's shoulder.  Any knitter will learn a fascinating technique which blends the best of the two more known styles of knitting, and become a speedy, even, and most importantly, intuitive and creative knitter. The beginner will have sound foundation on which to develop skills, and learn to conquer knitting insecurities which may prevent project development. The intermediate knitter will appreciate Modesitt's contageous enthusiasm, and likely rediscover a passion for knitting that may have faded after doing one too many sweaters or pairs of socks in the same way. The advanced knitter will be find knitting time spent on knitting projects neverbefore dreamed of - an expanded range of hats, jewelry, and even FURNITURE!!!  As Modesitt says, we don't unlearn past knowlege, we build upon it, and whether this book is a basic foundation or one more brick in the wall reaching to the top, it is a strong and solid addition to the construction of a well-rounded knitter.
