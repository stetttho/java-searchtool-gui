 Decide whether or not you like the movie without worrying about the people who strongly hate it because someone told them it was racist (although I thought it was clear the Japanese were doing what they thought to be honorable, despite it being against the "good guys") or for whatever reasons they didn't like it.  Make up your own mind about that.  I enjoyed the movie - and it is a fictional movie, not a documentary by any means - but I won't buy it on DVD until they come out with a version that doesn't split the movie itself between two disks - put the all extras on the second disk, and the whole movie on the first.  I don't think it was so long that it wouldn't fit, but the intrusion in the middle is unforgivable.  I'll buy it as soon as the whole movie is on one disk!
