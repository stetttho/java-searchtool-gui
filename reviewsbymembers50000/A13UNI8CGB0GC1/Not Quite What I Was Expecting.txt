 First of all, I know it says right here on the page that the book is 48 pages, but I skipped over than in my excitement about knitting, and was *almost* disappointed when I opened the box and pulled out something that looked very much like a magazine. The book itself is very well written, encouraging, and enthusiastic, with good illustrations, and fun patterns (in both letter and graph form) that I can't wait to try! But it's not for a sock-beginner!  If the words "Now make the heel flap" remind you of The Far Side cartoon ("Now a miracle occurs") you might not be ready for this book - unless you have another source of help. Don't get me wrong - this is DEFINITELY one that belongs in your knitting library; it's fun, informative, and an excellent source.  But it's not the place to start.
