 I taught myself to knit - and knit only - off of a pamphlet in a store.  I could start, I could do the basic knit stitch, then I could make the world's longest scarf, because I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to stop!  This book helped a great deal, with simple instructions and ways to fix all those mistakes you make in the beginning. There aren't a LOT of illustrations, but the ones they have were very helpful.  I can't imagine true photographs would be better - hello?  yarn is fuzzy!  It blends together in a photo, but in a drawing can be more distinctive.   The special sections which help prevent snarls and give helpful pointers are great, and make it easy to follow.  Also fun are the suggestions of dialogue heavy movies (so you can watch your hands more as you knit) and various "famous" knitters and how their styles have influenced the knitting world.  There's a bibliography at the back (I'm looking at it right now - 8 books on knitting, 7 on crocheting) as well as a glossary, and perhaps most importantly - how to fix mistakes without ripping out and starting over!!!  The overall format is easy to read, and very approachable! To quote the owner of a frequently visited yarn store - you'll never need another book on knitting!
