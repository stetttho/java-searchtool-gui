 I have been waiting three months for my ordered copy of this to ship.  Amazon is aware of the problem, but is still listing it as "usually ships within 10 days" as of this writing (July 9, 2005).    The book may or may not be fantastic, but you should know not to order it for any special occasion, or for any little one who knows about it and will ask for it.
