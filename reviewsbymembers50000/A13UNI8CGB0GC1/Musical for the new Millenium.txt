 It's important to remember what it is you're watching, as you're watching this.  It's a musical.  People don't break into song instead of conversing normally in real life, nor do they in realism theater.  This is not realism.  It's a musical.  A big, bold, graphic and glorious musical. The performances are all incredible - each actor takes risks that may seem too much (but again, we're talking suspension of reality here) and your emotions will be on a wild rollar coaster from the first to the last note. I saw the movie in the theater, and now own the DVD - which brings lots of entertaining extras that anyone who wants to see what goes into a musical will love.  Full length dance routines (not the shorter versions that make the final cut) and original camera angles make you take a second look at the movie - and realize just how brilliant Baz Luhrman is. You'll be singing along before you know it - since you probably already know the songs anyway - and you'll look at your pop music favorites in a whole new way... It really is Spectacular - Spectacular!!!
