 This book is just beautiful.  It's an obvious must have for Fairy lovers, but flower lovers will have their breath taken away as well.  It's filled with whimsy and the most amazing artwork, it's perfect for just about anyone's coffee table who likes a lighthearted "something different". Another plus to the book is how heavy the pages are.  They're nice and substantial, meaning it's OKAY TO PAGE THROUGH without feeling like the book will flake apart in your hands!  Often I find when books are about delicate fairies, they feel the book itself needs to be delicate - in this case, it's definitely for browsing. It's simply beautiful, and remarkable, and memorable.  A winner.
