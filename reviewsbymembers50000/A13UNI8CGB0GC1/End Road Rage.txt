 I keep my Bop-It Extreme in my car - it's a great stress reliever for traffic back-ups or waiting for someone.  Kept my 35-year-old friend and his 8-year-old son both entertained for an hour long car trip (both of them going "come on, it's my turn, pass it!")  Several of my other adult friends have found it to be addictive and bought one for themselves based on borrowing mine.   Would I play it every single day for an hour?  No.  But as a break in the hum-drum, and a chance to yell and hit something for fun, I think it's great for all ages!
