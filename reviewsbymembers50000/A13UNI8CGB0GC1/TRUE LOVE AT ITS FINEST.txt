 A simple story about a boy and his dogs?  Yes.  But so much more.  This book shows the love of a family, the love of two dogs, and the sacrifices involved.  It has brought a tear to my eye (okay, more than one - a box of kleenex worth!!!) since reading it in elementary school.  I've read it numerous times since then, and it touches my heart each time.  My most recent purchase of it is my third or fourth copy - it's one that gets read and worn frequently! It's suitable for readers of almost any age, although there are some scenes that might be difficult for readers under 9 or 10 (wild animals attack and injure the hero of the story, and the end is extremely emotional) it's beautifully written, a brilliant and touching story, and a must read for anyone who recognizes the bond between man and animal - and between animals with each other!
