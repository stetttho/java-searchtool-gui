 These are such an amazing series of books, I almost don't know where to start.  The tales are magical, the characters rich, and the stories so layered that any generation can enjoy them.  I remember reading them when I was very young - and being excited when the cartoon of "The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe" came on tv each winter.  15+ years later I took a college course on them and loved them even more!  Similar to Harry Potter, the tales are about 4 "normal" children who stumble into an alternate world filled with ... well, lions and witches.  To this day, the name Aslan brings a smile to my face!  My only recommendation is to read them in the order they were written - which is (oddly) NOT chronological order to the timeline of Narnia itself, and not the order provided in this collection.  I don't suppose it makes all that much difference, and it certainly doesn't make the stories less enjoyable, nor cause me to lower my rating.  I just think you owe it to youself to be drawn into the world the way C.S. Lewis intended (and was drawn into it himself). I honestly think this is a must have for any library - young or old - and have bought several sets for loved ones, and to replace the much loved and worn copies of my own!
