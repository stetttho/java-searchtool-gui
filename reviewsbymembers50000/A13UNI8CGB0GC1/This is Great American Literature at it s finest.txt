 Fortunately, fifteen years (or more) ago, I read this book on my own before my English teacher required it...  this is not a book that needs to be analysed and charted.  It is one that needs to be absorbed, and felt.  It does NOT deserve to be one of those books students hate merely because it's required reading. The characters are as real as books get, the small town one that you might live in now, or your grandparents might have lived in decades ago.  The issues - from racism, sibling relationships, and just plain growing up - touch your soul.  And it's just plain fun to read. It's a bit of American culture that should be cherished... passed on as the valuable art it is - but to tear it apart with attempts to read into symbolism, or to over analyze it... that nearly denies Harper Lee the respect she deserves for writing it.
