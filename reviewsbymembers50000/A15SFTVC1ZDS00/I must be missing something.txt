 This CD is on more year-end 10 best lists than any other, so far as I can tell (ok, maybe U2 is up there as well).  I don't know why.  I love Prince, his most obvious influence, and Marvin Gaye, his other glaring influence.  And I was prepared to love this record.  But I don't.  Marvin Gaye and Prince are/were able to maintain high energy and interest even in the most languid groove.  To me, this one just falls flat.  After repeated listenings, I just don't get what the fuss is about.
