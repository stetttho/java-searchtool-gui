 That Brian Wilson could make this record at all is a miracle, given his  personal history.  That fact led critics at the time to overrate the actual  product.  Yes, Love and Mercy is a classic - but it is the only song on  this record that ranks with Brian Wilson's best.  Most of the album is  warmed-over, late era Beach Boys.  Buy Pet Sounds.  Buy California Girls.   Buy Good Vibrations, perhaps the best box set ever.  But don't buy this  unless you've got everything else and feel the need to own even second-tier  Brian Wilson.
