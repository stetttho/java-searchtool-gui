 Ok, it's not Train A Comin' or El Corazon, the masterpieces that followed Steve Earle's release from prison.  But let's face it:  Steve Earle is a national treasure - one of the best songwriters our country has ever  produced.  And this album merely adds to his legend:  the Irish-influenced  Galway Girl, the Beatles-through-a-mixmaster title track, and a handful of  the amazing ballads that he can seemingly write in his sleep.  There's a  little filler here, but it's still a keeper.
