 I'm not a huge McCartney fan, but wow.  This is the most consistently enjoyable album he's ever done as a solo artist.  Paul honors his wife,  Linda, by blowing the doors off the studio and screaming his lungs out on  mostly obscure older rock and roll tunes.  Imagine an entire album of songs  as fun and energetic as the Beatles' "I'm Down" and you have the  idea.
