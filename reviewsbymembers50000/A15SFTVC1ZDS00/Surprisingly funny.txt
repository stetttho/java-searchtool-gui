 Given that this book won the Pulitzer for fiction, I expected beautiful writing.  What surprised me was the amount of laugh-out-loud humor, much of it based integrally in the well-drawn characters and their interaction with each other.  This book's wide scope reminds me of the best John Irving, without Irving's occasional lazy habits.  First-rate.
