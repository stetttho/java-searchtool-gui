 John Irving touches on familiar themes, in a familiar style (including  books within books, a heavy infusion of erotic content, and sporadic,  shocking violence).  But this is not a re-hash of his earlier work.   Rather, it is a more mature, disciplined novel, which made me laugh out  loud and - at a key moment - find myself crying tears of joy in the middle  of an airplane.  Quite simply, it is the best book by one of my favorite  authors.
