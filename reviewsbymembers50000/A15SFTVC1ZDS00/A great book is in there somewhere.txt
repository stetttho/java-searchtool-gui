 This is a quick, fun read without a lot of depth.  That is unfortunate, because the theme - an homage to Tex Winter's triangle offense as "pure" basketball - is worth exploring in depth.  I enjoyed the book, but the sloppy editing, particularly in Phil's chapters, interfered with that enjoyment.  If you haven't read "Sacred Hoops," start there.  If you like that one, this is a lesser, but still enjoyable sequel.
