 This book has a viewpoint, which should not be a crime in biography.  The book is not as virulently anti-Daley as some of the reader comments suggest.  Those of us who live in the city run by King Richard II can see  both the good and ill that Richard J. Daley wrought.  This is a  well-written, thoughtful portrait of a man and the salvation of a city (and  the seeds for its potential downfall as well).  Anyone who cares about  Chicago or American politics should read it.
