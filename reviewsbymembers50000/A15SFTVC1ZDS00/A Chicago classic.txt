 Material Issue may have been the best pure band out of the Chicago scene that spawned Smashing Pumpkins, Liz Phair, and Urge Overkill, among many others.  It's great three minute, three chord rock and roll, wearing Jim Ellison's heart and influences on its sleeve.  Contrary to one of the other reviews, MI did not disband.  Ellison killed himself, a tragic loss for pop music.  But that is not why to buy this album:  buy it for the life that courses through Ellison's songs and his band's performances, not for the sad way his life ended.
