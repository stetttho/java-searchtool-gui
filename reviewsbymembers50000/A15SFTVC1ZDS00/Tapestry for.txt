 Ok, so it's not Carole King's masterpiece - but Aimee Mann's new album has  striking similarities to King's classic.  The songs are perfectly rendered  miniatures, with thoughtful, understated arrangements, incisive lyrics, and  melodies that stick to your brain like tar to sneakers on a hot August day.   Near perfect.
