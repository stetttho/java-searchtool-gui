 I am a huge Palm fan and use my VX religiously.  But . . . this product is a disaster.  The so-called color screen is so dull and lifeless that I couldn't tell that most screens were in color at all.  I ordered the game and travel cards.  The game card did not work at all.  The travel card contained next to no useful information.  Just an awful product.
