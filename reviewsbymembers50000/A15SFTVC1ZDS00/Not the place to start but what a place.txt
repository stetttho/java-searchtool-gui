 If you've never heard Prince before, buy (in no particular order) the box set (Hits and B-Sides), Dirty Mind (if you have one), 1999, Purple Rain, Sign of the Times, and Diamonds and Pearls.  Is this album as great as those, each of which ruled my CD player for a year or more? Not quite, but it's awfully close.  Superb, utterly original music, the usual wacked-out lyrics, and occasional displays of wrenching emotion - plus, oddly enough, a cover version of a Sheryl Crow song that blows the doors off the original.  If this is where Prince's head is at today, he's still at the top of his game after more than 20 years.  Amazing.
