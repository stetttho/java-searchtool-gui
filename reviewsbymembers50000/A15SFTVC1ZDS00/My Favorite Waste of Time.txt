 Marshall Crenshaw's first album was his best - and one of the best albums  of the decade.  He is this generation's Buddy Holly.  If you've never heard  him, start here.  If, like me, you owned this on LP many years ago, it is  worth upgrading to CD.  The bonus tracks, including the classic  "Favorite Waste of Time," are not the usual filler.
