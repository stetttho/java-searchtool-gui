 Let's face it:  five CD's of outtakes and b-sides (the Tracks box set) is a bit much for all but us hard-core Bruce fans.  18 Tracks, on the other hand, is a more bite-sized near masterpiece.  With a couple of exceptions  (I'd name Seaside Bar Song and Trouble River as the two) the songs all  work, and some of them rank with Bruce's best.  The Promise is manna from  heaven; My Love Will Not Let You Down was a highlight of the 1999-2000  tour, and Where the Bands Are has become my 5 year old's favorite Bruce  song.  Worth buying for even the casual Springsteen fan.  Hardcore fans  have to have it.
