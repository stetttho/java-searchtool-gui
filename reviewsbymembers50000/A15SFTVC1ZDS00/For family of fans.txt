 Notwithstanding a few glaring factual errors, Alterman accomplishes what no other writer has:  he explains the rational (in the view of this Bruce nut) near-religious ferver and devotion of Bruce Springsteen's core fans.   I want my wife to read this book, so she might understand why I drop  everything and fly around the country every few years to see a 50 years old  man and his close friends sing and play for three hours a night.  The  stories are largely derived from Dave Marsh's hagiographies, but the book  works.
