 Simply one of the greatest overlooked rock and roll records ever.  No, that's not right.  Simply one of the greatest rock and roll records ever.  Buy this record.  You will not be sorry.  Steve Van Zandt is the arranging genius and the soul of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band.  He put into this record everything gleaned from all those late nights listening to scratchy old R&B records - and somehow made an album unlike anything he or anyone else has made before or since.  None of it sounds dated, even 20 years down the road.  All of it sings with a passion that we rarely see in pop music any more.  Buy this record.  If you love rock and soul and R&B and songs about men and women that reflect reality, buy this record.
