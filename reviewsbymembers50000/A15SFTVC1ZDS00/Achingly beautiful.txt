 I know next to nothing about Eva Cassidy.  I received this CD as a gift last week and it has been in my CD player non-stop since then.  She has a beautiful voice, the arrangements are tasteful yet innovative, and the  entire effect is one of beautiful sadness.   I understand that Eva  Cassidy died young.  That is sad, but her music stands up entirely apart  from her personal story.  Buy this CD.
