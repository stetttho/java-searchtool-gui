 This is an excellent accessible reprint of the famous Oxford Univ Press translation by Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, perhaps the foremost Egyptologist and archaeolinguist of the late 19th Century. It retells the Ethiopian legend of the founding of the "Solomonic" dynasty, which only ended with the demise of Emperor Haille Selassie I, and the insistent "proof" provided by the presence of a hidden artifact in the Sanctuary Chapel at Mariam Tseyon in Axum, said to be the original Ark of the Covenant. This edition suffers somewhat in omitting Budge's 50-odd page introductory essay, which was rich in historical background and knowledgeable commentary. The interesting part for many, the famed romance between King Solomon and Queen Makeda, is somewhat glossed as the scribe/deacon was in no little hurry to provde a patent of the divine right to rule for the then-current monarch. Scholars might find useful query in whether there is evidence of an older (pre-Christian tale) with interpolations later made to "Christianize" it as the religion of the aristocracy in Ethiopia changed, which might indicate the pedigree of the tale. This is the legend prompting many current sects' preaching of Afrocentric ownership of <"true"> Judaism and Christianity -and Rastafarianism (Haille Selassie's given name was Ras Tafari). Persons looking for a good romance will find here the foundations for Ms. Janice Dennie's series of historical romances such as "Moon Goddess; the Queen of Sheba" and the forthcoming "Menyelik the Conquering Lion" -also available through Amazon!
