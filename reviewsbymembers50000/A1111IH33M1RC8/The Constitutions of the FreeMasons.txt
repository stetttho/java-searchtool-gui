 Wonderful that copies of this little book are still in circulation for any FreeMason or historically- or philosophically-minded reader to peruse. Rev James Anderson wrote this to attempt to regularize the workings of lodges of speculative "Masons" as distinct from trade guilds of operative or stone- Masons. The governance of societies of FreeMasons and the charges upon their individual behaviors both inside the lodge and outside in the profane world show how this confraternity has elevated benevolence to one's fellow man to a high (Royal?) Art. Even though written in the 18th Century, for thinking men of all levels of society to live the Enlightement and oppose religious and ethnic prsecution, there is little in Aderson's Constitutions which is not applicable to human society today. I am proud that my lodge left Philadelphia during its occupation by the British in 1778 and Wintered with the Continental Army at Valley Forge; there were many collaborators in Philadelphia, but there were a few who saw where we were going. The intolerant, the authoritarian, the supremacists have always acted against Masonic lodges upon first gaining power; did you ever wonder why?...
