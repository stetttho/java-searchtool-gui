 This booklet (it is just under fifty pages) packs enough information regarding Western Christian symbols for those doing embroidery or hand-drawn signs and banners. It is a good, quick survey of many symbols and their very general meanings. For the researcher, it is a good place to start exploring iconography, and a useful directory for reading Christian art. Church publications and even embroidery shops with digital equipment look forward to the CD carrying the clipart and commentaries.
