 I cannot recommend this book too highly to readers intrigued by the decribed structure and functionality of the Herodian Temple in Jerusalem. The author has done two magnificent tasks:  first, creating a scale model of Herod's Temple based upon descriptions from Flavius Josephus, the Midrash, and Scripture. second, writing a considered text to accompany excellent photos of his model, intelligible to anyone who can read English. His text and terrific color photos are unencumbered by "should-be" tradition, and the book makes a compact valucable addition to any Jerusalem scholar's library. Freemasons should note the shape of the main building from above. Tau for two?
