 A bit of a disappointment, a short book firmly seated in the "Freemasonry is Americanism" genre from a 33rd degree Scottish Rite Mason. It is assumed as a matter of course that, since the Founding Fathers had a great proportion of Masons amongst them, that the principles they fought for/enshrined in the US Constitution, those principles were necessarily Masonic, yet the new member would look in vain in the symbolic lodge degrees for universalism or transparency or absolute liberty to pursue happiness. There are also some notable democratic actors whose masonic membership is problematic who are claimed, as the Rosicrucians often do, to be members. Ambrose Bierce notes this in his (in)famous "Devil's Dictionary" in his longish entry under "freemason". An inocuous little work, though I will remark that, although published in 1994, there are no mentions of Prince Hall African-American Masons who have argued (perhaps more diligently) for the same principles for nearly 200 years.
