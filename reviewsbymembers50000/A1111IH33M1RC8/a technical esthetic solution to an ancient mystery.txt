 Absolutely fascinating account of the <probable> solution to the meaning of the "te'amin" occurring  in the Masoretic or traditional text of the Hebrew Bible. For centuries they have been thought  to be vowels or punctuations (which purpose they may have served as they DO  govern the chant),yet without clear meaning, this having been lost in the  dispersions and persecutions of the Hebrew Temple hierarchy. I have heard  Haik-Vantoura's decipherment/arrangement of the 'Song of Solomon' and it is  a beautiful composition very clearly meant for male-female duet. Whether  this is the ACTUAL system as originally used, it DOES produce beautiful  music that is probably upwards of 2,500 years old.
