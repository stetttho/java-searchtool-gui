 It bemuses me that so few people know of this American hero; William  Still was born of an escaped slave in Delaware and moved early in life to Philadelphia, where, by dint of perserverance and personal sweat, he managed to teach himself to read and write and become a major industrialist in 19th-Century Philadelphia. He became an officer of the Pennsylvania Abolitionist Society, and was instrumental in turning it from cheerleading meetings to active MI-9-like evasion and escape assistance for slaves, forming the first of the so-called "vigilance committees". He was the first to have undercover agents on the docks and railroad stations of SE Pennsylvania, where Southern plantation owners transitted with their "properties" on their travels. The book is Brother Still's after-action report initially published by subscription. It is a collection of spectacular, tragic escape stories, some black genealogists today using it for family research. Of particular interest is the network of men Still was able to utilize, putting themselves at risk from federal marshals after 1851 and the Fugitive Slave Act, who volunteered immediate clandestine assistance to escapees of another race. Whence came such a moral, secret enterprise? That's easy, William Still was a Pennsylvania Freemason. His grave is in Eden Cemetery in Delaware County, and should be paid respect by all Pennsylvania Freemasons, as he did more for the City of Philadelphia than anyone except Benjamin Franklin (also a Pennsylvania Freemason). This edition is out of print, but copies may be had from used bookselllers, and I understand the Johnson House Underground Railroad Museum in Philadelphia has hosted the issue of a new edition in February 2005.
