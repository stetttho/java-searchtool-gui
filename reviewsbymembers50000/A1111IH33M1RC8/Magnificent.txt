 I can add very little to the reviews already posted, except to comment that it is obvious that Director Peter Jackson comes from "our" generation; the generation who went through secondary school in the late sixties and early seventies, and whose cultural millieu, for all our lifestyle "differences", is remarkably the same. I recognized characters walking onto the screen before their first lines, and Dwarf- architecture looked, well DWARF. And Elvish sets looked ELVISH -and we forget that although Tolkien used a lot of words, there were not a lot of specific descriptions. I would like to submit that the famed trilogy could possibly be credited for the success of the Civil Rights movement in the United States (well there is a way to go yet, but the laws are there now). Think of the Fellowship -we have representatives of multiple ehtnic/racial groups, very few of whom seem to get along with each other in Middle Earth, suddenly combining for a common task (not that they don't bristle at each other occasionally, but, hey...), and our suspension of disbelief in the mid-60's allowed us to accept the idea that those "other" people were still people. There's a PhD thesis for somebody there....
