 I must confess to owning two copies of Wallis Budge's translation, and therefore my review may be colored or spoiled by previous contact. It must be noted that Dr Brooks used a Spanish translation from the Ethiopian Ge'ez as his starting point, and there are several lacunae and editorial lapses in this edition. It was also noticeable that Dr Brooks apparently believes the claims in the original and advances scarcely-disguised notions of Africanist superiority, which would be rightly termed racialism as it had been with Budge's British Imperial conceits. The assertions in the editorial review above are noticeably absolute and categorical, despite the legend which it relates, and which may be found in differing versions within Ethiopia itself.
