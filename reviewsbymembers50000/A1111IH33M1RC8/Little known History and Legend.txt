 This book is a series of translations from original documents by the famed Egyptologist/Hebraist Sir E. A Wallis Budge of the British Museum. It was published during the ascendancy of 'Ras Taferi' who had not-yet been  enthroned as 'Negus*nagassi', Emperor Haille Selassie of Ethiopia, and was  evidently done with his cooperation. It is a fine scholarly work which does  not lead itself to 'light' or 'summer beach' reading, but very finely fills  in the dearth of available historical and legendary information for the  Horn of Africa and, indeed, the entire area immediately South of the  European fascination with Egypt. Modern scholars such as Stuart Munro-Hay  still reference Budge's translations, and although the scent of the 19th  Century Imperial is evident in a few of Budge's editorial comments, it is  still indepensable for the student of Ethiopian history. -And someday we  will find a 'Rosetta Stone' for Meroitic!
