 Bro Wilmshurst's volume is regarded with awe by many Freemasons, and not without cause; there are many deep ehtical ruminations here. The book suffers from the Weltanchauung of the late 19th Century, when everybody reading was presumed to be an Englishman, worried about classical philosophies, and a Trinitarian Christian. The book suffers from repetitiveness (I surmise it to have been a collection of previously-delivered lectures and speeches) and 19th Century grandiloquence, but nonetheless proves to be a worthwhile addition to most Mason's libraries. Just make sure you donate your copy to a local library when you are finished with it, so that students and scholars may form their own opinions; it might be shelved with Freud and Jung instead of Nathan Bedford Forrest. Remember also, Bro Benjamin Franklin's acute summation of "The Mysteries": "the big secret is that there IS no secret".
