 A lushly photographed Continental retelling of the Beauty-and-the- Beast/young-girl-comes-of-age-with-demon-who-turns-into-handsome-prince story, my commentary will part from other reviewers (I found the story predictable, and acting melodramatic) by mentioning my primary reason for purchase of this video: the Tuscan villa setting including the famous "Monster Grotto". The sculpture garden attributed to a retired 'condottiere' who commissioned grotesque sculptures for his meditative garden, reflecting his supposed cynical worldview. The views of this Tuscan curiosity are worth the lightweight fairy tale surrounding it.
