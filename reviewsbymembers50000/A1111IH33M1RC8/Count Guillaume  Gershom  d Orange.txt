 This book should be read by everyone interested in Medieval French History and/or the "chansons de geste". It solves the scholarly mystery of why Charlemagne, a strictly Christian/Roman Catholic monarch, had such a good relationship with the Jews of the Carolingian Empire to the continuing fulminations of the ecclesiastical authorities. The author uses sources not generally referred to by European Medievalists, such as the famed Cairo Genitza and synagogic correspondences from Byzantium and Kairouan. The chansons provide useful accompaniement to this volume, and it is absolutely fascinating how "al Makhir" became "Aimeri" became "Thierry" became "Heimrich". The clan of the Narbonnese was celebrated by every one of the surviving chansons de geste, and the mystery now is: who was "Garin de Montglane", perhaps GAON OF MARSEILLES? The mystery of the illustration on the cover of the Penguin Paperbacks edition of Wolfram von Eschenbach/s "Willehalm" is now expalined -but see it for yourself; Wolfram knew of whom he was speaking. In the Sidney Painter translation of Einhard's "Life of Charlemagne" (1994 ed.Univ of Michigan Ann Arbor Paperback)the translator remarks on Einhard's curious "ommission" of the archbishopric of Narbonne in the Emperor's will (page 64 footnoted #83), claining the contemporary account is wrong; I beg to differ as there may not have *been* an archbishop there at the time-if it were the seat of the Jewish Principality. I always hoist a toast to St Guillaume de Gellone on his Feast Day, May 28th, and his "monastery" is now located in upstate New York and available for tours since the last Century; it is the CLOISTERS. Thank you Dr. Zuckerman.
