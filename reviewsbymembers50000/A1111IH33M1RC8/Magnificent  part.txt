 Well, I was thoroughly impressed with the artistic treatment of the Fellowship of the Ring, and found only editorial advantage to the screenplay. Peter Jackson's second volume-film makes a somewhat lukewarm book into a roaring movie, and the purist-decried changes to the text serve only to reign in JRRT's sometime excessive verbiage. SPOILER: Purists recoiled (I saw them do so in the theatre) when the unheralded horn blows before the assault on the Hornburg. It is testimony to Mr Jackson that, when the horn sounded, my mind said "Elves!", and, dammit, I was right, and the plot addition was exactly with the spirit of the story. The Free Peoples come to each other's aid, no matter their ethnic dislikes (was there a moral here?), according to the larger issues at stake. While it might be argued that Mr Jackson has let his romanciers run wild with the attraction between Arwen and Aragorn, it must be remembered that JRRT dealt with this in his appendices, and much would be puzzling to the viewer who has not read the text. The engagement between the Rohirrim and the wolf-riders was logically necessary as JRRT's poetry did not always serve military sense; a spoiling attack by Theoden's force was necessary to allow his people time to reach the Hornburg. This is an excellent movie made out of a weak book, and wholly in the spirit of JRRT's overall work, if deviating from it in some necessarily dramatic details. The Return of the King promises to be a whopper.
