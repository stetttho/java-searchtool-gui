 This book (published by the British Museum) is the most comprehensive treatment of Egyptian music and musicians I've ever seen in one place (at least for the general reader). It uses no footnotes, but it does give a  bibilography of the massive academic tomes on which it draws. Special  mention is given to the use of chironomy (gestures of the hand, arm and  fingers) to represent and to conduct music, to the role of music in every  aspect of Egyptian life, and to the connection between the erotic and the  spiritual in Egyptian thought. My only disappointment is that she ignores  the musical scale (again, based on chironomy) reconstructed by one of her  sources, the late Hans Hickmann. I had no idea Dr. Mannische had written  so many other books as well, though I should've guessed this would be so.  Until this gets back into print, I'd say any book by this author would be a  good bet.
