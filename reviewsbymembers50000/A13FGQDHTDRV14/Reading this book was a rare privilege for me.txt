 ...as was reading the rest of the trilogy when it was in print. (I got the whole trilogy through a friend in England, but I'd never heard that Mr. Milne had written a fourth volume.) I'm glad to see that excerpts of all  his memoirs are available in one volume, BEYOND THE WORLD OF POOH, because  Mr. Milne was indeed a gifted and sensitive man. I have a special  interest in this book because Christopher Robin, of all the characters, was  my favorite -- indeed, my alter ego. I knew from an early age that there  was a real boy behind the fictional character, and I sensed the three of us  were a lot alike. It was a delight to find out just how right my intuition  was.
