 It's difficult to add to what's been said already by so many (save that those reviewers who can't appreciate how the movie pokes fun at the Star Trek genre probably can't laugh at themselves either).  I can say this much: For a "Trekker" (a rational fan) like myself, this movie is pure genius and pure joy. Yes, it has a few plot holes big enough to drive a D'deridex-class Romulan Warbird through. But the scriptwriting overall is excellent, the cast-typing first-rate, the special effects top-notch (not least those necessary to transform Sigourney Weaver into Gwen DeMarco), the acting worthy of the technical expertise and vice versa, and the respect for the phenomenon of Trekkie fandom genuine. Perhaps best of all, the DVD has extra features that add much to the product without being overwhelming (like those endless director comments in some of the Star Trek DVDs). It makes me wish that someone really would start up a Galaxy Quest TV series with all the original cast and the elements of parody firmly intact -- and put it on the Sci-Fi Channel, if necessary.
