 Like his father A.A. Milne before him, the late Christopher (Robin) Milne became a pantheist and a humanist as an adult. This book illustrates a great deal of the process. I understand the nature of his skepticism toward  traditional Christianity, because he and I are a great deal alike. We share  a love of nature and the flip side of that love, a difficulty in seeing  beyond the natural to the supernatural. Yet for all his obvious mental  gifts, I find Mr. Milne's skepticism prejudicial, as I find my own natural  skepticism prejudicial. In this book, he seems to be searching for a  personal philosophy that leaves God out in a way that someone who wants to  be left alone searches for a place to hide. For him to submit to the idea  of a personal God would have required more changes in himself than he could  have borne. So far, I've been willing to pay the price of Christian  discipleship -- and that has made all the difference between us. I'm glad  to learn that excerpts of this book may be found in BEYOND THE WORLD OF  POOH, along with excerpts from his other books. He, like his father, was an  excellent writer and a thoughtful and gifted man.
