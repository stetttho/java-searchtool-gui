 Rarely do I give unqualified praise of anything. Maybe the fact I do here (well, almost) shows my ignorance, but I like just about everything about this album. What's not to like? OK, I would've liked some transliterations and not just translations of the Hebrew texts in the liner notes, but the whole concept of Judeo-Baroque music is fascinating. This album gives a view into a unique confluence of cultures at a unique time, and features two special loves of mine while it does (Hebrew and Baroque music). The instrumental and vocal performances are splendid, the liner notes informative, and the cover attractive. As I said, what's not to like? Well, at least some people at the time didn't like some of this music. To the Jews, it was too musically alien; to the Gentiles, too verbally alien. Sometimes you just can't win. But some Jewish composers of Baroque music (like Rossi) did well for themselves then and retain lasting fame now -- and that's good news all around. As for the modern listerner, if you like Baroque music, you ought to like this: European ear candy with just enough Middle Eastern spice to be interesting. I'd recommend it for Sabbath listening and secular enjoyment alike, and you can't say that about every album.
