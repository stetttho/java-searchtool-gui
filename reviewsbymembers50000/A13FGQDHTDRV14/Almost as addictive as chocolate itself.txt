 What could be better than a book written by my favorite greeting card author and illustrator? And about my favorite vegetable: CHOCOLATE (is a many-splendored thing)! To whet your appetite, I give you what the Pig says (on the reverse cover) from the lecturn/podium to the Turkey, Cow, Cat and Hippo in the audience: Pig: This comprehensive guide answers every possible question about chocolate. Turkey: Is chocolate available in nicer colors than brown? Pig: This thorough guide answers every INTELLIGENT question about chocolate. This is a genuinely educational book, to be sure; but the facts are always thoroughly interlaced with Boynton's inimitable wit (both verbal and graphic), with which she all but pulls your leg off at times while keeping her own tongue firmly in cheek. Buy a candy bar (or better yet, a box of chocolates) from Godiva to go with this book, and you're have the luck of the chimney sweeps follow you (or the lucky lass/lad you give them to) forever.
