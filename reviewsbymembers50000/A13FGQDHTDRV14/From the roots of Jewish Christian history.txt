 This well-done CD explores the often-complex interrelationships between Jewish and Christian music (both sacred and secular). It goes from the earliest sources to the end of the Middle Ages. Most striking to me was  the track that alternates an early Jewish chant of Psalm 114 and a  Gregorian chant of the same Psalm. Mr. Cohen thinks this may be the oldest  song on recording. I don't agree with that assessment; the music of the  Temple at Jerusalem was different and far older (cf. my reviews of LA  MUSIQUE DE LA BIBLE REVELEE, CD, and the book THE MUSIC OF THE BIBLE  REVEALED, both on Amazon.com). There are many other beautiful and  haunting works on this CD, some of which make me think there was more  Hellenistic influence on early Jewish music than the producer and  performers realize. This CD gives us *popular* rather than *classical*  Jewish liturgy, which then influenced Christian liturgy (and vice versa).  It also gives us a good sample of popular, non-liturgical Jewish song.
