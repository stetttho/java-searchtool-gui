 I don't know why Amazon.com has moved so many of my early product reviews (especially those of Enya's albums) into the anonymous file ("a music fan"). Here is a repost, and slight revision, of my original review.  Serendipity strikes again...that quality of finding something wonderful that one isn't looking for. This debut album by the Taliesin Orchestra is one of serendipity's more powerful lightning bolts in my life. Much closer (IMO) to the spirit of the original artist's work than TO's follow-up treatment of George Winston's music, this CD takes the heart of Enya's music, plants it as a seed in new soil, and nurtures it into a bloom worthy to stand in Enya's own tea garden. "Lothlorian", the title track, "The Celts", "Bardic Dance" -- all of these sparkle like stars painted in the sky...(pardon my numerous puns!)  There is only one thing I really dislike about this recording: its treatment of the incomparable "The Memory of Trees". Every note and every chord Enya puts into her arrangement is necessary to the whole; take out even a little of what she put in, and the whole song is denatured. In TO's arrangment, the musical climax at the end of the original song is missing (why?), and with it the sense of holy awe the song is meant to evoke. Had the arranger stuck strictly to the melodic and harmonic structure of the original song, his soaring strings could've melted us the listeners right down into our socks. As it is, the arrangement succeeds despite itself, because the starting material is so strong.
