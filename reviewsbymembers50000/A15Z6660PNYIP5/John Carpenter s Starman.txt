He must evade government agents in time to return to his own planet. Special Features: Trailers. Review: John Carpenter directing a romance? Yes it is true one of the signs of the apocalypse has come to pass. Widow Karen Allen can't get over the death of her husband, but when a visiting alien takes his form (Jeff Bridges) they must flee government agents who are desperate to catch the alien. This film is sweet, funny, and yes an enjoyable chick flick. (Hm is that the second sign of the apocalypse?) As for the cast they are all fantastic. I bought every performance. Karen Allen and Jeff Bridges give the performances of their lives wow! Carpenter directs his chick flick with unbelievable style. This is just further proof Carpenter is the greatest director of all time. As for the DVD? Get off your rears Columbia/Tri Star and go make my special Edition of this and "Vampires" NOW!
