Review: When a fantastically filmed ship crashes on a remote planet with 3 suns the survivors must find away off the planet. However they discover that creatures of the night live beneath the planet, and when a total eclipse falls they must survive the dark as well as each other. David Twohy has a knack for writing engrossing sci-fi films ("The Arrival") and this is a great film. I'm a big fan of animal attack films, and sci-fi so naturally I wanted to see this. I was not disappointed superb special effects, acting, and direction highlights this gripping sci-fi/horror film. Vin Diesel owns the show. The rest of the actors turn in brilliant performances especially David, Hauser, and Mitchell, but Diesel surpasses them. He proves here he is the action star of the future. Twohy uses colors, images, and lighting all to his advantage. He puts a masterful style into this film and deserves to be proud. As for the DVD? I like the Unrated version better than the R rated one. Not a lot of features, but well worth the money.
