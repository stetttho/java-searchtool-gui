Review: This film is excellent let's get that out of the way. One of the most terrifying creatures to ever bloody up the silver screen is a delight to behold. The use of creature effects instead of stop motion make this baby look as polished now as it was then. An arctic research time is under siege when some crazed foreigners unearthed an alien life form that has now come into there camp. The only way to kill one is to burn it, and worst of all it can absorb you, take your form, and make several copies of itself. Trust no one! A true horror classic from the master! Kurt Russell is absolutely incredible, Keith David is a great tough guy, and the whole supporting cast is excellent. Carpenter goes all out building the suspense, delivering eerie shots, and shocking images. I loved his fade to blacks. Carpenter is the man! As for the DVD? This is a dream come true. This baby is chocked full of extras and well worth your hard earned cash.
