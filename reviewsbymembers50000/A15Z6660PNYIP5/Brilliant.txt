 Well it is a lot like the Matrix (however Dark City was first). It starts off with a professor (Kiefer Sutherland) explaining the arrival of "the strangers" a race of aliens, and how he betrayed the human race. A man (Rufus Sewell) awakens confused he is in a hotel room with a murdered prostitute, blood on his forehead, and naked in the bathtub. He then is called by the Professor who warns him to leave. He does as several ominous looking "strangers" head up to his room. He then heads about the streets in a city that is always night. He can't remember who he is, or what he is supposed to be doing. He is being tracked by a detective (William Hurt) who is somewhat doubting his guilt as a prostitute murderer. Rufus Sewell's characters searching leads him back to his wife (Jennifer Connelly) and eventually the detective catches up to him. They then began searching for the answer to what this city (and world) really is. It is an absolutely dazzeling, captivating, fascinating sci fi tale. Its special affects are superb, and the acting is unbelievable. The directing is masterfully handled by Alex Proyas (The Crow). This is one of the most original and breathtaking films to come out recently. I HIGHLY recommend it. It is rated R for violence not very gory, a few choice words, and some naked hookers (mostly dead ones.), but those minor cautions aside if you are adult about this film you will love it, or at least appreciate its vision, scope, and magnitude.
