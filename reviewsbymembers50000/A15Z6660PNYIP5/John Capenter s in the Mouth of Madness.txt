Special Features: Wide-Screen and Full-Screen Versions, Feature Length Commentary, Trailer, Filmographies. Review: When the recent releases of films questioning reality came out this film is often not mentioned. This proceeded "The Matrix", "eXistenZ", and "The Thirteenth Floor". It is also one of the eeriest, deepest, most terrifying horror films in ages. Insurance fraud investigator John Trent (Sam Neill) is sent to find missing author Sutter Cane (Jurgen Prochnow). He is accompanied by the author's agent. They arrive in the small town which only exists in Cane's novels. Trent is sure this is a scam, but he slowly unravels that Cane's writings may threaten reality itself. Sam Neill is stupendous in this film, Prochnow is memorable in his small role as is Charlton Heston, Carmen is interesting, but forgettable. Carpenter's direction is fantastic his uncanny eye builds suspense on a stellar level. As for the DVD? The Wide/Full screen kills the space for most special features, but it is still well worth buying.
