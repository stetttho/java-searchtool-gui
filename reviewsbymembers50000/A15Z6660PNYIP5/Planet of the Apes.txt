Review: Being a big fan of the original I was really looking forward to this. What I received was an over-budgeted, under-scripted mess. This film follows a psychotic astronaut who blasts off to save a monkey, and he travels to a planet ruled by apes. He is captured, and subsequently escapes by running with several humans past a battalion of apes who see them, but do nothing except commit acts of violence against Kris Kristofferson. Them and their ape allies prepare to battle, and just when it looks like it is going to be interesting a monkey lands and the fight stops. It then proceeds to one of the most ludicrous endings in film history. The actors all seem lost and I don't blame them. Tim Burton's brilliance never really shines through. As for the DVD? Lot's of features make this so almost worth buying.
