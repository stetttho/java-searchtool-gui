Review: In a world where genes control everything about your life a young man who thinks he can be more switches place with a crippled elite. However people begin to suspect something may be wrong. A deep, cautionary drama Gattaca may be slow moving, but it is beautiful. There is a lot to get out of this film, prejudice, being more than people tell you, and sibling rivalry are just a few. This film often dallies in unimportant things, but for the most part this is a stunning Sci-fi/drama/romance. Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, and Jude Law are in top form. The rest of the cast complements them splendidly. Andrew Niccol proves he is a director with places to go, but he may want to work on his pacing. As for the DVD? Superbit sacrifices special features for picture and sound and for a film like Gattaca I appreciate that.
