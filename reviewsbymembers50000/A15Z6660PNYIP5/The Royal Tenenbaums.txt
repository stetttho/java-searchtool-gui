Review: Well let's start off by saying what a cast! How did they afford theses people? Gene Hackman, Danny Glover, Anjelica Huston, Bill Murray, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson. The cast would lead you to believe that this is a comedy. Well it has some funny moments, but at heart it is very much a drama. Royal Tenenbaum is a rascally old fellow who wants to make thing up to his family who he hasn't seen in years. The kids were all geniuses, but were forgotten due to the sins of the father. This film is touching, moving, and sometimes downright shocking in its portrayal of its characters. It reminded me a lot of "Magnolia" where the people's lives wove together. It is a fascinating film to watch simply to view the characters interacting with one another, and to see their motives are revealed. This film is deep, sweet, shocking, and an excellent acting. Gene Hackman and company were all snubbed for Oscar nominations. Hackman especially for his portrayal of the rascally, lovable patriarch. Wes Anderson's directing is on I really digged the slow motion Gwenyth Paltrow getting off the bus sequence. The soundtrack is slow and sweet it really goes with this film. As for the DVD itself it is a 2 disc, beautifully presented, but with some odd artwork. This baby is loaded with special features that fans of the film will love. It also has some large booklets in the front of reading material about the film. Definitely worth picking up.
