With his team slaughtered, and time running out. He must stop this vampire before a black cross allows the vampire to walk in the daylight. Special Features: Feature Length Commentary, Trailer. Review: This film opened with the highest Halloween opening ever, and sold like nobodies business on home video. Master slayer Jack Crow's entire team except sidekick Daniel Baldwin are slaughtered by the original vampire caused by a reverse exorcism by the catholic church that was never finished. This master vampire searches for the black cross to finish the ceremony that would then enable him to walk in the daylight. Crow and sidekick use a bitten hooker to hunt down the vampire due to her psychic link to him. This bloody vampire film is well written, stylish, and just the ticket for horror fans. I jumped out of my skin at the split in half killing. The acting is on James Woods scowling owns the picture he is one of the greatest tough guys ever in this film, Daniel Baldwin is excellent as the no bull sidekick with a soft spot, Sheryl Lee is on as the turning hooker, Tim Guinee as the reluctant priest, Thomas Ian Griffith as the Valic, and Maximillian Schell as the bishop, they are all in top form. Carpenter's direction is slick and he has an eye for spooky sights. This film gets better every time I watch it. As for the DVD? Well the commentary is cool, but couldn't they have added a little more to it? Disappointing, but the film makes it worthwhile. Where's the special edition?
