Review: When you get talking about classic sci-fi that is still top notch today you inevitably come to the subject of "Alien". This haunting, atmospheric tale of a small ship which is sent to answer a distress call remains one of the key films in sci-fi history. It is at its heart a monster tale, but frighteningly original. Even the monsters birth is disturbing and new. The crew is relentlessly stalked by the creature that comes aboard. With very little weaponry they must defeat the creature, and get off the ship alive. The cast is chillingly effective and Weaver gets her first chance to shine. Ridley Scott directs with pure atmosphere something that has been absent from films for a long time, and he knows to keep his creature in the shadows most of the time. This film is still as scary today as it was then, and is sure to go down as one of the greatest films of all time. As for the DVD? The "Alien" fans dream. This sucker is wall to wall extras and 3-D menus.
