Synopsis: When a law man is set up by his brother he must fight to clear his name, and to save the lives of those living within the corrupt system. Special Features: Trailer. Review: Back in the day when Stallone was the man this film was one of the cream of the crop. Stallone plays Judge Dredd part of the new breed of cop who are judge, jury, and executioner. In this future earth is a wasteland, and only a few megacities exist. These cities are violent places to be. The city is controlled by older judges and one in particular wants to grab power. He uses a violent ex-judge (Assante) who frames Dredd. Dredd then begins his quest for justice. One of the better sci-fi action epics out there "Judge Dredd" presents us with a bleak, dark, violent, future and then it lets Stallone loose "Rambo" style. Let the fun begin. Stallone was born to play the tough guy, Lane is surprisingly good, Schneider does the sidekick thing well, Prochnow is great, and Assante is pure evil. Danny Cannon directs this film with a frenetic pace and he succeeds. One beef I have is why are the religious people always the psychopaths??? As for the DVD? Nothing worthwhile I want a Special Edition!
