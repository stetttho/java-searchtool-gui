Review: The film starts out with an attempted assassination upon a young talented game designer (Leigh). She is taken away by Jude Law who must protect her. She however is only concerned that the game she spent so long designing is in one piece. She convinces him to play the game with her. Once inside they must figure out the point of the game, but as they enter and exit the game they begin to wonder what is the game and what isn't. This film is brilliantly written, and really requires some thinking. Everything has a unique organic look that sets this film in a class of its own. The acting is top notch. Leigh is fearless, Law is incredible, Ian Holm lends his considerable wealth of talent and charm to the film, and Willem Dafoe's small part is one of the best scenes in the film. David Cronenberg delivers a completely new and original vision and succeeds on every level of directing. As for the DVD? Ugh where is a special edition when you need it. Come on Dimension this film deserves it!
