 Not many people know this story, and I must say they got it as right as any other war film. This tells the story of Jewish fighters who held of the Germans longer than the entire army of Poland in the Warsaw Gherro. It shows all angles of the resistance effort, and is well directed by Jon Avnet. It is a harrowing tale and well worth watching for any war film fan, history buff, or well anyone. Excellent acting from a stellar cast including Hank Azaria, Donald Sutherland, Leelee Sobieski, David Scwimmer, Stephen Moyer, Jon Voight, Cary Elwes, Radha Mitchell, and many more. Not rated probably would've been PG-13 maybe an R.
