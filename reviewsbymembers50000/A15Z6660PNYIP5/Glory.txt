 Glory (R) *****/5 Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Cary Elwes, Morgan Freeman, Andre Braugher. Directed by: Edward Zwick Synopsis: The true story of the first all black regiment in the civil war. Special Features: Trailer. Review: The greatest war film ever in my opinion. It is not over bearing in its war scenes. It does not indulge in or exploit gore. It is disturbing in its battle scenes in the way they should be the drama and emotion of them. The soldiers in this film must battle not only the enemy, but also racism from within their own army. This film is uplifting and saddening to an extent never duplicated in motion picture history. The acting was incredible despite worries casting Ferris Bueller would ruin it. Broderick is fantastic as the white soldier chosen to lead the regiment, the underrated Cary Elwes again is superb as Broderick's best friend and right hand man, the always dependable Morgan freeman comes through again, Denzel took the Best Supporting Actor Oscar home, and a excellent support performance by Andre Braugher as Broderick's butler turned soldier caps the cast off. Edward Zwick is incredible from the director's chair. This film has every shot right, and it's pacing is excellent. He also does a great job in keeping focus during the battles. As for the DVD? This is the single disc version, and it's a freaking flip disc d'oh! The only special feature is the trailer (hold me back). Do yourself a favor and buy the 2 disc special edition.
