 Well I expected more from the people who brought me the shockingly frightening "House on Haunted Hill", but... A eccentric ghost collector (F. Murray Abraham) is killed capturing a ghost (along with several other expendable crewman) and his house is given to his grieving widower nephew (Tony Shalhoub). The house may I say is spectacular! Well to make a long story short an associate of the deceased collector (Matthew Lillard) shows up, and the ghosts (conveniantly locked in the basement) get loose. Everyone runs away screaming, kids are captured, Dad has to save them. This would be a bad film, but Matthew Lillard is entertaining, and I really empathized with Tony Shalhoub. The kills are few, but bloody. The opening 360 degree shot is to die for (no pun intended). If haunted houses are your thing you might just dig this. Directed by Steve Beck. Rated R for Some choice words, a few gory killings, lots of gory sets (watch for the bathtub scene), and a naked female ghost who pops up frequently.
