 Wesley Snipes plays his finest role yet-Neo-esque half vampire/half man Blade. Blade is a daywalker who fights the vampires and their human allies in the darkness along with his friend Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). Stephen Dorff is fantastic as Deacon Frost a evil vampire with designs on looing a vampire virus upon man kind. Blade rescues a bitten woman (N'Bushe Wright) and together they wage war against Frost. Udo Kier gives a freaky performance as Dragonetti for the short time he is in the film. Great battles the effects sometimes get cheesy, but this is a low budget masterpiece. Directed with gusto and fervor by Stephen Norrington. Rated (R) for Strong Language/Violence/Gore, and some drug content.
