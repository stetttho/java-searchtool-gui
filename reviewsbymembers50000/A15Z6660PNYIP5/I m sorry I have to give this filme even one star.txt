The bugs should've starved long ago because there is nothing on those planets but rocks.  5.) Military intellegence can't tell the difference between harmless bursts of light, and rear-end launched, ship destoying, bug laser blasts.  4.) Jets bomb the devil out of the bugs completely incenerating 1 tiny group of them, and then they send in the footsoldiers.  3.) Even though the marines are shown to blow away the nerve center of the bugs to take them down for good, they inherently blast small sections of arms, legs, etc., until the bug kills the marine, or several of his buddies.  2.) They are never going to use these planets ever, but yet instead of nuking them they decide to send marine footsoldiers against the bugs.  1.) If the greatest warrior of the future is Casper Van Dien we never would've lasted through 1 battle.
