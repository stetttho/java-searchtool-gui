 Escape from L.A. (R) ..../5  Kurt Russell, Stacey Keach, Steve Buscemi, Peter Fonda, George Corraface.  Directed by: John Carpenter. Synopsis: A famous mercenary must recover something for the president. The one catch is it is in the middle of the prison city of L.A., and in the hands of a maniacal warlord. Special Features: Trailer. Review: Snake is infected with a virus and forced to go do three things. One is try to contact the only surviving member of the first rescue team, two recover what the president's daughter stole for a deadly criminal, three is kill the president's rebellious daughter. The only catch is he has got to do it on the prison island of L.A. before the virus kills him. Roger Ebert raved about this film, but it tanked at the box office to bad too. This film is a hyperkinetic retread of the first and shows what Carpenter couldn't in the first. Originally when I saw the film I was upset the country was under an of course psychotic Christian presidents control, but then I realized the criminals world was just as bad. I figured out maybe he is saying we need to meet in the middle, or perhaps I read too much into films. As for acting Russell is once again the ultimate anti-hero in the part that forever shattered his Disney image, and a large supporting cast of zany characters all perform marvelously to make L.A. the place to be. Carpenter's direction is fantastic, and his cockeyed vision that is put on the screen is fantastic. I really loved the sub sequence, Snake suiting up, and the fantastic fight scenes. One of the greatest action films ever conceived. As for the DVD? Only the trailer blast you Paramount!
