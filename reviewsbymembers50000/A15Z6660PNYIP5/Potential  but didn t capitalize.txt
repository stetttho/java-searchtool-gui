 Ridley (Justin Whalen) and Snails (Marlon Wayans) are two hack thieves. They live in the kingdom of Izmer. When their attempted burglery of the magic school goes wrong they escape with a mage (Zoe McLellan) and a dwarf (Lee Arenberg). Then they are thrown into attempting to save the kingdom from a evil sorceror (a over-acting Jeremy Irons) and his henchman (Bruce Payne). They are aided by a elf (Kristen Wilson) and special effects hijinx ensue! Thora Birch is Queen Amidala...er Empress Savina ruler of Izmer not much of a role, or performance for that matter for her. The music drowns out dialogue, and much is lacking from this film. So why a 3 star rating? Watch the DVD deleted scenes if they included them this could've been a great film. What we are left with though is a semi-entertaining fantasy flick. Directed by Courtney Solomon. Rated (PG-13) for Fantasy Action Violence.
