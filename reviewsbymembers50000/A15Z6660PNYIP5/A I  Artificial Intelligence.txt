Review: In this hit and miss sci-fi drama a young android (Osment) is sent to a family whose son is dying. They are a little unsure at first, but grow to love him. However paradise is lost when their son miraculously gets well. Instead of sending him for destruction they leave him in the woods. He, his teddy bear, and a gigolo robot (Law) head out to find a blue fairy to make him a real boy, and to return home. This story is long, depressing, but beautiful. Osment, Law, Hurt, and everyone else act their hearts out. Fantastic performances abound, and Spielberg is on top of the directing game as usual. Overall this film is art, but it is extremely painful to watch. As for the DVD? Loaded, if you liked the film then you're set.
