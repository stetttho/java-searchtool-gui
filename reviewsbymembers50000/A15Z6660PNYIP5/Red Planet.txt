Review: A group of astronauts are sent to investigate the terraforming project on Mars, but lots of things go wrong and they crash, are stalked by a robot, and find life on Mars. This film tosses its interesting premise out the window to go for the disaster flick vibe. All in all it isn't great sci-fi, but it is entertaining. All the actors turn in great performances which elevate the film a notch. Hoffman shows a lot of stylish directing in this film. It looks good, it's fast paced, it isn't all it could be, but it is a good turn your brain off film. As for the DVD? Weak squared if you liked the film get it. If you were indifferent nothing here to tip the scales.
