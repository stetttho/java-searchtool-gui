Review: In one of the most original concepts to hit sci-fi in a long time. K (Tommy Lee Jones) plays a veteran MiB. They are men in black suits with no names, only letters, who police aliens on earth. K begins training of a new partner J (Will Smith) just in time to deal with a nasty bug alien bent on stealing a galaxy. The catch is another group of aliens will destroy earth if he gets close to succeeding. This rollicking sci-fi comedy is brilliantly thought out. It all rides on credible performances by Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. They not only succeed, but have absolutely terrific chemistry together elevating the humor. The special effects are top notch, and Sonnenfeld's comic genius of a direction job is a sight to behold. As for the DVD? You couldn't ask for more!
