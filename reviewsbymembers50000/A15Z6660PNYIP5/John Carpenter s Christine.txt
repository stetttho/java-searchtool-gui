 Christine (R) ***/5 Keith Gordon, John Stockwell, Alexandra Paul, Robert Prosky, Harry Dean Stanton.  Directed by: John Carpenter. Synopsis: A vengeful car is bought by a young nerd.  Special Features: Filmographies. Review: A car with an appetite for vengeance becomes the obsession of a young nerd, but when the car decides to go on a killing rampage for its young master his best friend and girlfriend decide to attack the car with a bulldozer. I did not find this film all too scary. The only thing that saves this film is Carpenter's handling of his material and fantastic performances by all involved, (Especially Gordon who has to change so much through the film, and the always cool Harry Dean Stanton). This film was based on a story by Stephen King. Directing-wise it seemed to be a bit off on movement shots by Carpenter (Could've been my trashy DVD player). He handles the film nicely, and he creates some excellent shots (the flaming car chase sequence). As for the DVD? Only buy if you're a Carpenter or King fan. Note to studio cast/crew bios don't cut it.
