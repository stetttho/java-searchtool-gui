 Peter Weller is Buckaroo Banzaii brain surgeon, scientist, and rock star. His gun toting body guards/band The Hong Kong Cavaliers, and himself, joined by new band member (cowboy outfit clad) Jeff Goldblum are forced to save the world from being destroyed to prevent the escape of the evil Dr. Emilio Lizardo (John Lithgow) an alien from the 8th dimension, and leader of the evil red lectoids. Lizardo is joined by sidekick John Bigboote (Christopher Lloyd). Buckaroo who traveled to the 8th dimension in his experimental interdimensional rocket car is forced to save the world while wooing the seperated at birth twin of his deceased wife Ellen Barkin. What can I say it is a B-movie, but it is pretty dang entertaining. Directed by W.D. Richter. Rated PG.
