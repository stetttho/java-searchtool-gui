Review: The mother of all summer films comes to 2 disc glory at last! Wise talking tough guy truck driver Jack Burton (Russell), his friend (Dun), and the zaniest supporting cast in history must save their girls from the grips of an evil sorcerer in the depths of Chinatown. This hilarious action/comedy is one of my all time favorites. It sports action, comedy, and a clever script. Russell is fantastic as Jack Burton, Dun is great in one of his few film roles, Cattrall is cool as the love interest, but Victor Wong steals the show as the goofy Chinese wizard bent on taking out the evil Lo Pan. Carpenter directs to perfection with his trademark style again. He gives this film energy, style, and great pacing. As for the DVD? This is the DVD we fans have been waiting for. We revel in its two disc glory. All hail 20th Century Fox! All hail 20th Century Fox! Buy this now!
