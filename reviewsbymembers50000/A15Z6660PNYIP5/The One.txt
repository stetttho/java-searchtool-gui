Review: I loved the concept of this film. Where Jet Li travels between dimensions killing other versions of himself to divide their power among the survivors. Hot on his trail are cops (Lindo and Statham). He then goes to the final dimension and does battle with an equal version of himself. This is a fun flick; it has a great premise, "Matrix" like action, but fails to capitalize many times. Li is great in his multiple roles, Lindo and Statham are great as the multiverse cops, Gugino turns in 2 good performances. Wong directs with an incredible amount of energy and style. As for the DVD? Jam packed action film fans should enjoy this as a fix before the next "Matrix" films.
