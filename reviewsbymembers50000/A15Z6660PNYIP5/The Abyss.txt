 The Abyss (PG-13) 5/5 Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Michael Biehn, Leo Burmester, Todd Graff.  Directed by James Cameron.  Synopsis: A deep sea oil rig crew is recruited to investigate a submarine crash, but something unknown resides in the abyss. Special Features: Original Theatrical and Extended Versions of the Film, Feature Length Commentary for Both Versions, Filmographies. Review: One of my all time favorite films. An oil rig crew is joined by a military team to investigate a mysteriously downed sub. As they descend into the abyss they begin to realize they may be the only humans down there, but they are not alone. Sci-fi has never been better this deep social commentary was originally cut by hack producers thus again proving they know jack about films. Know it is restored in its originally intended glory. Ed Harris is as always fantastic, Mastrantonio is great, and Biehn has fun with his bad guy role. The rest of the crew excels too. Cameron is in his staple genre and he directs to perfection. As for the DVD? Should've bought the 5-star collection. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! This is a solid disc, but really this is one film worth the extra cash.
