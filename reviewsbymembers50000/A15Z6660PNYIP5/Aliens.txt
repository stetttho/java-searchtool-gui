Special Features: Behind the Scenes Footage, Interview, Still Photo Section, Trailer. Review: This tale of a group of marines sent to investigate a disturbance at a colony is my second favorite film of all time. This is the sequel to "Alien". It takes the horrific elements of the first film, and it multiplies them infinitely once the marines discover what is going on the aliens launch a relentless onslaught that lasts the entire film, and never let's up. In the meantime we get to know and love the characters Weaver the reluctant hero, Biehn the charismatic leader of the marines, Paxton the cowardly marine, Henriksen the synthetic, Goldstein the tougher than nails marine, and a slimy Paul Reiser. Every performance is outstanding hire this casting agent. Cameron is an excellent director and this is his finest film. He injects atmosphere, lighting, and pure kinetic energy into this film. Producers cut a lot of this film, but it is now restored. Producers leave the director's films alone already. As for the DVD? This is nowhere near the "Alien" release. The film doesn't need it, but it did deserve it. Come on 20th Century Fox we want a 2 disc set!
