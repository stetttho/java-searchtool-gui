 Well I'll try to make this short and to the point. "Hometown legend" is about a small Alabama football town in need of a miracle, and surprise they get it in a big way! Now being a big fan of football I try to see every football film I can. This is one of the better ones, and it's clean and enjoyable to the whole family not just the kids to boot. As for the story it is rousing and original. The cast does a surprisingly good job for the budget. Terry O'Quinn is on the money as always, but the real standout here is Lacey Chabert who proves she should be an up and coming star. As an aspiring writer I can appreciate the narritive scope of this film. It is a refreshingly well written film in a sea of summer plot hole muck. This no doubt can be attributed to the fact it came from a novel written by Jerry B. Jenkins author of the "Left Behind Series" While I'm not a fan of that particular series, and its film version can't touch "The Omega Code" let alone it's sequel "Megiddo" I may pick up a copy of "Hometown Legend" after seeing this film. This is not quite as good as "Remember the Titans", but it thankfully takes its own original approach instead of delving into proven formula. A worthy film to add to the family section of your DVD collection.
