 Alien Resurrection (R) ****/5 Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder, Ron Perlman, Dominique Pinon, Raymond Cruz.  Directed by: Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Synopsis: Aliens are let loose aboard a military ship, and a small band of mercenaries must find their way off the ship. Special Features: Behind the Scenes Featurette, Interviews, Trailer. Review: Set in the far future a clone of Ripley is used to extract a queen alien. Surprise! The aliens get loose aboard the ship and a group of mercenaries band with Ripley to escape. This is a fun film. It has plot holes to be certain, but it drops the serious tone of the first three and just has a lot of fun. The aliens look tremendous, and this is the bloodiest of all the entries. I loved every single character even Winona Ryder. Jeunet does a fantastic job directing this. As for the DVD? Not much buy it if you like the film, or better yet just buy the box set.
