 The Fifth Element (PG-13) ****/5  Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, Ian Holm, Chris Tucker, Milla Jovovich.  Directed by: Luc Besson.  Synopsis: A "perfect being" and a taxi driver must save the galaxy from evil. Special Features: Widescreen and Fullscreen Versions of the Film. Review: A perfect being (Jovovich) crashes on Earth and must prevent evil from destroying it. She gets help from a cab driver (Willis), and a priest (Holm). Bad guy Gary Oldman proceeds to help the evil attempt to destroy the galaxy for some unknown reason. To be honest I did not understand this film really. I got the basic plot, but it's a bit goofy. Do I care? No not really this was one of the most enjoyable times I had at the movies, and I have no idea why. Willis gives a fun performance, Jovovich is terrific as Leeloo, Ian Holm gets the job done splendidly as usual, and Oldman is one of the best bad guys going. Luc Besson injects this film with energy, and a fantastic futuristic vision. As for the DVD?  Weak buy the Superbit disc instead.
