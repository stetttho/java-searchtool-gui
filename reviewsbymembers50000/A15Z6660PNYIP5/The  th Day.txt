Review: Somebody clones Arnold and he comes home to find the clone with his family, and bad guys hunting him down. He must find out who cloned him, why, and get his life back. This film is marketed as a Schwarzenegger action film, and while it is that I read a little more into it. I loved the more dramatic moments of this. Duvall and his wife subplot was great, as well as the dangers of cloning points, and Arnold's love for his family. The cloning sets and special effects were superb. I also loved the dark comedy moments of this film. Now this is how you make A Schwarzenegger flick! Arnold is great as the cloned father who wants his life back, Duvall is fantastic, Rapaport is great sidekick, Goldwyn is a decent bad guy, and Rooker is cool as the lead henchman. Roger Spottiswoode is on the money directing. He paces the film well and gets a lot from his actors. As for the DVD? Good times here it contains plenty of special features. Sure there's a special edition out, but this is one film where no special edition is needed. This edition stands on its own.
