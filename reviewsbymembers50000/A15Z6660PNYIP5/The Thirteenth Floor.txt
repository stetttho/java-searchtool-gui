Review: When a rich professor and head of a virtual reality game project is murdered his business partner (Bierko) begins an investigation. The police keep interfering, and the partner believes the answer to lie in the game itself, but when he comes out of the game he begins to discover a threat to his own reality. "The Thirteenth Floor" is top notch stuff. Bierko, Mol, D'Onofrio and everybody else is stellar even though most have two parts to play, and yes they each deliver two strong performances. Now that is acting. Most people disliked the ending, but hang me I liked it. The presentation of the game is fantastic as well as all aspects of Rusnak's directing. As for the DVD? There is plenty to get excited about. A fine complement to a fine film.
