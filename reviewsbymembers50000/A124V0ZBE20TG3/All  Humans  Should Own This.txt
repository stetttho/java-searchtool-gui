 I have never really been a big fan of David Byrne, or Talking Heads for that matter, but a while back I saw an appearance of Byrne performing "Like Humans Do" on David Letterman and was very intrigued. I decided to buy it because I wanted something different in my collection. It definitely is different. Each song on this album displays a different sound. The album's opener "UB Jesus" pulls you into 'Eyeball' with odd lyrics and fantastic use of backing vocals. "Like Humans Do", the song that originally reeled me in, is amazing on this album. It is very colorful and melodic - as are a lot of songs on this album, including (especially) "Desconocido Soy", a Spanish-sung tune that allows you to enjoy the song even if you don't know what is being said! "The Accident" is a dark, eerie song with an amazing vocal hook. This album is overall incredible. If you want something new, different, and fun - get this!
