 This review is coming from after about two months of owning this album - a more than reasonable amount of time to make a true judgement. Two months after Before These Crowded Streets was released, I made up my mind that it was an awesome album, and was listneing to it everyday. Can't make a nice, little pun for this album - let me just say that Everyday is far, far under par for the Dave Matthews Band. There are songs on this album that I could see on their previous works ("If I Had It All", "Everyday"), but as a whole, this album...stinks. It truly is a great rock album, but a mediocre DMB album. I also think Glen Ballard is really good at what he does, but he just shouldn't do it for Dave Matthews Band. Speaking of doing it, "I Did It" doesn't! Neither does "Dreams of Our Fathers", "What You Are" and "Angel". Who is this band? I'll admit - I like these songs, but knowing it's coming from DMB, the same people that brought us "Two Step", "#41", "The Stone", "Crush", etc., makes me...not like them. Now we all know that it would be hard for DMB to make another Under the Table and Dreaming or Before These Crowded Streets, so with that thinking - let's HOPE they never make another Everyday.
