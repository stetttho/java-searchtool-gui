 After a long wait since their last studio release (2002's 'Burger After Church'), The Waybacks come back and prove that even with an ever-changing lineup, they still can have a remarkably consistant sound... while leaving room for growth. This album was recorded in between the time they had a revolving door of guest fiddlers and finally the permanant addition of the amazingly talented Warren Hood, whose absence on this album is a disappointment. For lack of, at the time, a fiddler they could call their own, they received help from some of the best: Gabe Witcher, Evan Price and Darol Anger. Lloyd Maines' masterful production gives the listener the feeling that what's on the album can be reproduced in a live setting without missing a step. While further experimenting with bluegrass, they have ventured into the realms of jazz, swing and even straight-up rock (this showcased on the surprisingly universally accessible "Helping Me"). The album's title track is one of the most well-written instrumental pieces I've heard in a long time (my only complaint about this album is that this song did not open the album). "Monkey Pants" has already been a crowd favorite at the Wabes' live shows and the stuio rendition does the song justice. With "Hot Kranski" and "Ninety-One", James Nash proves to be both a well-educated instrumentalist and arranger and a skillful, reflective songwriter. Stevie Coyle does not disappoint with the cleverly lyricized "The Petrified Man". The Waybacks will someday be a huge concert draw (even more than they already are), winning over fans with their interesting take on bluegrass and folk music, and this album just may do it.
