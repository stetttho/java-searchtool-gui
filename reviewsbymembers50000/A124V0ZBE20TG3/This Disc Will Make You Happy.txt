 The Bills are such a great group of musicians. I recently saw them at a folk and bluegrass festival (The Bills fell under the folk category) and they were great. I wasn't familiar with them before their performance, but I wanted to be afterwards. I bought this after the show and it is a great representation of their live sound. From the rollicking "Hello" to the solemn "Which Way Away" to the very catchy title track, this album is diverse without losing focus. This disc simply makes me happy, and I hope it does the same for you. Check this out and check out their previous album 'All Day Every Day', under their former name The Bill Hilly Band. "The Bills" was kind of their nickname, until they officially changed it to simply "The Bills". A good change, in my opinion.
