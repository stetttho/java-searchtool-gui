 This is an excellent album for all music fans. There are so many music styles the "slamgrass" band Leftover Salmon covers on this album. Rock, bluegrass, country, and even the latin flavored first track  "Carnival Time". Songs like "Reuben's Train",  "Come On Home", and "Rocky Road Blues" make you want to  get up and dance. Their cover of Led Zeppelin's "When the Levee  Breaks" is a totally different twist to the original tune. Highlights  on this album include the laid back "Bend In the River", the  upbeat "Jokester", and the catchy "Stay Away Monday".  If you're a fan of good and fun music, pick up this album.
