 Bela Fleck & the Flecktones are one of the greatest live bands ever, but throw in 5 more of the most unique and sometimes unusual musicians in the world, you have an amazing show...and in this case, a DVD. Live at the Quick offers a colorful look inside the world of the Flecktones. While some crowd shots are a bit unnecessary (and obviously not in sync with the stage's activity), Quick still provides an amazing musical and visual experience. The DVD also has some interesting band member interviews and a look into the history of this magnificent band.
