 Matthew Good Band is one of the last true, good rock bands out there today. We're talking memorable guitar riffs and solos and songs with real themes. The popular music scene does not offer any real rock acts. Which makes sense why Matthew Good Band is NOT currently in the popular music scene. All 14 tracks of the band's Beautiful Midnight serve up heartfelt, mini-rock masterpieces. Midnight will be one of those albums to go down is history as one of those unheard essentials. Although I prefer to listen to this album as a whole, every time, there are certain songs I must go straight to. "Failing The Rorschach Test" is one of those songs, with a more than addicting riff. If you are longing for a straigh-forward rock band, or just an album, get this now!
