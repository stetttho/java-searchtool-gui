 David Byrne's albums always seemed to go by unnoticed, and with Uh-Oh, this is truly a crime. This album is so diverse and colorful and it really deserves some recognition. With the help of a lot of different musicians and instruments, this is a very bright and happy album. The comical opener, "Now I'm Your Mom" starts out a bit off-beat (musically and in subject matter), but includes a wondefully rhythmic chorus. Other highlights include "Girls On My Mind", in which Byrne's vocal delivery is extremely reminiscent of the latter days of Talking Heads, which is cool to hear. "Hanging Upside Down" has features enjoyable and fun lyrics with a driving guitar throughout. "The Cowboy Mambo (Hey Lookit Me Now)" is a very jumpy tune which truly captures the essence of 'Uh-Oh'. The album's closer, "Somebody", is also probably its best track with a very epic and large feeling which ends this album perfectly. Get this album now!
