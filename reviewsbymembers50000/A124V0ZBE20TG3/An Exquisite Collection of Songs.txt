 What Travis did with The Invisible Band was very brilliant. They took the sound and attitude from The Man Who in which we all fell in love with, and combined that with newer, fresher material that would satisfy and surprise any 'The Man Who' fan. The album opens with the first single "Sing" which is a magnificant song that mixes up Travis' mellow sound with a twangy banjo. "Side" is one of my personal favorites on the album. Songs like "Follow the Light" and the bonus track "You Don't Know What I'm Like" display how "colorful" Travis can be. There is some excellent work done on this album. Don't let this album be invisible in your collection...BUY IT!
