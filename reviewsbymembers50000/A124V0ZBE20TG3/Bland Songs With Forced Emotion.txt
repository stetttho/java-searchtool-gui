 Critics seem to automatically give a band or artist a very good review simply because of the band and not necesarrily because of the music they make. U2 is one of those bands. Critics have hailed this as an excellent album. How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is nothing of the sort. The songs, while well-written, lack a lot of the natural emotion heard and felt in classic U2 songs. The lyrics are all different, but Bono seems to be saying the same thing on all eleven tracks. He seems to have traded in his soaring powerful vocal delivery heard in more recent songs like Walk On and If God Will Send His Angels for a more tender, almost whiny vocal delivery. Highlights of the album include City of Blinding Lights, All Because of You, and Vertigo. As a whole, I think this album will be forgotten.
