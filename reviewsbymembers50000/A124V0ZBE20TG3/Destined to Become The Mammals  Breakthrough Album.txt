 The title says it all - this is certainly a departure for The Mammals. Their two previous studio albums, Evolver and Rock That Babe were both very typical of the newgrass genre. Typical, but still incredible in their own right; boisterous, fun and traditional. While Departure has its moments of their previous rollicking nature, it is by far more focused on the rock side of their overall sound. The first clue to this is the lack of any traditional covers, rather, a cover of the Nirvana hit "Come As You Are" (done incredibly, by the way). The tone of this album is a bit more solemn than previous albums, but they have not lost their freewheeling spirit or folky edginess. They've just matured... a whole lot.
