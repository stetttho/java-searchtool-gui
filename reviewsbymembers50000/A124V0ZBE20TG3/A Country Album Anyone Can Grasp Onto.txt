 I've never been one to shun country music anyway, but this is one country album that can appeal to almost anyone. With Loretta Lynn's sweet and charming vocals mixed with Jack White's edgy production, the result is what country music should be: gritty and touching. Up until the release of Van Lear Rose, Ms. Lynn was basically a has-been, but just like Rick Rubin's masterful productions of Johnny Cash's American Recordings, Jack White has rejuvenated Loretta Lynn's sound and career. The production has not taken away from Loretta's unique sound, rather, it has updated her sound to please her longtime fans and to appeal to newer listeners. Jack White has been unofficially producing albums since he was thirteen, so he is no stranger to getting music onto an album. He's not just a hip, young trophy for Loretta to hold on to. He is a masterful producer who has enhanced Loretta's style. This is absolutely the best album of 2004.
