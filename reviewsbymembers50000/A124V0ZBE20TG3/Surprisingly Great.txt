 Purchasing True Stories was my next step in my David Byrne/Talking Heads fanaticism. I bought it for ... and after viewing it, I would've had no problem paying more. You don't have to be a Talking Heads fan to enjoy the movie ..., but you may become one after watching the film. The idea of inserting songs from the Talking Heads' album of the same name as this movie into different parts of the film, and having the actors sing them was a great idea. The "Wild Wild Life" scene is simply classic. John Goodman portrays the very likeable Louis Fyne - a person who is looking for a wife and from the start you're wanting Louis to get what he wants out of life. This movie about small town life in Texas is definitely worth viewing. True Stories is truly a hidden treasure.
