 First off, it astounds me that this album is not considered to be an "essential recording" by Amazon.com. Anyone that has a CD collection (and that has a decent taste in music) should own this album. It is a masterpiece - a mantra that may seem over-used - but Girlfriend is amazing! From pure pop classics ("Divine Intervention"), to straight-ahead rock tunes ("Does She Talk?"), and even a country-tinged track ("Winona"), Girlfriend pleases everyone. One listen and you are hooked!
