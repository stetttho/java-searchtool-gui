 Whether or not you like the work of Basquiat (or art in general, for that matter) this is a very enjoyable film. This true story of a street bum turned hot NYC artist is both heartfelt and raw. And what a cast! Jeffrey Wright, Benicio Del Toro, Dennis Hopper, David Bowie, Parker Posey, plus cameos by Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe, Tatum O'Neal, Courtney Love, and many others make up this very talented and diverse group of actors. Let it be known that the people who are in this movie made very little money, therfore, they WANTED to be in this movie. They were passionate about the story and the life of Basquiat, and it shows through their performances. Jeffrey Wright is absolutely unforgettable as Jean-Michel Basquiat and David Bowie as Andy Warhol is hysterical and amazing. The film captures the essence of Basquiat - as an artist, as a person. The film has the main character tackling issues dealing with racism, relationships, success, failure, optimism, and loss. This is one DVD that will not collect dust in your collection.
