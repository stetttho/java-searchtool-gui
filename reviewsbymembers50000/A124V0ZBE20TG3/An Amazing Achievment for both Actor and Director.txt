 This film is simply stunning, and I want to emphasize the word simply. There is not a movie in recent memory that I have seen that has packed such a dramatic punch without being as simple as Ghost World. No pretensiously complicated storyline, just an excellent film. The amazingly beautiful and talented Thora Birch gives her best performance as Enid in this movie. Yes, I loved her in this movie even more than in American Beauty. Steve Buscemi also puts on his best performance as the reclusive, yet likeable Seymour. This movie really makes you care about the people you are seeing on the screen. Terry Zwigoff really captured true suburban life for many characters - an eccentric art teacher, a troubled father, a class full of mundane art students, a phony high school friend, a waiter nicknamed "Weird Al" - all people of which you wish you could know more of in this movie. Going back to the simplicity of this film, Ghost World tells you a whole lot without showing you everything. A tip: watch it with a friend, you might feel lonely after the movie if you're by yourself.
