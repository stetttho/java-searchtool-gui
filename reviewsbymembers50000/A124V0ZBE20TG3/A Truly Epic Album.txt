 I decided to give a review and show respect for such an amazing trio - especially after recently hearing of their break up. Ben Folds Five was one of the most innovative bands in modern music. The Unauthorized Biography Of Reinhold Messner starts out as a thrilling, epic album with the breath-taking "Narcolepsy". And it only gets better from there. The thrashing drums, rhythmic bass and of course, the awesome paino all shine through on this album. The mood for this album is very mellow with a peak of hardness at tracks 6 and 7 ("Army" and "Your Redneck Past"). The album closes with less than a bang with "Lullaby", me personal favorite on the album. Get this album!
