 This it truly a stunner of a album. Each song has its own personality and its own thing to say. David Byrne has always tackled every type of music imaginable, and he goes one step further on this album - opera. With Bizet's "Au Fond Du Temple Saint" (featuring an amazing vocal performance by Rufus Wainwright) and Verdi's "Un de Felice, Eterea", David personalizes these operatic offerings to display his unique voice and emotion. David has always had an interesting style of writing, and this is truly prevalent in songs like "Glass, Concrete, Stone", "Tiny Apocalypse", and "Civilization". While this album seems more mature than Byrne's previous albums, his playfulness and funkyness is still very much heard on "Dialog Box" and "Pirates". David talks about many different topics on this album, including politics. "Empire" is, as Byrne himself described, a song written to be an anthem for Republicans. This very sarcastic song has a surprisingly charming sound. Other highlights of this album, in terms of both sound and writing, include "She Only Sleeps" and "The Other Side Of This Life". This is an amazing album as a whole, but the individual tracks speak a lot as well
