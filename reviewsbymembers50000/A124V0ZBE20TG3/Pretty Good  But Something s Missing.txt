 Old 97s' edginess is missing on their latest album. Their mixture of punk and alt-country is heard on only half of the songs on this album. The rest, while not bad, seems like continuation of the tone and themes of Rhett Millers solo album, The Instigator. Drag It Up is a worthy follow-up to Satellite Rides, it's just nothing amazing or ground-breaking. If you're a longtime fan, you will of course want this. If this would be your first Old 97's purchase, I'd recommend instead Too Far To Care or Satellite Rides.
