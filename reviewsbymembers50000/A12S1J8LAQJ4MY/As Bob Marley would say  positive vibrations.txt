 I am relatively new to Acoustic Alchemy--this is my 4th purchase. However, I must say that rarely have I enjoyed an album more. From the first listen, I find the selections, rich, robust and soothing. I particularly love the title track which moves me in a way I have not been moved by this genre--except, perhaps, by Pat Metheney. It is much harder to critique music than literature, since there is much more subjectivity involved. However, if you like Alchemy's previous work, you're sure to find something to love on 'Positive Thinking'!
