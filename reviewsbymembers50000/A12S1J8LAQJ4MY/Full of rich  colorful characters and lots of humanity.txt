 This was my first experience with Roslyn Carrington, but it won't be my last! "Every Bitter Thing"  is a wonderful story full of color, emotion and richness. I was very impressed with Carrington's grasp of the human condition and her ability to convey such through her main characters.  Her wisdom is that of one much older than herself.  The hero and heroine are very believable and Carrington does a good job of connecting the past and the present. I particularly like that each character's traits and personality are defined in relation to their pasts and as a result of their upbringings. There is much insight in this work. Her writing style evokes not only emotion, but allows the reader to feel, hear and almost smell the surroundings. Having spent much time in the Carribean myself, reading her descriptions (particularly) of the seedier side of a downtown Caribbean port city, brought back many memories. It's been a long time since I read a novel that kept me as captivated. I actually found myself 'making time' to read this one. I like that feeling! I will now go back and read her previous work but certainly hope that Roslyn Carrington is an author that we are going to be hearing from for a very long time!
