 Not since Andrew Hacker has a white author been as conversant and  intuitive about both sides of the race issue in America.  Jim Meyers  presents both black and white 'world views' thoroughly and fairly and  without rose colored glasses--a feat not often accomplished by privileged  whites.  In my experience, black authors write from a more reality-based  position than do whites, but Meyers obviously walks the walk. Meyers  guides the reader through a variety of situations in which we all find  ourselves.  Of particular interest to me was his discussion of how a person  of color might feel upon meeting a white stranger and vice-versa.  How  might each person be feeling, what might they be thinking, how are they  conditioned to respond, which self-preservation behaviors kick in?  Useful  information for those of us who try, as best we can, to encourage cross  racial and cross cultural friendships and understanding. Icon charts  incorporated throughout this book provide powerful, at-a-glance imagery of  the ratios of blacks to whites in America and help illustrate why some  blacks may be hesitant to speak their minds in certain social settings.   Since much race-related literature speak in abstract terms, Mr. Meyers use  of math and numbers is also a powerful learning tool.  Like the author, I  am also a white person previously married to a black spouse who surrounds  myself with friends of all ethnicities.  I believe race relations is the  single most important issue facing America today.  I give Jim Meyers credit  for presenting this topic in a fresh, conversational way that is easy to  read and very enlightening.   I recommend this book to people of all  races who want answers to questions that many may find too difficult to ask  in the real world.
