 It's about time someone wrote forcefully about the very unpopular reality of what religion has done through time-- and continues to do-- in justifying evil and retarding our development as a species.   Harris tackles some very complex theories about beliefs, reason and faith, in a way that even the average reader can grasp. While his comments are harsh when necessary -and will probably offend the faithful-his thesis is not without merit.   Since humans are resistant to having their core beliefs challenged (even successfully) this may be a hard read for some. But it is a necessary read if we are to have any hope of preserving our species. If we keep heading down the path we're on, our destruction is a near certainty.  This is not to say that this book is thoroughly depressing. Rather, Harris offers some paradigm shifts which must occur if there is to be any hope of finding humans on earth at the dawn of the next millennia.   I challenge any believer to take on the incontrovertible facts Harris puts forth, and to `argue' them with sound reasoning, not blind faith in unprovable concepts. This would be impossible.   I was most surprised that a book on this subject turned out to be a real page-turner I could not put down. For anyone with an open mind, I highly recommend it.
