 Not only is this book fact-based and well written, but on many occasions I found myself laughing so hard I started to cry. Right wing, left wing, Democrat, Republican, Green or Independent, it doesn't matter....read this book. If for no other reason than the comic relief. I was especially pleased that Mr. Franken rode Bill O'Reilly to the bitter end. For his pomposity alone (never mind his behavior on C-SPAN), O'Reilly deserves every barb Franken tossed his way. The fact that Al despises Ann Coulter does nothing but endear him to me further.  Franken's fresh style, brutal honesty and whitty outlook on life make for a quick read that left me wanting more. Rush Limbaugh fans may not like it, but open-minded, free-thinking patriots who value honesty will relish this lampoon of the new century's UNfair and UNbalanced news media. Mr. Franken, bring on the sequel !!!
