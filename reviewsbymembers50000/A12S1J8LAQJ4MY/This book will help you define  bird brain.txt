 As a parrot owner, I was touched by Joanna Burger's depth of feeling for her beloved Tiko. This story is an enjoyable read for anyone, but particularly  so to those of us who have been blessed to have known the love of a parrot.  I appreciated some of the more scientific and behavioral information and the fact that the author only added it where necessar,as punctuation to the story. Burger raises a highly disputed theory--that of animal 'emotions', which anyone who has ever shared their life with an animal has witnessed first hand. As an animal lover and a scientist, she bears witness to the irrefutable fact that Tiko felt empathy, concern, sympathy, caring, and love--attributes some believe to be exclusively human. I would recommend this book to anyone thinking of becoming a parrot partner, (some might say owner, but you'll see!) It gives great insight into the tremendous responsibility of taking a parrot into your home, and tells it like it is--warts and all. One last observation of mine, for those who may doubt a parrot's mental acuity. If WE are supposed to be so far superior intellectually, how come THEY have to learn OUR language?
