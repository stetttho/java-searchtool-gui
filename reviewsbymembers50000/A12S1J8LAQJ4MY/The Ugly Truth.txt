 This book is an essential read. And while many may pooh-pooh Moore's take on the state of the nation...for the most part he's right on. I admire his courage in speaking out about things that really matter. It makes me proud to read a book such as this-- knowing that in no other country on earth could a book which is critical of many of our national practices  and policies not only be published, but flourish for many weeks on the best seller list.  For those who doubt Moore's assertions that our government is bought and paid for, that African Americans are no better off today than they were 100 years ago (and that most whites are clueless to this fact,) or that Bush II stole the white house, pay careful attention to the proof he offers. While I wish he would have provided substantiation for all his claims, anyone familiar with Moore's integrity knows that he does his homework. Anyone reading this book with even a slightly open mind will get angry enough (hopefully) to become an involved citizen. If Moore accomplishes nothing more than this, this book will has been a tremendous success. Thanks again Michael for telling it like it (sadly) is.
