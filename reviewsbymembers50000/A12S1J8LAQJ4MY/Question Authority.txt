 The fact that so many reviewers are being accused of bashing this book just because Michael Moore is a muckracker makes it all that more attractive to me. Anyone who has followed Moore's carrer knows that he's about as politically incorrect as it gets. This book is no exception. However, for those of us who question authority, we need a mouthpiece like Moore to go where no man has gone before, to ask the hard questions and to press for answers.  Some may not appreciate where Moore's sarcasm ends and the truth begins...that's a function of being familiar with his style. However, no one with an open mind can deny that he makes a lot of sense!!!  Moore calls it like he sees it using his signature, in-your-face style of  challenging those with whom he disagrees. I like that. His critics claim he's an uncooth loose cannon but check his facts (and there are volumes of footnotes at the end of this book, substantiating his claims) and it's not hard to see that his detractors are frustrated by the fact that Moore has chutzpa. He asks the questions that no one right of center wants to answer!!!  For that  reason alone, I recommend this book.  Moore's as much of a patriot as I've seen. He knows the system is broken and he is again making suggestions to begin fixing it. Isn't that what this country is supposed to be all about--citizens engaged in change???? As with all of Moore's work, be prepared to think, to question and to take action when you're through. If you don't, you've missed the point.
