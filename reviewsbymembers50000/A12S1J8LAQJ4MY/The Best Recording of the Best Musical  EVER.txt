 From first seeing Les Mis on stage in New York many years ago, and having subsequently seen the Philadelphia and San Diego stage productions as well, this original Broadway recording has spolied me for any other. Boublil and Schonberg created a masterpiece which frequently has me trying to decide which I love more, the lyrics or the music. I cannot help but compare all newcomers to the original Broadway cast who, in my humble opinion, gave the richest performance ever. There's been no Valjean, Fontine, Javert or Eponine like them since!   I wore out my first set of CDs and recently purchase a second. Yet, through thousands of listenings over a decade, certain portions still move me so that I weep as if hearing them for the first time. I cannot imagine a better rendition than that of the orchestra on this recording nor the powerful, polished voices enunciating the lyrics as has no cast that has followed. There are not enough superlatives in the English language to describe how much I love this recording.   Needless to say, I more than very highly recommend it!
