 Hugh Pearson wrote a painfully honest discussion of that which he uncovered as he took a personal journey to learn how his great-uncle, Dr. Joseph Griffin, 'a wealthy negro surgeon, wielded power in the Jim Crow south.'  I both enjoyed and was disturbed by this excellent look back at a grim era in our collective past. Mr. Pearson shares with his readers the pride as well as the conflict he felt upon learning the extremes to which Dr. Griffin chose to resort to fulfill his dreams and aspirations. Mr. Pearson's style of writing is refreshingly straightforward and in-your-face honest.  I was particularly impressed with his impressions of the connection between the Jewish community and the Black community (long an interest of mine,) which haunted him throughout his journey.  In a convoluted way, the story was inspiring.  Dr. Griffin went to many lengths and used any means possible to attain wealth, and subsequently power, in an age when power was unattainable to southern Blacks. As the real means of attaining power (education, real estate ownership, political involvement and money) are still out of the reach of many black Americans today, we must ask ourselves how--if at all--have things changed since the days of Dr. Griffin?   I strongly recommend this book to any student of history who would appreciate an accounting of the Jim Crow era, from its last remaining survivors.
