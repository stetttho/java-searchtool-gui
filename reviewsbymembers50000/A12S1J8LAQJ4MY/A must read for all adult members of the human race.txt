 Those of us familiar with Farrell's work will agree--this was worth the wait! Those new to Farrell will wonder why they've never read him before!  This book helps us clearly see how our gender opinions were formed and how  inaccurate and contradictory they can be.   Great suggestions for improved  communication between the sexes in modern times.  Dr. Farrell again  uncovers little-known statistics that media and government don't  necessarily want us to know which will proove surprising. He then offers us  ways to interpret these statistics which have made me much more aware of  how insensitive today's popular culture is toward men.  Much of the  'male-bashing' humor in the mainstream would be completely unacceptable if  directed at other minorities.   This book (as all of Dr. Farrell's books)  has given me an insight which, as a woman, I would never have been able to  have otherwise.  Reading it  will make men feel better and women better  partners. Men, if you read only one 'self help' book this year, make it  this one.  Then, share it with your signifcant other and watch your  relationship improve. Bravo Dr. Farrell.  You've done it again.
