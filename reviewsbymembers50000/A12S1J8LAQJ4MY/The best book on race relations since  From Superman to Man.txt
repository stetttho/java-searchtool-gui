 Dr. Tatum explains beautifully many previously undiscussed aspects of race relations in America. But she also goes beyond  what IS to explain WHY it is.  Her explaination of how each of us develop our own sense of racial and  ethnic 'self' provides great food for thought. Tatum's background, area of  expertise, experience and sensitivity combine to make her the perfect   author of such a work.  She gave me insight into my own long-held feelings  of guilt about being a benificiary of white priviledge.  Particularly  poignant were stories of how she discussed racial issues with her own  children as they were growing.  Every chapter so intrigued me that I would  like to read an entire book dedicated to each of the topics.   In a  perfect world, this book would be required reading for all Americans and  should be assigned to every high school student in this country.  I don't  remember the last time I was as moved by a book and I can't wait for her  next one!  Thank you, thank you, thank you Dr. Tatum!   Each of us who is  ready to take a look inside ourselves and be completely honest about our  own biases needs to read this book!  It will make us better Americans,  better humans and better friends.
