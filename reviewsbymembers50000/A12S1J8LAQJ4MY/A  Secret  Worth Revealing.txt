 Neil Henry took this journey for himself and his family.  That he chose to share it through 'Pearl's Secret' is a gift to us all. This work is an excellent addition to the body of literature about race relations in America.  This book chronicles Henry's often exasperating research into the history of his white ancestors and their descendents. Through years of diligent, tedious searching, Henry managed to find his present-day white kin and visited with them in the hope of having his burning questions answered and sharing collective lore and memories.  His writing style and candor in describing his curiosity, anger and dissapointments made for more engaging reading than I had anticiapted from a book which I had mistakenly believed was only about genealogy.   The conculsion that Henry's 20th century black family raised in Seattle was far better off than his distant white relations living in the south is a testament to the home enviornment in which he was raised by loving parents who truly understood the importance of instilling pride, self worth and confidence in their children--no matter the odds stacked against them.   Overall, I found the book to be uplifting and positive. I would recommend it highly.
