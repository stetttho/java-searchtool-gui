 This is an amazing, mind-changing video.  I spent awhile opposed to "classic" forms of exercise, and then this came along.  It appeals to the deepest parts of you, that want to SCREAM! and throw yourself at the mercy of your own adrenalin.  It really, honestly doesn't feel like exercise.  Although it did take me forever to finally make it through the whole tape without stopping to catch my breath and recover from muscle failure! I would recommend completing the instructional and basic tapes first, to get the idea of what kinds of moves Billy Blanks will be using.  He uses almost all the same moves from these two tapes, but at a much quicker pace and in longer reps. If you are a martial arts student, you may either enjoy this and the other Tae Bo tapes immensely, or you may totally dislike it!  I myself am a martial arts student, and while the technique he displays is not the one I am taught to use, I just remind myself that this video is for exercise, not instruction in self-defense.  I even tweak it somewhat to retain my own muscle memory, when possible. I appreciate the use of so many different kinds of people in the background...men, women, tall and skinny, short and muscular.  But each person's physique is inspiring--you just say to yourself, "I want that!"  And away you go! I highly recommend this tape for advanced exercisers, or beginners who are willing to take it a step at a time until they can finish the whole tape.  It will really make you scream out loud, and you'll feel GREAT for it!
