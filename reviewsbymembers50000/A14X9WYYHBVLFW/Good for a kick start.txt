 I wasn't really sure what I was getting into when I purchased this video, but I knew that I enjoyed many of the other FIRM workouts and figured this one would be no different!  I have to say, it definitely lived up to its reputation. This video is split into two sections--one which focuses on the lower body, and one which focuses on the upper body.  Each one is approximately 20-30 minutes long.  You can either do each half on alternating days, or do the full workout.  I like the versatility this offers. You'll need several pieces of equipment for this video....a box to step up on, ankle weights (if you desire them), and a barbell, although I substitute putting weights on my shoulders, which works just as well. I'm really impressed with the lower body segment, and use it often.  True to the packaging, it's not so much of a toning workout as a cardio one.  It REALLY gets your heartrate up there!  I am not really sold on the upper body portion, although if you're aiming to do the whole workout at once, it's nice to have ab work early on in the upper body portion to rest a bit from the cardio work.  If you're just looking to do the upper half, though, it's kind of annoying. Overall, however, I would recommend this video to anyone for a substantial cardio workout that also helps you to tone major muscle groups.  It's a must for any FIRM exerciser's collection!
