 I have been studying and practicing the Pilates method now for over six months.  I've really enjoyed the instruction I've received from other videos, but wanted something to aspire to--and this is it.   In reading some of the other reviews, yes, this DVD does have a fast pace; however, the goal of the Pilates method is for the entire matwork routine to be performed smoothly and with a great sense of flow and rhythm--not as a collection of separate, start-and-stop exercises. I appreciate that the atmosphere of the workout is not hyped-up, with pounding dance-mix music or a super-perky instructor.  The emphasis is only on what's at hand--the workout.  I also enjoy the voiced-over instruction as opposed to receiving it from the person who is also demonstrating the movements.  The speaker addresses you as though he were in the room with you, checking your form.  In this way, it feels very personalized to me. If you are an absolute beginner, I would suggest that you watch the various levels of the matwork first.  Watch it a couple of times, even, maybe trying a couple of the exercises as practice on your own.  Once you have the general idea of what the different movements are, then proceed to work with the DVD on your pace and fluidity. If you already have a foundation in the principles of this exercise method, then this is the DVD to buy to further your ability.  It's not watered down, slowed down, or commercialized; it's just Pilates the way Joseph Pilates created it.  I myself can't wait to continue working with this DVD to improve my technique and my strength--it's really given me something to shoot for.
