 I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend whose opinions and attitudes I have long respected.  She had cited for me a few paragraphs and I thought it would be something I would enjoy, if not agree with totally--at least it would be stimulating food for thought. I was very surprised to open to book and find Dr. Pittman's advice to be really lacking basis.  There were many times when I couldn't actually decipher what his point was exactly, or what he suggest we do to go about remedying our lives and our world. I agree that we are living in a world that is rapidly being taken over by consumerism, thoughtlessness, and pretense.  I agree that many of the attitudes being celebrated are, at their cores, immature.  I also agree that all of this is learned, and is thus a choice that we can make, or not make.  We are in charge of our lives, and it is our job to own up to that responsibility--if we don't, we live in a world where other people and powers-that-be control us, and that doesn't feel good no matter how we might try to convince ourselves otherwise. But I don't think this is worth writing a nearly 300-page book about, or worth the reader's money to buy it.  It seems to me that these conclusions are rather obvious, if you just keep your eyes and ears open--and I would hope that anyone who is interested in this book has already taken that step, and realizes that something's amiss.  I have yet to see what exactly is entailed by "growing up," in Dr. Pittman's opinion.  How exactly does one do that?  Chances are, the people who are most in need of this statement have not learned this skill, or else they wouldn't need the book.  Grow up....how?....by growing up! All in all, I was disappointed.  The content is not what I thought it would be, and in the midst of that I'm afraid his "witty" writing style was lost on me.  I wish I would have perused this in a bookstore before spending the money.
