 This video gives me a feeling I don't get from any other workout video--it really works your core leg muscles, leaving you feeling sore in ways you never knew possible!  But what you get is a fantastic toning workout.  I used this video a lot before I recently began marathon training, and I am so glad I got my legs in better shape before I started running!  It's also helped me in all my other fitness endeavors, like yoga and tae bo.  What I really recommend is that you buy this video as a part of the FIRM Parts 4-Pack--then you get your upper and lower body and abs workouts all in one set--they complement each other perfectly!
