 Although all the Harry Potter books are fabulous, I have to say this one is my favorite.  To me, what's interesting in the Harry Potter story is the human side, rather than the wizard side.....his life, the things he's endured--and the chain of events that has made his life the way it is.  This book really brings home a lot of those issues, and a lot of insight into the "past" of the series' story--it's a must-read and I guarantee you won't be able to put it down!
