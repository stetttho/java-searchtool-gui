 I recently purchased this 4-pack and have found it's a great way to "spice up" my workout week.  Both the Upper Body and Standing Legs tapes are quite the workout (and they cram in a lot of punch for only 35-45 min.), and I will do maybe 20 min. of plain (without weights) cardio to warm up beforehand.  I have a tendency to get bored if my routine is too unvaried, so these provide a great way to change it up and keep my attention.  Plus, you can just pay attention to your body's desires and say, "hm, today my arms really feel like working.  Let's do Upper Body!" Tough Tape 2 is just that--really tough!  It's a good alternative to one of the Total Body videos, if you feel like doing more weights and less cardio (although you do get your cardio simply from hefting those weights around the whole time).  The transitions between segments can be somewhat sloppy, but once you do the tape a few times you know what's coming next and can prepare for it.   5-Day Abs is a great addition to any collection....the short workouts are intense.  I used to just fast-forward my Total Body video to the abs section and do it alone, but this has done it for me, and gives me the abs sections for tapes I don't own, too. Bear in mind that this collection requires a step or box in all the videos (although in 5-Day Abs, it's just for putting your feet on as you lay on the floor).  If you don't care to buy one from The Firm company, you can find suitable ones at the store ... in the housewares department.  They're sturdy, have little rubber feet to keep from slipping, and are about the right height.  Standing Legs also allows you to use a barbell, if you have one, but if you don't, that's fine (that particular section is hard enough even without any weight!).  You could probably also substitute just putting weights on your shoulders, as you do earlier in the video. If you crave variety in your workout week, this package is a great choice!
