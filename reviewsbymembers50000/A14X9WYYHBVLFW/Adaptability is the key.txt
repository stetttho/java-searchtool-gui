 I recently ordered this video based on the rave reviews it's gotten; plus, I am familiar with the FIRM serious and Tracie Long.  I did enjoy the workout; however, advanced students should know that you really need to use heavy weights to get the workout you're after.  I was expecting it to be much harder, so I went with lighter weights, and it was over before I knew it had begun!  The reps are really quite short, so you'll want to pile on the weights in order to really feel it.  Once you do that, though, it's a great tape and I'm sure I'll be reaching for it often when I am looking for a specifically weight-training video.
