 I use this video for my "off days" of more intense exercise, or when I have had a stressful day and want to calm down.  This particular video is great in that it both soothes you and energizes you at the same time!  Although I am fairly flexible to begin with, I find that this video helps me to improve on that, and I am impressed by Suzanne Deason's attention to all levels of yoga practicioners by providing 3 other modifications to her routine so everyone can follow along (provided they have the yoga props, which you can easily purchase).  For people who fear that yoga involves far more contortion than they can muster, you will be relieved to find that none of the poses in the routine are at all complicated, and Suzanne throws in reminders/suggestions every step of the way to make sure you're doing them correctly. Clearly, you won't see a dramatic loss of weight after your first couple times using this tape.  However, you will get a renewed sense of satisfaction in taking time for yourself, and I believe that weight loss and fitness in general is not just about huffing and puffing, but also involves your emotional state.  "Look good, feel good" should be reversed to "Feel good, look good"! What this tape WILL do for you, and you will feel it right away, is begin to tone your major muscle groups simply by holding the positions.  My legs always feel noodly, like I just did an intense workout, after doing this routine!  It's kind of bizarre to feel yourself almost breaking a sweat and not moving at all.  This tape is also wonderful, for intense exercisers, to be used the day after a hard workout, to stretch and relax your body and prepare for the next workout. :)
