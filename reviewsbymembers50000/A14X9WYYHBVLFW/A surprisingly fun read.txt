 I had bought this book in anticipation of moving, with a new kitten in tow, and I wanted to make sure that I familiarized her with her new surroundings and was able to catch any behavioral problems early on.  I was then surprised by how much FUN this book was to read!  Dr. Dodman's case stories are really enjoyable and informative--almost like reading a little mystery.  "Why's the cat doing this?  What can we do now?  Here's the answer!"  He has a genuine knack for storytelling and at the same time provides valuable insight into the minds of our cats.  I've been able to put several of his theories into action with my own cat, and we're both very happy with the results!  I highly recommend this book even if you *don't* think you have any behavioral issues with your cat--it's stuff worth knowing, and a great read to boot.
