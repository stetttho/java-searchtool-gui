 As a beginner in Pilates work, I had tried another video prior to this one and was wishing for more detailed explanation to the technique.  A good friend and Pilates instructor recommended the Stott series, and this video in particular to start with.  I was so glad she did!  If you are new to Pilates and serious about getting the full sense of technique that will give you the results you're looking for, this video is the one to try!  The leader explains each motion clearly and emphasizes the need for flow in between, as well as placing the importance on preparing for each new exercise as being nearly as important as the exercise itself. The workout is very intense and requires both physical and mental endurance, and the instructor's demeanor is pleasant and makes you feel comfortable about being at whatever level you're at.  If you're unable to perform the full exercise, she shows or explains how to modify it to suit you.  I appreciate her manner in doing this, so I don't feel "less able" because I not as flexible as she is (yet!). I feel I've advanced so much from using this video regularly, and I can't wait to try the other videos in the Stott series once I feel I've mastered this one.
