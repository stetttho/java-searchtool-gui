 I first used this video 6 years ago, borrowing from a college roommate.  I liked it so much I bought my own, and since then have used it and other Firm tapes religiously.  This tape is awesome for all muscle groups--particularly the butt and arms!  I've enjoyed the adaptability of it, too--I started out barely handling 3 lb. weights, but I've been able to move up as my strength increases (and it still is!).  I never got the same results going to the gym.  Another plus is that it doesn't require any other equipment besides the weights (no steps or anything) and doesn't even require a whole lot of space, because there is no complicated footwork.  I like to alternate this workout with running, Tae Bo, or other cardio work, and then use the Firm Parts tapes. Plus, you can giggle at all the 80s music, clothes, makeup, hair, and Susan Harris's playboy voice (I do love her though!) :)  If these things would normally bother you, don't worry--the workout is so intense, they become the last things on your mind.  All that counts is that you feel absolutely stellar afterwards!
