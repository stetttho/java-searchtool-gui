 This is the book I return to again and again, since the exercises, which are gentle and easy to do, really do help on tense and injured muscles and tissue. The book is very much focused on the drawings of the exercises with helpful text on the sides and references to important intro text scattered throughout to help you remember the essentials of safe stretching. Very easy to use book, and the exercies do help! If you need more information in general about RSI, the physiology of it and treatments, I have found "It is not Carpal Tunnel Syndrome!" to be a very informative book.
