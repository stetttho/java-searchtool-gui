 This system almost sounds as good as it is good-looking! The design of this product will uplift the ambience of any room, and while you can't expect really deep bass or high-end high frequency reproduction, it still sounds amazingly good. The bass goes deep, considering the size of thespeakers and the midrange is open and has a lots of detail.  Attaching a good subwoofer would undoubtedly help with the bass. Absolutely worth the money!
