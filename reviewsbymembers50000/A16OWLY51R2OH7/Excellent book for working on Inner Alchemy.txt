 Thisis a very practical book. Starts with a very short introduction to the subject, and describes how alchemical drawings are the equivalent of the well-known Eastern mandalas. Then goes on to describe how to work with, and meditate on, the alchemical drawings in the book. 30 alchemical drawings with explanations follow, and you can meditate on, and integrate, the various symbols in the drawings. Besides it's very practical application, it is very good that the book draws attention to the fact that the West have an as deep and knowledgeable esoteric tradition as the East, and that the West have tools that are especially suitable for the follower of the Western Mystery Tradition. 5 stars!
