 From an esoteric viewpoint, this book is one of a kind. The book is very well-researched, and treats the Norse myths with respect and thoughtfulness.   For those people out there who, following in the steps of the fanatical followers of the monotheistic religions, want to create a new type of "Norse fundamentalism", I have this to say: Fundamentalism is utterly foreign to the spirit of our Norse ancestors and to the Norse tradition, and you are really taking on an attitude that stems from Churchianity, Islam, and other intolerant religions. Think about it.  For the esoteric minded person, who is interested in finding the deeper perspective and wisdom of the wonderful and deep Norse tradition, this books is invaluable. Buy it!
