 This cd is definitely the best cd I have bought in a very long time! The music and text stirs the soul and made me feel that I was back in another time. It also beautifully illustrates parts of the history of the Native  American Indians; it is hard not to be deeply touched by some of the texts  on this cd; "Ghost Dance" and" It is a Good Day to Die"  comes to mind in particular. The mix between modern instruments and drums  is very well carried out, and some of the melodies on this cd are just  captivatingly beautiful! Buy it or you will regret it!:-)
