 To read this book is similar to undergoing an initiation experience oneself. The book is very well-written, and it is hard to lay it down before reading it all the way through. Personally this book has had a profound influence on my life; I can only recommend it to the highest degree. If you are ready to get a push forward on the initiatory path, this book can do it for you! Another recommendable book  in the same genre is : The Red Lion & The Elixir of Eternal Life, which describes from a first-person perspective the cycles and laws of karma and rebirth.
