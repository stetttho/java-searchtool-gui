 This book is a very good all-round book; it both deals with setup and maintenance of the aquarium (location, filters, heating, water quality, etc), and has a lot of pictures of common plants and fish. It puts the various fish into categories like whether they function well in a communal  aquarium, where they mostly stay in the tank (bottom, middle, top), and  what their preferred food is (plant, livefeed, dried food). This is a book  you will find yourself returning to again and again for reference. Highly  recommended!
