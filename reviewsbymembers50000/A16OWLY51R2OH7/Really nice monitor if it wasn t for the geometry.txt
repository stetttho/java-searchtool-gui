 The good thing about this monitor, besides a very nice and decorative exterior design, is a screen with bright colors and high resolution. However, I am on my 3rd ViewSonic monitor within a few weeks, 1 P70F, and 2 P90F. None of them has been able to produce a straight horizontal line accurately. My first monitor was slighly concave, while the last two each has had problem with the horizontal geometry. After doing a lot of tweaking and adjusting I am still left with a screen where the lower right corner is about 3 milimeters higher than the left lower corner! This is visible even at a distance and of course makes for incorrect screen geometry overall. If it wasn't for this problem, I would find this monitor absolute great. I am amazed at how a reputable company like ViewSonic can put out a product like this, obviously with either insufficient quality control or extremely low requirements for what is supposed to be their top-of-the-line CRT monitor. I have worked for major computer companies, where I worked with a lot of different screens, and never have I seen monitors with these kind of severe geometric problems anywhere. I am going to go for a NEC MultiSync FE991SB monitor instead, since I only have only have good experiences with NEC monitors. Hope ViewSonic get their act together, then they could definitely have a winner here!
