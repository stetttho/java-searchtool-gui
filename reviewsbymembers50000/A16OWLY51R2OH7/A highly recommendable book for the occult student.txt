 To read this book is similar to undergoing an initiation experience oneself. The book is very well-written, and it is hard to lay it down before  reading it all the way through. Personally this book has had a  profound influence on my life; I can only recommend it to the highest  degree. If you are ready to get a push forward on the initiatory path, this  book can do it for you!
