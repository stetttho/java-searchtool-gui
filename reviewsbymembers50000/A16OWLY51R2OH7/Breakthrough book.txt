 I have been a Buddhist monk myself, and while Eckhart Tolle's teaching has parallels to the Buddhist Mindfulness practice, he manages to explain things in a clear and very useful manner you very very rarely find. I follow the Hermetic path as well, but I find that the teachings in this book are extremely beneficial and powerful to use in every day life. Thank you to Eckhart Tolle for expounding these timeless teachings so well. They can truly transform your life in the deepest sense, and they can do it here and now. You don't have to wait for this or that thing, relationship, or spiritual breakthrough, as the ego so often wants you to believe.
