 I thought I would update my earlier review. As written there, there were horizontal geometry problems with the first few monitors. I have now gotten a new monitor. The horizontal geometry problem is with this monitor reduced to a difference of 1 mm between the right and left side of the monitor, and that is much more acceptable than the 3 mm difference on the two earlier monitors I tried. Else the same positive qualities holds true: a very bright monitor, with crisp colors, and very good sharpness; it is a great joy to work with this monitor! I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the geometry problems. I have been in contact with both ViewSonic Europe, and the local importer, and apparently ViewSonic's specifications allow for a difference of up to 3 mm's horisontically. I personally find that that is 2 mm's too much. Fortunately, at least in Scandinavia, the importer (www.infocare.dk) will send you a new monitor within 48 hours, providing you with a postage-paid form to mail the defect monitor back to them). At least the service is good! A word of advice, which I think has been stated earlier, but nevertheless it doesn't hurt to repeat it: wait about 45 minutes after you have turned it on before you tweak the picture with the controls (which by the way I still find the easiest to use monitor controls I have so far encountered!)  for the best possible picture. Lastly, I would like to mention that I looked into a lot of other totally flat CRT monitors on the market, but they were either considerably more expensive and/or had two vertical damper wires across the screen, and certainly none of them has the elegant design of the ViewSonic P90f that makes it possible for you to even have it in your living room; it actually enhances it!:-)
