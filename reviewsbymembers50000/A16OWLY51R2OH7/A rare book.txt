 This is a very enlightening book. Finally, it seems someone has had the courage to divulge some of the more esoteric teachings of Native American spirituality. I have studied esoteric teachings for many years, and there is far between books like these that really gives you many and deep insights. Definitely a book that can be read many times, and each time you will get something more out of it. A far cry from the books of "plastic medicine men". T. ex you can buy books out there that tells you how to make your own medicine wheel, even coming from a non-native background. This book will tell you that you are not reallly ready for any such thing before AT LEAST 30 years of study and practice. No quick-fixes here!  As non-natives we need to have an very deep respect for Native American spirituality. First we took their land, then we prohibited their religion and language, forcing their children to go to boarding schools in order to brainwash them into Churchianity and capitalism (this first ended in 1970!!), and THEN well-meaning, if ignorant, people come and demand to be initiated into their spirituality, taking Indian names, charging money for teachings, etc. I do believe we can learn from them, if we will listen with an attitude of respect.It is wonderful that Chokecherry Call Eagle had the mission and the courage to publish the teachings in this book. An extremely honest and higly recommendable book..!
