 This mouse is definitely the best mouse I have ever tried. It feels very comfortable in the hand (right or left), the buttons operate very smoothly, and the mouse itself weighs surprisingly little. If you are a person like  me with large hands, this is finally a mouse where you can actually rest  your hand on the mouse comfortably. The mouse seem to work very precise,  even when used on your jeans! That the tail of the mouse also radiates a  warm read glow just further add to the impression that this is a very high  quality product. Together with the Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro, this  mouse defintely helps toward a more comfortable computing experience. 5  stars!
