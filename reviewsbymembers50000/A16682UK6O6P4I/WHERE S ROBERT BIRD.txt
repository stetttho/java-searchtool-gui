 Gee, this isn't very funny, and a better target would have been the esteemed Democratic Senator from West Virginia, Robert Bird. Senator Thurmond was merely a segregationalist (as were 98% of the Democratic senators from the South). But Senator Bird was an open and vocal member of the Ku Klux Klan. So why is Senator Thurmond the target? Simple. He's a Republican. Fair and balanced? I think not.
