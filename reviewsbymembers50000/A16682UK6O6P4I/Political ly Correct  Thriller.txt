 I'll bet the producers feel like fools now. Who was the genius who decided the Islamo-facist mastermind of the novel should be replaced by a (yawn) neo-Nazi? And why did this neo-Nazi detonate a nuclear bomb on US soil? We don't know, and this film doesn't tell us, either. A sublime novel by Clancy has been turned into a silly (but sometimes effective) film for some other age, but certainly not our post-9/11 world. Saddest of all, the metaphorical vision (look it up) of Tom Clancy's villainous cast--an Islamic terrorist dying of cancer, a Native American activist lost in a fever-dream of romantic primitivism, and an East German female Bader-Meinhoff type who never figured out the 1960s are over--is nuked by an incredibly stupid plot involving those evil white men, at it yet again. Don't blame Ben Affleck for this mess. Take it out on the suits!
