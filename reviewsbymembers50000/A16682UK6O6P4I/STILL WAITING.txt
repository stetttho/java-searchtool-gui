 Yeah, like most everyone else I got a set with a defective disk--Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, one of my favorites. Contacted Universal, told I would hear back within a week, and receive a replacement disk--that was two days after this set was released. Still haven't heard a thing, still waiting for my "replacement disk." Just should have returned the set to Amazon and got it over with. I doubt I will purchase the next set. Well, Universal and NBC have merged, so you get lousy DVDs, Katie Couric, and The Left..er WEST Wing from the same source.
