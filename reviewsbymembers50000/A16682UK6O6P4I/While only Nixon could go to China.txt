 Ms. Faludi, consumate feminist, is clueless in this "study" of the American male. She discounts the negative impact of feminist theory, rhetoric, and pro-women, affirmative action on the lives of American  men--opting instead to blame men for men's problems. While a lot of blame  can be put on men for the current state of masculinity (obsession with  sports, for instance, has all but blinded men to their loss of hegemony and  (yes) freedom under this new matriarchy we are now suffering with), I still  have to say that when half the population, and the policies of the United  States government turn against you, there is only so much men can do to  fight back. And, of course, being a woman, Ms. Faludi offers no  solutions--and therein lies the cluelessness of this book. Despite some  interesting interviews with famous and not so famous men, STIFFED is a  waste of time.
