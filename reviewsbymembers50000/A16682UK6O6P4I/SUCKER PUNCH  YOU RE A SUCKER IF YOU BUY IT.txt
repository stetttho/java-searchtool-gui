 Now that we know this little narcissist is a liar, we can judge his "memoirs" as fiction, and as fiction they suck. Rambling, repetetive, filled with the kind of self-love rich out of touch folks like Oprah eat up, this piece of dreck has nothing to offer. Go out a read a REAL novelist, not a sideshow freak spinning lies.
