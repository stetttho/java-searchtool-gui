 Overrated, overproduced, overacted, stagy, cynical and snide. Why does this film have such a great reputation? It's a depression-era bath in manure, with a feel-bad ending of the kind that the liberal elite love (because they are rich and comfortable and need that touch of misery to feel like "the little guy"). It doesn't surprise me that this film was rejected by the paying audiences of the time--those folks had enough real misery and didn't need the cinematic kind. Indeed, now that we're on the subject, what is the basis for Humphrey Bogart's reputation? Hell, Lon Chaney, Jr. was a better actor and had more range (remember Lenny?). Bogart was nothing more than a big, dumb no talent lummox and he played the worst Philip Marlowe next to Elliot Gould's (who, along with Robert Altman, should have been shot by a firing squad for making THE LONG GOODBYE in the 1970s). "The Treasure of Sierra Madre" is no treasure, it's Warner Brothers studio pap.
