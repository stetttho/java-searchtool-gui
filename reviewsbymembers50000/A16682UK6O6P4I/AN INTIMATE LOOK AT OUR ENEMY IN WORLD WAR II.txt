 Sakai died last year, but his legacy lives on in this remarkable autobiography (written with Martin Caidin). Reading this frank and memorable work makes one wonder how the Japanese ever got the notion that they could win a war against the United States. It is clear that their strategy of "bushido spirit" over technological innovation was doomed, and Sakai graphically depicts how the Zero fighter--once the top of the line aircraft of the Pacific Theater--fell behind the Allied designs until the once-formidable fighter was totally outmoded. Read this volume alongside Bergerud's FIRE IN THE SKY and Yoshimura's ZERO FIGHTER.
