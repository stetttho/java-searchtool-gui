 These are fine films and I raced out to buy them the day they arrived. But like the first batch of Universal Legacy collection DVDs, one disk was defective. It stuck, froze, locked, and shut down my DVD player. What the hell is wrong with Universal? Can't they even produce a decent DVD without quality control issues? I have decided NOT to purchase DAWN OF THE DEAD next week as it is yet another Universal product and probably defective.
