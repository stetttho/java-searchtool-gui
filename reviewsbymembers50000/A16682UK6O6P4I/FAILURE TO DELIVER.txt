 I've submitted over three hundred dollars worth of orders to this site. The items I ordered were never sent and after nearly a year, Ted Malone, the owner of this "enterprise" has still not answered repeated inquiries by myself and my credit card company. Even literally dozens of calls to the site's 800 number failed to elicit a response. Buyer BEWARD!!!
