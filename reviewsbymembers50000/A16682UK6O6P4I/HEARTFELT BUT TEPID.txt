 This tame little film is marred by limp screenplay and one-note performances by both Richard Gere and Lisa Eichhorn. This movie is so deadly dull that even sensitive turns by William Devaine and Vanessa Redgrave as ill-starred lovers could not hold one's interest for long. Supposedly the story of Americans in England prior to D-Day, the period illusion is completely shattered by director John Schlesinger's disasterous choice of locations--most especially the "American training camp" filmed in the shadow of a nuclear reactor's cooling tower!?! Ridley Scott would never make such an error.
