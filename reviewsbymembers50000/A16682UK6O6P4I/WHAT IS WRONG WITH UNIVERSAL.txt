 What the heck is wrong at quality control over at Universal (Mexico?)? I've purchased three Universal DVDs in the last three months and all of them had to be returned because they were defective. On this Abbott and Costello Collection, Side Two, Disk One won't play. Their Monster Legacy Collections were downright unviewable (three sets exchanged before I got a set that worked) and now this. It's official--I'm giving up on Universal products. Universal, you suck almost as badly as the network (NBC) who took you over.
