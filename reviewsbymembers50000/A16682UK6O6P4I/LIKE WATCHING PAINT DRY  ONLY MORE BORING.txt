 This film is the driest, most boring, most pointless science fiction film ever produced by any nation. Solaris gets its overblown reputation as a classic no doubt because it came to America during the first years of the Reagan Administration and the elite media types had to find something Soviet to laud as they condemned The Great Communicator's relaunching of the Cold War. The only thing more boring than Solaris is the George Clooney remake, but at least that is (mercifly) shorter.
