 This piece of utter dreck fails on so many levels I can not list them here. Simply put, basing your "science" on a fruit cake late night talk show host like Art Bell (Who previously claimed Y2K would end civilization as we know it)is a recipe for disaster, but not the good kind. The two morons who made this tripe also directed "Godzilla" where there was at least better science--If you ask me it is more likely radiation can make a lizard grow to super size than global warming is a fact. Emmerich and Devlin can go to hell.
