 While young men are in crisis and boys are consigned to the back of the educational bus (3 out of 5 students in college are female) our art--with the exception of FIGHT CLUB--ignores this crisis. Instead, we are all treated to the spectacle of middle-aged hippy angst. My favorite literary critic, Colin Wilson, maintains that people like to see their own beliefs, conceits and bias reflected in art. That is surely the case with this sad little film. AMERICAN BEAUTY tries to justify adultery with a minor under the guise of middle-age "searching." No wonder Hollywood loves this film. They love Bill Clinton, too.
