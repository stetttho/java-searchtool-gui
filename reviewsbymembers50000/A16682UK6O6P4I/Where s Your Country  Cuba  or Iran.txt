 After reading the drivel from this socialist chucklehead I found "his" country. It's a fascist totalitarian Marxist hellhole where the "union" man gets a "fair break" (free bread and government cheese) but everyone else who actually thinks goes to jail for practicing their religion or criticising a postage increase. Dude, go to hell.
