 Poor little Jimmy. He turned traitor to get his educational spending bill passed, but like Benedict Arnold, Jumpin' Jim discovered that no one respects a turncoat--least of all those who benefited from his disloyalty. Democrats didn't lift a finger to support Jefford's "educational initiatives," and he ended up getting less than he would have gotten if he'd stuck with the Republicans. Look for little Jimmy to decide "not to run for personal reasons" in the next election. His influence is gone, his book didn't sell, and after 9/11 his issues are as dead as the Vermont economy.
