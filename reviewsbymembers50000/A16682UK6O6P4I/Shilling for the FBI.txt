 This wooden and disappointing film resembles an episode of the old Dragnet show, but not in a good way. Antiquated crime fighting techniques are demonstrated, al la CSI, and the virtues of the FBI (you know, the guys who couldn't figure out the 9/11 attacks were coming) are endlessly touted. Don't be fooled. This is NOT an example of film noir, just a second-rate crime drama filmed in black and white.
