 Hasn't anyone noticed that Tears of the Sun bears a striking resemblance to a 1965 film called Dark of the Sun, based on a Wilbur Smith novel of the same name? Heck, even the titles are similiar! In fact, the differences between the two films are in the details, not the setting or theme. For instance, Curry--the protagonist in Dark of the Sun--is a mercenary soldier; in Tears, Bruce Willis and company are Navy SEALs; the rescued diamond miners and their families in Dark of the Sun were transformed into indigenous tribesmen for Tears; and the Macguffin-like cache of diamonds in Dark of the Sun metamorphs into the young son of the murdered president in Tears. Don't get me wrong--this is not a criticism of Tears of the Sun, a pretty fine film. I just think Mr. Fuqua is another fan of that old Rod Taylor, Jim Brown, Yvette Mimieux classic, as am I. Hey, MGM, when are you gonna release a nice, clean, widescreen print of Dark of the Sun on DVD?
