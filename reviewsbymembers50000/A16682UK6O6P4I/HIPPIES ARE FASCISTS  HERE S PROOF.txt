 This prophetic movie, about the hippy-dippy counterculture of the 1960s gaining absolute power and turning America into a fascist nation is dead on prophetic--Kent State, Woodstock, baby-boomer consumerism, are all on display in this film.   Think about it. Where is the politically correct silencing of speech, the mandatory "sensitivity training" coming from? Ex-Hippies, that's who. All those soccer Moms who now belong to teacher's unions and drive gas-guzzling SUVs, who adore the modern Mrs. Grundy--Senator Hillary Clinton--used to be flower girls.   Amazon is incorrectly listing this film as unavailable on DVD, but it was actually released in the first week of September, 2004 on a double sided disk with GAS-S-S-S on the flip side. The DVD is available from MGM as one of its Midnight Movie disks, ISBN # 0-7928-6137-X.
