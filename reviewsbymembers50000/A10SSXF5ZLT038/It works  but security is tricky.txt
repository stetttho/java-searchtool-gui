 This is the only product I know of that works with the X-Box. It's overpriced, but it does work well. I am all for less clutter so the price was worth it for me.  The only issue with this device is you cannot change the security channel. What I mean is that I like to have my 128bit key on channels 2,3 or 4 but you MUST use channel 1 for this to work with your router (and your router must also have its 128bit key on channel 1).  Other than that, this is another fine hardware product from Microsoft.
