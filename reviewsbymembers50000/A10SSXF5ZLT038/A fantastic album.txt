 This CD is for those who like Rush, Kansas, Steve Morse Band, and other that use complicated time signatures.  As a drummer, I can say that Virgil Donati is my new idol. He has the fastest feet in the business and really shows his abilities in this release.  True the music is not completely polished, but the musicians are tuned into each other and play the rhythms very tight.  There are no vocals so don't expect any songs. As such, this CD is not for everyone. Musicians will appreciate this more as the abilities of all the players are excellent. The sound is pure rock and fusion with a touch of jazz. If you want to hear something new and unique, give this a try - you won't be dissapointed.
