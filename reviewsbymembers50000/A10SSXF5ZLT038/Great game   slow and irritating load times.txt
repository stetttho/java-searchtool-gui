 I must confess that I have only recently started playing console games. I bought the X-Box because of the type of games I am interested in playing. My first game was Star Wars Battlegrounds - fun game.  As my second game, I chose Knights of the Old Republic II. The game is OK. A friend of mine told me that the cool force powers are available for those characters edging towards the Dark Side, so I purposfully chose responces that guarantee those points. A dissapointing feature of the game is that I cannot do very evil things like kill my companions or leave them behind. It seems regardless of my choices, they come along anyway.  The most annoying feature is the loading involved. I wish there was some way to copy the game and have it run from the hard drive as I am sure the load times would be faster. It takes close to 30 seconds to load a next scene, and sometimes accessing multiple scenes is required for game play.  But it is a fun game to play and I have been attachted to my game controller playing this game for day on end.
