 I did not buy this through Amazon, but through NewEgg. After I ordered it, I noticed the reviews here so naturally I became worried.  I recieved the unit and used it right away just to make sure it work - and it works just fine. The heater elements are quick to heat. Of course its only 50 bucks so there are not a whole list of features but it does come with several accessory trays (including one for muffins).  The timer is mechanical and it does click as it counts down, but the previous reviewers must have super sensitive hearing...its not that loud.  The top heater element is the primary so it heats first. As the temperature selection is increased, the lower element starts to warm up.  I like this unit, and it looks nice too. The only complaint I have is the metal seems rather thin. Overall the operation seems just fine, and that is all that matters. The plastic handles on the underside is a nice touch if you must move the unit after use. It is also pretty easy to clean as the door underneath spans the size of the cooking area.
