 I watched Re-Loaded in the theater and was overcome by the amount of psycobabble that I could not enjoy the action. When this came out on DVD, I decided I liked it. It was not really that bad, except for the "to be continued." Then came Revolutions. I had high hopes for this. I wondered how it would end because I had this idea that what was concidered the "real-world" was actually another extension of the Matrix. I think that would have made a great ending. Anyway, I watched the movie and quickly became dissappointed and bored. Halfway in the movie, no progress was made to reveal the plot, then the seemingly endless battle of Zion takes place. SPOLIERS AHEAD: I have to admit the ending of the movie caught me by surpize. Having Neo make a deal with the machines shows that third option that was not present in Re-loaded. Non the less, there is no reason why this film could not have been merged with Re-loaded. In summary, what is wrong with Revolutions 1. No plot development during the first half of the movie 2. The Zion battle sequence was much too long and kind of over the top. 3. Trinity and Neo die. I understand Neo dying, but what was the purpose of Trinity dying? Cannot figure that out! I would think her seeing the Sun then returning to Zion will offer hope to the humans. 4. I can't help but loose pace with the different body of the Oracle. Yes they tried to cover this in the script, but it did not work for me. 5. I miss the twins. Those guys were cool! 6. What is with the fight scene between Smith and Neo? That was way too "video gamey" to me. Kinda silly actually. What is right with Revolutions: 1. It does end eventually. 2. I bought it at Amazon, so I saved a few bucks. 3. If I cannot sleep at night, I'll put this on. 4. If someone I dislike asks me for a movie recommendation, I will recommend Revolutions. I will agree with almost everyone here - The Matrix origional is by all means the best of the three. From there, its downhill.
