 I needed a new phone because I absolutely hated the freebee they give when you sign up. I thought about getting the RAZR but since everyone and their dog has one, I wanted something different.  This phone has the best reception I have had in a cell phone so far. It also has the ability to play music and games. The onboard memory is about 240MB so it can be limited to how many songs you can play. Keep in mind that ringtones and games will add to the memory usage.  The phone comes with some weird headphones - I don't like them at all as the cord is too short on one side. The sound quality is OK but with better headphones quality is much improved.  The included software is not very good. I just used the drivers on the CD and dragged and droped my MP3's using the standard explorer interface. The really cool thing about this phone (and others I am sure) is that you cna choose a whole song, any MP3, as the ringtone.  The only downside to this phone is that it will not play the Mobile Battlefront game - it is not a choice for this phone.  The phone is also smaller than I thought, which is cool. I also like the orange color, but there are grey "skins" included as well. My box came with headphones, charger, software and driver CD, battery (of course) and a grey skin pack.  This phone is much more cooler than the RAZR in my opinion. Get one before everyone else does!
