 I cannot remember if I posyed a review on the WGT624 or not, but here it goes. I bought Netgear because of great products and support in the past. I have to say that both have declined greatly. I have the v2 of this router, and its buggy. In wireless mode, the router begins rebooting itself! I have spent some time with this so I will break down this issue here: Wireless mode turned off: no reboots whatsoever, stable. 108Mbps enabled: reboots every few hours G and B mode: reboots every 2 or 3 days in B mode only: reboots every 5 to 6 days. When I contacted Netgear (and contacting a call center in India), it took 20 minutes to explain the problem only to have them parrot back a misinterpretation! Its not their fault, its Netgears fault for contracting with them - sure it saves money but at what cost? Their suggestion was to diable SPI firewall which did nothing. They will RMA the unit. What is strange is if you search Google for "WGT624 reboots" and you will find a host of people with this issue. Problem is Netgear is neither aware of the problem, nor willing to acknowledge the problem. I will send this in for RMA. In the meantime, I decided to buy a new wireless router - the Microsoft MN-500. I read the reviews and it received good press. I must concur that the Microsoft router is problem free, greater range, much cheaper, and simple to setup. I will review the router so look for it. Bottom line, avoid this router. If you are still willing to shell down money for a gamble, I would wait until Netgear finally acknowledges the problem that way it can be fixed!
