 I am a Rush fanatic, but I must say this is not their best CD. I still like it a lot, but the sound quality leaves much to be desired. There is far too much distortion to the master - done on purpose I am sure.  This particular CD digs deep into their roots of rock and roll with little (if any) electronics. And this CD does rock hard - blasting in with a double-bass barrage and grinding guitar of One Little Victory.   My favorites on this CD:  One Little Victory Vapor Trails Earthshine Secret Touch Nocturne Freeze  The rest, well I will leave that up to you.
