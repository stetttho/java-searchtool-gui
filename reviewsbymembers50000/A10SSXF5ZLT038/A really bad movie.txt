 I had high hope for this movie - all of my favorite characters of novels being hunted by Hugh Jackman (the Wolverine in X-men).  However, from the star this movie is just plain silly. It relies completely on computer technology but the story is lost. There is no character development and no decent interactions. There are not even any decent one-liners!  Save your money from something much better - say "Dude, Where'w My Car." That movie was one of my worst rated films, but then came Van Helsing.
