 For me the measure of intelligence is the ability for a person to take his or her chosen subject and explain it such that the subject becomes easily understood. Particle and Quantum Physics are not easy topics, yet Martinus Veltman explains the subject so wonderfully that now I can feel confident when confronted with terms like particle accelerators, quarks, pions and mesons.  Understanding of the physical processes is required to really reep the full benefit of this book but I think the lay person could also enjoy the reading. A word of caution, English majors will no doubt gringe as this book does have repeditave grammaticall errors (as does this review no doubt). Regardless, this book is fantastic. I particularly enjoyed the narratives of some if the top minds in the field - and there are some fun anecdotes as well.
