 This unit has some wonderful features for the price, but it is no stable when the wireless mode is enabled. Ever 2 to 4 hours, the unit goes through this rebooting process that cannot be stopped. There is no issue listed on the Netgear website, and Netgear has yet to respond to my inquiry, but do a Google search for "WGT624 unit reboots" and you will see what I mean. It is best to avoid this product and choose something else. Is is suspected that the "Atheros" chip is to blame, whatever that means! I guess find a wireless router that does not use an "Atheros" chip.
