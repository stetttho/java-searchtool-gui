 I know there are many Microsoft bashers out there, but bottom line is their hardware products always work without a hitch. I have used Microsoft Keyboard and Mice with no problems ever. I bought a Netgear WGT624 router which was a nightmare. Reboot issues remain ignored by Netgear, and their support is lacking. I read the reviews of the MN-500 router by Microsoft so I decided to give it a go. At the price you cannot go wrong. I am a very proficient network type guro, and manage a modest size network at Stanford. I have always been hesitant using wireless because of the hit and miss connection issues. My laptop has a wireless network card so I decided to take the plunge at home. Dealing with the Netgear router made me want to give up, but using the Microsoft router, I must say I am very impressed. At first glance and feel, its rather cheasy (showing my age). Setting the unit up was a breeze. You can set the router up without using the software, but I like the software so I used it. After a few clicks, it was up and running. Wireless too. No problems at all! It was really refreshing to use a wireless router without haveing to deal with hassle. Plugged it in, ran the software, surfed the web, end of story. The software will notify you of an update, and I recommend you do. It adds an extra security feature - dissabling of SSID broadcast. So what do you get for about 40 bucks? 1. Wireless router 2. 4 port switch 3. Firewall 4. MAC address filtering 5. 64 or 128bit WEP 6. Disable of SSID broadcast 7. Very good wireless range - 20% greater than the WGT624 in B-mode. and all of the other usual features like DHCP. Sure its only 802.11b, but its tried and tested. If you are looking for a router, get this router!
