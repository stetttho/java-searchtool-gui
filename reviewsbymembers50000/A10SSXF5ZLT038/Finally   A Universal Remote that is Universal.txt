 This thing rocks!  I do not have a X-Box 360 yet, but I bought this in anticipation of getting the new X-Box. Really what makes this an X-Box remote is a pre-configured profile for X-Box and the Y X A B buttons (like on the controller).  What you get with this is an impossible to open (like all things in plastic these days) package - but in that package is a software CD, a set of 4 AAA batteries, a USB cable, and the remote. The remote has 4 AAA batteries installed, but these MUST be replaced by the inlcuded extra batteries. It won't work otherwise.  The remote is configured online using a very extensive database. The remote works by creating "profiles." For example, when setting up the remote, there are already templates ready to go: Watch TV, Watch DVD, Listen to Radio, Play X-Box, Play CD's, and Watch VCR. You tell the software what you have (you will need your model numbers) and asks how your setup works. When all is ready, the Watch TV action does the following (for me anyway): Turns on the TV, turns on cable box, sets the TV inputs and I am ready to go. For DVD: Turns on TV, turns on receiver, turns on DVD, sets TV inputs, sets receiver to DVD.  How cool is that.  The difficulty was my TV. I had to do some tweaking in the setup - learing new commands and re-assigning keys - mostly because their database did not have the correct commands for my remote.  What remotes are not in the database can be easily learned, and you can completely re-configure the "profiles" as you wish.  It takes some time to set up but it is well worth it. I have no need for any of my other remotes: TV, Cable, VCR, Receiver, DVD, Media Center, and CD.  This is truly a Universal remote!
