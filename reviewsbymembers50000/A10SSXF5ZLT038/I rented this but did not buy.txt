 I am a South Park fan. The way these guys make fun of everything - and I mean everything - is just wonderful. In reality, these guys are erasing the blurred lines people like separate things with and show them for what they really are - religion included.   This is entertainment and not to be taken seriously! People who find these episodes offensive should just return them and be quiet. We all know South Park is offensive - that is why we watch them! Besides, we know these people laugh when they are making fun of things that do not offend them.  On to the DVD itself...  This DVD includes only three episodes, but they are all good.   Personally I did not like the movie Passion so I really enjoyed South Park's rendition. While I have no experinece with the Catholic religion, I did enjoy how Trey and Matt have kept up with the current events to make Red Hot Catholic Love. Basically it shows how the media can make parents overly scared and the usual responce is to over-react while the Church hides the fact that they condone sleeping with boys. Simply wonderful.  As for Cartman's forming a Christian Rock Band, I have to say this is priceless. I have experience in this area from my high school days. I had friends that actually thought as Cartman did (I went to high school in West Texas) so I can relate. Also, the reference to Creed is classic.  I buy the season disks so I would wait to buy these. For example, Red Hot Catholic Love is just now released on Season 6. I don't remember what seasons the other two episodes are, but they are not on seaons 1 through 6 so I will have to wait.  My recommendation is to rent this - its not worth the money to own simply because it will be released on the season series disks anyway.  But they are very funny!
