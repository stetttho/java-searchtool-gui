 The arrival of this book is great news! This is the long-awaited tenth-anniversary edition of Dr. Chamberlain's 1988 classic, Babies Remember Birth. In paperback format and enriched with a new last chapter,  this book has the potential to revolutionize the way we look at babies,  both before and after birth. Part I is filled with  "user-friendly" information about the mind and abilities of  newborns, as well as a thorough look at their development before birth.  Parts II and III present evidence that babies do remember birth and are  very much aware of the people around them at that time. There are many  amazing stories of labor and birth, from the baby's point of view. As Dr.  Chamberlain writes, "Birth memories indicate that babies have an  identity of their own; their parents don't give it to them. They act  mindfully and build experience around a central core of self." The new  last chapter is worth the price of the book all by itself. Dr. Chamberlain  writes compellingly about the newborn's sensitivity, awareness, and  vulnerability. He emphasizes the importance and power of the  infant-and-parent connection during pregnancy and after birth. When the  information in this book becomes common knowledge, we will look at our  children with new respect and understanding.
