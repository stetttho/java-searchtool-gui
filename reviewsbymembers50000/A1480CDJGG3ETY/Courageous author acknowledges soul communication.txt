 As I opened this book, I wondered whether I would be disappointed by yet another author who pushes aside the possibility of pre-birth communication. I have read books on the dreams of pregnancy that speak of symbols, wish fulfillment, and the mind's tendency to sift through possible outcomes. It takes courage to assert that some dreams may be genuine communications from the soul of the unborn child. Raina M. Paris has that courage. This is a wonderfully satisfying book, written with the touch of a poet and full of common sense. There are rich chapters devoted to both the mother's and father's experiences, exercises to increase dream awareness, and an insightful glossary of common dream symbols as they pertain to pregnancy. One of the most delightful aspects of Paris's style is the way she accepts premonitory dreams as entirely natural events, "mysteriously ordinary, like life." This is the approach I prefer in dealing with all channels of pre-birth communication.
