 As I came to the final pages of this book, I felt a sigh of deep satisfaction. This is an extraordinary revelation of our ability to remember not only our life in the womb, but our existence before conception. In an engaging and candid style, Gerald Bongard describes how we can experience ourselves as soul, and even remember the choices we made before coming into the world.   The book is rich with stories of real people and how the "near birth experience" has changed their lives.   These soul-awakening experiences place our lives into a much bigger context than the usual "cradle-to-grave" view, and allow us to see our circumstances as both chosen and meaningful.
