 If you are new to the concept of communication from the spirits of children before birth, this book is a wonderful introduction.  It gathers first-person stories from about thirty mothers and fathers who experienced such contacts. A nice balance of stories from birth parents and adoptive parents makes it clear that soul connections, rather than biology, are the central bond in creating families. Originally published as "Life Before Life," this new edition of Sarah Hinze's book is enhanced by an Afterword from Sarah's husband, psychologist Brent Hinze, Ph.D., in which he draws comparisons between near-death and pre-birth experiences and analyzes the aspects of a "typical" pre-birth contact. Sarah's approach is deeply reverent, imbued with her religious beliefs. Her own experiences are perhaps the most remarkable of all, told in the moving and very personal first chapter.
