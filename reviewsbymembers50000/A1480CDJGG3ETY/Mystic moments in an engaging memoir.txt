 To describe an intimate mystical experience so clearly that the reader can virtually participate in it -- this is a truly rare gift! Jane Goodall possesses the ability to take you right into her moments of vision, glimpses of spiritual realities. For me, these are the unforgettable highlights of her memoir. The story of her childhood, adolescence and young adulthood is enchanting, as a portrait of an essentially normal and loving, supportive family (why is that so unusual in autobiographies!?). I would have liked to learn more of how and why her marriage dissolved, but Goodall chooses to veil that part of her life in privacy.  The final chapters of the book are somewhat less interesting, dealing with fairly well-known information about the serious conditions on the planet. Jane Goodall probably deserves to feel like a saint if anyone does, but it was a little off-putting to sense the halo in her self-image. She recommends that we all become "saints" in saving the earth and its creatures, even in such simple ways as turning off the lights we don't need (it makes me smile to feel like a saint as I flip a switch). This is one of the most engaging memoirs I've read. It seems particularly appropriate for the teenager and young adult reader, showing how a unique life path can develop from seemingly random events and the simple faith to step into the unknown.
