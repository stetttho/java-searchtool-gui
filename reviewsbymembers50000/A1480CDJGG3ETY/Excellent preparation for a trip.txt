 This is a great video for someone who is actually planning a visit to Florence and Venice. It's also a fun video just to watch -- lots of scenes of Italians in action. Reviews that imply there is not much time spent on the cities are simply incorrect. The time spent in Venice and its islands totals 22 rich and well chosen minutes; Florence is equally well represented. There are about five minutes devoted to very good tips on planning your trip, and tips on overcoming the language barrier are scattered throughout the Florence section. I would recommend this tape highly to anyone planning their first visit to Venice and Florence! Rick Steves knows what he is talking about and he gets a lot of valuable information across, while treating the viewer to a fun and beautiful visit to these two wonderful cities.
