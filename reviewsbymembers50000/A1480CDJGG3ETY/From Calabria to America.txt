 This book had special meaning for me as it turns out the author is a cousin-by-marriage! But my enjoyment in reading Penny Petrone's autobiography went beyond the personal angle. She describes a segment of Italian-American life that isn't very well known--that of the immigrants from Italy's southernmost province, Calabria. The portraits of her mother and father are unforgettable. With descriptions of the special foods, religious observances, bits of folk wisdom, and Calabrese dialect--this book filled in many gaps in my understanding of what life was like for the people who left the Old Country, and for the first generation of their kids growing up in the new world.
