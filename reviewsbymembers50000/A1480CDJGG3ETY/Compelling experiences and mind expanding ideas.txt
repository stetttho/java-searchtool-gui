 Return From Heaven focuses on an exciting pattern in reincarnation.  From well-documented cases, it appears that same-family returns are common.  A young child may reveal memories and show behaviors that point to a previous incarnation in the same family - perhaps as a grandparent or even a recently deceased brother or sister. Carol Bowman explores this possibility through detailed case histories written with a warm and personal touch.  These are tremendously moving human interest stories.  They reveal the emotional impact on a family experiencing a reincarnational drama, as well as the signs that link a new child to a previous identity. Bowman also includes an excellent overview of parents' experiences with pre-birth communication, evidence that dovetails with her research findings.      Countless parents are hearing past-life memories from their young children.  Carol Bowman does a tremendous service by showing us how to recognize and listen to these memories.
