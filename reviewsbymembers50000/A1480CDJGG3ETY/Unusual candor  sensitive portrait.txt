 It's some of the similarities that drew me to this book:  Reeve Lindbergh is just my age, with a mother who was a writer. Like my own mother, Anne Morrow Lindbergh was a gifted poet and wordsmith who lost the power to think clearly and use words effectively in her old age.  The strange, unsettling contrast between the silent old woman and the wondrous communicator she once was is a central theme.  I kept turning back to the cover to re-connect with the image of young Anne when she was keen and alert. Reeve is an excellent observer of her own mother: at once compassionate and meticulously objective.  There is much humor in this book, and a refreshing openness about the ambivalence Reeve and her siblings felt as their mother's decline looked likely to last for endless years and to drain their energies in caring for her. I admire her honesty as she probes her own feelings of mingled guilt and tenderness toward her mother.  Many flashbacks to the earlier years, including life with Anne's famous husband Charles Lindbergh, add to the fascination of this lovely book.
