 This is a book to read slowly and savor, as each page offers so much to reflect on -- and even argue with!  Impelled by her own spiritual search, Paula Marvelly interviews the best-known teachers of Advaita and asks the questions that matter.  The resulting conversations are intense and energy-filled. Marvelly's likeable, questioning personality shines through, a good counterpoint to the teachers' assurance. She observes them and herself with honesty and touches of humor. The dialogues are enhanced by Marvelly's striking photographic portraits of the teachers. I turned to them time and again while reading, finding they deepened my sense of each teacher's personality. I don't know when I've read a book that gave me more to think about!
