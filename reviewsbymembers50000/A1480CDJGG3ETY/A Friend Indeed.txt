 This book is so much fun! I've only been working with it for a week but I can definitely feel a change, a lift in my spirits.  By reading only one day's suggestion (okay, it's really tempting to read ahead, but resist the urge!) you have a fresh idea to anticipate and savor each day.  You'll be invited to ponder questions that gently unlock happiness-enhancing insights.  It is like having a friend along on the daily journey of life, a wise and supportive voice that helps keep you focused on the simple and readily available means of fostering your own happiness.
