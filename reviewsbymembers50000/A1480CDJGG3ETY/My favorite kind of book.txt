 Lesta Bertoia's "mini memoirs" are a necklace of small masterpieces. I'm always intrigued by personal accounts, but my favorites are those that let you catch glimpses of the soul world shining through the story. Lesta is a master of "double vision" -- one part slogging through the tribulations of daily life and one part looking on with deep wisdom and humor.  Her writing has a gracefully casual tone that draws you in as though you were sitting across from her at the kitchen table. With unflinching honesty she describes her struggles with the real hard relationship stuff -- and shares many mind-expanding encounters with spirit.  My favorite section is a profound revelation of the soul-wisdom of children, as her little boy recalls his existence as spirit. I hope there will be a sequel; Lesta is an unforgettable personality and leaves you wanting to know more of her unique insights.
