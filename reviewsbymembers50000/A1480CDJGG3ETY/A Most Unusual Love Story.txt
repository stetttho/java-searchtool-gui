Early in her pregnancy, the author experiences communion with the spirit of her child, a spirit full of curiosity and personality.  She  soon finds herself engaged in a conversation that deeply involves them  both.  Their conversation unfolds over the months until birth, and covers  many profound topics such as how a soul chooses its parents.  Mary Grace  McManus's gift is her ability to make such an extraordinary experience  real.  This book is a major contribution to the understanding of Pre-Birth  Communication.  If you are expecting a child, it will inspire you to tune  your inner senses and "listen in."
