Beginning soon after conception and carrying on through pregnancy, birth and beyond, her heartfelt "love letters" record one woman's transition into motherhood.  More than that, they are the first links of that mysterious mother-and-baby connection.  For anyone expecting a baby, this is a wonderful gift.  It's a journal to be used and kept, perhaps to share later with your child.
