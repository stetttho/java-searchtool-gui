 Jo Rainbolt's book is a treat.  She teamed up with her voice teacher, Bonnie Jean Triplett, to create a work that is part autobiography, part instruction manual, and thoroughly delightful.   	Singing Is Natural poses the question "What keeps us from singing?" and comes up with some intriguing insights into our need for self-expression.  Jo describes her own rediscovery of singing, beginning a few years ago with a birthday gift of voice lessons.  Her enthusiasm for learning and sharing "the gift of song" is bound to inspire all of us would-be warblers and kitchen-sink crooners.   	The book is warm as a wood stove and bracing as a winter breeze.  It's peopled with early opera singers, old-time cowboys, friends and neighbors from the small town of Hot Springs, Montana -- all of them illustrating the many ways that singing can enrich our lives.  And for readers who want to take inspiration a step further, Part Two is a detailed, nuts-and-bolts lesson in vocal technique.
