 Much is written about dysfunctional families, and a novel about women oppressed by the patriarchy is not new.  But Vinegar Hill manages to initiate the reader into the dark psychological world of a family torn by  religious and sexual oppression-- and into the heart of a woman coming into  consciousness amidst the maelstrom of changing social mores, festering  family secrets,and the blindness of a Church whose impotence has blinded it  to truth and compassion. Readers who want entertainment alone won't like  this novel, but those who have sought courage and truth in the midst of  paralyzing pain won't be able to put it down.
