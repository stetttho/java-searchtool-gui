 Reading this work is like reading good poetry--vivid, precise, with an economy of words and a wealth of images that bring the reader  into a living conversation with the author.  The book is about relationships which  is are essence of healing--between patient and practitioner, between  individual and symptoms, between the sacred and the mundane, and between  the spirit and the body. In an era of new age "presto-change-o"  approaches to holistic healing, it is refreshing to encounter a writer with  such depth of knowledge and soulful expression. I recommend it to my  patients often.
