 As a psychotherapist, I found this book an invaluable source of practical wisdom.  The author has articulated something that often goes unheard in a extraverted, "more is more, and more is better" culture.  HSP's  have difficulty making a relationship to their healthy creative selves;  they have often learned to pathologize their gifts of intuition and  introspection, depth and empathy.  Separated from self, it should be no  surprise that they also often become alienated from their partners, but  when they are in sync with themselves, they can be warm, compassionate,  spontaneous and profoundly present in love relationships.   It is  gratifying to find a resource that offers concrete suggestions and a wealth  of support to HSP's.  They are among the more gifted among us, and they  need and deserve to be encouraged.
