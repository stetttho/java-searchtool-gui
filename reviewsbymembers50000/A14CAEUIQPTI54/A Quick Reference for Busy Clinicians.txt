 Psychotherapists often complain about the high cost of doing business with managed care companies--but the real plea behind the complaint is that we want to spend more time with clients and less time with paperwork.  This  book creates a framework for doing just that.  The experienced, competent  clinician who finds him- or herself strangely inarticulate when faced with  a blank OTR will find a helpful link between theory, technique, and  individual needs that will help in carifying goals, determining specific  interventions, and measuring success.  When I use it with clients, I find  the therapeutic alliance is strengthened, problems and obstacles are  clarified, and underlying issues often surface in unexpected ways.  A great  find for busy clinicians.
