 I kept trying to like this book.  It offers the basic elements of an inspirational resource--juicy anecdotes, eternal truths,and concrete tips on how to live a more peaceful and joyful life.  But the author appears to  rely heavily on his credibility as a Yale-educated psychiatrist, reminding  the reader continually that he holds a respected place in mainstream  left-brained society.  Perhaps his other books do a better job of  describing his evolution from the traditional community where he received  his training--but the absence of that story in this book leaves the reader  a little cold, wanting to know more about the author than about the  miracles he claims to  work through regression therapy.  I am troubled by  the focus in new age writers on he "nobless oblige" of the more  enlightened among us.  My experience is that we are all just a breath away  from an encounter with the Divine--and a breath away, too, from an  ego-based reptilian flight-or-flight presence which is part of the human  condition.  The task of our lives is to do the hard work of making peace  with all of the parts of ourselves.  To reduce that process to new-age  psychobabble about instant enlightenment and consciousness, I believe does  a disservice to the process of individuation.   If this work were  particularly poetic or articulate, it would be a valuable source of  encouragement.  As it is, it is mostly a head-trip of warmed-over  wisdom--an oversimplification of some of the principles of the great  religions of the world.
