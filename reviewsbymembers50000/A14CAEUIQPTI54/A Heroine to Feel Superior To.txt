 Jo Becker is the kind of character that readers will love, partly because of Sue Miller's deliciously sensuous descriptions of her rather ordinary life.  But Jo is also a protagonist the reader can feel superior to.  As  has been pointed out by critics, Jo throws over her family commitments in  order to satisfy her impulses.  The interweaving currents of her choices  wound two husbands, a mother, and three daughters throughout the course of  the novel, and it is easy for everyone (including the author herself) to  disregard Jo as shallow.  But Jo is a woman who, after all, is simply  trying to find a place of inner mooring in a world that still regards the  dark impulses of the psyche as things to be feared and disdained; her  tragedy at midlife is that she has found no language through which to make  a relationship with her own conflicting selves, and that she projects her  "good" self onto family members who are all too eager to villify  her.  In the end, her attempt to find integrity--by reconciling with her  past, by daring to flirt with her erotic self, and  by going to the police  with what she knows--is met with a stark reality that is too easily  overlooked by the undiscerning reader: Misogyny is as alive in 1999 as it  was in 1968.
