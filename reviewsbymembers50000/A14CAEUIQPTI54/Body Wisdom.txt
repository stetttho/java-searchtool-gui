 I am disappointed to discover that this book is now out of print.  It has been an infinitely valuable resource to me as I have searched through the traditions of medicine, mythology, religion, and psychology to discover the  mysteries of feminine wisdom.  My own copy, dog-eared by years of  referencing as I work with women struggling to get in touch with their own  wisdom, is a treasure in my library.
