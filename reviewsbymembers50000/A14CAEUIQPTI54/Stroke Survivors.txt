 Stroke Survivors is a worthy contribution to the field of caregiving and recovery from one of life'most devastating experience.  In its first pages, the reader is drawn into the riveting experience of several personal  accounts chronicling the inner experience of the stroke  victim--the pain,  the terror, the confusion, the disbelief, and the sudden isolation of  having  speech, organized thought, and/or controlled movement stripped  away. The problem with the book is its lack of focus.  Written by a  stroke survivor and two clinicins, the book is forever changing from voice  to voice in a rather meandering style that leaves the  reader a little  disoriented.  The central focus ofthe book is perhaps too wide-angled:  Is  this a book (as the title implies) about stroke survivors? If so, then why  not make the case studies easier to follow,less laden with social work  jargon.  Is it an academic work?  Then why not clarify the research  questions and draw conclusions that are a little crisper?  Is it a book  about caregivers?  Then why not draw a more clear portrait about one or  several caregiver? The book is actually filled with helpful bits of  information.  But its meandering style and lack of focus make much of that  information inaccessible to the reader.
