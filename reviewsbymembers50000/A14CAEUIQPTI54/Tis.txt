 How Frank McCourt survived to be a master storyteller, poet, and humanitarian is a miracle and a mystery; midway through his story he suggests the whisper of an answer.  After we have walked with him through  the cold and filthy streets of Limerick, suffered with him through the  senseless deaths of several siblings, felt the cruel indignities of  frostbite and fleabite and hunger and mean-ness of human spirit, he posits  an intriguing and hopeful suggestion.  In the hospital recovering from a  near-fatal brush with Typhoid, he shares a brief friendship with a fellow  patient who introduces him to great literature.  Lost in the delicious  escape of poetry, he comments, "'Twas a lovely thing to discover that  they couldn't mess with the inside of your head."  At the end of this  memoir, stepping off the boat onto US soil, a companion exclaims what a  great country this is.  In the one-word ending chapter, McCourt replies to  his friend simply, "'Tis."  Angela's Ashes leaves the reader with  an indelible experience of enslavement to classism, poverty, disease, and  hunger, but it leaves us with an even larger question:  Can we fully and  truly and responsibly inhabit a land of freedom, plenty, and opportunity?   The reader, left breathlessly waiting for the answer to be found in the  sequel to this astounding book might do well also to look within.
