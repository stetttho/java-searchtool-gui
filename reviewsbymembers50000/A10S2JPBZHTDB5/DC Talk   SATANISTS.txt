 I used to listen to these guys when I was young and went to church. After "Free At Last" was released, I stopped listening to them. I came back after this CD was given to me as a gift. I listened to "My  Friend" about 20 times in a row...it's REALLY  good."Supernatural" is very good as well.  BUT, in the song,  CONSUME ME, at 4 mins and 3 sec into the song, Mike says, and I QUOTE,  "I'm consumed with SATAN." It can be VERY clearly heard. With a  step into mainstream music, and songs that talk about God less, one has to  wonder if DC Talk isnt just in it for the money anymore. The older stuff  was more genuine, but, releasing singles and things...I have heard about a  lot of Christian bands being confidentially satanist. AND THINK ABOUT IT:  Does ANYONE know who the song "My Friend" was written for. It  contains referances to a former christian who has changed his music and  stopped talking about God in order to be more mainstream...to get in the  top 40 and also to get "A video on VH1." It also says "Never  thought I'd see your light begin to fade." Maybe DC talk is talking  about themselves, since EVERY REFERANCE to the mysterious former  "christian" ALSO applies to the Band. AND a lyric says  "We'll see you some day" meaning they will be that way or reveal  themselves as fake someday just like the object of their song. There is  also pictures of the band looking to be dead on the inside cover.  I hope  so bad that DC talk isnt satanists. They are the only band that I like that  I consider to be clean and Godly.  ANYONE who has noticed this or can  counter me, I BEG OF YOU E-MAIL ME AT CORNDWELLER@HOTMAIL.COM
