 No. 4 doesn't contain as many hits as their first three albums. It isn't as heavy as "Core," it isn't as catchy as "Purple," it  isn't as ambitious as "Tiny Music...". So, how is it their  best? At first, it isn't. I'm sure you've read it takes time to like the  album, and it's true. But after a while, you start to like it...then love  it...then think of it as one of your best CDs you own.  This album is  magical, mysterious , dark, isolated, angry, offhand, powerful, regretful,  psychedelic and hypnotising. All in all, it has to be the best album of  1999. VERY, VEEERY underrated. It's hard to pick a best song.  "Down" and "Sour Girl" were both huge top ten hits, and  they couldn't be more different sounding. "Down" is among the  heaviest songs STP ever did (with absolutely AMAZING vocals), and  "Sour Girl" is a catchy 60s-esque pop tune with a cool, weird  video. But the singles aren't the stars on this  album... "Atlanta" has got to be the most enchanting, amazzing  song I have ever heard. The bridge (that shows Scott's ever increasng vocal  range) will get you HIGH. Well, not really, but it's the closest thing to  it naturally... Every song works great together here, like it's a concept  album. "Pruno" could be a hit single if it were  released..."Church On Tuesday" is a catchy little pop song that's  instantly enjoyable..."No Way Out" is an intense, angry, mournful  song about hatred for heroin and what it was doing to Scott at the  time..."Sex and Violence" is a heavy, catchy rocker that is  likely the next single..."Glide" is a great song after a while,  adding more pschidelia to the album..."I Got You" was my favorite  the first time I listened to this CD, it's a Countryish pop rocker with a  great acoustic solo..."MC5" is a short, heavy rock song with a  kick *ss drum line. Buy this album. If at first you don't like it...don't  sell it to a CD shop. Keep it. It will get better. I know for a fact.
