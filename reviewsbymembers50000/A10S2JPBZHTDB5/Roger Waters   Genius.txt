 Since their Barrett-dominated debut, Roger Waters had grown extensivley as a songwriter, and it is shown here. He is the main writer for this album's  best songs, and his ambition only grew for Floyd's next album, "The  Wall". This album is magic, mysterious, faceless, psychedelic, and  the lyrics are unbelievable. Songs like "Time," "Money"  and "Brain Damage/Eclipse" are rock radio staples. While most  Pink Floyd fans give most of the credit to David Gilmour and say that  Waters was ruining the band, PF would not be famous today if it hadn't been  for Roger Waters' incredible songwriting. Aside from his great lyrics and  harmonies, he also is very underrated as a bass player, and in my opinion  is Pink Floyd's best musician. "Piper At the Gates..." is the  most interesting album by Pink Floyd, really because of Syd Barrett's  mysterious psyche-pop and the story that goes with him, a genius songwriter  himself. To say this album is better than that is wrong...Syd's Pink Floyd  and Roger's Pink Floyd might as well be two different bands. Both are  equally impressive in their own ways. But DSOTM is a million times more  known than PATGOD, make of that what you will.  Roger Waters was able to  keep Floyd interesting after Barrett's ousting. People who say Waters was  ruining Floyd make no sense: listen to any post-Waters album and you'll  know that they lost something really good in Roger Waters. He reinvented  the band when the first leader was fired, and then when he was asked to  leave himself David Gilmour was unable to reinvent the band so therefor the  only valuable Pink Floyd albums (in my opinion) are those written by  Barrett and Waters.  This one stands as one of Pink Floyd's best. All of  the songs are relaxing, with nice bass lines and great guitar work by  Gilmour. An instant classic that spent over 25 years on the charts.
