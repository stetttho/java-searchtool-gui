 This album is pathetic. The music sounds old and uninspired, the lyrics are the worst string of cliches I have seen this year...and the VOCALS. Don't get me started. I really tried to like this band. But this music is just so fake. Couple that with the fact that Mark Tremonti did an interview and openly bashed the bands Creed rips off (Nirvana, Pearl Jam) and going so far as to say Scott Stapp barely sounds like Eddie Vedder...it's all too much. I don't only dislike this band...I *hate* it. I LOATHE this cheap excuse for grunge. And you can go ahead and click this review was not helpful. It's not that I'm trying to put down fans of this sound...I just want to say, if you like Creed's sound, and it's new to you...check out bands like Stone Temple Pilots, Alice In Chains and Pearl Jam. Those bands are Creed with better music, lyrics, singers and most of all...they have real emotion.
