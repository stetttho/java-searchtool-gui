 I was having a terrible day and I came upstairs to go to bed and noticed the unopened Amazon box.  This was a frivolous purchase and I was going to send it back, but the book is so original and beautiful, not to mention a good guide to making balloon hats. The authors went to far away places (Russia, Vietman, Kenya, Indian, Japan, just to name a few and made big beautiful hats for the people there and took pictures of them in them.  It put a smile on my face just looking at the book!  There are some excellent instructions with great pictures as well.  I highly recommend this book for its instructions and originality!
