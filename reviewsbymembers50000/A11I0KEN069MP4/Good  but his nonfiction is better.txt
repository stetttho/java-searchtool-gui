 I loved Richard Prestons 2 nonfiction books, THE HOT ZONE (which I stayed up all night and read, could not put down) and THE DEMON IN THE FREEZER. Preston did, however, weave some reality (UNSCOM among others)into the narrative, but when I know this is made up, it just does not have the power to grab you and make you stay up all night.  I just think when it comes to this kind of thing, truth is scarier than fiction.
