 I read this book in one day, and I had spent the week before reading parts of Book 5, where I beleived some crucial clues to Book Six were.  The first five books seemed to me to progress in some kind of coherent pattern, as if the author had the whole set written in her head up to that point.  This book however, seems as if it was almost written by someone else.  Almost all of the questions that came up in book 5 were either not answered or rendered moot by this completely new path the series has taken. I enjoyed the book but I have to say that the ending was a disappointment to me and I do not see how every lose end can be tied up in one final book.
