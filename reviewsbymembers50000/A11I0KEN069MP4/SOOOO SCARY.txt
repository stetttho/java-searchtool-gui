 I did not think I was going to like this book because it was written before 9-11 and therefore I thought was out-of-date.  UNTRUE!  Although this book concentrates on biological warfare and not on airplanes used as missiles, there were people warning about terrorists making an attack on this nation long before it happened.  I live near Houston and the first chapter describes a hypothetical scenario that was played out by the military involving some people from the Iraqi government holding hostages at Bush International Airport and dousing them with several biological agents.  In a few days, the city of Houston was reduced to martial law according to the forecasts.  It gave me chills.  This is a very good book if you want to know what our enemies can do without using airplanes to crash into buildings.
