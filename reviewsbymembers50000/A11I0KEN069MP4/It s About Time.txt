 Finally someone is trying to tell the story of the real Hillary Clinton.  Sadly, I believe that he is preaching to the choir. No one who needs to read this book (i.e. -those who beleive in the "vast right wing conspiracy") would ever buy it. One of the most telling items is a story that I have heard several people try and clarify, including Mr. Morris, but which the Clintons continue to tell and the public continues to take as gospel.  I am referring to the story that Hillary Rodhams mother named her after Sir Edmund Hillary, the man who was the first person to reach the top of Mount Everest.  Mrs. Clinton conveniently overlooks the fact that Sir Edmund was not famous at the time of her birth and did not make his famous climb until she was about six years old. How do they manage to keep getting away with that? This is a VERY revealing book about Mrs. Clinton and also gives the reader some insights into the former President as well.  Definitely worth a look.
