 I was randomly searching Amazon one day looking for something interesting to read and I came across this book completely by accident.  I ordered it and have read it at least twice all the way through.  Farquhar's dry wit and the contents of the stories (although there is no proof to the legend that Catherine the Great "loved" her horses as much as is often told, there are other stories of her life that are stranger than any fiction) make this book a "must read".  I only wish he would write a sequel!
