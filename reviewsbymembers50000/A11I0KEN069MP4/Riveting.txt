 There are not really words to describe this documentary.  The first time I watched it (when it originally aired) I don't think I blinked.  I cried like a baby that time and when I watched the DVD, but I thought this was an important piece of history that I would like to have to show my son (who was 3 at the time of the attacks) what it was like - and also to remind myself.  It is well done.  I especially liked the fact that these 2 brothers who filmed what was originally a documentary on rookie firefighters did not go for the lurid - you can hear the sounds of bodies falling, but they are not shown.  One of the brothers states that someone to the right of him was screaming and on fire when he first entered the lobby of the Trade Center, but he did not think it was proper to film.  The brothers did not capitalize on the horror of the situation to make money.  This is by far the most complete and most compelling piece on September 11 I have seen.
