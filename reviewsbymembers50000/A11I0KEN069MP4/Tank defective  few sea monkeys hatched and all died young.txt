 I bought this for my son for Christmas and became way more interested in it than he did.  I followed the directions exactly, but I only got a few to hatch and they died within a couple of days (yes, I aerated the tank and did not overfeed).  My sea monkeys never got anywhere near as large as the ones in the customer images.  One possible reason for this is that the light would not stay lit.  Every time I put in new batteries the light would only last a couple of hours. I tried at least four sets of batteries before I gave up. I will probably try again, but I would not buy this particular tank because I believe that the light was defective.  I suggest another tank, but I think every kid should have sea monkeys at least once in their lifetime.
