 One of the interesting things about this book is that the author, being a former CIA agent, has to run anything he plans to publish past the CIA and let them "blackline" it.  These blacklines are left in the book, so you can see what the CIA thought was important to delete, which, surpisingly, isn't much.  There are a lot of names and dates in here that are not deleted, and a lot of information that you would never know if you just watched the news.  This book was a fascinating look into the CIA and the changes created by politics, mistakes, and differing opinions of the CIA's mission.
