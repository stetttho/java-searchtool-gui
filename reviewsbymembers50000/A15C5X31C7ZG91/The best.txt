 This is simply the most comprehensive attempt ever to develop a Christian theory of the state. Approaching the issue from a Reformed perspective, Hall divides the book into three sections. In the first, he provides an  overview of the history of Christian political thought, examining thinkers  like Augustine and Aquinas, but also exploring the impact of secularists  like Machiavelli. The second section is a comprehensive look at what the  Bible has to say about the state and its power and functions. Virtually  every passage is covered here. The final section deals with politics and  the Christian on an issue by issue basis: welfare, slavery, taxation,  democracy, etc. This is a long book with small print but very rewarding  to those who make the effort.
