 Charles Ryrie gives an able defense of classical dispensationalism. He  begins with an overview of the idea of dispensations and provides a new and  revised definition of the term as well as Biblical justification for the  use of the word. Dispensationalism is a help, not a heresy, as its  opponents have often uncharitably characterized it. Ryrie goes on to  outline and defend the dispensationalist view on the following  topics: the logic of seven dispensations the need for a literal  hermeneutic the plan of salvation under the Law and under Grace the  distinction between Israel and the Church pretribulational, premillennial  eschatology Other chapters include an account of dispensationalism's  origins and a defense against the charges of recency and divisiveness.  Ryrie also provides three chapters dealing with dispensationalism's  opponents: 1) progressive dispensationalism, which bears a remarkable  resemblance to Laddian historic premillennialism, 2) covenant theology, and  3) ultradispensationalism.
