 This is a classic expression of kerygmatic theology and realized eschatology. Dodd attempts to cull from the early apostolic preaching as related in Acts the key points of the Gospel. From there, he examines the 4  Gospels and the Pauline Literature, noting the developments and  modifications which the kerygma underwent. In my opinion, Dodd has a  one-sided, and therefore inadequate, concept of the kingdom. This leads him  to deem as inauthentic any canonical literature which does not accord with  his realized eschatology. More recent studies, though, have basically  settled on a synthesis of Dodd and Schweitzer, opting to explain the  apostolic view of the kingdom in terms of inaugurated eschatology. Dodd is  also rather affected by the critical scholarship of his day and the  optimistic positivism so rampant then. But today, there are few sureties in  the field of New Testament studies. Nevetheless, this book is essential to  an understanding of critical scholarship and the apostolic preaching.
