 Schreiner here provides an excellent overview of the key interpretive issues surrounding the Pauline Epistles. He covers genre, intent, coherence, and much more. Perhaps the most helpful chapters are 5 and 6,  where he outlines an exegetical method based on analysis of the sentence  structure and the structure of the discourse as a whole. His method of  tracing the argument is fine for those just beginning Greek exegesis, but  more advanced students will want to consult Cotterell and Turner's work on  Linguistics and Biblical Interpretation. Schreiner's categories are too  limited and not sufficiently nuanced. His understanding of syntax and  semantic structure is limited compared to more recent advances in the  field. Still, on the whole, a great introduction to exegetical method  with a view to the Pauline Epistles.
