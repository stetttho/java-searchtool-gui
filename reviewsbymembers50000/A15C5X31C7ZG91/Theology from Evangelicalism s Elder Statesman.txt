 This slim volume is made up of four lectures Henry delivered in a 1989  tour of Scotland. Demonstrating the truth of Christianity's truth claims  has served as the driving passion of Henry's life and work and these  addresses have the same focus. Chapter One sets the tone with an overview  of the current state of philosophy, theology and apologetics -- in Henry's  opinion, all dominated by an underappreciation for the central Christian  concept of rational propositional revelation. Chapter Two deals with the  controverisal subject of presuppositions and their role in theology and  apologetics. Henry is a dedicated presuppositionalist of the Gordon Clark  variety and proffers what he sees as a via media between fideism and  evidentialism. Chapter Three presents the two basic axioms or  presuppositions of Christian theology: ontologically, eternal God as  trinity; epistemologically, the Bible as propositional revelation. Chapter  Four continues this theme as it traces the downgrade trends in contemporary  theology towards irrationalism and offers a critique of its premiere  purveyor - neo-orthodoxy. Altogether, these lectures provide an excellent  introduction to the thought of the foremost spokesman for evangelicalism in  the 20th century. One could wish he had spent a bit more time speaking to  the postmodern condition rather than beating the long-dead horse of logical  positivism. The recurring emphasis on warrant and the like similarly  betrays a dependence on outmoded foundationalist concepts of rationality.  Nonetheless, most of what he says is right on target.
