 Strathern has a real gift for "putting the cookies on the lowest shelf." Unfortunately, with a thinker of the complexity of Wittgenstein, that can often lead to shallowness. This book suffers more  from its narrowness of scope, though. While its biographical aspects are  complete, its description of Wittgenstein's philosophy focuses almost  entirely on the Tractatus, only mentioning briefly his later developments  of linguistic theory, which more than anything else he produced has  influenced postmodernism. In fact, I don't recall ever seeing the term  "language game" used in the book! Nevertheless, because the book  requires such a minimal investment of time, it is probably a good place to  start. Just don't end there.
