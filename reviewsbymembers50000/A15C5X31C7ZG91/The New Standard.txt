 Robert Reymond deserves hearty thanks and congratulations from every Christian for this, his magnum opus, a 1210 page wonder of the theological world. Unabashedly Reformed in perspective, Reymond attacks each problem  from historical, biblical, and systematic viewpoints, providing  descriptions of the major positions and then unrelentingly demonstrating  the superiority of his position. To a large extent he succeeds. There is  enough ammo here to win any theological battle in which you might find  yourself engaged. With Reymond on your side, you can easily prooftext your  opponent into oblivion! This is no naive scripture-positivism, though.  Reymond interacts extensively with a wide spectrum of views, especially  neo-orthodoxy and liberal theology. Don't expect to find him addressing  feminist, liberation, or postmodern theologies, however. The following is  a summary of his positions on the key issues: Unifying Theme:  Covenant Apologetics: presuppositionalist Bible:  inerrantist Eschatology: inaugurated eschatology  (amillennialist) Ecclesiology: Presbyterian Sacramentalist Soteriology:  Supralapsarian Calvinist Anthropology: Dichotomist Helpful extras  include appendices on canonicity, modern Christology, the 5 points of  Calvinism, and Romans 7. A major bonus is the extensive annotated  bibliography. If you are a bookhound like me, avert your eyes from those  pages, lest your pockets surely be emptied!
