 Vanhoozer has written the definitive evangelical response to postmodern  literary theory. In this book, which is about 500 pages of small print,  Vanhoozer analyzes the deconstruction of the author, the text, and the  reader, and then provides a Christian reconstruction of the three centered  around an Augustinian hermeneutic of charity and recognition of God as  ultimate author. Vanhoozer is no slouch when it comes to linguistics,  philosophy, literary theory, and their intersection in postmodern  hermeneutics. He recruits the insights of Searle, Austin, Ricoeur, Gadamer,  Hirsch, and yes, even Derrida, in his examination of the present confusion.  Best of all, he shows remarkable skill in packing all this esoterica into  readable and understandable prose.
