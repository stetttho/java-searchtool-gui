 Contemporary theology is perhaps irretrievably balkanized and this collection reflects that. From Carl Henry's conservative evangelicalism to the mujerista liberationism of Isasi-Diaz, there's something here for  everybody.  Badham's chapter at the beginning is an excellent survey of  the contemporary theological landscape, perfect for those just getting  acquainted with the current atmosphere.  The book has six sections: 1.  Introduction, 2. Evangelicalism, 3. Postliberalism, 4. Liberalism, 5.  Liberationism/Feminism, 6. Deconstructionism.  Notable essays include those of John Cobb, John Hick, Carl Henry, Clark Pinnock,  Stanley Hauerwas, and Thomas Oden.
