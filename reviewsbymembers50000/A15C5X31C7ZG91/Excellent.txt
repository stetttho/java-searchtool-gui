 This is an entertaining account of a skeptical journalist who spent a semester as a student at the staunchly evangelical/fundamentalist Criswell College. Bryan tells of his encounters with:                                               - Paige Patterson, now president of Southwestern Seminary but then the head of Criswell, various `Green Berets' - very evangelistic students - who did their darnedest to win him to Christ  - Jim Parker, the philosophical ethics prof, who presented the intellectual case for Christianity                        - Danny Akin, now president at Southeastern Seminary, then theology prof at Criswell, who taught Bryan the evangelical view of the Bible and Biblical doctrine   In the process, Bryan sat through numerous chapels and evangelistic meetings, met hundreds of believers and heard their stories, attended a preaching conference in Florida, and tagged along on a missionary trip to civil war-torn El Salvador.  Throughout this fascinating book, a journal of sorts, really, Bryan gives a sketchy autobiography of his disbelief. In the end, Bryan, though challenged mightily by the witness of the sold-out Criswellians, chooses to remain in his comfortable `soft agnosticism.' He makes this decision ultimately not because of intellectual difficulties - indeed, he couldn't come close to answering Dr. Parker's attacks on atheism/naturalism - but because he cherishes his current lifestyle -- what he calls the lifestyle of "frozen margaritas and R-rated movies."  Bryan is surprisingly objective and very generous in his portrayal of Criswell and the Christianity represented by its students and faculty. It is obvious to any reader that he enjoyed his time there and learned quite a bit as well.   Altogether, a good read.
