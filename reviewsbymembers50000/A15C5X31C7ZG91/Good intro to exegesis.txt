 Carson designed this work to be a textbook for seminarians and to serve as  an introduction for budding exegetes. Anyone with a basic knowledge of the  Bible and the biblical languages has probably found himself wincing on  Sunday morning as a deacon or Sunday School teacher, or even the pastor,  takes a verse out of context or mangles the original intent of the author.  Such mistakes are simply inexcusable, for teachers of the Word ought to  take utmost care in handling the text. Souls are in the balance. Carson's  Exegetical Fallacies, though only 150 pages long, fires a powerful volley  in the battle against exegetical imprecision. Carson covers word-study  fallacies, grammatical fallacies, logical fallacies, and presuppositional  fallacies, giving examples of each and demonstrating the errors of  each. This book serves its purpose well and is excellent for both trained  ministers and laymen. Read it and you will never listen to a sermon in the  same way again.
