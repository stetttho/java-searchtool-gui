 The Millennial Maze provides a helpful and readable introduction to  eschatology, the study of the last things or the end times. Grenz  introduces his work with a brief biographical section where he recounts how  he became interested in and realized the importance of eschatology.  Although he grew up in classical dispensationalism, in seminary he moved  first to historic premillennialism and then to amillennialism. After this  introduction, Grenz makes a brief foray into historical theology, giving an  overview of the various changes and developments in eschatology throughout  church history. He then proceeds to outline the four major eschatological  theories: Postmillennialism, Dispensationalism, Historic Premillennialism,  and Amillennialism, including the criticisms that each school of thought  has for the other three and what Grenz sees as the shortcomings of each.  The final two chapters present Grenz's view on the significance of  eschatology for the Christian church and its work in this world. This is a  valuable and fairly objective analysis of contemporary options in  eschatology. My only criticism is that I wish it would have dealt more with  the growing optimistic amillennialism/partial preterism that Gentry,  Chilton, North, and Sproul have endorsed. Overall, though, Grenz's work  deals well with the key themes that are common to all eschatology:  hermeneutics, philosophy of history, and the nature of the kingdom.
