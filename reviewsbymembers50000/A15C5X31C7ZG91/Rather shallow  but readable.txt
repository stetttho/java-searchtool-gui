 Schlatter was one of the foremost Biblical theologians of his day. With  his academic excellence and intellectual rigor, he earned the respect of  his more liberal peers, even though he contradicted them on almost every  point. Neuer's biography of Schlatter recounts his childhood, his education  at Basle and Tubingen, his ministry, and his teaching career at Bern,  Berlin, and finally at Tubingen. Schlatter was born and grew up a pietist,  but in college, when he was exposed to the philosophies of Hegel and Kant  and their intellectual challenges to his faith, he came to see the  shortcomings of his upbringing. His teaching career could be viewed as an  effort to move pietism toward a more intelligent, but no less reverent,  faith. In his later years, books poured forth from his pen, including a  New Testament Theology, an Ethics, a Dogmatics, a Metaphysics, and a  complete commentary of the New Testament. These works are just now being  translated into English and are increasingly serving as an excellent  resource for American evangelical theologians. This biography is  well-written and easy to read, but one could hope that it had included more  information on Schlatter's views, especially his interaction with his  contemporaries. Appendices to this volume include essays by Schlatter on  prayer, method in NT Theology, and atheistic methods in theology.
