 This is a very in-depth and thorough treatment of Ephesians. Lincoln devotes a lot of space to: rhetorical analysis, describing the syntactical and discourse structure, the use of the OT, and dependence on Colossians.  By far, the most satisfying aspect of the commentary is the constant reference to what has gone before in the letter. This helps the reader maintain a clear picture of the overall argument and flow of the letter. It does create a little bit of overlap, though, between the various sections of the commentary (Form/Comment/Explanation). That is more the fault of the WBC layout, however. Lincoln is very mainstream in his exegesis and cautious in his interpretive judgments. He shows no signs of having a theological axe to grind or a system to impose on the text. A good example would be his interpretation of the household code. He doesn't try to "reform" the text by making it more palatable to our egalitarian age. He lets the author speak for himself. One disappointing feature of the book is Lincoln's insistence that Ephesians is deutero-Pauline. For those of us who believe that Paul was more stylistically flexible than modern scholars give him credit for being, Lincoln's arguments will not have much force. At times, too, he falls prey to the "contradiction behind every bush" mentality which is overzealous in its attempts to portray Ephesians in opposition to the "genuine" Paul.
