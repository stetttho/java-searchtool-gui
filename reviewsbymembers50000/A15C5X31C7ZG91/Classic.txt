 Bainton's classic is still a great pick for the scholar, pastor or layman interested in his spiritual heritage. Erasmus was perhaps only a little less well known than Luther during the Reformation. While he ultimately  maintained a semblance of loyalty to the Roman church, he was always a  compatriot at heart with Luther and his movement. Bainton presents the  facts with the touch of a master, weaving together the various strands of  Erasmus life -- linguist, satirist, theologian, classicist -- into a  coherent picture that allows the reader to come away feeling as if he had  spent a day with the great humanist himself. It would be best to have a  rough idea of Reformation history under your belt before reading Bainton.  He takes for granted a familiarity with the general events and characters  of the 16th century. Two complaints: First, Bainton fails to devote  enough attention to the content of the theological debates (especially  Luther vs. Erasmus) in which Erasmus was continually embroiled. Second, the  extensive quotations throughout the book often seemed extraneous.  While  not as compelling as Bainton's _Here I Stand_, _Erasmus of Christendom_ is  still a standard work in Erasmus studies and a worthwhile read for those  interested in Church History.
