 Encountering the OT This is an excellent text for a survey class in college or high school. Full of charts, pictures, and other layout features, it looks fluffy at first glance, but it covers all the major  issues. Comes with a CD that has nicely presented summaries of the  chapters, quizzes over the outline of the book/s, and a glossary of terms.  One nice feature on the CD, along with the audio glossary (aids correct  pronunciation of difficult words), is the video introduction to each book.  Two complaints: first, the section on the minor prophets is far too brief  to yield meaningful information or encourage retention. Second, the CD's  quizzes could have been much more helpful and really made the CD a valuable  addition. Hopefully, future additions will find both of the shortcomings  remedied. Overall, this is a perfect textbook for Generation X.
