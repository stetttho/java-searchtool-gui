 Schreiner's work provides a good response to the New Perspective on Paul and the Law which has swept NT studies over the past fifteen or so years. He approaches the problem from a modified Lutheran standpoint. Schreiner  begins with an overview of the state of NT scholarship on Paul and the Law.  He focuses on the impact of Sanders and Dunn, but also takes into account  the earlier views of Schweizer and Davies and the more recent contributions  of Laato, Westerholm, and Thielman, as well as the Reconstructionists. He  then explores the issues of: the meaning of 'nomos' in Paul; why the works  of the Law can't save; the purpose of the law; the temporary nature of the  Mosaic covenant; the fulfillment of the law by Christians; and Paul and  justification by works. He concludes with a brief sketch of other NT  writers on the Law. Schreiner ably defends the position that Paul was (at  least in part) addressing Jewish legalism, that he almost always refers to  the Mosaic law by 'nomos', that Christians fulfill the Law by the power of  the Spirit, and that works are necessary for final salvation. Works of the  Law cannot save because no one keeps the Law perfectly, he  contends. Highly recommended.
