 This is a great compilation of essays from the top evangelical biblical scholars. Highlights include: - Greg Beale on eschatology as the chief interpretive framework in Biblical hermeneutics - Daniel Block on Gog and  Magog in Ezekiel - Ben Witherington on Paul and Imminence - Alan Garrow on  interpreting Revelation - Earle Ellis advocating annihilationism - Richard  Bauckham rebutting Moltmann's millenarianism - Stephen Williams provides an  overview of the work in eschatology in the past 30 years Overall, there  is enough here to keep any student of biblical studies satisfied for a good  while. Even though many of the essays are unconvincing (Beale and Ellis for  example) they are nonetheless stimulating and enjoyable.
