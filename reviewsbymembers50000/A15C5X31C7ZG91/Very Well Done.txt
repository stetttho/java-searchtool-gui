 Roundtable is entertaining, insightful, and thought-provoking. It is a  series of interviews with the foremost Christian theologians in Europe,  from a variety of traditions. Among others, Jurgen Moltmann, Wolfhart  Pannenberg, Dorothee Solle, Thomas Torrance, Alister McGrath, and John  Macquarrie are included. Each theologian answers the following questions:  What is a good life, and what good is life? What is a good death, and what  good is death? What things have made you doubt, and how have you handled  them? Do you have any regrets? How would you describe God? What is a human  being? What is the most perfect creed the church has ever written and why  do you think so? What are you proudest of, or what has given you the most  satisfaction? If you could ask any theologian of any time or place just one  question, whom would you ask and what would you ask? From the Trinitarian  focus of Kallistos Ware to Moltmann's theology of hope, from the liberation  theology of Solle to the traditional evangelicalism of McGrath, this volume  is a microcosm of the contemporary theological world. It will whet your  appetite and provide an incentive to read more contemporary theology.  American evangelicals must escape their fundamentalist ghetto and open  their minds to the extraordinary insights of some of their contemporaries.  Evangelicals should understand that interaction does not equal compromise.  We need not tie ourselves to the mast of fundamentalist ignorance in order  to escape the siren song of liberalism. There is a via media. Reading  Roundtable is a good way to begin an American theological renaissance.
