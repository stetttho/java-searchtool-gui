 Adam has provided students of preaching with a solid theological  foundation for preaching. He begins with the doctrine of revelation, the  inspiration of the written word, and the command to preach the word.  From  these three principles, Adam draws a wealth of practical advice. His model  of preaching is taken from the apostolic proclamation in Acts and the  exposition of Scripture in the epistles. All of this is supplemented by  insights from church history -- namely, the examples of Richard Baxter and  John Calvin. Every minister of God's word will profit from Adam's  explorations.
