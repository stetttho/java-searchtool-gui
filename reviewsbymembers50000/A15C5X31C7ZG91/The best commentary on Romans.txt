 This is certainly the best commentary now available on the book of Romans. Schreiner expertly unearths the flow of Paul's argument and presents a clear and logical exposition of the Apostle's magnum opus. Schreiner is  Calvinistic and argues persuasively for this view, especially in his  section on Romans 9-11. He is usually within the bounds of Protestant  tradition, and all of his exegesis is characterized by careful attention to  context and linguistic-structural aspects. Schreiner is to be commended  for this highly readable, yet comprehensive study of Romans.
