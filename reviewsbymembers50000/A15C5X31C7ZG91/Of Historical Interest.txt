 Let me begin by making it clear that if you want to learn about Pauline  Eschatology, this is NOT the book to read. . . . which doesn't mean that  you shouldn't read it. Because it was published in 1930, it has several  disadvantages. First, Vos writes in the old style - very long paragraphs  and sentences. His chapters do not systematically address the issues;  rather, they spiral into his view by a circuitous and often laborious  route. Second, Vos is unable to interact with the recent developments in  Pauline studies, especially with regard to the law, resurrection, etc. This  is of course not Vos' fault, but it is something of which the reader should  be aware. This book is great if you are historically inclined and want to  trace the development of inaugurated eschatology from its beginnings with  Vos. But, don't stop here. Go ahead and read Ladd, Ridderbos, Cullmann,  Dodd, Beasley-Murray, and Fee. One last note: Vos' chapter on 'Chiliasm'  is very unconvincing. He begins it by accusing pre-millenarians of  psychological instability! Good for a laugh, anyway.
