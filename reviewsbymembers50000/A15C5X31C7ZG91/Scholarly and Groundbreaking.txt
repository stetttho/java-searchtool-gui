 Those familiar with McGrath's set, Iustitia Dei, know what to expect in this book: careful documentation, well-reasoned argumentation, and dry-as-bones writing style. Nevertheless, Luther's Theology of the Cross is  a substantial and groundbreaking contribution to Luther studies. McGrath  traces Luther's movement from a theologian of the via moderna to a  theologian of the cross, recounting the step by step transformation that  occurred through Luther's prolonged pondering and studious research on the  concepts of iustitia Dei, fides Christi, iustitia fidei. Along the way,  McGrath analyzes Luther's role in the Reformation and encourages an end to  attempts to pinpoint Luther's so-called 'breakthrough'. The final two  chapters are the most insightful as they outline Luther's theologia crucis  and describe the historical impact of the doctrine. Overall, this is a  detailed and scholarly piece of historical theology which should be of  interest to anyone in the field of Reformation studies.
