 This book gets 5 stars simply for daring to do what few have ever thought possible.  Linnemann was a respected NT scholar in the tradition of Bultmann before the Holy Spirit radically saved her.  Now she teaches the  Bible in Indonesia, presumably in a missionary capacity.  This book  represents her effort to prove the literary independence of the Synoptic  Gospels.  While it may not reach the level of "proof" (whatever  that word means in our postmodern times), it does demonstrate that one can  hold to independence and still be a rigorous scholar. The book has 4 main  sections.  First, Linnemann excoriates contemporary historical-critical  scholarship for its circular reasoning, fanciful speculation, utter  disregard for Occam's razor, and total disrespect for church tradition and  the gospel writers.  It's always good to be reminded of how little evidence  many NT scholars have for their claim.  The second section is the key part.   Linnemann provides a statistical analysis of the Synoptics and the extent  of their agreements and disagreements.  The chapter on vocabulary is  especially convincing.  As a whole this section makes it clear that the  similarities between the Gospels have been vastly overestimated.  Part 3  discusses the possible explanations for the writing of the Synoptics apart  from literary dependence.  Especially striking is the support that  Linnemann gathers from early church tradition for literary independence.   Part 4 concludes with some thoughts on hermeneutics in light of literary  independence. While this book will undoubtedly be ignored by the  establishment, it should receive a hearing, especially in those sections of  evangelicalism which have felt compelled to cater to the liberal-critical  scholarship that controls NT studies.
