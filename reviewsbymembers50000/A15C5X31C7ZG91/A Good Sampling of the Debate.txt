 This is a collection of essays presented in lecture form at the 1995 Wheaton Theology Conference concerning prospects for a consensus between evangelicals and postliberals. It largely succeeds in outlining the areas of agreement between the two. The differences, though, are still substantial.  Postliberals reject inerrancy, a correspondence theory of truth, and the concept of propositional revelation. Largely dependent upon the writings of Karl Barth, its founders (Frei and Lindbeck) stress the narrative quality of the Biblical account and (borrowing from Wittgenstein) describe the church as a language game where doctrines function as grammatical rules.  Because of their dependence on the cultural-linguistic model of theology, they tend to be anti-realist in their metaphysics. The Bible is a narrative that serves as a way to organize, relate to, and explain an otherwise inchoate reality.  Postliberals are antifoundationalist and therefore see systematic apologetics as a misguided task. They prefer an `ad hoc' apologetic, not bound by an adherence to method, but engaging in a dialogue with the unbeliever. They stress the internal coherence of the Biblical narrative, and the need for theology to be done within the believing community.  The essays are uneven in quality, frustratingly repetitious at times, but generally well-written and helpful. The best of the bunch are Hensley on Postliberalism and Antirealism, Clapp on Evangelicalism and Foundationalism, and Kenneson on Postliberal Theology and the Possibility of Change.
