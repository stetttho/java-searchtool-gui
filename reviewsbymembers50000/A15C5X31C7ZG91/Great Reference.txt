 I love the set of reference works that Elwell has edited and this one doesn't break the streak. For anyone interested in 20th century evangelical theology, this is a must. It covers T. Zahn, A. Schlatter, G. Vos, A. T.  Robertson, A. W. Pink, O. T. Allis, N. Stonehouse, E. J. Young, F. F.  Bruce, G. E. Ladd, Leon Morris, John Wenham, Donald Guthrie, Walter Kaiser,  Gordon Fee, Edwin Yamauchi, D. A. Carson, and N. T. Wright. All the  chapters are well written, include a bio and a helpful summary of each  scholar's theology.
