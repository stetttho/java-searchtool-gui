 Just as Christians were beginning to get used to modernity, along came  postmodernity and confused them once again with its new and unusual  challenges to theology and evangelism and its seemingly great opportunities  for the same. Lakeland begins his work by describing postmodern philosophy,  especially as it relates to culture. He describes three typical strands of  postmodernism: Ultramoderns completely embrace the project of  deconstruction and are more the outgrowth of than the rejection of  modernity. Conservative postmoderns embrace some of the changes  postmodernism brings but still believe in the basic rightness of the modern  project. Countermoderns embrace some tenets of postmodernism but only as a  way to return to a premodern sensibility. Lakeland then outlines these  three positions as they apply to religion in the postmodern age. He ends  with a chapter on apologetics in the postmodern age, especially as  apologetics relates to the problem of pluralism. I believe Lakeland has  correctly classified the three streams of thought in postmodern philosophy  and insofar as his book engages in descriptive analysis of these three  groups, it excels. Lakeland goes wrong when he enters the normative realm  and attempts to lay out a role for the church and Christianity in the  postmodern world. It becomes apparent that Lakeland has no real solutions  to offer other than radical pluralism under the guise of avoiding the  totalizing tendency of metanarratives. His plan for apologetics entails  nothing less than the total compromise of the uniqueness of the Christian  faith. What use is apologetics if you have no faith to defend? Thus  Lakeland demonstrates the self-destructive tendencies of postmodernism when  it becomes nothing more than a code word for relativism. Nonetheless,  this slim volume (120 pgs.) does provide a good introduction to postmodern  philosophy, culture, and theology. It is also well written and easy to  read.
