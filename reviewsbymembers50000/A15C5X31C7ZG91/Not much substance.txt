 I was pretty disappointed with this book, because I was expecting a thorough investigation of Paul's Pharasaism, use of rabbinic exegesis, keeping of the law, etc. Instead, Young spends most of his time simply asserting that Paul was a Jew and remained a Torah-observant Jew his whole life. There is hardly any attempt at establishing an exegetical foundation. He does not look in any detail at Phil 3, Rom 9-11, or any of the other obviously important texts. This is such a fertile area in scholarship right now that Young's book truly pales in comparison with the work currently being done by others, not to mention even the previous contributions of Davies and Sanders, etc.
