 Bierma is an expert on covenant theology and its history. This is his work on the covenant theology of Caspar Olevianus, a German theologian in the confessional era. Bierma explores the development of covenant theology  from Zwingli and Calvin to their successors: Beza, Bullinger, Ursinus. The  last half of the book corrects the mistakes made in previous scholarship on  Olevianus and provides an outline of his concept of the covenant. The  reading can be tedious sometimes as the book is dealing with minute details  in a somewhat obscure historical figure's theology. Most of the footnotes  are in Latin or German. This book is not for the typical layman, but if  you are interested in historical theology, especially of the Reformed  tradition, then you might enjoy it.
