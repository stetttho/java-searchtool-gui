 This compilation of essays on Paul and his theology, especially as it was influenced by his Damascus road experience, is well done, covers all the important issues in Pauline theology (eschatology, christology, ethics,  law, women, spirit), and includes contributions from an impressive lineup  of evangelical heavyweights. Notable are the chapters by I. H. Marshall  (eschatology), James Dunn (justification), Stephen Westerholm (law), Seyoon  Kim (reconciliation), Gordon Fee (spirit), and Judith Gundry-Volf  (women). This collection would serve adequately as an introduction to  Pauline theology.
