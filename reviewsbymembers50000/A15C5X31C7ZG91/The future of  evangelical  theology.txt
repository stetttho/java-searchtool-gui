 Well, if you want to see where evangelical theology is going, this is the  book to read. Grenz certainly deserves credit for his constant presence on  the cutting edge of theological developments. Here he presents his  "fresh agenda" for theology in the 21st century. One thing is  clear: Grenz is evangelical in name only. The theology he lays out would  better be labeled 'post-evangelical' because he rejects almost every sacred  tenet of evangelicalism. Perhaps the central theme is the rejection of  what Lindbeck called the 'cognitive-propositionalist' model of theology.  Grenz treats doctrine as a 'cultural-linguistic' set of rules that govern  community behavior, not as propositions which reflect reality. His doctrine  of Scripture suffers accordingly as he reduces it to a mere narrative whose  authority derives from its usefulness to the community, not from its truth  value. Not surprisingly, he concludes his book by calling for a shift in  theology's integrative motif from the traditional 'kingdom concept' to a  more communitarian ideal. Grenz and his compatriots, Clark Pinnock,  Donald Bloesch, Gabriel Fackre and Robert Webber will undoubtedly plunge  evangelicalism into yet another identity crisis. What will emerge is  anyone's guess.
