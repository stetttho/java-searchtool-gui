 This is a pretty good book for a couple of reasons: First, it interacts with the contemporary philosophical environment but without being tedious and difficult to understand. Second, Edgar realizes that apologetics is  both God-centered and audience-oriented, which allows him to avoid being  caught in either a presuppositionalist or evidentialist foundationalist  fantasy land of certitude. However, I think that this book's strengths  are also weaknesses in a way. While apologetics should be  audience-determined in methodology, it should not be so in content. And  Edgar, especially in the section on the problem of evil, seems to give up  too much ground to unbelief. While he rejects the free-will defense  normally used to combat the problem of evil, he leaves us with no other  place to stand! If you can't offer a plausible solution to the problem of  evil, why even start doing apologetics?
