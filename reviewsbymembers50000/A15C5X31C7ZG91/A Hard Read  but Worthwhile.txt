 In this volume, part of the Guides to Theological Inquiry series, John  Thiel provides a good and thorough overview and analysis of  postfoundationalism and its impact on theology. He begins with a look at  the philosophical and epistemological aspects of nonfoundationalism,  focusing especially on Quine, Sellars, Rorty, Davidson, and Williams and  their rejection of Cartesianism. Next, he outlines the way this rejection  of modernity has affected theology. He concentrates this section on the  thought of George Lindbeck, Hans Frei, Karl Barth, and Ronald Thiemann,  showing how nonfoundationalism has caused the rise of narrative theology  and its accompanying `unapologetic theology,' to use William Placher's  term. Thiel's final chapter addresses the critics of nonfoundationalism and  draws a valuable and necessary distinction between theological and  philosophical nonfoundationalism. Altogether, Thiel has supplied his  readers with a useful introduction to the recent developments in  contemporary theology and their relationship to current trends in  epistemology. My main complaint is that Thiel's prose is turgid, to say the  least. The jargon-filled pages contain seemingly interminable sentences  that stress the reader's ability to follow. Perspicuous brevity is  apparently a foreign concept to Thiel. Many academics need to learn that  brevity is next to godliness and that profundity does not equal  unreadability.
