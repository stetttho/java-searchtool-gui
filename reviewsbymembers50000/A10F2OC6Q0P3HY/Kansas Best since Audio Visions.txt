 I approached this album with scepticism based on the post-Audio visions recordings of Kansas - some of which were average at best and absolutely terrible at worst (Drastic Measures and Vinyl Confessions sounding nothing like Kansas at all). Thankfully my worst fears were alayed. Freaks of Nature is a really decent Kansas album which marks a welcome return of the violin to their music. For me Kansas is not Kansas without that trademark. This is a good collection of songs with the band really seeming to give 100% and enjoy it. This album may still stand well in the shadows of Leftoverture and Point of Know Return but its much better than could be expected and a worthy addition to any Kansas fan's collection. Recommendation to buy.
