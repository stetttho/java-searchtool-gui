 This self titled album, Kansas, marks a strong debut for the band. One can clearly hear the roots and style which would become trademarks of their complex melodies in the classic albums to come later. Of particular note are the excellent Lonely Wind, a lovely ballad; Journey From Mariabronn, a track which firmly establishes the Kansas trademark style; and Death of Mother Nature Suite. All the other songs are firm although its clear with the benefit of hindsight that the band were still working on finding their perfect groove - one which was to provide many classic songs in the years to come.  I would have normally given an album with this composition of tracks 3* but since it is a debut album and the overall quality of the album is such that you can listen to it seemlessly with the albums which follow I felt 4* was a fair mark in the circumstances. Recommendation to buy.
