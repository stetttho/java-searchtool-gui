 The Time Masters is a rare example of French Animation. Despite being prolific art film makers the art of animation mainly passed them by. Therefore the skills employed in making this film are probably light years behind what Disney et al were producing with the help of the mighty Hollywood machine but that should not distract from an original and sublime vision that first captured my imagination as a young child. The Time Masters (Les Maitres du Temp in France) was inspired by L'orphelin de Perdide, a novel by French science fiction auther Stephan Wul. Importantly the design is by well known French graphic artist Mobius who is well known in comics circles for his Silver Surfer and Heavy Metal work and who also did the design for The Fifth Element. Overall this helped produce a film that was strikingly different, powerful and full of surprises even if the animation techniques were not as slick and glossy as those of Hollywood where skill and money abounded. I loved this as a kid and would expect any child today to quite enjoy its haunting story. As a big kid today I still enjoy this movie which is a rare gem of French animation. If you do enjoy this movie then check out Director Ren Laloux's next work La Plante sauvage (Fantastic Planet in the US I think) as you will enjoy that also.
