 Masque is an odd album. It's apparently been deleted in the US - being available from good old blighty (Britain) which is thankfully where I live. I have no idea why such a good album should have been deleted in the US when all the other albums are available as well as a lot of rushed together compilations. This album deserves an audience. If I were to base this review purely on the tracks Icarus Borne On Wings Of Steel, Mysteries and Mayhem and The Pinnacle it would have merited a 5* review with no problems. These tracks represent Kansas at their best and easily take up about half the air time of this album. Unfortunately the remaining tracks are average although typically Kansas. That's not to say they're not enjoyable, they most cetainly are, but when compared to other Kansas masterpieces (The Wall, Icarus, Song For America) they do pale by comparison somewhat. Definitely a great album overall but not one to get hysterical about. Icarus, Mysteries and Mayhem and The Pinnacle show what was to follow soon in classics Leftoverture and Point Of Know Return - albums that sealed Kansas' rock greatness. Recommendation to buy.
