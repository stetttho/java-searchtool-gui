 Ignore the tacky overdubbed dialogue, poor quality film transfer and weedy storyline. This is a Kung Fu masterpiece and in my opinion you wouldn't have had Enter The Dragon, The Matrix or Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon without it. The Kung Fu set pieces with flying, sticking to walls fighting and choroegraphy that replied on skill not clever editing of quarter second segments makes this film a true joy.  If you're in anyway a fan of matial arts movies then this is a must buy. Dont expect that glossy Hollywood look or feel and flashy editing. This is the real thing. So get a few beers from the fridge, kick back and enjoy it for what it is.
