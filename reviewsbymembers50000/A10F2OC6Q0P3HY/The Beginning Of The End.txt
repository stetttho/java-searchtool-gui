 The 1980 album Audio Visions marked the last time the original band line up would play together until 2000's Somewhere To Elsewhere. It WAS the end of an era as it heralded a split and ugly protracted death for the band. With 6 other successful studio albums behind them (and one classic live effort) the band was beginning to show strains amongst its members. Despite what may be said by some in other Kansas reviews around the site - that the band's split after this album was caused by Livgren becoming a born again Christian - the main reason was that Walsh and Livgren were at odds regarding the creative direction of the band. Walsh preferred a grittier harder rock approach whereas Livgren did not. And it's apparent on this album which is fairly uneven. That's not to say this is a bad album, its not by any means, its a fairly decent collection of tracks, but its certainly a departure from the quality fans had come to expect from Kansas and certainly nowhere near a classic like Leftoverture and Point Of Know Return. Livgren's religious conversion certainly in no ways spoils the album for me despite the Livgren penned Hold On being about Livgren trying to get his wife to convert also. Despite that its still a very, very good song and probably my favourite on the album. Other solid efforts include another religiously toned effort from Livgren, Relentless, and Walsh's down to earth rock'n'roller Got To Rock On. On the downside are songs like Anything For You - its hard to believe Walsh is responsible for this. As one previous reviewer noted - if you were to take the best songs from both this album and Monolith (the previous release to Audio Visions) then you could quite easily create an album  which would rival the best they had done. Unfortunately the remaining tracks together would make a real clunker. And that sums it up pretty nicely. Overall a fairly decent album, nothing to get hysterical about and for more than completists. Recommendation to buy.
