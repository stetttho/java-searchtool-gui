 Monolith was the first release to follow the brilliant live album Two For The Show and possibly the first to show the differences in direction that the two lead men Steve Walsh and Kerry Livgren wanted to move in (which were all too obvious on the next release Audio Visions). Its most likely this that makes Monolith slightly uneven and a step down from Leftoverture and Point Of Know Return although still a very worthy album. Monolith is very much like Masque and Song For America in one respect. Over half of the tracks are very strong with the other half being very average. For instance On the Other Side, People Of The South Wind, Angels Have Fallen, A Glimpse Of Home and Reason To Be represent Kansas at their best and contain some wonderful melodies whereas the others are lacklustre with How My Soul Cries Out For You featuring a bizarre interlude in the middle with the sounds of a packed bar and rickety old barroom piano (weird). Although not their strongest album it is probably only bettered by Song For America, Leftoverture and Point Of Know Return (if you exclude the wonderful live album) and is a worthy addition to any Kansas fan's collection.  Recommendation to buy.
