 Two years after Kansas had died an ugly protracted death, key songwriter Steve Walsh reformed the band with original members Rich Williams and Phil Ehart. Still missing was the bands other songwriter Kerry Livgren (who is replaced on guitars by Steve Morse) and the trademark Kansas violins provided by Robbie Steinhardt. Like Vinyl Confessions and Drastic Measures this album is not classic Kansas in sound. However, unlike these two albums (which are simply terrible), it is closer to the original sound and is a decent collection of pretty good rock songs albeit without Steinhardt's trademark violin.  Anyone expecting a classic like Leftoverture or Point Of Know Return will undoubtedly be disappointed but anyone willing to give the new sound a chance will be rewarded, especially those familiar with Walsh's excellent solo album Schemer Dreamer and his other band Streets (formed when he originally left Kansas following the Audio Visions album).  It's certainly not Kansas best album, not by a long way, but its decent and certainly a lot better than their worst (both mentioned above). Most Kansas fans should find something they like on this album and at this price, less than a measly 6 dollars, you really cant go wrong even if there's only a couple of tracks that grab you. It's certainly for more than diehard Kansas completists. Recommendation to buy.
