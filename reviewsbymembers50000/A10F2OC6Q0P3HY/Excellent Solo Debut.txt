 Schemer Dreamer (SD) is Steve Walsh's first solo album, recorded in 1980 having split from Kansas. SD is an essential purchase for any fan of Walsh and Kansas and features a good collection of songs. Absolute standouts are Every Step Of The Way and So Many Nights, both of which are instant classics and would feel right at home on any Kansas album, Audio Visions and before. My only criticism is that it lacks the bite in places that Walsh had when with Kansas and when he wrote with Kerry Livgren. For instance Wait Until Tomorrow is just crying our for better lead guitar work that someone like Livgren could have provided, as is clear from his contribution on You Think You Got It Made. I'm also not a fan of the trumpet and sax on Wait Until Tomorrow.  That said this is still a strong album - so its a pity that it's only available on import. Recommendation to buy.
