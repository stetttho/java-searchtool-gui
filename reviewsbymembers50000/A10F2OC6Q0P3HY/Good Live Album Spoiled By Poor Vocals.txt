 This is a good live album let down by one crucial fact - Steve Walsh's once golden vocals have deteriorated badly, so much so that he can't even hit the notes in his own songs any more. And this really detracts from what is a decent live album and one much better than the album the concert was meant to promote - In The Spirit Of Things (see my review on this site). As it stands the album is far superior to the awful Live At The Whisky and features an overall performance far in excess of that. If you want to hear what Walsh and Kansas were once capable of spend your money on the truly incredible Two For The Show - which I called the best live album of all time in my review on this site. Unlike Live At The Whisky this album is worth your money and it contains decent live versions of some of the only good songs from In The Spirit Of Things.  Recommendation to buy.
