 If you were to make a list of the greatest live rock albums of all times you could quite happily get people to agree on classics like The Allman Bros Live At The Filmore, UFO's Strangers In The Night and Queen's Live Killers. I would quite happily add Two For The Show to that list of seminal works. It's very rare for a live album to contain all of a band's best tracks performed with a gusto and freshness that brings them to life in new ways. Well this is one and it shouldn't be overlooked. This album is simply a must have for any rock fan never mind Kansas fan. It IS that good. The only major complaint is that the CD is issued on one disc and since the original vinyl was a double album, one track has been discarded due to time constraints. Sadly a wonderful version of Closet Chronicles close to the end of the original issue has been uncerimoniously dumped. Of course the problem was that the track list is so astoundingly good you couldn't find another track to drop without moaning about that too. The highlights of the album for me are an ecstatically good version of Song For America which opens the album in a blaze of glory, and the wonderful mixing of a piano solo with Lonely Wind as an intro into Mysteries and Mayhem followed by an excerpt from the Lamplight Symphony straight into the best version of The Wall I've heard.  A true classic in the strictest sense. This is an album you should own.
