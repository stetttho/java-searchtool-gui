 As a diehard completist Kansas fan who had every other album except Drastic Measures (at the time) I got this and soon wished I hadn't. This is a terrible album that sounds very unlike Kansas and which set the stage for Steinhardt to leave, for Livgren to become a passenger and for the outright awfulness that was to bestow itself in the next album Drastic Measures. With key man Steve Walsh gone, the strange choice of John Elefante joined the band and added songs (many co written with non-band member and brother Dino) which were simply 80's pop-chic and utterly unlike Kansas. The sound just doesn't mix with the existing band, even though by this point Livgren seems uninspired and going through the motions as does the soon to leave Steinhardt.  Only two tracks, both written by Livgren, esccape my axe. Play The Game Tonight and Crossfire, although far from Kansas classics, they are decent songs which don't deserve to be dragged down by the rest of this awful album.  One wonders why they simply didn't label this John Elefante's solo album with contributors Livgren et al as that is really what it is. Although far from good this album isn't as bad as Drastic Measures which followed and which was almost entirely Elefante's album. Both are for completists only. Not recommended.
