 This, along with Leftoverture, is probably Kansas best known and best album - and not without due reason.  Picking up where they left off in Leftoverture Kansas penned another album full of brilliant tracks with the classic Dust In The Wind Standing out as an all time classic. Other brilliant songs are Closet Chronicles and Portrait both of which maintain the creative spirit and superbly creative musicianship of the previous album. The weakest track is the last, Helplessly Human, but even then its still decent and can't really detract from the overall experience. This is an album all rock fans should own, not just Kansas fans.
