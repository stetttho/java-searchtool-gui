 This is quite simply one of rock's greatest albums.  If ever a band hit a creative peak and laid down an album of classic tracks in one go then this is it. There isn't a dud or average track present and every one scores a hit. From the well known radio classic Carry On Wayward Son, Kansas most famous song, to passionate masterpieces like The Wall, the frenetic Magnum Opus and wonderful Cheyenne Anthem this album is filled from start to finish with superlative musicianship, songs, lyrics, and vocals. This is a must buy for any rock fan, not just fans of Kansas.
