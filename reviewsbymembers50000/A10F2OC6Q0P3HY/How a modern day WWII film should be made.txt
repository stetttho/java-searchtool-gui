 After an absence of god know's how long Terrence Malick returns with a cracker. IMO The Thin Red Line is the best WWII film made and that includes Saving Private Ryan (for my reasons see my review of SPR also here on Amazon). Malick's ponderous film is a masterpiece from start to finish. Starting with scenes of Gaudalcanal's peaceful indiginous population showing how man can be Malick soon takes us on an emotional tour de force of the horrors of war cleverly built up through the attack on a hilltop japanese bunker. Tension mounts quickly as you can imagine yourself there and how scared the soldiers must be as they're picked off by snipers.  What this film lacks in terms of Saving Private Ryans landing sequences, gore and shock value it makes up for in emotion and human spirit. Above all this is a film about the triumph of humanity over savagery - a theme captured in the character of   played by Private Witt. The film is packed with marvellous performances, in particular that of Nick Nolte as the general looked over for promotion and who uses his men heartlessly as pawns to erase that painful memory. The DVD package itself is also excellent with extra features. This is a must buy.
