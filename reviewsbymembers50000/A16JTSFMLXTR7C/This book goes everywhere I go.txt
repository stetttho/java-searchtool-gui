 I bought this book in 1990, and it's travelled with me everywhere I've been since then.  Not that I'm constantly reading it -- as a matter of fact, I think I last opened it a year ago -- rather, I think of it as a medicine cabinet of little insights and stories: wisdom in distilled, titrated doses, a portable collection of innoculations against quotidian ennui, antidotes for social blindness.  It's hardly Milosz's best book; but it represents something of an apotheosis of the personal literary journal, and as such it's a good reference or example to have on hand.  I sincerely recommend it.
