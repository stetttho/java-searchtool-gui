 The Cupcake Cafe is much better known for the artistry of its buttercream cake and cupcake decorations than it is for the tastiness of its baked goods... and this cookbook plays to the Cafe's strengths.  Not that the recipies aren't good -- they are, and the muffins, cakes and doughnuts they describe are all consistent and not at all 'difficult' or temperamental -- but they're all rather dauntingly SOLID, VERY heavy on the butter, and not especially inventive as far as texture and flavor are concerned. But anyone who's ever been to the Cafe can tell you -- that's authentic, and the book faithfully describes how to produce the Cafe's best-known products.   There's an ample section on decorating 'the Cupcake Cafe way', but surprisingly (and disappointingly) few step-by-step illustrations or photographs.  Many of the flowers Ann Warren describes are very complex and more diagrams would have been very helpful.  I was also surprised to notice that the photographs aren't really quite in focus, and don't give you any more than a general sense of what kinds of buttercream floral renditions the Cafe is known for -- which is to say, they don't do Ann Warren's artistry justice, since her work is beautiful. Her recipe for buttercream frosting is, I think, a little unnecessarily delicate, given the heavy hand with which she expects you to apply the stuff (one 10" cake's worth of frosting calls for two pounds of butter!) -- I've had better results modifying her recipe with a little confectioner's sugar than I've had being obedient to the original. All that said, this is a handy cookbook with reliable recipes for cakes, doughnuts and muffins, and it provides ample food for inspiration.
