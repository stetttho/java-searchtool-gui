 Word on the Street is an accessible introduction to the descriptivism of modern linguistics -- and this is most certainly a book written for the general audience, not for students of linguistics.  Much of the book is taken up building McWhorter's argument for the basic linguistic equality of all spoken idioms/languages/dialects, which is to say the capacity every spoken language has to articulate all the finest and most specific aspects of human experience.  This is all very well and good, an easy introduction for the lay reader, and a strong basis from which McWhorter then proceeds to argue (1) that Standard Black English is neither more nor less than a spoken variant of English, on par with any other, and (2) that the contortion of the public education system to deliver instruction in variant 'non-standard' forms of English or other languages is not helpful in overcoming the basic obstacle that underperforming inner-city children face in school -- namely poverty, and the lack of emotional and intellectual resources that it engenders. There are two troublesome aspects to this book, which might be a bit confusing for the lay reader.  First, McWhorter doesn't sufficiently distinguish between the written and spoken forms of a language -- the two are manifestly different, both in the ways they're used as communicative media and in the ways they evolve over time.  Second, it's not entirely clear why he argues on the one hand that Shakespeare should be 'translated' into modern standard English, so that it can be more accessible to theater audiences and schoolchildren; and on the other hand that the 'translation' of texts into Black English is counterproductive in helping children with little Standard English exposure to learn to read. All of this aside, I recommend the book: McWhorter writes well, and his axe-grinding (as another reviewer put it) at least gives one something to think about.
