 The editors have attempted to cram half a century of various scholarly musings on the written word, the uses of reading and literacy, the materiality and production of books, the reception and interpretation of meaning in books by readers and consumers, and the evolution of print culture into a couple hundred pages of really teeny tiny print.  This has required creative editing and the use of FAR too many ellipses -- a number of important pieces are so gutted here that they're rendered almost meaningless, which is worse than frustrating.  However, there is no other book available that provides the same kind of overview of the basic relevant literature on these subjects -- and the motivated reader, I hope, will search out the unabridged versions of those articles she finds interesting.
