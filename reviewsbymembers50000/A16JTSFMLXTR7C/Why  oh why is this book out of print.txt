Why on earth is it out of print? Strauss looks at the goals and the results of the educational campaigns of the early Lutherans, and ultimately finds that until local and regional government took an active role in the administration and funding of the schools the Lutherans established, their effectiveness (measured by the results of inspection committee examinations) was slight.
