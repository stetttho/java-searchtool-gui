 I stumbled on this book entirely by accident, and judged it first by its cover and illustrations, which are appealing.  Now that I've actually read it -- What a great resource!  Not only is she a good writer, and a careful logical thinker, she's anticipated pretty much every question the novice gardener could have and has explained her topic with grace and wisdom.  AND the illustrations are clear and appealing.  I'm looking forward to putting her instructions to practice this month.
