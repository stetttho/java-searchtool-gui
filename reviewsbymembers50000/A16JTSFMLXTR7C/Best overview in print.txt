 Raguin's overview of stained glass is the best available art historical overview of the medium, though it's not exactly exhaustive -- it covers the development of stained glass from early medieval time through the present day (though the examples of modern stained glass are comparatively weak), focusing on the evolving function of stained glass in its architectural context (as adornment, a didactic tool, an artistic medium).  This is a reference book.  You will not find patterns or techniques in it; and it does not examine any particular set of windows in depth; but it does frame the development of style and technology in an understandable narrative, and it has plenty of excellent photographs.  Well worth the money.
