 You can almost hear the gutteral hiss of the capuccino makers in the background as you play this album, I swear -- this is such generic genY cafe soundtrack music.  And I was so hopeful when I bought it!  It's pleasant, sure -- and competent, and even good in a couple places -- but mostly pretty cheesey, and too deliberately evocative of other artists with more artistry to be worth all the acclaim it's getting.  Most of the songs are better enjoyed as background, they don't stand much close attention.  I'm with the Rolling Stone wag who said that "Your Body is a Wonderland" was a much better song when it was called "Crash" by the Dave Matthews Band.
