 William Ackerman's first three albums (I can't speak for any others) are so bland, so mild, so inoffensive that you could play them to your aged grandmother without any problems, except that she might ask you to turn  them up; on a couple of the faster items you might notice her tapping her  toe, faintly. But I'll bet that after listening some time your  grandmother's going say, "Well, it's very pretty and all, but aincha  got Blind Joe Death by John Fahey? When I hear the American acoustical  guitar, I like it to go someplace, not just lie in a corner and curl  up!" Ackerman's tunes drift pleasantly down, like snow, and melt as  soon as they touch the ground, leaving not a trace behind, except the faint  impression of wasted time.
