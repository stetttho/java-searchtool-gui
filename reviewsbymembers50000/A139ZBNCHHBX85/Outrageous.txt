 "That whole record was a hoax. On all the songs that say it's me it isn't and vice versa." - John Fahey A lavish autobiographical fantasy, an absurd exercise in self-gratification, or self-deprecation, hard to  tell; a labour of love for sure, a financial disaster, definitely, a grand  folly, a lovely indulgence, a holiday from seriousness, a mosaic of diverse  musical traditions and a discographical nightmare; "The Voice of the  Turtle" is all these things. The most rococo expression of Fahey's  sense of the absurd, with its lying notes, self-mythologising and lunatic  picture book, this is a serious joke. With those notes, and that picture  album so lovingly subtitled, the sleeve in all its gatefolded glory -  "the author age 17" , the quote from the Bible which everyone  including Fahey knows means turtledoves, not turtles, this record comes at  you like a conceptual piece, a bold encryption of a dream of a possibility.  Fahey, I award you the Turner Prize for 1968.
