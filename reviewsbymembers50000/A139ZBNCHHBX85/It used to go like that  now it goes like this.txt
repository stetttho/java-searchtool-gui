 Actually, Fahey recorded this one himself right there in the motel where he was living at the time; he got a little help with the tape loops (not from Jim O'Rourke) but that's about all. So it's just exactly as he  intended. Which means it's difficult stuff, mainly, because this is the New  Fahey - no more Mr Nice Guy, no more Blues or Folk or whatever it was - now  you get Industrial Ambient. Hmmm. I do enjoy the idea of Fahey tearing up  his whole back catalogue, trashing all his old fans and heading out into...  Somewhere Else. (Starting with "City of Refuge" and continuing  with "The Epiphany of Glenn Jones") But I probably like the idea  better than I like this cd. On the other hand, Gamelan found sounds are  nothing new. Check out Fahey's 1968 composition "A Raga Called  Pat" (on "The Voice of the Turtle").
