 Come on, people, you hear one looooooooong drooooooooooooooone piece, you heard em ALL! We do not require these guys to do this over and over again. For that is what you get, dear reader, loooooooong drooooooooooooones. Listen to the example Amazon helpfully includes here and imagine it going on for 40 minutes, then stopping finally. Imagine paying dough for a record you're glad when it stops. I hope someone somewhere has removed the need for some of the small but adventurous record companies to inflict this kind of avant-garde nonsense upon us in the name of art.
