 In Fahey's Last Phase (96-01) he was experimenting like crazy and was telling everyone that all the old stuff was horrible, only his new stuff was any good. This of course was nonsense. He was just trying to be the oldest punk in town. The Trio work is Fahey at his most noisy, tuneless and experimental. Some of it just sounds like roadworks outside your house. Guitar, keyboard and a ton of effects, plus at times JF intoning very funny parts of liner notes to previous albums. It's fairly excruciating to my shell-like ears, but I'm aware that some folks LIKE this kind of thing - there are dozens of noise bands out there. Fahey's favourites were Einsturzende Neubauten - so if you like those bad boys, this is for you. But if you love "Sunflower River Blues" or "The Death of the Clayton Peacock" then invest in a pack of Anadin Extra before pressing Play. You have been warned.
