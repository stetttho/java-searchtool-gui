 John was quite ill when he made this record, and it shows. There's no inspiration, and no syncopation. Everything is tired, flat, listless, dull. You'll never find a more apt title on anyone's album than "Minutes Seem Like Hours, the Hours Seem Like Days". So this is for completists only. As the album title itself says "I Remember 'Blind Joe Death'" - now THAT was a great album!
