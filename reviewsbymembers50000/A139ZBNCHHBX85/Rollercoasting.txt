 In the 1970s Fahey recorded three "John Fahey and his Orchestra" albums, and this is the first. But it's not an orchestra, that's just a little joke, it's a dixieland jazz band plus some other assorted acoustic accompanists. Fahey fans are divided - some like the trad jazz tracks and some hate them. Fahey himself thought they were the greatest bunch of musicians he'd ever worked with. Anyhow, this album is a real mixed bag. "Steamboat" is a collection of lazy generic slide riffs, very pretty but nothing too challenging; the two medleys (guitar duets) are extremely dull; "Funeral Song" is a rerecording of an old fave from "Requia" and is great but unnecessary; "Lord Have Mercy" is full-on trad jazz and is tedious (sorry John); "Song" is a solo guitar meditation, that's okay - so that leaves only two gems - "Texas and Pacific" which is a trumpet led jazz tune, great melody, and the gradual increase of pace works like magic, and the heavenly "Dixie Pig", which must be in my top 5 Fahey tunes - on that one the dobro player gets the best bits. I think I'll have it played at my funeral service. There won't be a dry eye in the place. But, well, two out of seven ain't that good by anyone's reckoning.
