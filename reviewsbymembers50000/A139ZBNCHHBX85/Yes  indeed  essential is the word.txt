 By 1967 Fahey was at the height of his compositional and playing power, and pieces like "The Yellow Princess" and "When the Catfish is in Bloom" are truly stunning. Even the less flamboyant - say,  "Charles A Lee" - have a mesmerising beauty. There is not one  wasted second on this brilliant cd (which consists of 2 albums "Yellow  Princess" and "Requia" minus a long  guitar-plus-sound-effects piece called "Requiem for Molly" which  you're better off without). Listen to the ringing intro to "The Yellow  Princess", or its helterskelter finale; melt away to the simple tune  which wraps up "Russell Blaine Cooper"; delight in the whole  thing. Guitar perfection.
