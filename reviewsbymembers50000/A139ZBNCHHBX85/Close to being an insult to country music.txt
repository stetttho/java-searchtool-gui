 I got to level with you. Terry Allen leaves me feeling like everybody's laughing but I'm not getting the joke. He has No Tunes - the excuses for tunes he uses are like grotesque parodies of what other people think country music is, as is his accent. He comes on like a guy with an attitude, and the attitude sounds interesting, but when you look further his songs just shuffle cliches around and go nowhere with  them...And the leaden tempos he uses incessantly make me want to tear my hair...
