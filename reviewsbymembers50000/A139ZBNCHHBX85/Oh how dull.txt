 It's an excellent idea, but what grindingly dull work Todd Harvey makes of it all. Each of the 70 analyses follow the same pattern, so each contains a paragraph which says something like "I have heard 11 versions of Don't Think Twice, It's All Right : the [10/?/62a] 2nd Gaslight performance, the [11/14/62] Freewheelin' session VI recording, subsequently released on that lp, the [3/?/63a] Witmark session V recording..." etc etc through all 11 performances. (All the sessions are listed in an appendix at the back of the book, so why he couldn't asterisk those he'd heard and save 70 tedious paragraphs, I don't know.) Then later, we get a musical analysis of each song, like this : "Lay Down Your Waery Tune has a verse-chorus form with five verses (verse four has no chorus). In duple time it has an ABCA/ABCA phrase structure. Like Paths of Victory and Walkin' Down the Line the melody is the same in both the verse and chorus sections". Well, not much enlightenment there. I give credit for the author's doggedness in trying to chase down the sources for all these songs - there's lots of stuff I didn't know in here - but ignoring the appendices this book is only 127 pages long... (I believe that might be because it's aiming for educational establishments and not fans - maybe. Anyway, it tries hard to be "scholarly".) There are also odd lapses. Harvey credits John Bauldie's notes to the "Bootleg Series" box set then does not mention that Dylan's "Cough Song" is probably based on Jimmie Tarlton's (1930) "Mexican Rag" as Bauldie says. He omits the connection between "When the Ship Comes In" and the Carter family's "Gospel Ship"; and he doesn't explore the rather obvious thematic similarity between Dylan's "John Brown" and the Irish trad song "Johnny I Hardly Knew You". I might have forgiven the author for those omissions, but I can't forgive him for writing such a very dull and boring book about such an interesting subject. All in all, this is a real missed opportunity.
