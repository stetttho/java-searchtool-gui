 The latest in a series of Christmas John Fahey albums, and perhaps the prettiest, with flute, piano and cello arrangements gracing some less obvious Xmas pieces - this is Fahey at his most New Age. Enjoying its  lambent simplicity, the listener would never realise that this is an album  made by a man on a kind of precipice. Fahey was being gradually overwhelmed  by various health and financial problems, and after this album nothing was  heard from him for five years. (The silence was finally broken by the dark  gratings and howlings of "City of Refuge" which includes a  ghastly 15 minute noise sequence called "On the Death and  Disembowelment of the New Age".) But as Fahey's Xmas albums go, this  is probably the best. The somewhat mechanical syncopation of previous   Christmas outings is abandoned for a kind of crystalline purity of melody  which represents, in its way, one of Fahey's most extreme statements (as  "City of Refuge" represents another).
