 Anyone who doesn't notice a major decline in Tom Waits since the 80s is in need of counselling. He is rewriting himself endlessly, and it ain't funny any more. He has no new musical ideas, and especially he has no tunes any more, and he appears to be successfully covering that up by using the patent Sound of the Primeval Soup routine on every track, which has the effect of making the thing superficially aurally attractive. But, for instance, Eyeball kid is a rewrite of 16 Shells, and when you look at the lyrics of House Where Nobody lives, you have to wonder - this from a guy who wrote three whole albums (Swordfishtrombones, Raindogs & Frank's Wild Years) where almost every line was a jewel. He drops into his sentimental-barroom mode on three occasions, and never gets within a country mile of Soldier's Things or Jonestown Illinois or... you name em. The chorus of approval given to this album is proof that most people are happy to be persuaded of something they want to believe. Truth is that right now Tom Waits is played out.
