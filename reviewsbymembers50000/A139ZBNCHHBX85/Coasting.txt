 With only three original compositions, this album signifies that Fahey was running out of ideas by the late 80s. With Terry Robb again duetting on about half the songs (and taking the lead on some) this isn't really much  of a Fahey album at all. Instead of working over tunes like they were old  dinosaur bones, he cooks up smart acoustic arrangements from unlikely  material, lending weight to the idea that eclecticism is the first resort  of the bankrupt imagination. Well, I wouldn't go that far, but you have to  raise an eyebrow at the choice of "Layla", and the two  beautifully played sambas are just that. And alas, the lengthy "Ocean  Waves" goes to show that no one plays Bola Sete like Bola Sete, or  George Winston. But hey, come on, it's John Fahey, and he's great you know.
