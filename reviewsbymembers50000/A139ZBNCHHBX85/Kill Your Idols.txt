 One of those extraordinary encounters which make the story of John Fahey so fascinating, this a fine mixture of psychological terror, straightforward Freudian psychology and of course some radical-but-cuddly  music. Imagine the situation: you are Glenn Jones and for years you've  idolised John Fahey. Now you're a fine guitar-player yourself, with your  own band (Cul de Sac), and you get a chance to make a record with your  hero. You feverishly prepare for the precious few days of studio time. You  rehearse the band, and send stuff to Fahey so he can arrive prepared. On  the great day everyone meets at the studio, and Fahey immediately denounces  you, your music and your band as old fashioned and pretentious - wow! Major  trauma! Hang on to your ego!  After some fraught hours trying out this and  that, JF stated bluntly that either he took over the project or he was  walking. So they made this record, which is a series of abstract textures  with a couple of great blues interpolations (Come On in my Kitchen, Maggie  Campbell). Pretty good stuff, in the end - it won't frighten you (like  "City of Refuge" might) - although it frightened Glenn!
