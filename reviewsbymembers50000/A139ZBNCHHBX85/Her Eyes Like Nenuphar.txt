 Which is a kind of giant waterlily, of course! Here's a splendid cd from the godlike Robin Williamson, co-creator of the Incredible String Band. It's one for String Band devotees since it resurrects two ISB songs which were never released, Ring dance and Fine Fingered Hand, and revives three other ISB period pieces, Invocation (from the then-unrereleased "U"), Veshengro from "Be Glad", and I See us Cross Great waters, which is a retitled I See Us All Get Home from RW's first solo album "Myrrh". This is the core of the album and they're all wonderful apart from Veshengro which really doesn't work. There ain't never been any songs so magical and delirious as these and Robin's other String Band works. I can't honestly say that I've been a fan of Robin's solo career, certainly not the storytelling and harping on (which accounts for most of it), and the occasional original-song albums like Ten of Songs never convinced me at all, but this one does. The non-ISB stuff is excellent (leaving aside the toecurling spoken word item My Enemy is Listening). Many say Songs of Love and Parting is Robin's best solo album, but I say Ring Dance is. 5 stars for Fine Fingered Hand alone. One star deducted for not including Won't You Come See Me.
