 Nobody is going to love me for saying this, but Jim O'Rourke's essay in experimental elevator music is all dressed up and nowhere to go. He gets ten points for trying different things with many instruments, and another few points for creating modern music which isn't rock, isn't anything remotely like rock, but I have to take all those points right off him because there are No Tunes At All on this album. There should be a sticker on the front : "Warning! Tune-Free!" So it comes and goes in a fairly unobjectionable way - apart from "Women of the World" which is the Most Aggravating Song I heard since "Kitty in a Basket" (you never heard that one? I must play it for you one day.)    (Jim O'Rourke worshipped at the shrine of John Fahey, as I do, and his best album (of the ones I heard) is "Bad Timing" which is his most Fahey-like music; but hell, why not just listen to John Fahey instead?)
