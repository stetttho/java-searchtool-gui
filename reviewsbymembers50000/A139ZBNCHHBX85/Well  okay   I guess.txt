 Brian's on a roll now, but he still has only released 2 albums of new stuff since 1988. So when this cd was released the fans of Brian Wilson leaped in the air and praised the Lord - Brian was BACK! Well, it sure sounded like that. It was an album, of songs, and Brian was singing and writing again. But after the euphoria wore off, Imagination was revealed to be a disappointingly ordinary album with a few grand touches, hampered by dismal glittery sparkly production which was horrible froth compared with ANYTHING from Brian's previous catalogue. So here's where we have to use OUR imagination - why does Brian release this tepid stuff when his great second solo album "Sweet Insanity" is a-mouldring in the vaults, unreleased except by the evil bootleggers? Story was that the record company wouldn't released "Sweet Insanity" because of Brian and Eugene Landy's "psycho-babble" lyrics. Or then again, I heard that it was "mired in legal complications". Well, a couple of the tracks on "Sweet Insanity" are terrible, it's true, but if you eliminate them you've got an album which burns "Imagination" into a crisp - at least five stone classics on it ("Water Builds Up", "Don't Let her Know she's an Angel", etc), great driving production and harmony which will make very happy anyone who thinks what you get on "Imagination" is anywhere near what Brian's capable of. Record company executives of America! I speak to you with a heartfelt request: release "Sweet Insanity" right now! Then I can write a 5 star review of it!
