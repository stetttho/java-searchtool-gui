 But you can't blame the guy. He's got to eat just like the rest of us. Back in 1968 he noticed that Christmas records just sell and sell and sell, so he recorded one ("The New Possibility") and wouldn't you know,  it became his best seller - not Blind Joe Death, not Railroad, not The  Yellow Princess or any of those other masterpieces. So he put out more  Christmas albums over the years (I think I count five) and this is the  ickiest one of the lot - can you stand "The Skater's Waltz" or  "Do You Hear what I Hear"? The music is mostly duets with Terry  Robb, and most mellifluous they are too. And I guess guitarists will like  the arrangements. But as a Fahey record, this is for completists.
