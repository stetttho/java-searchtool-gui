 The creators of Between the Lions have written an interesting well laid out book however, I believe they over emphasize the *need* of children to watch their show.  The writers believe that it is virtually impossible to show some pre- and emergent readers concepts without using the TV to illustrate their point such as the alphabet done in verbs.  In fact there is a book called _Action_Alphabet_ that does just that.  The authors believe their concept of switching around the letters in a word (the Fred segment) and adding letters can only be done on TV, in fact the book _The_Alphabet_Keeper_ shows it being done.  We can also easily do this on our fridge at home using the magnetic letters.  If you (and your kids like the TV series) this is probably an okay book.   In addition, by kindergarten chapter the authors discuss how to teach help your child  without interfering in the school's reading instruction.  It becomes clear that emphasis is not on how to teach your child how to read, but how to support emerging literacy.  This is a good goal, but not what I was hoping for.  On the plus side, after reading the first section, the authors do encourage you to skip around and read only the sections that are important to your child, so you can go straight to the first grade chapter and skip the others if that is where you child currently is.
