 This is a GREAT book!  I got it two weeks ago and have made two weeks worth of menus out of it already.  My family LOVES them and I love this book.  It provides 32 weeks worth of dinner menus divided into four seasonal sections beginning with fall.  Each menu comes complete with a grocery list that included the side dishes that she recommends with each entree.  Each week has a fish entree, a meatless entre, and a crockpot entree.  She provides entrees for six nights each week.  This book has saved me TONS of time in menu planning, meal prep, and cleanup and now my family is eating more nutritiously than ever before.  The only quibble I have is that there is so much meat in the menus (5 out of six nights) which can get expensive.  But cooking these menus is a lot better than take-out and less expensive.
