 I'm not a big fan of What To Expect When Your Expecting books but I wanted a way to explain to my 20 month twins that we're having a new baby in a month.  This book goes into details such as "How did the baby get  inside Mommy?" and "When will the baby be born?"  It uses  anatomically correct terms such as sperm, ovum, and vagina, which was more  detail than I would have gone into.  I was looking for a book that would  explain what would happen in the house after the baby was born, and this  book stops once the baby is born.  It does not cover any of the post-birth  issues such as how a child can interact with their new sibling or the range  of emotional experiences they may go through with a new baby in the  house. A friend gave me Mercer Mayer's book "The New Baby",  which my children love to have read and re-read to them and actually deals  with how they can interact with the baby after it's born.  Also Joanna  Cole's book "The New Baby in the House" goes into some of the  feelings a child may have about having a new baby brother or sister.
