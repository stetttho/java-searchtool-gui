 This is a wonderful book for both children and adults.  It was written by a second grade teacher for her class to perform and it goes through each letter of the alphabet in order telling the Christmas story.  "A is for Augustus who sent out the decree..."  I originally discovered it because it was recommended in "The Godparent Book", when I found the library I was in awe.  It is one of the few intelligent books the aims to tell the who Christmas story without dumbing it down or putting in overly cutetsy or sentimental pictures.  The pictures are lavish and brightly colored.  It goes far beyond the standard alphabet format so that even adults will enjoy reading and re-reading it  year after year.  My family reads one Christmas story every day leading upto the 25th, this is a definate must have for your collection if you do the same thing.
