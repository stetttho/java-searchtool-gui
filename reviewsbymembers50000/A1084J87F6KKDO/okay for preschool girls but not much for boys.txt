 While I like and get the Chinaberry catalog, the descriptions of the books in these pages are just a pulling together of various catalog descriptions.  The entire book seems to focus on children from 3 to 8 with an occassional book that can be read to the age of 10.  Also, as a mother of two small boys, most of the books recommended by Ruethling have no appeal to my sons.  Part of the problem may be that most of the books that Ruethling loves have *very* detailed illustrations on the pages.  The authors want you to spend time analyzing the pictures with your child and my boys just want to turn the page to find out what happens!   The green typeface can be hard to read and gets very annoying after a few pages.  While it can be a good jumping off point for checking books out of the library, you would do just as well by checking their web site.
