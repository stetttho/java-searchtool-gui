 When I was in high school, the principal frequently read this story aloud in assemblies (it was a Catholic all girls high school).  You could view it as a modern parable about relationships (parents and children, people and God).  When my children were born I held my new babies in my arms and read it aloud again and cried because it covers the cycle of life so beautifully.   The story is about a little boy and his relationship to an apple tree.  As the boy grows older his needs change and his relation with the tree changes.  A first he needs protection and play.  Then he moves into a stag where he needs "things"  money, a house, etc.  In the final stage he is an old man and his needs have become simple again, just to sit and rest.  Throughout all of the phases of his life, the tree is there and unjudgementally supporting the boy.
