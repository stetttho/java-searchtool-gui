 The dry mixes are probably the best of the bunch, particularly the muffin mix.  I tried to make the Chocolate Chip Cookie Mix and it nearly did in my Kitchen Aide Mixer.  There was too much dough to process.  Also the cheese  mixture calls for egg yolks, but doesn't require that they be cooked to a  high enough tempeture to kill the bateria.  The hot chocolate mix was  tasteless, I ended up adding more sugar and vanilla once we made the hot  chocolate just to get it to taste like a boxed hot chocolate mix and it  does not approach hot chocolate mix made from scratch.
