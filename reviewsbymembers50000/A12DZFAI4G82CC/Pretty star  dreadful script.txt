 I bought the DVD on the strength of having watched the last 10 minutes or  so on HBO. I just *had* to find out how it happened. And Sarah Michelle  Gellar looked quite appealing in the short segment I saw. It turns out  that I'd already seen the best part of the movie -- the ending. Gellar's  character triumphs over adversity and rides off happily into the sunset. Or  whatever. But the screenwriters and/or producers threw together a patchwork  of half baked nonsense to get us there. It turns out that Gellar's  triumph wasn't over adversity, it was over her own incompetence. She  started the movie as the propretor/cook of a small Manhattan eatery that  she inherited from her parents. The handful of regular patrons remain  purely out of inertia, since Gellar's cooking is reputed to be awful. That  is, until the day she buys a "magic crab" whose presence in her  kitchen transforms her miserable attempts at cooking into works of art. I'm  sorry, but such a premise doesn't inspire sympathy for a character, no  matter how pretty she is. There are a few obvious parallels with the  wonderful "Like Water For Chocolate," like bouts of anger and  tears that obviously affect those who eat Gellar's cooking. But the  thinness of the rest of the movie make these homages look like failed  attempts at cinematic hipness. There are a few nice moments, notably the  scene where her crush, who becomse obsessed with her cooking,  "mugs" an elderly couple who have some carry-out treats from  Gellar's restaraunt. But a romantic scene is marred by unexplained (and  thankfully unrepeated) levitation. I find myself wondering how many cooks  had their fingers in this production. It was more than enough to spoil the  broth.
