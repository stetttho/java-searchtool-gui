 Fred Cohen did pioneering research work in viruses and this book is a survey of virus technology. The book covers the general topic of malicious software from a solid technical level. The book provides no magic bullets  either for stopping viruses nor for writing them (there aren't any), but he  nails the technology right on. Sill a worthwhile book even though it  predates the popularization of active content like Java and the outbreaks  of macro viruses in Office applications.
