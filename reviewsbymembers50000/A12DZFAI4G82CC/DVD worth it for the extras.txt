 I wasn't going to buy this DVD. I already have the film on VHS normal and VHS widescreen. Now I have all 3 formats. The commentary track by Emma Thompson and Lindsay Doran is the most entertaining I've heard on any DVD.  The two of them obviously enjoyed making the film and they have lots of  little stories to tell about it. Their comments fill in a lot of questions  I was left with after reading Emma Thompson's published screenplay. I was  curious to see the infamous kissing scene. I see why it was left out, but  it's nice to have finally seen it. Mix it with brief cuts that are in the  trailers and not in the film, and there's some interesting extra material.  But of course films are best if they leave you wanting more. The only  thing I'd change about this movie, if I could, would have been to have the  sisters both be teenagers. Emma Thompson did a great job as a  twentysomething older sister, but Elinor's character really should have  been an older, serious teen against Marianne's impulsive teen.  Pronouncements by Emma's Elinor carry too much conviction because she's  just those few years older. The "I wish Marianne had a better  acquaitance with the ways of the world" exchange with Col. Brandon has  a very different flavor if it comes from, say, a nineteen-year-old.
