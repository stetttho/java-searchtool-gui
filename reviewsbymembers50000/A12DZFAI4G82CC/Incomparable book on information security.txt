 Those of us in the computer security business have been mining Ross Anderson's web site for years, since he's done some really unique and important work in the field. Finally he's pulled it into an incredible book, one that's essential for anyone interested in information security. Two elements combine make this book unique: first, the book manages to cover all of the major topics in the field, and second, the book covers the whole range of attacks that systems can face: technical, procedural and physical. Historically, writers on information security have focused on computers and disembodied "users," downplaying the crucial issues of physical security, perimeters, operating procedures, and the limits of human behavior. This book tries to integrate such concerns into information security thinking, instead of treating them as "special concerns that computer geeks don't really care about." Best of all, the book is a great read. Ross has a fine way of drawing out the irony we encounter in user behavior, enterprise behavior, and even in the actions of presumed authorities in industry and government. At one point he discusses a government endorsed security evaluation process "which, as mentioned, is sufficient to keep out all attackers but the competent ones." Ross unabashedly explains several aspects of information security that most writers ignore entirely, like security printing, seals, tamper resistance, and associated procedures. In my own books, reviewers have chided me for including such "irrelevant" topics, even though they play an essential part in making a real system work. As Ross ably points out, most successful attacks these days are pretty mundane and don't involve cryptanalysis or sophisticated protocol hacking. ATM fraud, for example, often relies on pre-computer technology like binoculars to pick up a victim's PIN. This book should open a lot of peoples' eyes.
