 For those that don't know, Alan Douglas (aka, The Butcher, or the Bungler) had more control over this record than the prominent Experience Hendrix estate; the latter is Jimi's family. Douglas was the infamous producer of  Crash Landing and Midnight Lightning. These two albums were originally  recorded by Hendrix alone, however, Douglas assigned session musicians to  play around the source; thus giving a wall of sound of new instruments and  singers. Altho it seemed like a clever idea, the releases were highly  criticized for such a feat, especially since some of Jimi's guitar tracks  were erased and replaced by some goon.  Jimi's Blues is another example  of Douglas at his butchery. For Instance, there's a track called  "Voodoo Chile Blues" which is the same recording on ELL but  Douglas has edited it and gave it his own moniker. "Once I Had A  Woman" was previously released on ML, however, here it is remixed and  containing several different rhythm tracks. "Jelly 292" was a  basic jam, originally released on Loose Ends, this time --- ". . .  that bloody Douglas!"  On the contrary, there are some highlights to  this CD: "Born under bad sign" is truly a rare gem; "Hear My  Train" the acoustic take, is a beautiful introduction to the album  (sometimes I wonder 'why did Jimi prefer electric! '); and "Catfish  Blues," a Muddy Waters original, is the kind of song you'd like to  pick-up-that-guitar-and-jam to.  Considering the few decent tracks on  this CD, I think if Douglas hadn't tampered with the majority of them,  maybe the true Hendrix fans would hear the songs the way Jimi intended them  to be. I'd say, leave all unreleased recordings in the hands of Experience  Hendrix estate, and let them figure it out. A 4 star rating for those  untampered tracks.
