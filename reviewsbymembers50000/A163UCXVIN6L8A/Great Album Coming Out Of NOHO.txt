 Those crazy lads from Northampton, MA are at it again with their official 	worldwide release Night On The Tiles. The Big Bad Bollocks broke out on the now  	defunct Jamadisc label, with its first LP Hanged At Gibbet Rock,  interjecting a Celtic 	Rock sound to an audience hackneyed by grunge  and pop rock. This release  	was a local success as well as a stepping  stone for the bands first major tour; however, 	the album underwent  several complication due to its atrocious remastering and legal 	 issues. The group's follow-up EP Where The Beef Meets The Sea, was a minor 	 achievement but presented the band at its experimental stage, utilizing a  scattershot 	approach ranging from punkrock to hip-hop. Consequently,  the band ventured to a 	different avenue (as well as kicking out a few  bandmates) for its 3rd release on the punk 	label Monolith. Indeed,  they've come a long way.  		The Album opens with appellation  jingle, thus segueing to the band  	(should-be hit) single Tidza, which  is a nickname for Tideswell. Johnny Alien, the 	group's Guinness crazed  frontman, simulates a howling banshee in the hooky roundelay 	English  Village. Lead guitarist, Peno, muffles three chords and an attitude on  Motorcycle 	Jacket (one of my favorite song on the album) that  subsequently trails off with a female 	doowop. The LP gets pretty  interesting after DrinkUp Yabastards, a song that speaks  	for itself.  Tracks like Thirteen Pints, Aunty Mary, and Uncle Ted have a more 	 progressive feel as well as exhibiting a perfected song structure  ----musically and 	lyrically. I understand that Mr. Alien has  blueprinted a poetic ambiance for his recent 	gigs, and I do hope he'll  pursue this method for the next Bollocks LP; or a Johnny Alien 	solo  project.
