 End of Torment can be viewed as an indepth clarification of Hermione. The book (or journal) was written at the time of Pound's hospitalization, and Hilda has a lot to say about her ex. However, HD still has her way with  words (or play on words) and symbolic imagery, which can make this read a  sweat. Nevertheless, it still is beautiful poetry and should not be  overlooked. Also included is Hilda's archive of Pound's priceless poems.
