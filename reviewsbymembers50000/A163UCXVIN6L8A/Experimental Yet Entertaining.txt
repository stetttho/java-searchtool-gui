 Not the best Kerouac novel but one of the more entertaining, Vision Of Cody follows Kerouac's hero Neal Cassidy through his endless exploits and  meaningless discourse. Sometimes dubbed as Kerouac's Finnigan Wake,  according to particular critics, the book utilizes a style of an  architectural text format on the printed page, as well as inventive  diatribes and phonetical play on words. However, the book is definitely a  challenge (writing close to 500 pages) and requires a lot of patience.  Nevertheless, it still is a fun read once the reader overcomes the Joycean  first two chapters. The book's highlight is the tape-recorded  transcriptions concentrating on Jack and Cody's contentions of Jazz and  sex.
