 The Yage Letters was a correspondence between William Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg. Burroughs describes his ongoing search for the ancient drug, starting in Mexico, and finishing in South America. Likewise, Ginsberg  finishes where Burroughs left off and the rest is history. I enjoyed  reading this book, and was pleased to learn about new cultures and info on  hallucinogens. The book can become overwelming in some section, especially  the last bit about the cut-up process; nevertheless, it's still an  interesting idea, which Burroughs had utilized in every artistic medium.  Also included are a few sketches by Ginsberg himself
