 This is where it all started. Keroauc's first novel is a tough read. Not  "tough" as in the crazed style of Dr. Sax, but "tough"  as in "meticulous." TTATC has more of a formalized outline than  the Kerouac books that followed --ie, On The Road, Dharma Bums, etc. I've  read this book was fashioned in the style of Thomas Wolfe, one of Kerouac's  hero; hence, the punctilious descriptions and rustic overtones.  Nevertheless, it's still a fine story, depicting Kerouac and his families'  migration from the milltown of Lowell to the urbanized New York City. As a  note for some readers, Kerouac is represents as 3 different characters; the  protagonist (Jack) and his 2 brothers.
