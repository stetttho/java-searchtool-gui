 Is it another world, or our world gone mad?                               Ferreri has quite an imagination, especially his                               use of juxtaposition: a rotting carcass of King                               Kong, a wax museum where James Coco                               reenacts parts of history, and an underground                               society where rats prevail. Depardieu, who's lines                               are badly dubbed, manages to get through this                               yarn uncomfortably gripping a chimp where he                               found beside the dead Kong. Mastroianni is                               always at his best, altho this time presenting a                               more cartoonish characterization. However,                               despite the exotic idiosyncrasies, this film can be                               rather dull at moments. Nevertheless, I enjoyed                               a large percentage of this movie, ad hominem                               the ambiguous finale which may help clarifies the                               film's bizarre symbolism. Watch this one on a                               rainy day.
