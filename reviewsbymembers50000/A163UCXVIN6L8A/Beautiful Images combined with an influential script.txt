 I bought "I Am Curious Yellow" at an old book store for a buck. The book (or film outline) contains beautiful yet erotic B&W stills from the movie itself. In addition, there is an extensive transcript for the US District obscenity trial that the film had incited -- remember, this was officially the first film with male frontal nudity as well as graphic sex. The court transcript features several film critics and writers speaking on behalf of the film, which includes the famous author Norman Mailer. Although sometimes a bit far-fetched (the story and it's character's motives), the film presents an interesting statement on moralism vs. politics. The story is set in 1968 Sweden during the decline of the Civil Rights Movement, notably, King's assassination. This tragic spirit was definitely felt by the people of Sweden as well as by the film's heroine. This dismal state of mind also has an affect on the main character's personal affairs. The film and the book "I am Curious" presents many straight-faced yet intriguing concepts of spiritual regeneration, wayward relations, Reichian beliefs, and feminine individualism; ideas that were important in the 1960's.  I enjoyed this book all in one night (pages under 150, and quick reading) and then rented the movie which I thought was also well conceived. However, this book is hard to find (coincidental luck on my part) and may be out-of-print. Nevertheless, if you see a copy, grab it!  Trivia: there is a sequel to the film "I am Curious (Yellow)": "I am Curious (Blue)." The colors of the title represent the colors of the Swedish flag. However, I doubt that they made a book to the film, considering that "(Yellow)" caused such an uproar.  Overall, "I am Curious (Yellow)" is a part of the pantheon of influential cinema and the book and the film should not be missed.
