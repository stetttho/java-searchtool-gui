 Jack Kerouac is claimed to have written this novel in one night on Benzedrine. Matter of fact, it definately shows: jagged usage of /"punctuation," free-floating ideas and dialogues, oddly placed  dithyrambs, etc. On the contrary, what underlies is a love story between  the writer himself and a black inamorata. In this novel Kerouac adumbrates  the topic of interracial relationships in a surprisingly uncontroversial  style, especially considering the wild writings of his contemporaries, such  as Burroughs and Henry Miller. The Novel is centered around a bohemian  society called the Subterraneans, which includes many notables of the Beat  Generation: John C. Holmes, Ginsberg, and Corso who has a leading role.  Hollywood had produced a movie based on the novel; however, considering the  standards of its time, a lot significant elements were left out of the  film. Pity!
