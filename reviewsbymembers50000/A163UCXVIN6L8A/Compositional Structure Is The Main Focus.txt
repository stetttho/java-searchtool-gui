 An outstanding album by the partially bisected Mother of Inventions, of which several member left causing a conglomeration of styles and new ideas. Nonetheless, Zappa still puts out a constructive effort, this time focusing  more on compositional structures as opposed to lunacy. A lot of the tracks  are similar to what was done on Lumpy Gravy, presenting a symphony of  snorts, glisses, pitch alteration, and othertimes resembling Stavinsky's  Rite of Spring. The tracks that stand out the most are: "Electric Aunt  Jemina," with it's bubblegum texture; "Mr. Green Genes,"  which was later reprised on Hot Rats as "Son of Mr. Green Genes;"  "Dog Breath" sporting 40 tracks of overdubbed percussion echoing  Edgard Varese; and finally "King Kong" and its 5 different  reworkings by each bandmember. If you already have Uncle Meat on vinyl, get  the CD which has several bonus tracks from the self-titled movie.
