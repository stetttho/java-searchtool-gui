 I bought this thing on vinyl during the late 80's. It was a great retrospective of Lou Reed material (plus 2 original VU live tracks) when it first came out; and still remains number 1. Aside from all the later Lou Reed compilations, WOTWS features a few tracks which were recorded during the sessions of the self-titled, debut Lp -- i.e. I love You, Wild Child. My only complaint is that the tracks are not in chronological order--somehow the album starts with "Satellite of Love" then segues to the Lou Reed Lp, and then Berlin. Nevertheless, if you're looking for an unaffected Lou Reed compilation to start with; this is it! Otherwise, if your a music connoisseur, go for the whole nine-yards and purchase the more conceptual anthologies out there. That's all.
