 Frank Zappa's post-Mothers (Flo + Eddie) material is prim yet fun. The musical direction of Chunga's Revenge is wholly eclectic---swopping from Jazz to Blues to Rock n' Roll. As remembered for their raunchy ditties, Flo  + Eddie assumes a more "genteel" attitude on songs like  "Tell me You Love Me" "Would You Go All The Way" and  "Sharleena". I good Zappa album to start with. Also check Flo and  Eddie's more daring songs on Zappa's 200 Motels.
