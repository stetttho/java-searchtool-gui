 I've always been a fan of Donovan's late 1960's psychedelic music as well as his more expressive acoustic classics like Young Girl Blues &  House of Jansch. I purchased this live album on vinyl 6 months back, gave it a listen, but was extremely disappointed. Most hit rock songs (or classics) are usually  reworked for the stage in a way in order to present something that wasn't initially developed in the studio or to have a little enjoyment altering it live for pure entertainment. For the most part the tune is kept recognizable to the point that the artist doesn't butcher it or go overboard embellishing it. In my opinion Donovan has done it both ways for this concert. For example most of hits (There is a Mountain, Mellow Yellow) have been redone in a pleasingly energetic manner. They may not be similar to the original LP tracks but they are fun and done well. Writer in the Sun is kept pretty much the same, with some melodic variations & intricate string arrangements. This song never did it for me even in its studio incarnation. Some of the acoustic ballads have not been improved nor degraded at all. Almost similar to those xeroxed folk hits Dylan played in the film Don't Look Back, lifted off the LPs with their original identity intact. There are some tracks I've never heard before (considering I've only listened to his more acid-inspired tunes) & I cannot judge them one way or another. And now it comes to Young Girl Blues, a classic which has been completely embellished that it loses its originally spare low-fi quality. I understand the work it took transcribing the score for this composition but Donovan couldn't you be a little more subtle & less heavy-handed. In short, some songs work & some don't but as a whole this album makes a very unsatisfying listen.
