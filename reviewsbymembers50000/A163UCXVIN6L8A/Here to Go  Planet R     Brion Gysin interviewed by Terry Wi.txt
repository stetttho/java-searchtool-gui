 A title that was lost to Savoy during the Savoy Books Ltd raids and eventual collapse of 1981. The book was conceived, commissioned, and co-edited by Michael Butterworth, who was left uncredited by Terry Wilson. WSB wrote the introduction. Butterworth commissioned a first interview for his small press magazine Wordworks, but other interviews followed after Butterworth conceived the idea of publishing a book based on Gysin's life and ideas similar to the Third Mind, a book Gysin co-wrote with Burroughs compiling their cut-ups and collaborations. Genesis P Orridge who published it in RE/Search finally found the book. The book covers such topics as the cut-up discovery, mirror-staring (a step leading to personality switching), drugs, sex, days in Northern Africa, Hassan I Sabbah, transcendentalism, viruses, and space travel. Claimed to be far superior to Bockris's book, Here to Go presents both artists with more insight and less heavy-handed pedantry. Wilson writes with many positive qualities that stand out, leaving the readers curious for more. A good introduction into the minds of two fascinating artists.
