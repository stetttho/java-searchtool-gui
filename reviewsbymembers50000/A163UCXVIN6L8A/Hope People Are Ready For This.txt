 O boy, what a novel to review -- or is this a novel? Actually it's not. It's a collection of random notes on Zen Buddhism, and some sections made its way to other books (i.e. Dharma Bums). This was claimed to be a Kerouac  novel the editors refused to publish; and I can see why --"It's Ahead  of its time." I recommend approaching this book (?) not with the  objective of reading it front to back, but instead back to front or front  to middle -- you get the picture. However, those approaching it as a novel  will not understand it; it's typically a coffee table book.
