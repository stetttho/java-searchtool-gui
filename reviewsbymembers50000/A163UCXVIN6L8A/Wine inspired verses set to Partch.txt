 Ever read Li Po, one of the greatest Taoist poet ever. Li Po spent much of his life as a hermit wandering around the mountains and writing poetry: sounds like a pre-Jahpy Ryder. Anyway, Harry Partch has put his writings to music, utilizing original instruments such as the cloudchamber bowl and the prepared viola and guitar. I first heard these recordings on a scratchy Partch/John Cage LP sampler and constantly listened to the Partch side (I'm not a big Cage fan). Now that these recordings are finally available in digital format, they sound even better. Go out and buy the Cd, then read Li Po.
