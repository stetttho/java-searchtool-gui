 A magnificent collection of plays by Cocteau, this set includes Orpheus, Oedipus Rex, and a preposterous execution of Knights Of The Round Table. Most outstanding is the surreal Eiffel Tower, in which inanimate objects possess mortal properties, and subsequently performing a play within a  play. More comprehensive than what he put to film, nevertheless Cocteau  writes in a minimalist mark that makes this book a fast yet enjoyable read.  Also check out the novels Les Enfant Terrible and Opium.
