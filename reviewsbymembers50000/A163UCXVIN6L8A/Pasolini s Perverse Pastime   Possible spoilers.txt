 Sometimes hard to watch, but nonetheless, clever little film by Pasolini, Italy's most controversial director. Notable for the remarkably shocking Salo (Pasolini's last film, he was murdered after its completion), Porcile is a step below the former in its use of depraved characters and unthinkable subject matters. However, Pasolini has his way with perversions (that is in his films) and Pigsty utilizes a sufficient amount of ribald qualities for which Pasolini's films are known for.... Porcile presents the filmmaker's own beliefs on Fascism, the bourgeoisie, and demoralization. These ideas (plus abstract metaphors) were succeedingly used in the aforementioned Salo;120 Days Of Sodom. Porcile (or Pigsty) stars the great (and omnipresent) Ugo Tognazzi, as well as Marco Ferreri, who would later direct a slew of black comedy-drama pictures in the same vein as the film in question. These two actors definitely energize the film, portraying two awkward Fascists who seemingly tickle the film's prevailingly dark subject matter.  All in all, Porcile is an acquired taste (hence, a cult film) but don't let the absurdities baffle you.
