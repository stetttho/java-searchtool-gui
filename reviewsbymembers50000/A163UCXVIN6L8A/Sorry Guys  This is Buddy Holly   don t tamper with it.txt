 After listening to this CD, I feel sorry that some crazed musical producer had even an inspiration for making this greatest hits package. Well, here it is. What they (he or she) did was create a (a la Phil Spector) wall of sound of male tenor voices, all arranged intricately and beautifully with the original Holly recordings. One listen, via realplayer samples, can clue the buyer in to this travesty. Is it arranged beautifully? Yes, the vocals alone are sung well, but why on top of a classic Buddy Holly recording. What surprises me is that even the more rockin' ones (Peggy Sue, Heartbeat) were overdubbed.   When Buddy Holly went solo he had formulated his ideas for a classical string quartet to play along side his rock ballads. The results were lightweight but still interesting as well as revolutionary. However, this package is going a bit to the extreme. If Buddy really wanted group choruses he would ask for them, no doubt. What's next, group vocals around Ritchie Valens. One star rating just for keeping Buddy vocals, at least. Enough Said.
