 One of my favorite Kerouac novels and one that is the quickest to read. Kerouac assumes a Romanticist pose when writing this book, centered around his formidable relationship with junkie-prostitute in Mexico City.  Allegorical tableaux of chickens and cat is insightful as well as  entertaining. Nice sketchings, the book is filled with  Love-Fear-and-Sympathy all in one. I recommend this book for those who  loved the boplike flow of On the Road and dug the imagery of Dr. Sax.
