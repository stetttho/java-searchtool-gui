 Another great novel by the master of Beat. In this book Kerouac takes us thru the town of Lowell, centering around Christ-like pneuma Sax as his tutelary spirit. Many biblical symbols often appear, somehow transforming  the novel to holy scriptures. When reading Dr. Sax I discover that writing  can be comical and at the same time perceptive. A must read.
