 This is an excellent album by the Kronos Quartet. The Cd consists of spoken-word compositions: Harry Partch's "Barstow," IF Stone's readings on government, J Edger Hoover's statement on Sing Sing, and Allen Ginsberg's powerful "Howl" poem. The quartet did a great job with sampling and it's combination of their strings, and with consistency; yes, a perfectly tight sound. I especially loved the reworking of Partch's intonation poem depicting a hobo's cross-country trip. In addition, the Ginsberg poem fits well with Kronos's violent chamber music. Contrarily, I thought the other pieces were executed with the same energy, but not as interesting as the Partch and Ginsberg compositions. Nevertheless, the album is one of Kronos's masterpiece and is a good starting point for KQ novices.
