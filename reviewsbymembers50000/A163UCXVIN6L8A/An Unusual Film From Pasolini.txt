 I picked up this Pasolini film a few                               days back, and I must say it was                               something a bit incongruous for                               Pasolini to make. The film takes place                               in a barren farmland, where a boy and                               his father meet a talking crow.                               Thereupon, the film shifts to a local                               monastery where we see the boy and                               father as monks. Inch by inch, they                               have the ability to talk to birds (i.e.                               chirping and whistling) as well as                               communicating with them. However,                               these birds (sparrows) are suddenly                               being killed off by the Hawks, and the                               rest is history. Although appearing dull                               at first, the movie soon gathers                               interest after the interaction with the                               crow, but abruptly finishes on a                               demented yet humorous note. Not as                               graphic as his later film would be, even                               so there's a sick sense of style                               idiosyncratic to Pasolini; although "The                               Hawks and the sparrows" still seems a                               bit weird, as if part of the school of                               Surrealism. I've heard Pasolini made                               this film as an allegory for his personal                               eroticism, or an across-the-board motif                               for homosexuality. If that were the                               case, it's a very imperceptible one that                               is obscured by the film's visual                               aesthetics altogether. Nevertheless,                               it's worth a look, and most hardcore                               Pasolini fans would understand it for                               its existence and beauty.
