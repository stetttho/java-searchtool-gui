 For those who know her society of partners: Erza Pound, Aldington, DH Lawerence; this book begins with her relationship of the first. Amongst her eccentric family, and bisexual classmate, HD presents a poetic sketch of  her coming of age which is contrasted between her erratic hang-ups.  Sometime sounding like Stein, other times Kerouac, Hilda plays with earthy  metaphors which derives from her early years in the Imagist movement.  Nevertheless, there was more to HD than being the Imagist's main figure;  what went beyond is in this book.
