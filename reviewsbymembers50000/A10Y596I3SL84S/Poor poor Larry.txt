 I've seen Larry Holmes interviewed in the past and at first I thought he was just a man with a massive inferiority complex but now I understand his problem.  When a film such as this (which gives a fairly detailed history of the heavyweight crown) completely and uterly ignores his domination of the division for a five to eight year span, I think his complex is justified.  Max Baer and Primo Carnera get five times as much attention in this movie as does holmes.   I was also expecting some kind of explanation of when and how the multiple governing bodies took precedence in the awarding of the title.  After all it's something that could be discussed in narration alone without additional footage.  Instead... we magically skip from Ali, who apparently has one title, to the days of Tyson and multiple titles.  This is an important omition. I understand that there is not film coverage of the absolute beginning of the heavyweight crown but I also find fault with the omission of this info...
