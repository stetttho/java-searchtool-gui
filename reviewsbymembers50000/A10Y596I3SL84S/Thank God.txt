 Thank God Terrence Malick only makes one film every fifteen years.  This laughable movie and all of its unsubstantiated praise makes me sick.  The phrase "character chewing" is the one I've used most often to  describe the direction of this movie.  Who were the characters again?  What  did they want?  Why are we supposed to care when the guys wife leaves him?   The reason I typically don't review films I think are bad is because I lose  sight of reason when I think about them.  I cannot begin to explain how  slow moving and unimportant this film is.
