 This is one of those rare occaisions where I can read both the extremely good and extremely bad reviews for a film and understand where both parties are coming from. Very bad things is, on one hand, a poor movie because it  breaks one of the commandments of plotting a film: Thou plot shall not  derive entirely from characters illogic and duplicity.  In other words,  Siskel and Ebert used the term "idiot plot" to describe a  scenario where the story would end in two minutes if the characters just  told the truth, which 99% of the audience would normally do.  Suspencion of  belief is something to be excepted in an exteralized conflict (even in  something as stupid as Independence Day) but in a situation where  everything hinges on an internal decision, that decision must be a  reasonable thing to do.  As I sat there watching Christian Slater reason  that they should hide the corpse in a desert, I knew that the reasoning  offered was not that of a believable character but a contriving  screenwriter who decided to make a character forty times stupider than  himself as a launch pad for the plot.  Everything that happens afterwards  is corrupted by the idiocy of the character reasoning in this scene. On  the other hands, Very Bad Things, once the characters are out of the hotel  room is a hilarious send up of something though it is often very heavy  handed - a character throws himself in front of a moving car to protect his  minivan (why do minivans take so much abuse in today's anti-suburban  propaganda?).
