 I confess that the very idea of this movie (what I gathered from the trailers and previews) made me laugh.  I instantly thought "What is wrong with Kevin Costner."  But when there was nothing else to watch,  I gave the film a genuine chance.  I wish I hadn't.  This was just about  the corniest movie I've ever seen and suffers largely from a ball of evil  antagonist who seems to have no aim but to make the lives of others  miserable (Note to writers of this film: it's best that the antagonist has  just as conceivable an objective as the protagonist - that makes for an  interesting story).  This movie destroys people I'd liked (namely Tom Petty  and Larenz Tate) and Costner even dared to rob his own son of a career  before it gets going by putting him in this piece of filth.  I'm sorry but  I have to go with the majority here.  I could live like Ghandi for another  thousand years and still not repair the damage that viewing The Postman has  done to my soul.  If I ever won the lottery I would dedicate myself to  collecting each copy of this horrid dribble so that I may banish it from  ever crossing human eyes.  IT'S JUST THAT BAD!
