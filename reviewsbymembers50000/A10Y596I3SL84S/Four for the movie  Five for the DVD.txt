 The angry one star reviews for Good Will Hunting demean the legitimacy of the angry one star reviews for films such as Titanic, which are truly terrible.  Good Will Hunting is not a lavish hollywood blockbuster that  cost 70 million to make and trippled that at the box office.  It did well  and garnered critical praise but it's still a (relatively) art house film  handled well by Van Sant who has constructed good, small, location and  lifestyle specific American movies.   This movie is the same.  I actually  agree with some of the legitimate criticism that this movie is predictable  and over wound up at the end.  The other criticism about how Will shouldn't  be a genius and that the film is generally "trite" seems like  silly prejudice. Take my perspective... I'm a young writer of screenplays  and saw the silly looking trailers for this movie written by two young  guys.  I was sort of furious on the inside that these two were being lauded  as great and I've never seen a Robin Williams movie that wasn't over  sentimental trash.   Then I go to the Angelica in New York, fuming and  ready to hate this movie.  But I couldn't... it was too well done, well  acted by all three of my nemesis and genuinely funny and emotional.  Those  below who say that Matt Damon's performance is bad are one of two things -  without any clue about acting or jealous (and stupid because honestly I'm  jealous yet I think he was great). In addition, the features here are  definately good for a couple of days watching and paint a vivid picture of  how this film came to be.
