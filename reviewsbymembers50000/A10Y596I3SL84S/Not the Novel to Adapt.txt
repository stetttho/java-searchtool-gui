 This is probably the strictest adaptation of a novel I have ever seen on screen.  Yet, as much as I loved the book, this film comes close to failure for a very simple reason.  The Toni Morrison novel tells a story that works  very well within the art of literature.  The arch of climax of the book is  not a narrative one but a lyrical and literary one.  Demme and Winfrey  chose to tell the story in the exact same order which Morrison chose but in  a film this sequence is very unfulfilling and seems to just drift and stop.   While the performances were fine (except for Newton's bizarre choices for  Beloved) and the film is superbly shot and scored, this problem could have  only been fixed by not adapting this novel or twisting it into a different  order.  I have a suspicion that Oprah (as producer and approver of the  script) is to blame, being too loyal to the novel and not considering what  is best for drama.
