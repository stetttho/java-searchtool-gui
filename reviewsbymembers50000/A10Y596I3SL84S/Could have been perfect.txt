 Breakfast at Tiffany's is the perfect example of what a romantic tale can result in when it concentrat on developing and shaping the main characters before having them persue and desire eachother. The reason I can't give  this film five stars is becase the embarrasing appearance of Mickey Rooney  as a Japanese landlord.  I can not simply toss this asside as a result as  it being dated.  The period this film was made in was one where many great  japanese films were being made.  Point being, Rooney could have easily been  replaced with a real Japanese man.  Surely Rooney does not possess some  comedic skill that no other actor could muster.  It is made far worst by  the fact that he is one of the first images in the film.   Lucky for the  viewer, this character appears infrequently and the charm of the story and  Hepburn shine through.
