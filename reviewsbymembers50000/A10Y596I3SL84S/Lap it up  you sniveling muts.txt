 Allow one of the brain-dead (see "galleries" review - term review used very loosely here) to chime in on this film for a moment.  Many of the scenes of Mulholland Drive create good atmosphere and have moments of bizarre comedy.  I found it quite engrossing up to about the last half hour of the movie when it appears at first to just fall apart.  I've since formed my own hypothesis which I fear uttering because I don't won't to seem stupid (he's saying it's just a movie and thus an illusion, right?). What really bothers me are the hoards of self righteous Lynch toadies who defensively condemn any person that may not find this to his or her likings.  I see a great deal of movies and have been known to prefer arthouse and/or foreign film that don't get a large audience... and I can see very well how this movie can win the disdain of many a viewer.  These viewers should have no shame and hold their heads high, for they are doing a greater service for the mission of this type of work than the little lapdogs who decide that because the story ultimately doesn't make much sense that it must be a work of astounding genius and thus beyond the average American mindset. Form your own opinion.  Me - I liked most of Mulholland Drive but have to wonder what the hell it was all for... maybe I could rate it higher if it was enjoyable enough for me to want to sit through it a third or fourth time to figure it all out.
