 It's the rarest occurance for me when I walk out of a movie theatre and can't wait for the film I've just seen to come out on video but that's how I feel about Being John Malkovich. I feel like my entire life is just  passing time until my preordered BJM DVD from Amazon gets here.   Inventive  and hilarious can't begin to describe this film.  Sure, there are questions  that the whole scenario brings up and does not answer but, hey... in a  world where Titanics and Phantom Menaces are made and praised, this is a  more than welcome change.
