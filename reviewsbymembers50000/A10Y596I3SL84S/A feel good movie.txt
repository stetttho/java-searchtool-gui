 I cannot explain for the life of me why this simple tale about simple characters lives in my mind as one of the best films of all time.  Maybe it's just the song, but something about Midnight Cowboy transforms a  would-be dark and depressing story into a celebration of life.  I normally  try to down play reasons for liking a film that have to do with  "message" but, in the case of Midnight Cowboy, the film is great  because it shows how even the deepest loneliness can be conquered.  Despite  the fact that Voigt, Schlesinger and (to a lesser extent) Hoffman have  become laughable after-thoughts to me, here they came together for one of  the great extended moments in film history.
