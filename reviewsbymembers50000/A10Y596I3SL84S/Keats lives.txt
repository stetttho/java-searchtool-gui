 The miniscule and sickly John Keats may not have been long for this world but he is an immortal of English language poetry.  The accesibility of Keats's great poems is the reason he continues to be read while those who  dismissed him in his own day have been swept into the ashcan of literary  history.  What's great about this complete edition is right there in the  title: It's complete, allowing the Keats enthusiast to travel through all  of Keats's romantic attempts, ranging from great to mediocre to poetic  fumbles... The Keats novice can start with the major poems and odes and  marvel, as I once did, how one so young created such a vast quantity of  work.  This edition also features valuable notes and the trajically short  biography of Keats.
